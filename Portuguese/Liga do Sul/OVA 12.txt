Good Morning, Shinichi!
I want to ask you something.
Excuse me, but could you come to the baseball field in Beika Park?
Baseball field?
Professor, you decided to play baseball?
[ In the note: "Don't forget to eat your breakfast. Ran." ]
I'll explain later...
I'll be waiting!
Play!
The Miracle of Excalibur
I've been waiting for you, Shinichi.
After all, what do you want to ask me?
And why here?
Don't try too hard, Minae!
Just try to hit the ball!
You should ask your childhood friend, Akira-kun, to let you bat!
Hey, Minae!
Even though we're childhood friends, I won't take it easy!
Akira...
That's my line!
It's a girl...
Here goes!
Out!
Not that one...  The ball went to the ground...
I don't have the strength to hit it...
Don't worry about it!
If I were stronger...
Two outs! Two outs!
I'll still send Akira's pitch into space...
That hurt...
A b-bastard?
Why is it there?
This is the legendary bat.
Legendary bat?
A long time ago, a player from the Giants team, Sada...
No...
Matsui Hideki buried it on this field, that's the legend.
Matsui Hideki from the Giants?
Let's see!
That's great! Is this serious?
Is that Matsui's bat?
Also...
"Whoever removes this bat...
will receive the true strength of a baseball player."  That's what they say.
The true strength of a baseball player?
What was that?
What is it, Minae-san?
If I take this bat...
I'll get incredible powers, won't I?
Don't be silly!
What is it, Akira?
You're still playing, aren't you?!
It's time to switch sides.
Let's defend.
So, what happened...
with that bat?
Coach and I buried that stick.
He's an old friend...
and he asked me to help.
He wants to give courage and confidence to player number 9, Minae-chan, somehow.
I am sure that when I touched the stick, I felt a kind of electric shock.
That stick is not normal...
If I can get it off the ground,
maybe I really will get stronger!
Right!
What are you doing?
What luck!
You're still too slow, Minae!
Akira! You hit back here on purpose, didn't you?!
That's right!
Damn it.
I can't take it anymore.
This mistake cost us a point!
Ken-chan...
This way, we'll never win.
Hey, don't try to put all the blame on Minae alone.
You were also defeated by Akira!
What?
To say anything, hit his shot first.
We only have one point thanks to me!
What did you say?
You...
There's no way...
We had no chance of winning from the beginning...
That's because we have one person standing in our way.
Our team has no balance...
So you can play better than that?
At least better than you!
What do I do?
It's my fault...
Come on, Minae, don't think like that.
Coach...
What's your number?
Nine!
Then you should be more determined!
After all, the number 9 always determines the rhythm of the team!
He's better at puns than you are, Professor.
Really...
I have to be determined...
That's right!
I have to be determined!
If the story of this stick is true, I can be stronger.
I will pick it up off the ground somehow, and I will surprise everyone!
That story is just someone's invention.
Ken-chan?
Besides...
A girl like you will never get him off the ground.
We won't know if I don't try!
Idiot...
- I get it...  - I get it...
I understand what the teacher and the trainer have in mind.
Oh, that...
They want to give her confidence by making her take the baton off the floor.
Yes.
Strike!
Batter down.
After she takes the bat down, I'm sure she'll have a lot more confidence.
Incidentally, this idea was inspired by the legend of King Arthur.
King Arthur who pulled the sword from a stone to become king?
And the rest I came up with after remembering that Mouri-kun has a staff used by Matsui Hideki.
Yes...
He said he got the staff from a Nichiuri TV producer.
So? Why do you need me?
About that, Shinichi...
I want you to use it when the time comes...
Professor...
This is...
I put chemicals in the earth around the stick to make it stiff.
And in order for the earth to soften, it is necessary to spread another chemical.
This way...
It would be suspicious if I did that, wouldn't it?
Then do it for me, Shinichi.
Really, you called me just for this?
Besides, I'd like you to keep an eye on the stick, because someone might try to take it away.
Do it yourself...
The Professor's horoscope reads as follows:
"Your plans will work out if you ask a younger friend for help."
Is that why you called me?
You could ask Haibara for that!
I don't like these things...
That's what I thought...
My prediction...
"Today you should play a silly joke on someone".
"Your lucky item is a different side of yourself".
Hey, you are a scientist, don't believe that stuff!
Besides, it's a horoscope from a girl's magazine.
Anyway, I don't think anyone would believe such a forced legend about a buried stick...
Come on, you can't be sure of that.
Why can't you be sure of that?
In fact, why are you like this?
Uncle!
When did he get here?
This stick...
What is it, Uncle?
This stick looks a bit like mine.
Well...
That's Matsui's legendary staff.
Hey, don't involve Uncle in this!
Really?! So I was right!
Uncle, wait.
Be quiet! This is my stick!
What do you mean?
Well, Mouri-kun, calm down.
Can you hear me first?
Actually, yesterday, I got together with some old friends from university for a drink and brought something to show them...
In short, I took Matsui's staff.
However, when I woke up this morning
I saw that he was carrying another stick.
Another stick?
What do you mean?
I also wanted to know how this happened, so I retraced the steps I followed last night.
Then I remembered that I passed briefly through this field last night.
Ninth inning, bases loaded, two outs.
And the hitter now is number 4, Mouri Kogorou.
The difference on the scoreboard is 3 points.
The pitcher gets ready...
and throws!
He's hit!
The ball flies straight to the electronic scoreboard!
It's a home run that determines the winning team!
So, I ran around the bases drunk...
I don't really remember what happened next, but...
I picked up the bat that was near the home plate,
put it in the bag and went home.
I see...
It is likely that he picked up the wrong bat at this moment...
But then, where is Uncle's bat?
And about that stick...
Yesterday, I met with the coach in this field...
I was just walking along and I noticed that the coach was thinking.
Then we talked about a way to help Minae-chan.
We went to a nearby coffee shop to discuss this matter, but we didn't have any good ideas so we went back to our homes.
When I got home, I had the idea to use the legend of King Arthur.
I called the coach and we agreed that he would find a stick,
and I would handle the hole and the dirt.  We agreed to meet here at ten o'clock at night.
The trainer arrived empty-handed.
And when he saw me with a stick,
he said that he had forgotten that stick on the bench in the field during the afternoon.
So we buried it.
So it seems that that buried stick really belongs to Uncle.
But I am intrigued by the fact that the coach's bat left the dugout and ended up on the home plate.
So that bat...
It must be Uncle's bat, right?
That's right! I knew it!
Hey!
Excuse me...
This stick is my precious stick.
So can you take it out and give it back to me?
No!
But listen, it really is mine...
This is Matsui's legendary staff!
Sorry about that, Uncle.
That's true, but...
Hideki...
I have no choice...
Now that I've gotten involved...
What happened to him?
I think he went to take a nap.
I know...
Hey, I'll watch this baton for you...
Really?
Thank you!
I'm glad I asked you to!
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Stop it!
What was that?
Basement.
Hey!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about that.
My dog loves tennis balls.
And when he smells one, he goes for it.
I understand...
But...
Just give up once and for all...
No!
There are no tennis balls around here.
That's what it looks like...
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Hey, come on.
First the uncle and now a dog?
What's going on, anyway?
Look, there's something buried!
It's a stick!
Maybe that's it!
All right, let's get it out of here! Let's get it out of here!
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
Conan-kun, listen!
We found a treasure map and followed it here...
And it looks like this stick is the treasure.
No, wrong. This is...
Now, if we're going to talk about treasures, this stick really is one.
You're saying unnecessary things again!
So it's true, right?
That's right! One more time!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
So it was the teacher who buried the stick?
If that's true, was it him who drew this map?
So he wouldn't forget where the stick was...
No, I don't remember doing this.
A treasure map...
Who could have done this?
I wonder who will win?
É!
Hey, Minae!
What are you doing there?
Be quiet!
I'm going to take this stick out and bounce your pitch into the stratosphere!
You'd think this would help you to hit it.
We won't know until we try.
But it's not like that's going to give Minae any more power.
That's what he said, Minae!
Wait and see!
Isn't that it?
That here?
Is that serious?
Should I take it back?
Yes, there is no option.
What are you guys doing?
Mouri-san!
Has something happened?
Can you tell me what happened?
Yes.
Actually, last night a jewelry store in Beika was robbed.
The owner was hit on the head with a cylindrical object as he was closing up the store.
And while he was unconscious, all the valuable jewelry was stolen.
And after investigating.
We received a report that two suspicious men were seen carrying baseball bats last night in this field.
We assume that they are the criminals, and have come to investigate, as they may have abandoned the murder weapon.
These two men must be the teacher and the coach, don't you think?
Hey!
Conan-kun!
I get it, that's what happened.
So that's not the murder weapon, right?
Hey, couldn't this jewelry theft be a scam to get the money from the insurance company?
Conan-kun, you seem to know a lot...
Uncle was talking about it...
I know, Mouri-san...
But in my opinion, this is not the case.
The store owner was hit from behind.
And hitting himself from behind alone would be very difficult.
However, the owner has a very clumsy younger brother.
His alibi has many inconsistencies.
Right! It's now or never!
Surely there is something mysterious about that stick?
And it seems that it is connected with all those events...
The jewelry store robbery...
The treasure map...
The smell of tennis balls...
And the exchange of sticks.
Hey, Minae is still trying to get it out!
Really?
The story about that stick is probably just bullshit...
Stick?
By the way, the stick that's with Uncle...
That's...
That's what I thought.
Hey, Detective Chiba.
I think you should check this baton.
It's almost time, Shinichi.
Yes, we have to use the chemical before the ninth inning.
She's not interested, but Haibara will have to help me with that.
Haibara-san!
Look out!
Are you okay, Haibara?
Yes...
The chemical!
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Oh, I'm fine...
But that's not...
Why were you fooling around?
You're acting strange today.
It doesn't suit you.
I'm sorry, professor.
Is there another one?
No, there was just this one.
Now, maybe we can't take the bat away.
Second base!
It's mine!
Saved!
You idiot!
You should be able to catch balls like that!
What did you say?
Damn it...
Ken-chan.
Don't worry.
Minae.
Don't worry about it.
She came from the right outer defense just to say that?
Hey!
Get on with it!
Akira!
I won't let you fight this one!
Is that right?
Right!
She's got it!
Out!
Are you okay, Minae-san?
I'm fine!
Let's go! It's the last entry! The last inning!
I'm going to bat this time!
It would be nice if she would hit...
Yes.
Who's the next batter?
Number 5, Kiyoshi-kun.
If we get two bases, Minae can hit.
If you continue to treat her so coldly, nothing will change.
Be honest with yourself.
What are you...
That one doesn't... He won't move...
But I have to!
Ken-chan...
I'll help you.
Let's get it out of here at once...
Don't go losing to Akira.
Kenta...
Right! Let's help them!
And we have to get Minae on the field anyway!
Guys...
Will they be able to retreat?
Well, they won't.
It doesn't matter anymore, the stick has served its purpose.
They have all become a real team.
Not for themselves, but for one team member, for Minae.
One, two...
Also, it will give them personal confidence and strength as a team.
Yes, that is...
Play!
Knock them out, partner!
Leave it to me!
If I get a base...
Minae will enter the game.
And once again...
The true power of a baseball player!
And that power...
is now theirs!
It is in their hands!
Note: Dead ball is when the pitcher accidentally hits the batter, the batter gets a base.
Dead ball!
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Okay, at least I got it!
It's 3-1, with two outs.
It's a chance for a home run to turn the game around!
This is exciting!
Hello?
Is that you, Chiba-kun?
What's up?
You found traces of big brother's blood and little brother's fingerprints?
Go, Minae!
With that stick, you'll hit!
Go on!
Minae, huh?
What luck!
Akira, now it's time for the truth!
Shut up!
Lefty!
Note: Foul is when the hit was made correctly, but the ball flies outside the line of the field. This attempt is not counted.
Foul!
Don't scare me like that...
Wow, almost...
That should have been a home run!
Minae, what happened?
It broke...
Why? Why did it break?
Why did it break?
Don't give up!
Even without that stick, you can still hit, Minae-san!
Minae, you are our hope!
We all believe in you!
Use your power and get three points from Akira!
But the legendary staff is in this state...
Give it to me.
Time out!
What's with her?
What's wrong?
Does she think she'll be able to beat my throw like this?
Throw!
King of the Giants, Matsui-san...
and the baseball gods!
Please share your strength with me!
Hit if you can!
She did it!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Why did I lose to her?
She did it!
A bye-bye home run that turned the game around!
Incredible!
Hey!
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you? A tennis ball?
Detective Takagi.
Yes.
Can you cut that ball?
Cut the ball?
Why is there jewelry here?
There is an incident behind the legend of that stick.
It probably happened this way:
First, the older brother, who owned a jewelry store, decided to give the insurance company a scam.
He bought a cheap tennis ball, put valuable jewelry inside, and buried it here on the court.
Then the coach of the baseball team met with Professor Agasa here.
Being that he had forgotten a bat on the bench when he went to a coffee shop.
At the same time, the older brother revealed his plan to the younger one.
And as a precaution, he gave her a map indicating where the jewels were hidden.
He also ordered him to find something that could be used as a murder weapon.
Since the younger brother wanted to know exactly where the jewels were...
He came here with the map drawn by his brother.
There, on the bench, he found the coach's baton...
and decided that it would be perfect to be used as a murder weapon.
So he assaulted his older brother, following his own instructions.
Got it!
That's why there is big brother's blood and little brother's fingerprints on the stick!
Probably the older brother told the younger one to get rid of the stick while he was talking to the police.
And the younger brother, clumsily, simply left the bat where he had found it, in the field, near the home plate.
And he must have lost the map on his way home.
And we found it!
After that, I arrived at the field drunk...
And I took the bat that the younger brother had left there, thinking it was Matsui's bat...
Soon after, the teacher arrived and found a bat, Matsui's bat, near the home plate.
Got it. So that's what happened.
The professor looked for a place with soft earth on the ground to dig a hole,
and this place was where the owner of the jewelry store had buried the ball.
Got it! As expected from Mouri-san!
I will interrogate the owner of the jewelry store!
Excuse me!
Who would have thought that all this would happen because of a stick?
Yes, I didn't believe it until I saw the stick Uncle was carrying.
But is everything going to be all right?
I'm talking about the stick...
Mouri-kun will be in a very bad mood...
He helped unite that team.
So I guess it's okay!
nee kimi wa boku ni itta ne "me o hanasanaide ite"
Hey, you told me not to take my eyes off you, didn't you?

This moment in time is both a beginning and an end

The blue sky, the sunset, the seasons repeating themselves again....

When I look at the sky by chance, no two clouds are ever the same

Overwrite
Overwrite...
A few days later...
Well, guys, I'm not going to take it lightly!
When did you become the trainer?
Go ahead!
Have a good game!
What's this?
Kouki!
What's that?
What is it?
Here, look.
Hey, that's...
That can't be...
Well, this is...
the legendary glove.
They say that the person who puts on this glove can throw at 200 kilometers an hour!
Are you serious?
Shut up!
We won't know until we try, will we?!
Are you serious?
Is this the beginning of a new legend?
No...
This is the beginning of a new love.
What do you mean by that? Hey, Haibara!
Hey, what are you going to do about my staff?
