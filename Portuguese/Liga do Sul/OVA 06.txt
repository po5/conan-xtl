Kaitou Kid?!
Detective Conan:
Pursue the missing diamond!  Conan & Heiji vs. the Kid!
[ Beika Commercial Area ]
What would you like for dinner, Conan-kun?
It can be anything...
To be honest, I really wanted to make sukiyaki, but my dad hasn't had much work.
So we need to economize.
Oh, Ran-chan! We're having a beef sale today.
So today I'll make croquettes!
I'll take 150...  100 grams, please.
And eggs too.
Thank you for your preference.
Ran-chan, who is this boy?
It's Conan-kun, we're taking care of him.
He's not Mouri-san's illegitimate son, right?
Stop playing around, Auntie.
Obviously not...
Here, I put 20 grams on the house.
Thank you.
Potatoes, onions, cabbage, tomatoes...
Ran-chan, this is on the house.
Thank you very much!
But who would have thought that Ran-chan would have a younger brother, right?
No, that's not it.
You can come! Fish is cheap today!
How about some?
Well, I think we can have it for breakfast.
You look as energetic as ever, Ran-chan.
By the way, Ran...
She always shops like this.
Take these seafood too.
That's great! Now I can make some miso soup!
Anyway, she's very popular.
That was "Cooking with Okino Youko"...
Our guest today was the great detective Mouri Kogorou-san.
See you next week!
Bye-bye, Youko-chan!
Frankly, how many times does he have to watch this video before he's satisfied?
That VHS tape must be worn out by now.
Be quiet!
Who cares? We don't have any customers anyway...
It's here!
It's what?
Thank you very much!
What is it, Dad? Who was that?
Forget about it...
It was just a package that came for me...
But who sent it?
That doesn't matter!
Isn't this something you asked them to deliver?
Is that true, Dad?
Hey, dad! It's not "weird" at all, right?
Idiot, what are you talking about?  It's a work thing.
So why don't you go back to the agency?
Shut up!
Gee...
What do you think, Conan-kun?
It's kind of suspicious, isn't it?
Yes! He must be hiding something...
Yes!
Have you prepared the money yet?
No "huh?"...  You've already prepared...
Who are you?
A blackmailer.
I'll record it.
Good morning!
Damn it!
Hello? Hello? What's up Conan-kun?
What's up Conan-kun?
(Number not available)
That's what I thought.
Conan-kun?
A blackmail phone call?
Also, his phone number didn't show up on the caller ID.
And he didn't mention any names, right?
Since the call came here, the victim's phone number must look like this.
Dad, let's call the police.
Forget about it, everything you guys said is bullshit.
We are not sure if this is, in fact, a crime.
But...
It could be someone collecting a debt or something.
Well, I promised to go play mahjong with some people.
Hey, listen to what Conan-kun has to say!
We're really not sure if this is a crime...
But if this is a kidnapping case, we don't have time to waste.
Bye!
Dad!
But first...
Have you prepared the money yet?
No "huh?"...  You've already prepared...
Who are you?!
That voice...  I think I've heard it before...
Besides...
Good morning!
Damn it!
I think I've heard that voice recently, but where?
Wait, the only voices I've heard recently...
Wow...
Fish is cheap!
How's that?
You are as energetic as ever, Ran-chan.
We're having a beef sale today.
He's not Mouri-san's illegitimate son, right?
Cabbage, tomatoes...
But who would have thought that Ran-chan would have a younger brother, right?
I wonder...
It's because we don't use pesticides...
I guarantee it's delicious!
No...  It's a little similar, but it's not that voice.
Thank you.
Where? Where did I hear?
Where?
Hello, sorry to bother you.
This is Moriwaki from DM Company. Is your boss here?
Heiji-niichan!
Kudou...  Opa, I mean Conan-kun...
This must be a very serious matter since you called me Osaka, right?
That's right.
Actually...
Blackmail by phone?
Yes, he said that the voice of the man who called is very similar to yours, Hattori-kun.
I thought I had heard that voice before, but...
he spoke in a strange way, so I couldn't be sure.
And we called you because...
You want my help to find out who that man wanted to call.
So you want to test all the numbers similar to the telephone number of the detective agency,
to see how each person who answers reacts.
Correct, that's our Hattori-kun!
Kudou...
No, no, no! This sounds like something Conan-kun would think of, doesn't it?
I've already compiled a list of numbers, so we'd better hurry.
In that case, come on...
You can leave the rest to me and the boy.
Then I'll make dinner.  If you need help, call me.
Make dinner?
This is a very homely detective agency, huh?
Hey, this is no time to talk nonsense! Let's get started!
All right.
Yes, Inoue residence.
It's me...  It's me...
Huh? Who is it?
Sorry, I called the wrong number.
It's me.
Huh?
Sorry, wrong number.
Oh, I'm sorry
Yes, this is Yuwatsume.
I'm Yuwatsume.
It's you!
You still want some more? You thieving bastard!
I already gave you 10 million and didn't contact the police as we agreed.
You have nothing more to do with me!
I will call you later.
Bingo, huh?
According to this call, he has already paid the money and completed the transaction.
But he called him a dirty thief.
What does he mean by "thief"?
This is it, isn't it?
What?
Inspector Nakamori...
If I'm not mistaken, you're the boy who's always with Mouri-san...
You went to see Yuwatsume-san?
Who is Yuwatsume?
We're investigating a case of fraud.
A jewel thief?
Yes, Yuwatsume is quite a different name, isn't it?
So I looked it up on the internet and found out that Yuwatsume is a jewelry appraiser.
From this we can conclude that we are dealing with a jewel thief.
But we are not sure where the blackmail comes into it.
Right! Let's look for this Yuwatsume.
But, Inspector...
Robbery is a third division jurisdiction, right? You're from the second division of the police...
Well, I'm already here...  And I can't ignore a jewel thief.
Oh, that's right!
Wait a minute!
I have an idea.
Did you see something fly by?
Yes, it must have been a big flying squirrel.
You'd think it was a...
What do the police want with me?
Do you remember hearing that voice?
Did you prepare the money?
Did you capture the criminal?
What do you mean "criminal"?
What? I'm talking about the jewel thief!
Jewels!
Yes, he fell!
Tell us the details, we need the victim's testimony.
Sure, no problem.
The day before yesterday, 100 million yen was...
Hey, can you say that again?
Not that one!
Did you prepare the money?
Again.
Did you "prepare" the money?
No, he is not a criminal!
He didn't have that weird accent!
What do you mean "strange"?  Are you making fun of the Kansai dialect?
Hey!
Who are you, anyway?
Me?
I am...
Naniwa's great high school detective, Hattori Heiji!
Note: Naniwa is the old name for Osaka.
You idiot...
Policeman! What does all this mean?
Anyway, it is true that a jewel worth 100 million yen was stolen, right?
No, the jewelry wasn't stolen.
The jewel is with me.
Here is the proof.
But a moment ago you said...
That was a joke.
A joke?
I see. So it's like this...
I've got the facts straight. This jewel was stolen, but the thief agreed to give it back if you paid 10 million, right?
What? Why would I... Why would I...
The fact is that you must have already sold the jewel to someone.
And even if you had to pay 10 million, it would be better to get it back.
Did I get it right, Yuwatsume-san?
Yuwatsume-san, please tell us the truth.
If we don't arrest the offender, it is possible that he will act again.
Maybe two, or even three times.
Yes, just like the Kid.
KID?!
That's right! Thanks to this guy I have many bad memories!
Damn! I'll get you, Kid!
Please calm down!
Speaking of which, is he after this diamond?
Wait, this jewel...
This offender isn't very greedy, is he?
Who is this boy anyway?
I have been thinking about this for some time...
Please don't pay any attention to him.
The diamond is worth 100 million, but he only asked for 10 million to return it, right?
If I were you, I would have asked for half of the total amount.
It's really strange that he only asked for 10% of the value.
This returned jewelry would not be fake, right?
This is impossible.
Wait a moment.
It is a fake...
Just as I thought.
It seems that this has also become a case of fraud.
Will you accept the facts now, Yuwatsume-san?
Yes.
So, do you know anything about the culprit?
Well, although I gave him money, we didn't find him. I only heard his voice.
You heard him on the phone, right?  Did you record the conversation?
No...
Looks like the uncle and the young lady are asleep.
Hattori...
I already know, you don't have to say anything.
You want to recreate our phone conversation with him, don't you?
Yes, but since this is not the real voice of the criminal, it wouldn't be factual evidence.
But it will help us find him.
Well done!
How about we start right away?
Did you "prepare" the money?
No, it's like, "Did you prepare the money?"
But that's what I said!
It wasn't! Even Yuwatsume-san understood.
Come on, one more time!  "Have you prepared the money?"
Have you prepared the money?
It's not like that! Why can't you talk like me?
What can I do?! I'm a native of Osaka!
Damn, at this rate, you'll never say it correctly...
It doesn't matter if I can't...
You couldn't say everything correctly in the Kansai dialect either, could you? We're even.
No way! I can speak in the Kansai dialect.
Really? By the way, you made an inference using a strange Kansai accent in the past tense.
On top of that, you used my voice...
The voice modulator tie!
That's it! With this we can take the proof!
Why didn't we think of that before?
That's what they call not realizing what's under your nose, eh?
Hattori, now you can leave...
Kudou!
Just kidding...
Please listen to the voice of a suspect in the theft of a precious stone.
Did you prepare the money?
No "huh?  You've already prepared...
Who are you?
Whoever can identify the suspect's voice, please call this number prepared by the police.
Hattori-kun, that was your voice, wasn't it?  Your accent was very good.
Well, yes... After all, I am a detective...
But I'm surprised that they didn't discover you.
Inspector Nakamori immediately realized that the recording was of Heiji-niichan's voice.
Exactly, but even knowing this, he used his connections to get it aired on the national network.
I have to say, that old man has a lot of guts.
The influence of TV is immense, I bet there are several viewers calling in...
It's Kazuha...
It's me.
Heiji! What are you doing?!
Your voice was just broadcast on TV!
You used a weird Tokyo accent, but it was your voice!
Your family is having money problems, so you stole a diamond?!
Idiot! It's obvious that I wouldn't steal a jewel!
But then...
Don't talk nonsense!
Actually, several viewers called in, didn't they?
Really...
By the way, Kudou, about that "good morning" you heard on the call...
Do you know where you heard that before?
No, although I've thought about it a lot.
Now that I think about it, that female voice may have been distorted by the man's voice.
Huh?
I wonder what that is.
"Okino Youko's special figure with alarm clock?"
What is that?
Isn't that the package that was delivered yesterday for Uncle?
Unbelievable! What is it anyway?
Let me see...
Wait a minute, Okino Youko...
This is well done, isn't it?
Good morning!
It's morning, wake up!
It's that voice!
Ran-nechan, that's the voice from the phone call!
Don't touch it!
This is a custom watch made just for Youko-chan's fan club members! It's a treasure!
Dad, how much did it cost?
It doesn't matter how much it cost...
Then how much?
2,000 yen...
You're lying!
20,000 yen...
20,000 yen? I save every yen I can here...
And you spend 20,000 on a toy!
That's why you hid it from us, right?
Only 200 were produced.  I really had to have one...
FATHER!
Only 200 were produced, huh?
We can find out the name of the criminal from the fan club.
Yes, probably the criminal set the clock on the figure at the wrong time.
So when he spoke to me...
Good morning!
Damn it!
Hello? Hello?!
The next day, thanks to the help of the fan club and a phone call from a viewer, we identified the thief.
Stop!
If anyone comes near it, I'm going to throw it into the sea!
Damn...
His voice sounds a lot like mine...
Kid!
Good morning! It's morning! Wake up!
Good morning! It's morning! Wake up!
Why the Kid...
He was probably aiming at that jewel too.
It's possible that he was aware of everything, even before we got involved.
So he decided to act now...
So that wasn't a flying squirrel...
ki ga tsuitara koi shikatta Next thing I knew, I was missing you,
Congratulations, little detective.
You've done a good job too, young detective of the west.
Quick, let's go after the Kid!
kanashii nyuusu afureru machi de in this town full of sad news.
I guess that's what they call "stolen from under your nose".
anata no koe ga kikenai hi wa On days when I don't hear your voice
Why did I come here from Osaka anyway?
Youko-chan!
watashi no subete ga tomaru I just can't do anything.
Such nonsense... I'm going home.
Me too...
kanashii hodo anata ga suki The sadder you get, the more I love you
koi shisugiru to "naze nano" When I miss you so much, I ask myself: Why?
konna ni mo kurushii That in itself is very painful

tobira ake hanatou...can open.
anata ga watashi no kokoro wo You give colors to my heart...
asaya ke ni someta...as we see the new morning dawning.
So I'll make it with you So I'll continue with you
[ The unpredictable Kaitou Kid returns 100 million jewel to its owner! ]
Ran-chan, one more! Please!
No! From now on, no cigarettes, and only one can of beer a day!
What?! Don't be so harsh!
It's really quite a homegrown detective agency, isn't it?
