This is a request from the Young Detectives!
This DVD is a special gift from Shogakukan!
While watching this DVD, keep the room bright...
And watch it away from your Computer or TV set.
Are you okay, Conan-kun?
I'm fine...
My fever's not too high,
if I rest today, I'll be fine.
So, I'll let your school know.
And also...
Ran?
If we don't hurry, we'll be late!
I'm coming!
I talked to my dad and he's making lunch, so warm up and get a good night's sleep, okay?
Got it.
Take care...
I'm coming.
Sorry for the delay.
Did the brat catch a cold?
That's right!
But he said he was feeling fine...
Have you talked to Shinichi-kun lately?
No.
Why not?
You're hopeless...
Why don't you forget this insensitive jerk and dive into the arms of another man?
"Dive"?
For example...
Araide-sensei!
He is a doctor and very mature,
surely he must be more reliable than Shinichi-kun.
Damn, that Sonoko...
Schoolgirl...
Will I never go back to normal?
No, no!
Is it because of the cold?
My mind is full of negative thoughts...
I have to recover from this cold soon...
"The Stranger Ten Years Later"
The Stranger Ten Years Later.
Hello?
Were you sleeping?
Haibara?
I heard you caught a cold.
Ã‰...
Wasn't that convenient?
I created a new formula for the antidote to that drug.
Antidote...
of Apotoxin-4869?
So, you want to try it?
Of course I do!
Where are you now?
At the professor's house?
Almost.
I'm on my way there from school.
Then I'll go there too!
Hey, lunch!
He's not here!
It's true!
I need to get something to wear...
Where's the Professor?
He had something to do and left.
Is that a school uniform?
Yes!
I want to go to school and surprise everyone!
How silly.
If you did that, what would happen if the rumor got out?
Come on, give it to me.
First, check your temperature.
Okay...
38.7 degrees...
It's pretty high...
You must be like this because I ran all the way here!
Are you sure you're okay, even with this fever?
Don't worry about it!
Let's go!
The effect of this antidote, like the previous samples, is about 24 hours.
However, this one is designed to work quickly, so you will transform as soon as you ingest it.
With this...
With this, I can become Kudou Shinichi again.
This is it!
Haibara?
Haibara?!
That's strange...
Where did she go?
It's 12:30, I can still make it for my lunch break...
Right!
Was the tree in my house that tall?
I guess I just saw it from a different angle with Conan's height...
Well, never mind!
Has this building always been there?
When did they build this condominium?
There really are many things that we can't see at a child's height.
It's Professor Gorilla!
I haven't seen him for a while, but it looks like he's gotten pretty old!
Whose is that?
How strange...
Could it be that someone was using my closet in my absence?
It's really not here...
Everyone will be surprised!
What's up?
Huh?
Why isn't anyone surprised?
And who are these people?
I don't know anyone here...
I think I got into the wrong class.
But the sign is right!
How strange...
Anyway, I have to find Ran.
She's always in the karate club room during the lunch break.
The door is locked...
Detective club?
Was there such a club?
You're finally here!
You went somewhere else to eat, like I thought, right?
We agreed to have lunch here every Tuesday and Thursday, didn't we?
And I even held back from eating my lunch ahead of time, you know?
The smell of Genta-kun's eel rice has already permeated the whole room.
Genta-kun must be the only student who still includes eel in his lunch.
Genta...
Mitsuhiko...
And Ayumi?
What is happening?
What are they doing here?
And why do they look like schoolboys?
What?
Conan-kun, you look a little strange...
Conan?
It must be because he's without his glasses.
Why aren't you wearing them?
That's right!
You look better like that!
Ayumi-chan, you're too close to him!
That's right!
Stay back!
It can't be...
What happened, Conan-kun?
You look like a bird that's been knocked over by a water pistol...
Genta-kun...
The correct saying is "the pigeon was knocked down with a bamboo stick."
Guys...
We are...
...in the second year of high school?
What are you doing?
Of course I am!
Stop fooling around, Conan-kun!
It really is!
This must be a dream!
The dream must have started with that phone call from Haibara.
It's not a dream!
Then what's going on?
Hey...
Don't get in the way.
Haibara!
Ai-chan...
Aren't you going to have lunch again?
This is bad for your health.
In my opinion, even without dieting...
You're very pretty!
Haibara!
Come with me.
Hurry up!
What's going on?
I should have become Kudou Shinichi!
Then why am I still Conan?
Besides, we're no longer in elementary school, we're already in the second year of high school!
I can't understand what you're saying...
But if you want, I can tell you what happened in the last ten years.
Our confrontation with the Organization never ended,
and as time went by, we advanced to junior high and high school.
During this time, you received several doses of antidotes created for APTX-4869,
so your body developed a total immunity to it.
For the past five years, you have never been able to return to normal.
It seems that you have been shocked by this.
I wonder if you didn't get amnesia during your lunch break.
The bell for afternoon classes is ringing, but you should go home and rest.
Yes...
I'll do that...
And today our guest is...
the great detective from Naniwa, Hattori Heiji-san!
He has become popular all over Japan, cracking a number of unusual cases!
And now he has opened his own detective agency!
You must be very busy, right?
No, no, no, no, no.
I heard that several girls have created a nickname for you:
"The Naniwa Stallion".
What can you say about this?
That makes me very happy!
(Note Iro otoko)
What do you mean by "stud"?
He's just a dark man!
Hey, Kazuha!
Don't interfere with the interview!
Why are you reacting like that?
How pathetic...
Did you say "pathetic"?  What do you mean?!
Hattori...
Kazuha...
Pardon the interruption, but when is your wedding?
Wedding?
"Stranding"?
This place is pretty much finished...
Oh, it's you...
You're home early today...
Uncle...
He hasn't changed a bit.
Looks like the brat decided to skip his afternoon classes!
Sonoko?!
Well, I have no right to judge anyone for that.
When I got disinterested, I just left.
It must be great to be a rich lady...
You live the way you want to...
Uncle, you're drinking too much.
Shut up!
Ah...
Ever since Yoko-chan stopped performing and got married...
I get depressed if they don't let me drink...
A man's tears...
I want a beer too!
These two...
They were not surprised by my arrival.
I seem to have lived here for these ten years...
Have I really lost my memory?
Speaking of weddings...
It seems that Ran has finally made up her mind.
Made up her mind?
On marriage!
With Araide-sensei.
Marriage?
To Araide-sensei?
Why are you so surprised?
You knew about that, didn't you?
Araide-sensei asked Ran to marry him two years ago.
But Ran...
She waited all this time for Shinichi-kun's return, but he didn't come back...
To come to a conclusion of how she feels...
She said that today she would go to the place where she has her most important memories with Shinichi-kun...
A place where we have memories?
Where exactly is that, Sonoko-neechan?
Where exactly is it Sonoko-neechan?
How would I know?
Damn it!
Ran!
I'm sorry.
It's Ran's!
Ran...
Don't turn on the light.
I don't want you to see me cry, Conan-kun.
This place is full of memories of me and Shinichi!
You're getting married...
Araide-sensei?
Don't do it!
Don't get married!
Why not?
Because...
I don't want to...
Because...
I'm Kudou Shinichi!
So...
Don't get married!
Ever since you became a high schooler, you've become too much like him.
I don't look like him, I am him!
Thank you...
For saying that just to try to cheer me up...
But...
I've made my decision.
I have waited for 10 years...
Then I can wait another 10 years.
Tomorrow I will refuse Araide-sensei's proposal.
Ran! I really am...
Conan-kun!
Conan-kun!
The body's on fire!
What's going on?
3 hours and 20 minutes.
The effect ended 20 hours earlier than usual.
Looks like the test was a failure.
So...
The dream was an effect of the antidote?
Yes.
You returned to normal after taking the antidote, but you were unconscious, having nightmares.
It is likely that you saw hallucinations due to the high temperature of the fever.
Even though the antidote needs a cold to take effect, it doesn't seem to work if there is a high fever.
But thanks to you, I was able to gain valuable information.
I am tired...
I'm going home to sleep...
Did I wake you up?
I'm sorry.
Ran-neechan...
Ran-neechan...
You look fine
Araide-sensei...
Be grateful to him!
Ran told his conditions and he came to see you!
Sonoko-neechan...
Sonoko-neechan...
Conan-kun!
We've come to visit you!
What a messy room...
Sorry about that.
This is my room!
Hey guys...
Yes, your fever is down.
You'll be fine soon.
That's great!
You went somewhere this afternoon, didn't you?
When I brought your lunch...
You weren't here.
I was in the bathroom...
I had gone to the bathroom...
Did I really?
I thought you went out to play when you felt better.
Of course not...
I would never do such a thing...
That's true!
See, it's just like I said!
How strange...
So, I'll make dinner.
Do you want to have dinner with us?
Yes!
Something wrong, Conan-kun?
This is the first time I'm happy to be Conan again...
You are a great cook.
Thank you!
The meal is delicious!
But now it seems there is one more problem...
kamishimeta kimi no kioku komorebi no nioi
The sunlight through the leaves reminds me of you,
oitekita nanika wa mou koko ni wa nai kedo
But what you left me no longer exists
meguriyuku omoi sururi toorinukeru hitokoishi sa
Our thoughts circulate freely, trying to connect us...
Doing all right!
Doing all right!
kokoroyurasare furimukazu ni ikirenai
We cannot live without facing what is in our hearts!
Doing all right!
We'll do all right!
tesagurishite yumemigachi demo ii n ja nai
We could simply ignore our dreams
kaze no yanda gogo sukoshi no jiyuu kotae no nai toikake
On windless afternoons, stop for a while and try to answer those unanswerable questions
sotto habataku you ni hajiketeyuku
And spread the answer through the air
