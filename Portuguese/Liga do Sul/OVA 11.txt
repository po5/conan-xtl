You are watching a special Shogakukan DVD.
When watching a DVD, turn on the light in the room and sit away from the screen.
After being invited by Diana-san, a British woman we met by chance,
we ended up traveling to England.
Obviously "Edogawa Conan" could not travel abroad,
so I had to take the antidote made by Haibara and again become temporarily Kudou Shinichi.
But I couldn't imagine that at the same time I was traveling to England,
something like "it" could happen...
10 a.m.
That's right...
Yoshida-san let me sleep in her house.
This room is completely different from mine.
Ai-chan, are you up yet?
My father and mother had important things to do, so they've already left.
I see.
My mom prepared sandwiches for us, so let's eat together!
Come on, get up!
And wash your face!
Finally, I found you...
It's me.
I found her.
Yes, there is no doubt.
As we planned, the rest is up to you.
Yes, understood.

Really, Sis...
You should leave them organized before throwing them away...
Who do you think does this every time?
Grace Aihara?
She looks a lot like Haibara-san!
Mit-chan!
Phone.
Yes!
It's Conan-kun.
Conan-kun?
Sounds like he's in a big hurry.
Hello? Mitsuhiko?
Mitsuhiko?
Make sure Haibara doesn't go near the professor's house today!
You can stay close to her...   Just don't take your eyes off her, understand?
(Mitsuhiko) Hello?
Hello?
Don't let Haibara-san go near the teacher's house...
But why?
London Secret Order!
See how she looks like Haibara-san?
Who is this anyway?
Grace Aihara.
A girl who became famous by appearing in American sitcoms.
Her hair color and hairstyle are identical!
Even the shape of her eyes is the same as Haibara-san's!
Really?
"Her favorite food is sandwiches with peanut butter and blueberry jam.
Sounds delicious!
The only difference is their age...
This magazine came out last year, and it says she was eight years old,
so now she must be nine.
But Haibara is seven, like all of us, right?
However, it is not uncommon for celebrities to hide their real ages.
And now this is just my guess...
But I think she really could be Haibara-san.
Didn't she tell us herself recently?
She said she lived in America for some time, and that her mother is English.
Did she really say that?
This girl too!
She's also mixed race, with a Japanese father and an English mother.
"Mixed race"?
If... What if she really...
this girl is Haibara-san,
then why did she have to change her name and come to Japan?
No... Wait, please!
This girl's name is "Grace".
Gray, meaning "gray", in Japanese would be "haiiro".
And the last name "Aihara" can be broken down into "Ai" and "Hara".
Got it!
It seems that "Grace Aihara" is a stage name based on the name "Haibara Ai"!
But...
Then, why did Conan ask not to let Haibara get near the professor's house?
That's...
There is something else written here.
"Six months ago, Grace Aihara unexpectedly announced her retirement.
She returned to England, there is no information about her current location."
England?
Conan and the professor went to England, right?
So he called from England?
I don't think it is possible.
They should arrive in London around...
It's still about seven hours before they arrive, so he called from the plane.
And they can make calls from inside the plane?
You can't do this from a cell phone, but I think airplanes have their own phones.
If he decided to call me in this situation,
it means that there is a very important reason for not letting Haibara-san get near the professor's house.
The reason for their trip to England may somehow be connected to this!
We can't just sit here!
Genta-kun, let's go!
Where to? To England?
Of course not!
Let's go to Ayumi-chan's house!
Maybe now Haibara-san is in serious danger.
Ai-chan, does it taste good?
Yes.
Your mother cooks very well.
I like sandwiches with ham and eggs...
So my mother always makes them for me.
Ai-chan, what kind of sandwiches do you like?
Let's see...  I think with peanut butter and blueberry jam.
With peanut butter and blueberry jam?
Yes.
If you spread butter on one slice, and jelly on the other and combine them,
then you have made a peanut butter and blueberry jelly sandwich.
This is the basis of American snacks.
Even now, from time to time, I want to eat such a sandwich.
But one day, when I made it with the teacher at home,
he looked at me with a look that mixed envy and sadness.
Since then I don't make them anymore.
That's right!
If the teacher eats a sandwich like that, he will become even more obese.
I know, Ai-chan!
Let's go shopping!
But the stores in this region have completely different products than the ones I used to use in the US.
We can only find similar products in stores with imported goods.
One of these stores is right in front of Beika Station!
Let's go and buy!
I want to try it too!
Why not?
I also want to eat, after all this time.
So, let's go now!
But before we do...
Hey, aren't you thinking too much?
What is this "danger" anyway?
I don't know.
But judging by Conan-kun's tense voice,
something bad will happen for sure!
Hey, should we take a shortcut through the professor's house?
No, it's better to go straight this way.
That way we'll reach Ayumi-chan's condominium faster.
Genta-kun, you'll be left behind!
I've always wanted to try this!
Ai-chan, let's do it together!
But why put on makeup?
Many celebrities always go to this supermarket in front of the station.
So we should look like celebrities too!
But still...
Why not?!
Let's do it!
Let's do it.
It's been a long time since I've done this...
What?
Ai-chan, have you tried wearing makeup?
No, I didn't mean that...
What a fright!
Sometimes you mumble some strange things.
Just like Conan-kun.
My mom won't be back until tonight.
So, let's make a big transformation!
That's it!
How about it, Ai-chan?
Did I put too much shadow on my eyes?
Maybe...
I think a more natural look suits you.
"Natural"?
Don't worry, I'll do it for you.
It doesn't even look like me!
Ai-chan, you're very good with makeup!
You happen to already have big eyes and a pretty face, Yoshida-san.
Thank you!
You look very pretty too, Ai-chan!
Really?
She's out.
Does she think she can fool me with this makeup?
No... Maybe it's more convenient.
It's me.
The target is on the move.
I count on you.
Did you see that, Mitsuhiko?
Yes.
Haibara-san and Ayumi-chan look even prettier than usual!
Their mouths are too red...
Did they put ketchup on their mouths?
They're wearing lipstick.
Both of them have put on makeup.
Make-up?
Yes.
It looks like Haibara-san put makeup on Ayumi-chan too.
Any child star can apply makeup well.
As I thought, Haibara-san...
What should we do? They're leaving!
Let's go after them.
I don't know why yet,
but it's better to follow Haibara-san, like Conan-kun asked.
That sounds like fun!
Hey, Ai-chan...
Yes.
I don't know what they're planning, but...
It can't be! That man...
Ai-chan, what happened?
It's nothing.
Let's get going.
It's not possible...
She's going to Beika Station.
Yes. I count on you.
Wow, what an amazing market!
This is a fancy market with imported products from various countries.
Normally, Haibara-san would never go to a store like this.
That's strange...
Let's see...
Peanut butter...
And blueberry jelly.
When I was younger... Yes, Ayumi-chan's age... I loved to eat that...
But aren't they the same age now?
If I remember correctly, in this article...
That's right!
Her favorite food is peanut butter and blueberry jelly sandwiches.
And according to what Haibara-san just said...
When I was younger... Yes, at Ayumi-chan's age... I used to love to eat that...
Since she just happened to mention it, that must be true.
So, Haibara-san is not seven years old,
she's older, she must be around nine or even ten.
So she is the same age as this girl, who was eight last year.
So this is really Haibara-san!
That's why Haibara-san looks more mature than us.
In American supermarkets there are always many different kinds of the same product, even peanut butter.
Some stores even have vending machines from which you can get the peanut butter, just like we do with ice cream.
How cool!
A woman in black...
I wonder if...
That man from before...
Surrounded me?
I don't feel the presence of anyone from the Organization...
How beautiful!
But...
Why Haibara-san...
And now some other news.
One of the most famous supermodels of the modern world...
was actually a spy working undercover.
She often acted as the main star of events for various famous brands.
Maybe Haibara-san is actually a spy!
She also became very popular in different countries around the world.
This incident caused strong uneasiness in the fashion world.
"Spy?"
Wasn't she a child star?
Haibara-san, also known as Grace Aihara, a rising American child star,
tried to find out information about dark matters that connect American show business and the mafia!
What is "mafia?"
But the mafia discovered her, and Haibara-san was forced to flee to England.
In other words, Haibara-san works for the...
UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI-6!
MI...?
In the end, Haibara-san decided to cover up her past and hide from persecution in Japan.
She settled in the teacher's house, pretending to be a relative,
and transferred to Teitan Primary School.
In fact, she is nine or ten years old, but she lied, saying she was only seven years old.
Meanwhile, the mafia found Haibara-san's trail and came to Japan.
The reason why Conan-kun and the teacher suddenly went to England,
must have been because they found out everything and decided to ask for help from the secret intelligence service.
However, the mafia found out the address of the professor's house,
but they found out about it and immediately called me
to warn me that we couldn't let Haibara-san get near the professor's house.
A perfect deduction!
Hey, what is this "mafia"?
Genta-kun, the mafia is actually...
They left.
Hey, what's the Mafia?
An American gang.
"Gang"?
They wear black suits and sunglasses?
Yes, that's right.
So, there's one of them.
How long has he been there?
I don't know, but he was in the supermarket.
Yes, exactly.
Let's approach them both at the same time.
He's going to capture both of them at the same time?
He's not only after Haibara-san, but after Ayumi-chan too?!
First, you block from the front.
Then we'll surround them.
Surround them?
He has an accomplice?
Haibara-san and Ayumi-chan are in danger!
Yes, we'll finish this soon.
I'm counting on you.
That's not...
I couldn't defeat someone like him...
But...
Hey, little princesses...
This way!
Could we talk for a second?
You're so cute!
I told you I'd never fool myself.
A gun?
Is he going to act? Here, in the middle of the street?!
Quick, run!
What are you doing, brat?!
Hurry up!
What are you doing with Mitsuhiko?!
Guys...
What's going on here?!
A talent agency?!
Yes.
We just wanted to offer him a job.
"Job"?!
So, you're not mafia?
Mafia?
I see, so you thought these two were mafia...
What a big misunderstanding!
I apologize.
It turns out that you were following them...
And then they said they would approach them at the same time....
No kidding...
We were informed that somewhere around here lived a girl who looked like the American star Grace Aihara.
So I had to find her.
Grace Aihara!
What?
Nothing...
After a month, we finally found her.
So we decided to arrange everything to talk today.
Then, we saw you with a friend, and both of you were wearing make-up...
So, we decided to make an offer to both of you at the same time.
So, was that what "approaching both of them at the same time" meant?
And what else would it be?
And how would I have to deal with a little girl,
so I decided it would be better to have a woman's help when recruiting.
So I called her to help me.
And that's it.
Now that everything is clear, can you listen to us?
In my opinion, you could make a couple of little beauties and be very successful!
"A couple of little beauties?
I refuse.
The circumstances are not so important,
but I won't work with a person who hits a child on the head with a wallet.
Neither will she.
What a waste of time.
What nasty brats.
Let's go.
Wait!
That was very well said!
As you said, you shouldn't work in a company that has employees who act like that.
It's good that you refused.
And you, who decided to protect your friends...
also did very well!
Although, it is too early for you to wear make-up, young ladies.
Right...
It seems that they were not related to the Organization...
Does that mean that what I felt was just my imagination?
I see.
And that's why you followed us.
It's true!
She looks just like Ai-chan!
Isn't she?
I really thought she was Haibara-san.
But to think that Ai-chan is a spy, pursued by the mafia, and is at the professor's house just to hide...
Your imagination is very good, Mitsuhiko-kun!
Well... you could say you got a lot of things right...
I'm just thinking out loud...
Anyway...
Why did Conan-kun say not to let Haibara-san go near the teacher's house?
By the way, when we passed the professor's house,
I saw a person going there.
It was the little guy who lives next door, Okiya.
At a time when neither I nor the professor were there.
After all, what was he doing?
Ai-chan!
What happened, Ai-chan?
You suddenly started running!
And what is this box?
What were you planning to do inside while no one was home?
Oh, no...
This is a delivery.
A delivery?
The teacher called me and said I should pick up the package that was to be delivered today.
I count on you, Subaru-kun.
Yes, understood.
That's why I came to check the professor's house from time to time.
And then Genta-kun saw you!
But why did Conan-kun tell me not to let Haibara-san get near the professor's house?
If there was a package still to come, why couldn't Haibara-san receive it?
Let me take a look at the receipt.
[ Recipient: Agasa Hiroshi. Caution: Fragile Product. Perishable Product. ]
Don't tell me...
It's okay to open it?
That's what I thought...
Peanut butter?
Blueberry jelly?
Thank you for always shopping with us...
Always?
Does the professor always buy this stuff hidden from Ai-chan?
Professor...
So the professor went to England, and forgot the package.
And so that's why they called Mitsuhiko?
But Conan-kun was very tense, so it must be something very important!
You have to pay by credit card for the phone calls from the plane,
and the price is very high.
He must have been in a hurry.
I know...
I know...
Why don't we eat this together?
Shall we?
After all, the professor was so kind and ordered all this especially for me!
No, I think the professor...
He was planning to eat it all by himself...
Ai-chan, you look scary...
Peanut butter and blueberry jelly...
It's a great filling for sandwiches.
By the way, I recently went to the bakery in front of the station and bought some really tasty bread.
Why don't we make sandwiches with them?
Could the pressure that I felt
really was him, in that bakery?
I want sandwiches!
I want them too!
And so do I!
Well, let's go then.
I have hot chocolate too.
Ai-chan, come on!
Sandwiches!
Yay!
I'm really craving some!
Oh, it's you, Professor Agasa!
I can't wait...
Yes, I received the package, but...
Give it to me.
Oh, Professor...
Thank you so much for the peanut butter and blueberry jelly!
Ai-kun?!
You probably wanted to please me with sandwiches with this filling, after all I love them...
So you ordered everything without telling me.
But you forgot and remembered already on board the plane,
so you had to pay for the phone on the plane, right?
That's right...
I just wanted to surprise you, Ai-kun.
Of course, I didn't even think of eating everything hidden from you.
No, no... That's not an excuse...
It's very obvious...
Thank you, professor.
I invited the class to eat too.
Thank you very much, professor!
I'm going to eat my fill!
I'll take some to my mom and dad!
Can I talk to Edogawa-kun for a moment?
She wants to talk to Edogawa-kun.
Hello?
Edogawa-kun, I also wanted to thank you for calling Tsuburaya-kun.
You and your beautiful personality, eh?
Have a good trip!
Really...
If I marry Haibara-san...
I'd have a sweet life, where Haibara-san would make sandwiches every day for me!
Here, take them.
Let's eat!
This is very tasty!
Delicious!
Too sweet...
I didn't even show up...
Doesn't that seem unfair?
It might even be...
Oh, I know...
Omoidasu no wa aoi gekkou
What I remember is that under that bluish moonlight
te wo futta ushiro sugata ano hi kimi wo tsuresatta
Your figure leaving moved me, it even seemed that the moonlight took you away from me.
kokoro kara kokoro kara kimi ni tsutaetai
From the bottom of my heart... From the bottom of my heart... I want to tell you:
aishiteru aishiteru todokanu omoi
"I love you, I love you." But those words can't reach you.
yume naraba yume naraba kimi ni aeru no ni
If it's a dream If it's a dream... I'll be able to meet you.
inori todokanai kedo
But I know my prayers won't be answered
tsukiyo no itazura no mahou kimi wa kage ni toraware
Moonlight night with its mischievous magic You've trapped me in the shadows...
shingetsu yami ni hisomu you ni kimi no sugata ga mienai
And your figure slips from my sight, just as the new moon disappears into darkness...
kimi wa chikaku ni iru no ni
Even though we're so close
