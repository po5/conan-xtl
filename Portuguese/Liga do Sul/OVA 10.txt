Kid on Trap Island
Ocean, 1000 km north-northeast of Tokyo
Koyakejima
"Tear of Artemis"?
It really sounds like something the Kid would wish for.
It's five minutes until Kid's announced time!
Damn, on a small island like this...
If I could use helicopters to surround this place, the Kid would be like a rat in a trap!
Today is the first anniversary of our hotel, and we are going to have a big ceremony!
Nezu Shinzou (58) President of the Nezu Corporation.
I don't want to frighten my guests.
Please protect this place discreetly.
Let it be...
I may have few men, but they are all elite, hand-picked.
I have also confirmed that none of them is the Kid in disguise.
Besides, we have a secret weapon:
The Iris Recognition System.
This glass compartment cannot be opened or closed without having my irises checked.
Not to mention that the viewer is with me.
You can come whenever you want, Kid!
Yagami Toshihiro (28) Nezu's Secretary
Tonight, I'm going to capture you!
Get ready for this!
(Keep your distance)
One minute to go...
Thirty seconds to go!
Seven, six, five...
Two, one...
The Kid will come when we're blinded by the light!
Stay alert!
Inspector, put on these sunglasses.
Thank you, sir.
Damn you...
Are you the Kid?
How's that?
This face made of plastic resin looks pretty real, don't you think?
Kid!
And now, bye-bye!
Wait, Kid!
Kid...
After him!
The elevator!
Hurry up!
Drive!
What?
I'm sorry!
Damn it!
We'll chase him on foot!
Kid, you're not getting away!
Every time...
They fall for the dummy's trick.
"He never really learns..."
"That inspector."
Isn't it?
Kaitou Kid-san.
How did you know it was a dummy?
It was easy.
The wind is blowing west...
but the hang-glider is going east.
Note: Hang-gliders usually fly in the direction of the wind.
As expected from you.
By the way, are you here because of the warning I sent?
No, it was purely by chance.
Sonoko's family received invitations to the birthday party at this hotel.
But no one in the family except Sonoko could come...
So she brought us along.
So...
I ended up seeing Inspector Nakamori patrolling this hotel, by chance.
And I thought something like this would happen.
I see.
But...
Inspector Nakamori's security plan was too weak, don't you think he wasted too much time doing it?
Ã‰...
It seems that the Inspector wanted to surround everything with helicopters, as usual...
Guys, about our anniversary party...
But President Nezu refused.
He asked for security to be discreet, without alerting the media.
Got it.
Well, then...
Let's stop talking.
Hey, don't tell me you're trying to use your infernal soccer ball?!
You're right.
Damn it!
Is he smiling?
Your precious gem was stolen, so why?
Well, now that we've had our desserts...
Let's leave the party and have fun somewhere else!
Huh?
Hey, where are Conan-kun and the others?
Now that you mention it, they're gone.
Where could they have gone?
They must have gone back to their rooms and gone to sleep.
It's past eight o'clock at night.
We don't need to worry about the brats.
Now it's time for adults, we have to enjoy it!
Wait...
How are things, Ayumi?
The Kid hasn't shown up yet?
It's too dark, I can't see anything.
If only the moon would come out...
There he is!
I see him too!
So he's flying west.
Just as I predicted!
Paper battle plane, take off!
What?
It's hit him!
Hurray!
Genta-kun, do it now!
Go!
I did it!
That catch is too big!
Genta-kun!
The Kid fell!
It was up ahead!
We can't go on like this.
We can go through this hole!
Who made this hole?
It doesn't matter who made it!
Let's go!
All right, let's go.
Private Property - Do Not Enter NEZU CORPORATION
Well...
What should I do?
I hit, got fished out and fell...
What a thing...
I can't fly like this.
The Kid's hang-glider!
And his clothes!
The Kid must be around here!
Damn, they've seen my face!
Shinichi-san...
Is that you?
That's right!
It's Shinichi-oniisan!
Who's that?
Come on, Genta-kun!
It's Ran-oneesan's childhood friend...
The high school detective, Kudou Shinichi-san!
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'm Kudou Shinichi!
It's been a long time, guys!
Shinichi-oniisan, did you come to capture the Kid too?
Yes...
But he ran away when I approached.
In that case, let's chase him together!
He can't have gone far!
Well...
What is it?
You came here to get the Kid, didn't you?
Oh, that's true, but...
So, it's decided!
We, the Young Detectives...
and the great collegiate detective...
will have a stellar collaboration!
Incredible!
That's so cool!
Not that one...
I got caught up in their conversation...
Is that the Kid?
A boar!
Did that boar make the hole?
It doesn't matter now!
Wait for me!
Where are they planning to go?
Shinichi-san, hurry up!
Hurry up, hurry up!
Give me some time...
We'll chase you all the way!
I'm so hungry I can't move.
Then let's eat our snacks!
Snacks?
First, let's spread it around.
Ta-da!
This is the main course!
It has eel in it!
I brought sandwiches and pizza!
I brought dessert!
All this was from the party?
Itadakimasu!
Delicious!
It's amazing to eat under the starlight!
These kids...
It's like a picnic or something...
What's next?
Mitsuhiko, eat carrots too!
I don't like carrots...
Shinichi-oniisan, is there anything you don't like to eat?
I don't do well with fish.
"Don't do well with fish..."
Are you afraid of them?
How funny!
That's so funny?
How exciting!
Just ahead is a bridge!
Are you all right?
Somehow...
A surveillance camera...
Are we being watched?
Look at this!
What is it?
It's the Tear of Artemis.
The Kid must have dropped it...
Ayumi-chan, good job!
This is the diamond worth 100 million yen?
Incredible, incredible!
Hey, Genta-kun, your breath fogged up the gem!
Let me see.
This is a...
fake.
Fake?
If you breathe on a real diamond, the condensation disappears immediately.
This is due to its great thermal conduction.
However, the condensation on this one took time.
But why would the Kid steal a fake diamond?
We will have to ask President Nezu about this personally.
Haven't you heard something?
Yes...
And it's getting closer...
A crocodile!
Run for it!
Guys, this way!
Why are there crocodiles here?
Now that you mention it, I heard they're building a crocodile park around here!
Does that mean we are in the crocodile park now!?
No...
Someone released the crocodiles!
In order to keep us away!
So what now?
I could run away, if I were alone.
But I have to save them too...
Hey, guys!
Give me the rubber bands you used to tie the snacks!
Elastic?
Hurry up!
Over here.
Don't move.
Now everything is under control!
Using only rubber bands...
Although crocodiles are powerful, when we close their mouths...
they can't demonstrate their real strength.
All right, let's get out of here.
It's a door!
You don't have to think!
Let's go in!
But...
Why is there a room in a cave like this?
What is this room for?
So many jewels!
Incredible!
No.
Nobody would leave real jewelry here.
They're all fake!
Fakes?
It seems that President Nezu has a studio that creates fake jewelry and artwork...
Also...
He is involved in illegal arms sales.
The reason he let the Kid steal that fake gem...
Was to win the 100 million in insurance.
Looks like you saw something you shouldn't have, huh?
President Nezu...
I'll let you see the real diamond as a parting gift.
I appreciate your generosity.
But you take the real one with you out of fear, don't you?
Because you know that the Kid will come after the real one when he finds out that the other one is fake.
Shut up!
For discovering our secret, you must die.
Damn...
These guys are more trouble than crocodiles...
Shoot them!
You...
Brat!
The reason President Nezu refused the police helicopters' help...
was to help you escape, don't you think?
Yes.
Even if I returned the fake gem to the police afterwards...
They would say that the Kid was responsible for the exchange.
And they would claim that the real gem was really stolen.
That was the plan.
If you leave the Tear of Artemis, I will make an exception and let you go.
As a thank you for saving my friends.
How kind of you.
To tell you the truth, accompanying them was very tiring.
But, I think I understand a little now...
I'm talking about how you feel about them.
So be it...
Until next time, great detective!
Hello Mr. my yesterday itteokure yo
Hello Mr. Yesterday, say to me
"yume kanau sono toki ni mata aeru" to
that we'll meet again when our dreams come true.
zenpou no ikuta zentotanan no michi kouhou no michi koukai mo shitta
Behind me, there is a road that I have passed with many regrets
keiken to kachi yume nakaba ippon no michi kekka da ga
A path on which I had several experiences, almost a dream, but the result of which...
kibou to yuu utsu to no baransu nakushite kara mou dore kurai darou
I was lost between hope and despair. After all, when did this happen?
demo hokoreru mono mo nashi ni ima sara kaeru beki basho mo
I have nothing to be proud of and no place to call home
asu no riyuu mo mi dasenai yo boku ha
I can only move on without ever hesitating
Hello Mr. my yesterday taimumashin de
Hello Mr. past, use your time machine
ano hi no boku he ima tsutaetakute yume wo kataru mono yo
and ask my past self, that young dreamer
"anata no me ni asu no boku no koto ha utsuttemasu ka?"
"Can you see what your future will look like?"
I was surprised to learn that President Nezu was counterfeiting jewelry and artwork....
As well as being involved in illegal arms sales...
But what I'm disappointed about is that I couldn't find Kid-sama!
Excuse me for a moment.
Where are you going?
I'm going to look for Shinichi!
He won't answer my calls!
And ignored my messages.
I bet he's still on this island somewhere.
He'll see, when I find him!
I'm right here...
So, let's all go and look!
Now we know this island well.
Young Detectives...
Let's go!
I'm serious...
What about that guy?  How did he get away without his hang-glider?
Jii!
Come and get me!
A FISH!
