In Conan, Kid and the Mother Crystal
ending
This is a special episode brought to you by Shogakukan.
When watching this video, do so in a well-lit place and away from the screen.
This luxury train is the Royal Express, the pride of Japan.
Is it up to His Majesty's standards?
Yes, I am satisfied.
In fact, we could have booked it just for you, but...
No.
I want to get in touch with the people of Japan.
At least a little...
However, the Japanese government feels...
Besides, I have been able to meet that famous man.
Do you want to say Inspector Nakamori, the one in charge of your escort?
No, the one who came into my private room a while ago.
The thief who goes by the name of Kaito Kid.
What?
He came in contact with the Kid?
Really, Your Majesty?
Don't worry.
He's from the Japanese police...
Hey... what exactly has he done to the Kid?
He's come to steal Ingram's treasure...
The fattest topaz in Europe, the Mother Crystal!
How can that be?
So the warning that reached the embassy was true?
Anyway, how come he didn't leave with the jewel?
Just at a glance you will have realized
that this is...
What?
A replica?
Well...
I have the real one hidden in part...
Where, Your Majesty, if I may ask?
I can't even tell you that, inspector.
Maybe in the KID it's right here, in the train, listening to us.
That's right!
In the Kid is the train!
Search every passenger, head to toe!
Yes, sir!
Let it go!
I can't allow you to disturb the welfare of the people in the name of Ingram.
But, Your Highness...
It's two and a half hours before the train arrives in Osaka.
He will try to steal the jewel from me as he said in his note,
but I will protect it, I stake the honor of my country on it.
But, your majesty...
But, Your Majesty...
Tell me, mother...
Philip?
The pendant you wear...
Silence.
Have I not forbidden you to leave your room?
Besides, haven't I taught you that in front of people you must treat me with majesty?
This child...?
Prince Philip.
He is the honorable son of Queen Selizabeth and the late Henry.
He is the future king of Ingram.
It's just that this copy is different from the one you wore before...
What?
It's a transmitter.
Ten would have put it on when you entered his majesty's chamber.
Do you feel me, Kaito Kid?
As long as I'm here you won't lay
not a finger on the jewel!
You can count!
What's the matter with you all of a sudden?
Your father, he gave me a good booing.
It's all right.
You're angry?
It was you who wanted to make this trip by train, eh?
That's why I asked my father for the tickets.
Yeah, yeah... I'm always grateful to him.
Come on, change your face, we will soon present ourselves to Her Majesty, the Queen.
Her Majesty will surely be in the saloon.
So I will address and greet her:
"I am the daughter of Inspector Nakamori, the one who always chases in Kid everywhere."
Really?
Ouch!
Lucky you, isn't it?
We're on the same train as Her Majesty.
We'll have to thank the Kazuha and the others for inviting us to Osaka.
Indeed.
Anyway...
Why Inspector Nakamori's escort?
Do you want to go to the salon?
Maybe we'll meet His Majesty.
Yes, let's go!
Let's go!
And maybe we'll meet at the Kid.
I'm sorry but we can't accept any more reservations in this carriage.
We already have too many people today.
Really?
Oh...
Sorry for the inconvenience.
What a drag.
Eh, Conan?
Yes, but when we get to Osaka we will surely be able to see it.
But I can't just stand here, I must clarify if the Kid has made a warning or not.
Damn, because of the Kid, the number of agents has skyrocketed.
Now it will be more difficult than before, to obtain the jewel.
And then, wouldn't it be easier to steal it from him?
And his life.
This is the idea, he has already entangled us too many times.
And among the confusion, I will take his majesty's life.
It's the perfect occasion to become the number one shooter.
Your Majesty... won't you tell me the location of the jewel?
Without knowing it, standing guard is difficult.
If you're so worried, stay by my side and protect me.
I'll pour you some wine.
No, I'm on duty, I can't...
Oh, Inspector, you must not want to become the first to refuse me a drink....
Well, I suppose I'll allow myself to accept your offer.
Oh, Father.
Oh, Father!
European wine is the best!
Once you start you can't stop!
Oh, Father!
It goes well toasted!
Your Majesty, this is my daughter Aoko and her classmate, Kaito!
Pleasure to meet you.
It's a pleasure to meet you, your majesty!
These two said they couldn't miss the opportunity to travel on the same train as you.
In Kaito, I was looking forward to meeting your majesty...
It's you, who was looking forward to...
Aoko, don't go up and down grumpy guards!
Okay, okay, okay!
You sure are a good guard.
But well, now that I've infiltrated the hall with His Majesty...
I'll be able to find where he's hiding the jewel.
It's the perfect opportunity for the Kid!
But where is it?
I've already sneaked into his majesty's private chamber.
So he must have it nearby...
Or maybe...
A cat?
It can't be...
Oops, Kaito, you're staring at His Majesty.
Big guy!
I was just staring at His Majesty's cat.
At Caesar?
Isn't he cute?
This year he will be two years old!
Who are you?
Philip Maximilian Ingram.
Are you...
The prince?
Caesar, come here.
Here he is, Caesar!
Didn't you want to see him?
Yes...
Let-he caught me!
How beautiful!
Under the table!
Now it's mine!
My God, you're hopeless, Aoko.
Nothing good in the right eye...
Let's see the left one...
Are you okay, Kaito?
Coi, it's a cat and that's it.
What a cute stuffed animal you have!
You mean this one?
It's a present from father.
Is it?
It looks like it's got a tear in its eye...
Doesn't look like there's anything in it, inside...
Hey, mister.
Say.
Are you...
...the Kaito Kid?
Don't talk nonsense, prince!
Of course I'm not.
Oh, aren't you?
Oh, it's just that I know where the jewel is hidden...
But I won't tell you.
This scoundrel...
Prince Philip, this place is safe, you should return to your room at once.
And his majesty is already a bit angry...
The mother...?
Come on, you'd better go back...
I'm not leaving here, I want to protect the mother and the jewel from the Kid's hands.
You're really worried about your mother, aren't you?
I hate my mother!
Come on, come on.
She used to be very kind... but since her father died, she's changed completely.
As soon as she sees me she starts screaming and gets angry, she says I don't listen to her.
She doesn't love me anymore.
But I promised father that I would protect mother and country.
Mother!
You don't seem to care, neither listen nor cross.
No "mother"!
"Majesty!"
Majesty!
Mother!
I won't let you go out again!
(whispering): Okay?
Majesty, don't you find that...?
So be it!
This child won't believe if he doesn't roast well!
Mother...
Mother!
Mother... Mother!
Hey, you're Prince Philip, aren't you?
What about you?
In Conan Edogawa, a detective.
Wow.
I thought so, a warning from the Kid.
How cool, you're a detective even though you're just a kid.
Maybe you could find the jewel.
I have no idea where the mother has hidden it.
If you want to hide a leaf, do it in a forest.
Do you see it?
You couldn't tell me which piece I moved, could you?
And if there's no forest, do it yourself.
Oh, like the case of Gilbert Keith's broken sword, is it?
Yes, that's a line from Father Brown, the famous detective who rivaled Sherlock Holmes.
In the novel it is a cruel and merciless trick, but your mother's trick is just as I said.
No, in fact I'd say she's done even better.
"If you want to hide a leaf, do it in a forest. And if there is no forest, do it yourself."
Wow, that's why the mother...
It's probably been after the Kid stole the replica from her.
In you know many things, from Kid, Conan....
This is because our destiny is linked.
What is it, sir?
Nothing, excuse me.
Shame on me, I'm in the wrong compartment.
Oh, man, you have to be more careful.
No doubt, this man was spying on us.
Is it the Kid?
No, this face looks familiar...
Eh, Conan?
Ah!
Ran...
You've gone to the bathroom and haven't come back.
You can't go back and forth like that.
We'll be in Osaka in 10 minutes...
The famous Kid couldn't get out.
Looks like I've won, Inspector.
It looks like it, huh?
Well?
Where is it that you had the jewel hidden?
I'll tell you when I get to Osaka.
Another toast, inspector?
A celebratory one.
I'm already...
Come on, don't be like that.
Where will it be?
Where will you have it?
Shit, I have to hurry or I'll run out of time.
Where have I seen him, this man?
Where does he look familiar?
Strange, in all this time he hasn't slowed down at all.
I should have already...
I've got it!
For the victory!
Sorry for the wait.
Ah, thank you!
Guaita!
I got it!
I know where the jewel is hidden!
Thank you. Thank you.
Where are you going, Kaito?
Ah, the washroom...
All right, so far!
What a beautiful coaster!
Come on, the flowers are pressed, what a scent!
Sorry, Aoko.
I can't become Kaito Kid in front of you!
I saw it on the doctor's computer.
His name is Jackal.
He's a jewel thief known all over the world.
One of the most ruthless...
A blackout!
In Kid!
At the end you have appeared?
Your Majesty!
Do not be mistaken!
I was only looking to protect your majesty!
What?
Where is your glass?
From it...
All the staff!
Split this one up for him!
Maybe inside the glass I was drinking there was the jewel?
That sounded is a genius!
Ah, I've got it!
The Mother Crystal, safe and sound!
It's a pleasure to meet you again, Your Majesty.
In Kaito Kid?
We're on a train, there's nowhere for you to catch your breath!
Your Majesty, go to the boss...
In Kaito Kid is like the ghost in your room.
And you, before you're queen, you're a mother with a heart.
Don't forget that.
Wait, wait, wait!
Kid!
Shit!
What are you doing?
We can't let him run away!
Yes, sir!
Emergency!
Make way!
Ah!
What a disaster!
It's my fault we lost my country's most precious treasure!
Philip!
How naive, Inspector...
Every time I tangle with a dummy!
The naive one is you.
The jewel, come back to me!
Without it, my country will be in trouble.
Give it back to me!
But how did you know, that I would be here?
Conan told me.
Conan?
Why, that little boy is also the train?
And a man helped me to get up here.
A man?
This kind man behind me...
We meet again, Kaito Kid!
If you are...
That's serious, but I don't have time to play like you.
Put the jewel down and turn around, if you don't want this brat to die.
No!
Don't do it!
It's... Philip's voice!
Oh, no!
It can't be!
Prince!
Your Majesty!
I don't want any tricks!
You always give me worries... And now, turn around!
Even the eternal Kaito Kid...
...comes to an end.
And what do you say, if I do this?
Don't take my number!
He's already taken care of in Jackal,
but the other one still...
Hey, miss...
Aren't your socks a little strange?
They used to be white, when did you change them?
Coi as a boy!
If you have to disguise yourself, do it right, miss.
Just as I thought, it was that man.
This means that in Kid...
Conan!
What are you doing in a stranger's compartment?
Ran!
Well, being him, I doubt they'd just blow him away like that.
Oh, Lord!
Hey, are you all right?
The jewel, come back to me!
What the hell!
Is this how you treat the one who saved your life?
Without it, my country...
Like hell it is!
I'm not giving it to a liar.
What's that?
You really want her to make your mother happy, don't you?
You fly to bring her joy and win her approval, don't you?
Well?
What do you say?
Then I can think of a better way to get to know your mother's feelings...
Philip, Philip...
Your Majesty!
Mother...
Philip?
I'm sorry, mother.
I have chased the Kaito Kid to the train deck to retrieve the jewel, but it has been taken away.
M-Mother?
Why don't you listen to what I say?
How come you always, always, have to do dangerous things?
What good has it done me to take care of you with rigidity, as your father would have done?
But... But... I'm glad...
...that you're well!
I'm so...
Mother...
How nice, prince.
Your mother is a real queen of hearts!
Au va!
Children can't cry forever.
Besides, how many times do I have to tell you...
...that you treat me as "majesty"?
Just as I imagined.
Come on!
Ah!
The Kazuha and the others are waiting for us at the exit.
We should hurry.
This jewel is impressive.
I guess the Kid couldn't have stolen it.
Or maybe...
Next time, I'll get the Jewel of Destiny.
Selizabeth - Queen of the Principality of Ingram
Philip - Heir to the Principality of Ingram
Rose
Jackal
In Conan, Kid and the Crystal Mother
Among the wind, there are times when we are not above disputes.
Since we've always shared dreams
The day is coming when we'll be one and the same
Just like the color of the seasons let our love last forever
It's what I feel when you smile while you sleep
Then, just like now, these moments become our future.
