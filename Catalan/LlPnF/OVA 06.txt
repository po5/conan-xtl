On the trail of the missing diamond!
In Conan and Heiji vs. Kid!
Warning.
This video is a special offered by Shogakukan.
Please watch with the light on and do not get too close to the screen.
In Kaito Kid ?!
What do you feel like eating, Conan?
Anything's fine with me.
I'd love to make sukiyaki, but father hasn't been charging much lately.
So we have to save up.
Ah, Ran!
We're having a sale on beef today.
That's good, so I'll make croquettes!
Will you give me 150 grams?
Well, make it 100.
I also want eggs.
Right now!
Ran, who is this kid?
He's in Conan, he's in our country.
Mustn't he be an illegitimate child of en Mouri?
Come on, woman.
Of course he's not.
Look, I'll give you 20 grams.
Thank you.
Potatoes, onions, cabbage, tomatoes...
It's on the house.
Thank you very much, really.
Who knew Ran had a little brother.
Come on, we're not brothers.
I got the fish at a very good price!
Well?
I guess we could do for lunch tomorrow.
Always so lively, Ran.
Come to think of it, Ran...
She's always shopped like that.
Here, take these cockles.
Perfect, so I can make miso soup!
But it's very popular.
Thank you.
We're back here for "Cooking with Yoko Okino"!
Today's guest is the well-known detective, Kogoro Mouri.
All right, see you next week.
So long, Yoko!
My goodness, how many times will this video be played before it gets tired?
This tape must be worn out by now.
Quiet!
Don't meddle where you're not asked, if only I had clients...
This is it!
What is it?
Thank you very much!
What is it, father?
It's nothing.
Something they have sent me.
This I know, but who?
No one.
Maybe it's a request you've made.
Is it true, father?
Just a moment, father!
It will not be anything indecent, right?
You idiot!
What the hell are you saying?
I need it for work.
So why are you going upstairs?
What a pain in the ass!
Aai!
What do you say, Conan?
It's suspicious, huh?
Yes, isn't it?
At some head's door...
Hello?
Do you have the money ready?
Eh?
How "Eh"?
Do you have the...
Who am I talking to?!
Blackmail.
I'll search him.
Good morning!
Shit!
Hello?
Hello ?!
What's up, Conan?
I thought so...
Conan?
Telephone blackmail?
But the phone number didn't show up, we couldn't return the call.
And the man who spoke to you didn't say any name, did he?
Since he is called here by accident, our number will be similar to the one he was looking for.
But father, we should hastened to call the police!
Stop the carriage, what you have told me does not hold water.
There is no proof that this is a crime.
But...
I'm sure it was someone who wanted to collect a debt.
Well, I've arranged to play mahjong.
Hey!
You should listen to what Conan tells you!
It's true that there's no proof that it's a crime,
but, if there's a kidnapping at stake, we can't waste time.
Farewell!
Father!
But before that...
Do you have the money ready?
Eh?
What do you mean, "Eh"?
Do you have the...
Who am I talking to?!
That voice... I've heard it somewhere.
Besides...
Good morning!
Shit!
I'd say I've heard that voice recently, but where?
Wait a minute, the only voices I've heard recently...
My goodness...
Fish at a great price!
Well?
Always so lively, Ran.
We're having a discount on veal today.
Mustn't he be an illegitimate son of en Mouri?
Cabbage, tomatoes...
Who would have thought that Ran had a little brother.
And if...?!
That's because we don't use pesticides.
Delicious, I guarantee it!
No.
They look alike, but it's not that voice.
Thank you very much.
Where was it?
Where did I hear it?
Where was it?
Good morning, did I catch you at a good time?
Soc at Moriwaki's business affairs department.
What is it, the boss?
Heiji!
Kud -... I mean... Conan!
It must be an important matter
if you suddenly made me come all the way from Osaka.
That's right.
As a matter of fact...
A call from a blackmailer?
He says the blackmailer's voice reminds him a lot of yours, Heiji.
I thought I heard that voice before.
But the way he spoke was different, so I didn't notice it.
And the reason we called you...
...is to find the man on the call by making me talk like him.
And calling all the phone numbers similar to the detective agency.
We'll know from the reaction.
Yes!
You couldn't expect anything less from Heiji!
Kudo...
No, no, no.
Co-Conan, I can tell it's your idea.
The list of phone numbers is already made, I think we should hurry.
If so, without further ado...
Can you leave everything to me and the kid?
Well, I'll prepare dinner.
If I can help you in any way, let me know!
Dinner?
It's a very cozy detective agency, don't you think?
Hey, this is no time for small talk.
Let's put them on!
Very well!
Hello?
This is Inoue.
It's me... It's me.
{In English there is a note that Heiji uses first a dialectal form and then the standard form;
personally I'm convinced by this solution, but if not, let's make a translation note and put "It's me, it's me"...}
Eh?
Who is it?
Sorry, I must have the wrong number.
It's me.
Eh?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've got the wrong number.
Ah, sorry.
Hello?
Soc at Yuwatsume.
It's me.
T-Ti!
What more do you want now?
You filthy thief!
I've handed over the ten million yen and haven't said anything to the police, as we agreed.
You shouldn't have anything to talk to me about anymore.
I'll call you back.
Bingo, eh?
From the sound of the call, the man has already paid and closed the deal.
But he called me a "filthy thief".
What exactly did he mean by "thief"?
Here we are, huh?
Eh?
Isn't this Inspector Nakamori?
If you're Mouri's little boy...
You've come to visit Mr. Yuwatsume?
Who's Mr. Yuwatsume?
We're investigating a fraud case.
A jewelry theft?
Yes.
Yuwatsume is a pond name, isn't it?
So after looking him up on the internet we found out he was a jewel thief.
Which means that it's probably a jewel robbery.
But we're not sure how blackmail is related.
All right, let's meet this Yuwatsume.
But Inspector...
Aren't robberies handled by the third division?
You're from the second...
Since I'm already here... Besides, I'd be in trouble if I ignored you.
That's right.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I have an idea.
Nothing happened?
Yes.
Probably a giant flying squirrel.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
What do you want, the police?
Do you remember hearing that voice?
Do you have the money ready?
They've already caught the criminal?!
What criminal?
What criminal?
I mean the jewel thief!
Jewel thief?!
Yes, we got him.
Please explain to us-in all details, we need the victim's testimony.
Of course, no problem.
The day before yesterday, a...
Can you repeat what you said?
Oh, no!
Do you have the money ready?
One more time.
Do you have the money ready?
No, this is not the criminal!
He didn't have that strange accent.
What do you mean, strange?
Are you making fun of the Osaka dialect?
Hey, hey, hey!
Who are you?
I'm me?
Soc...
...the teenage detective from Naniwa High School in Heiji Hattori!
Idiot...
Inspector!
What's the meaning of this?
Never mind, the fact is that a hundred million yen worth of jewelry has been stolen, right?
No, it hasn't been stolen.
I have it.
And this is the proof.
But a moment ago you said that...
It was a joke.
Joke?
Wow, so that's it.
Understood.
After stealing the jewel, they offered to return it to him if he paid ten million yen.
Isn't that right?
Right?
And why should I...
The thing is, you had already sold it to someone else.
And even if it cost you ten million yen, it would still be worth it to get the diamond back.
Am I wrong, Mr. Yuwatsume?
Mr. Yuwatsume, please tell us the truth.
If I don't arrest the criminal now,
he may act again, maybe a second and a third time.
That's right.
Just like in Kid.
In Kid ?!
That's right!
I have a lot of bad memories because of this asshole!
Damn it!
I won't forgive you, Kid!
Inspector, please calm down!
Speaking of the King of Rome, I don't know if he'd be interested in this diamond.
Wait a minute, this jewel...
This thief is not very ambitious, is he?
Who is this boy?
He's a bit impertinent.
No, don't listen to him.
For a jewel worth a hundred million yen, he only got ten, right?
If it were me, I would have asked for at least half of what it's worth!
It's strange to ask for only ten percent of what it's worth.
Maybe the jewelry you got back is a fake?
No way.
P-excuse me for a moment.
It's a fake...
I thought so.
I guess it's a case of fraud, too.
You admit it now, Mr. Yuwatsume?
Yes.
Well, do you have any clue about the criminal?
Well, during the exchange we didn't see each other's faces, I only heard the voice.
On the phone?
Did you search him?
No, I didn't...
It seems that Mr. Mouri and Ran are asleep.
Hattori...
I know, you don't have to say it.
You want me to re-enact the call he had, don't you?
That's right.
Since it's not the thief's real voice, we can't use it as evidence,
but it will help us find him.
All right, let's go.
Let's go.
Do you have the money ready?
No, no, not like that!
"Have you got the money ready?".
Isn't that what he told you?
No, and precisely for this reason in Yuwatsume has realized it.
You have to literally say "Do you have the money ready?"
Do you have theprepared?
You don't remarked it like that!
Can't you say natural, like me?
What do you want me to do?
I've lived all my life in Osaka!
Oh, sir!
If we go on like this, we'll never finish.
And if I can't say it well, so what?
You wouldn't speak the Osaka dialect well either, it's quite normal!
Don't compare it!
Of course I know how to speak well, the Osaka dialect!
You do?
Well, I've heard you imitating him before and...
Doing me, in fact.
The voice transformer!
That's right!
With this we're going to get away with it the first time!
Why didn't I think of that?
This is what they call having it right under your nose, eh?
Hattori, you can go home now.
Kudo!
I was joking.
Regarding the jewel thief, please note the suspect's voice.
Do you have money ready?
As in "Eh"?
Do you have the...
Anyone who can identify the suspect, please contact the special hotline that is...
This is you, right?
Your standard accent is very good!
Well, we detectives put mentions on these things.
But I'm surprised they didn't realize it's you.
In fact, Inspector Nakamori does know it's in Heiji.
Exactly, but even knowing that, he has still pulled contacts to get it on TV.
I see that the inspector is not afraid of wind or water.
With the TV broadcast, there will soon be an avalanche of calls.
The Kazuha!
Hello?
Heijō!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I heard your voice on TV!
On a TV channel in Tokyo, but I'm sure it's you!
So bad go of money in your house that now you dedicate yourself to steal jewelry ?!
You idiot!
How can you expect me to steal jewelry?!
But it was your voice...
Don't be ridiculous.
Well, there are calls, yes!
Yes, really...
By the way, Kudo, have you remembered where you heard that "good day"?
That's the key to the case.
No, but I've been thinking.
Come to think of it, it sounded more muffled than the man's voice.
Huh?
What's this?
Special Yoko Okino figure with alarm clock?
What is it?
Isn't this what Mr. Kogoro got yesterday?
I don't believe it.
Why do you want this?
Let-me-see!
Wait a minute, Yoko Okino...
It's very well done, huh?
Good morning!
Good morning everyone!
Sleep away!
I-It's that voice!
Ran!
It's the voice of the call!
Don't touch!
These alarm clocks are made exclusively for Yoko's fan club members!
Father, how much did it cost you?
Does it matter, this?
How much!
Two... Two thousand yen.
Liar!
Twenty thousand yen...
Twenty thousand yen?
Duke saving every day and putting it in the account to get ahead!
And you spend that kind of money on a toy?
That's why you wanted to hide it from us, huh?
They've only made two hundred copies,
I wanted so much to have one...
FATHER!
Only two hundred?
We can take the name off the club's list!
Surely the criminal bought the watch and set the time wrong.
So when he was talking to me...
Good morning!
Shit!
Hello?!
Hello?!
The next day, between the fan club list and a call from the TV audience, we found the thief.
Freeze!
If he comes any closer, I'll throw this into the sea!
Dang it...
His voice is just like my...
Kid!
Good morning!
Good morning everybody!
Sleep away!
Good morning!
Good morning everybody!
Sleep away!
What are you doing in Kid...?
He probably wanted the jewel too...
He probably showed up before the interrogation.
That's why he was up to date on the case...
It was no flying squirrel...
Congratulations, little detective.
And to you too, detective of the west.
Hey, what in the Kid escapes!
That's what they call coming up empty-handed.
And that's why I came all the way from Osaka?
Yoko!
What a piece of betzol.
I'm off.
I'm leaving, too.
Ran, one more, please!
No!
From now on, no smoking, and only one beer every day!
No!
What a bastard I am!
It's a cozy detective agency, isn't it?

When I arrived, I long for.
In the city, rampant with bad news.
The day I can't hear your voice, the whole world stops.
The sadder you are, the more I love you.
But when I miss you too much, I wonder why.
It's all very painful.
With courage, the door to a new world is still open.
You have colored my heart with the brightness of dawn.
So I want to smile with you.
