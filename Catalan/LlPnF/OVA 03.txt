A spring day,
The Ran and I accepted an invitation from Hattori and Kazuha...
...to visit Osaka again.
This time we were only supposed to go sightseeing.
So, first of all, we went to the viewpoint of the Umeda building.
Hey, look over there!
It's the famous Six Gods Mountain.
And, over there, what looks like a dot is the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge.
See that?
That's Osaka International Airport.
Right next to it is the Expoland...
The Osaka Dome...
Tsutenkaku Tower.
And Osaka Castle!
Can you see it?
Isn't it...
...a wonderful place?
Osaka!
So much so.
These two are of the same stock.
In Conan, in Heiji and the missing boy
Go, next stop!
So far, it goes.
What's wrong, Ran?
Those kids...
They were already, when we passed by earlier.
Oh, really?
They were...
These three...
They're all amassed!
You're teenage detective Heiji Hattori, right?
Well, yes, I am.
My name is Mayumi Esaka.
Mayumi Esaka (7 years old)
I'm in first grade.
This lean boy is Mikihiko Yagi.
Mikihiko Yagi (7 years old)
And the chubby boy is at Kenta Ohsawa.
Kenta Ohsawa (7 years old)
Ayumi, Mitsuhiko, Genta?
No, no, no.
Mayumi, Mikihiko, Kenta.
What's wrong with your ears?
Even in name they look alike.
You should go to the doctor if you don't feel well.
Now that you're talking, I went to the doctor yesterday.
"This tooth looks bad!"
"I think we'll have to fill it."
You see.
This is the dentist.
My grandfather is amazing.
Every night he removes his teeth.
It's a denture.
He makes my head dance!
What pathetic anecdotes!
They have very different personalities, though.
You look for someone and...
...want my help?
Nothing less, yes.
Specifically, we are looking for a place.
We would like to find the place where Satoshi is.
In Satoshi?
He is a friend of ours.
We were supposed to meet at the bank at one o'clock but he didn't show up.
At one o'clock, eh?
It's already after two o'clock.

Agenda
Have you called your family?
Yes, but we got the answering machine.
This kid must have stood us up to go play in his secret place.
His secret place?
He said he used to stay until sundown.
See.
"It's where the red line train comes to the tyrannosaurus hand."
"Even though it's fun, it's a place that makes me sad."
What do you mean?
This says in Satoshi.
It must be a "paste."
It's called a "track."
In Osaka, the only line with red trains is Kanjou.
Wait a minute...
On the Kanjou line, you can transfer to the Yumesaki line.
Oh, right!
I got it!
It's the U...
Universal Studios Japan amusement park.
It's not USJ.
It's the first thing that came to my mind, but you already said no.
What could it be, then?
I don't know the Osaka lines...
Is there any sign or tyrannosaurus model seen from Kanjou line?
It's just that I remembered that Osaka people love these things.
In fact, there are giant crabs, octopus and puffer fish.
But no dinosaurs.
Well, then, Heiji.
There's only one way to clear it up.
Let's take a ride on Kanjou's line!
You idiot!
We have two guests today...
And now, we're doing fine.
Right, Conan?
Compared to what you've shown us in Heiji so far,
this should be quite interesting.
Decided, then!
Majadero, I'll remember!
That's a nice clip you're wearing.
Can I see it?
Of course you can.
I got it from Satoshi.
A gift from your boyfriend?
How embarrassing...
Hey, Ran, look over there!
What's there?
It's the Umeda building, where we were a while ago.
Ah, it's beautiful.
Tyrannosaurus, tyrannosaurus...
Hey, maybe I saw a freeway go through the middle of that building?
Yes, that's right.
Interesting, huh?
All of Osaka is!
In that case even a dinosaur there would fit.
See, the mountains!
What's wrong with them, in the mountains?
Sure, it's just that people in Tokyo don't often see mountains.
I do not see any sign with a tyrannosaurus.
The Otaki!
Kudo, did you see the white car parked in front of the police cars?
Yes, it was a sedan.
They found it.
The bank robbers' car.
Today at half past eleven a bank was robbed in Namba.
The culprits were two young men and a woman.
And they were in a white sedan.
Let them concentrate on the dinosaur.
Our stop is coming.
Our stop?
Otaki!
Heiji, what are you doing here?
We saw you from the train.
It's the bank robbers' car, isn't it?
Yes, a witness remembered part of the license plate.
So the criminals have changed cars here, huh?
Kid, you're not...
Heiji!
Conan!
Seriously, it's always the same.
You're Mr. Mouri's daughter, aren't you?
Inspector!
Look here!
What's this?
If it's...
A hair clip.
This clip...
It's like the Mayumi's!
Mayumi's?
This girl.
May I?
Of course you may.
They are very similar.
Little girl, where did you buy it, this clamp?
I didn't buy it, it's a gift!
Did they give it to you?
Who gave it to you?
A friend of mine.
He told me he found it in his secret place.
A secret place?
Well, I'll be damned.
So you all took Kanjou's line...
The car clamp must have fallen off the criminals, right?
This looks like it.
They were both wearing ski masks.
Surely it must have fallen off when the woman removed her mask.
And, given the clip this girl is wearing and that of the robbers....
I think there is a conclusion.
Looking at the needles, you noticed that both are painted red, right?
The woman must have used nail polish to paint them.
So scratching should get her out.
It's going away!
This means...
Satoshi's secret place...
...is somehow connected to the criminals.
Mayumi, is it usual for Satoshi to stand you up?
No, today was the first time.
That's a bad thing.
If he didn't show up at Satoshi,
he must have met the criminals at his secret place.
What are you saying?
If so, he could be in danger.
Armed criminals...
Who knows what they are capable of!
Anyway, we can't be sure.
Let's go right away to foul boy to check it out.
With all this we won't need to do any more work.
Yes, but what do we do about the boy?
Satoshi Moriguchi (7 years old)
He's already seen our faces.
We can't leave witnesses.
I guess we'll have to take him to the mountain and get rid of him.
Tsuyoshi Maejima (26 years old)
Too bad, but I guess we have no choice.
Kaoru Komiya (21 years old)
What an impressive house!
Also, it's newly built.
You are right.
As we thought, there's no one at home.
Even if there was only the mother.
We could have found out where Satoshi's secret place is.
The plants are dry...
How strange!
There's only one lock on the door!
So what?
If there's a security system, you can rest assured, right?
Do you guys know where Satoshi's father works?
Nope.
Wow.
Well, a little research might clear it up.
In Satoshi doesn't go to the same school as us.
He goes to a private school.
We go to public.
So how do you two know each other?
We met at a pond nearby.
That day in Satoshi was looking at the sky.
What are you doing?
Hey, look over there.
Those two clouds look like a tortoise and a hare chasing each other.
It's true!
So true.
What a strange boy...
Otaki, we're going back to Kanjou's red line to look for the tyrannosaurus.
All right, then.
Heiji, how did it go?
Badly, we didn't find anything.
Neither did we.
We split up but we didn't find anything.
We got as far as the Yomiuri Television building.
We haven't seen anything that looks like a tyrannosaur.
I guess it must not have been the Kanjou line.
Whichever way you look at it, it's orange.
Have you come up with anything, Inspector Otaki?
He just called us,
and he said they've been able to locate his father.
But it seems he has no idea where his secret location might be.
Of it, the one he said he worked for, Satoshi's father?
It seems that he is an entrepreneur.
He set up the company a few years ago and now recently they are in that house.
But in Satoshi is not very happy.
At first he complained that his father worked too much and that he was always arguing with his mother.
Right?
He looked like he was going to cry.
Oh yes, I just remembered something.
At the Nagai museum, I saw a huge dinosaur skeleton.
Eh?
Nagai, huh?
It's south of Tenoji...
The Midosuji and Hagane subway lines intersect there.
And the cars on the Midosuji line have red stripes!
Also, look.
The color of the line on the map is red!
So by "red train" he meant the Midosuji line?
Also, Nagai is near can Satoshi.
It must be there.
So this is the dinosaur....
It's not a tyrannosaurus, but...
It's here!
The tyrannosaurus!
What a mess, if it has no hands.
Shit!
So, we're wrong again?
Hey, Heiji, it's getting dark.
So the red train didn't mean the Midosuji line either, huh?
The tyrannosaurus!
See the shape of the lines, doesn't it remind you of a tyrannosaurus?
That's right!
The boss...
The body...
And here are the hands!
I can see it.
That must be it.
And the part with the hands is...
Nakamozu.
But what does Nakmozu have that the others don't?
The Otaki said he'd go talk to Satoshi's father.
So I guess we'll know before we get there.
Uh... When you said that...
There's only one lock on the door!
Why were you so surprised?
I thought they'd have a double lock...
Because Satoshi always has two keys on it.
One is normal, but the other one has a long saw.
Two keys...
Hattori!
Yes...
That must be it.
I've got it, Heiji.
The Moriguchi family...
They used to live in Nakamozu, right?
That's right, but how do you know?
It's just as we thought.
They lived in an apartment near the Shinnou Lake.
One called Nankaisho.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What, did the boy come back to us?
Who are you, you?
Entoma this one!
Satoshi!
Just a moment!
Mayumi, Mikihiko, Kenta!
You'll be fine!
I'm glad you're well.
So am I!
You saved me!
We were worried sick.
It seems that criminals had occupied this apartment.
As in Satoshi kept the room key when he lived here,
he sometimes came here on his own.
Yoshiko Moriguchi (35 years old)
Yousuke Moriguchi (38 years old)
But why did he do that?
I guess you'd better
see for yourselves, as parents yourselves.
In the middle of this room...
There was a dinner table.
The father would sit here, the mother would sit here.
And I sat right here.
Mom, you look beautiful today!
I always look beautiful!
I-I do?
It's true...
In Kenta may be the mascot, the Noray, who often came to see us.
The Noray was a cat.
Remembering this place in Satoshi said:
"Even though it's fun, it's a place that makes me sad."
Satoshi, we've come to pick you up.
Dad, Mom!
Don't you have any work to do?
No, we've done enough for today.
Let's go to Satoshi's favorite restaurant before we go home, huh?
Yes, great!
I hear your voice on the phone,
it makes me want to cry, but I'm strong...
Even if it hurts, I want to see you.
When did you say we'll be together again?
You can't answer, can you?
I can't hide it, when I remember that face...
I miss...
If I dream the next day,
I want to believe I'll meet you on the road.
If I dream the next day,
I want to look into your eyes.
Because all I see is the sunlight through the trees.
Neyagawa - A few days later
And that's what happened.
Very good job, Heiji.
Heishirou Bizen (34 years old)
Ah, yes...
I wanted to take those two here for pop fritters before they went back to Tokyo.
And I forgot again.
If you bring me here next time, that's fine!
I'll give them a very special treat!
Thank you very much, then!
The Yoshitsune Chronicles.
This book is related to the 7th movie.
Gifts for us?
That's great, Conan.
Is it eel rice?
Of course not.
This is for Mayumi.
This is for you, Kenta.
And this is for you, Mikihiko.
Mayumi?
Kenta?
Mikihiko?
Conan, did anything happen to you in Osaka?
Maybe yes...
