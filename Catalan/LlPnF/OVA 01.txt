Shonen Sunday offers this special.
Tilt the TV with the light on and don't get too close to the screen.
I'm knackered!
Hey, Mitsuhiko, what's this?
What is it?
Don't you remember?
I promised I'd leave you some manga, didn't I?
B-But all this?
It's only twenty-two four volumes anyway!
Only twenty-two four?
Well, you'll get them back to me whenever you want.
Hey, wait!
Ah, yes, when you give them back to me, they don't have to be all at once.
They weigh a lot and it gets heavy.
All right, very well.
It wasn't necessary to take them all, you too.
What's so funny?
Ah, nothing...
Do great detectives read manga, too?
Don't you think it's fun to read a little from time to time?
Yes, I suppose so...
But don't get too enchanted.
Excuse me...
In Conan vs. the Kid and Yaiba The Great Battle for the Sacred Sword
I've finally made it!
Yaiba the Masked III, from the Dreamstation.
In this game you find yourself on a magical island.
And the old witch comes out again?
Let's go to ca in Conan to try it!
What?
In my house?
Why not? Your house is the secret base of operations of the League of Detectives.
Your house is the secret base of operations of the Junior Detective League.
The secret base of operations, huh?
Hey, guys!
Want to know what the future holds for you?
N-No way!
It's the old hag!
Rude!
Although I am a young girl of seventeen.
Oh mother, what's with this outfit?
Akaki Koizumi
Oh, how cool!
The crystal ball floats!
Unbelievable!
I'm sure it's a magic ball.
That's right!
This mystical orb has been handed down in my family from generation to generation.
It can answer any questions you ask it.
Tell me, mystic orb,
is there anything you'd like to say to the boy with the glasses?
Eh, me?
In the place where you will find a tiger, a vulture and a giant frog,
you'll have to be prepared to deal with whatever comes your way.
A tiger?
A vulture?
A giant frog?
Well, if so, you'll have to keep your eyes peeled.
H-He's disappeared.
She sure was an old...
...witch.
What's on your mind, Conan?
That you're worried about the premonition?
No, and now.
More than the premonition, there's something wrong.
Mouri Detective Agency
Here you go.
Thank you.
I'm home!
Good afternoon!
Ran, we have clients?
That's right, we do.
Sorry, guys, but...
Yes, of course.
Come on, you want me to protect this sword
that mentions the warning from the Kaito Kid.
Yes.
Sayaka Mine
Shizuka Mine
You are the famous detective Kogoro Mouri,
I'm sure you'll be able to defeat the Kid.
Oi, mother?
Yes, of course.
Today at 8 o'clock in the evening,
I will visit your honorable home to take the Sacred Sword.
Kaito Kid.
Wow.
Damn, I can't get off track for a second.
In any case, now that I, at Kogoro Mouri, am aware of it,
I will not only protect your precious sword,
you also capture the Kaito Kid!
Great!
We really appreciate it...
Hey, come to think of it, these two...
What do they look like to me?
Cals Mine
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
We don't need your help here.
But if it's the Kaito Kid!
Neither Kid nor stories, your help would be of no use to us!
But...
Get out of here!
Grandmother
We'll protect the sword ourselves.
Very well, then don't come crying to me!
Grandmother!
What are you doing?
Oh, Sayaka.
I was dealing with these three men.
These men?
They're not policemen?
Sayaka, who are the people with you?
Oh, they're Detective Kogoro Mouri and his daughter Ran.
And the Junior Detective League.
I thought we might need them to protect the sword.
Thanks for nothing!
You can all go home.
Grandma, listen to me...
Is everything all right, Inspector Nakamori?
Yes, thank you, I'm just a little embarrassed...
I'm very sorry.
No, it's okay.
This grandma looks tougher than the Kid and everything!
In fact...
What's up with that.
Secure the perimeter of the house!
Shall we go in, Mr. Mouri?
Are you sure?
Yes, it's all right.
Yaiba Kurogane
Tell me, who is this Kaito Kid?
He's nothing but a scandalous thief.
A bad guy?
Pretty much.
Damn him!
Yaiba will give him what he deserves!
All right, do what you can.
Oh, how cute!
What's your name?
Y-Yaiba.
E-Eh!
What's so funny?!
But you don't look anything like Masked Yaiba.
That's right, not at all.
I'm not Yaiba Masked Yaiba, I'm Yaiba Kurogane!
Who is in Yaiba the Masked?
I wonder... where the kids must be?
Ah, I guess they must be playing in the courtyard.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Let's go.
Nice to meet you.
Raizo Mine
Soc in Raizo Mine, the head of this family.
My name is Kogoro Mouri.
This is my daughter, Ran, and Conan, who lives with us.
I was told that my wife and daughter invited her to come.
That's right.
In our family we are all kendo practitioners.
You can imagine that when the KID shows up he'll turn the tables.
In the meantime, you can wait here.
When we've stopped at the Kid's I'll buy him a drink.
What a great idea!
Father...
This yard is really big.
We can play hide and seek.
Ah, look.
What's that?
A cat?
I thought so.
Pussy!
It's coming out!
A-a tiger!
What is it, Gero?
A-a frog!
And a vulture!
Help!
What's that?
Everybody go!
What happened?!
Where's the Kid?!
Where's the Kid?!
Kid!
A tiger...
A vulture...
A giant frog...
It wasn't in the Kid, then?
Hey!
What are you doing?
Kagetora, Shonosuke, Gerozaimon!
Frighten the guests!
Kagetora?
Shonosuke?
Gerozaimon?
They are this child's friends.
Ace, they're just pets.
You scared us by I don't know.
This is the place the premonition was talking about.
But what now?
And what the hell is this feeling?
Coi of little kids and false alarms.
Hey!
"H-Hey?"
And who are you?
I am?
Kenjuro Kurogane!
Kenjuro Kurogane
Would you like to have a drink with me?
Tell me, grandmother.
Where is this sword?
I'm sorry, I have no idea.
But if you don't even know where it is, you won't be able to protect it in Kogoro.
What is this?
Baikal?
When I drank I regained my original form.
I've already told you that we don't need a detective to protect her.
Grandmother, what in this liquor do you use to drink?
Ah, I use it in natural remedies.
Hey, and what can I drink a little?
I have a bit of a cold.
Well, why not?
But just a sip.
Ah, not that...
This is a secret medicine that has been passed down from generation to generation.
It can cure any illness.
Oh, really?
It's true that it doesn't taste very good, but I guarantee it works.
It does.
Drink it all in one gulp.
The body... it burns me...
Maybe I'm about to...
What's wrong?
I don't think I've had enough.
Another one!
Conan, what are you doing?
What does "another one" mean?
Conan...
It's not what you think...
It's unbelievable.
I lose sight of you for a moment and look what happens!
Drinking alcohol!
And you're just a kid!
I tell you it's not what you think!
If you go on like this, you'll end up like the father!
My name is Ko-go-ro!
Ko-go-ro;
go = five
And I am Kenjuro!
Ken-Juu-ro;
Juu = ten
And the two of us together make Jugoro!
Jugo-ro;
game = fifteen
In Kid will arrive in 5 minutes.
Each in his place.
Wonderful, wonderful!
Wow, what a big house!
Well, so it will still be more interesting.
At least for me, in Kaito Kid.
And well, where is that sword?
Too bad, Gero!
And now?
What was that?
Don't make a fuss over nothing!
Go to sleep!
Sorry, Gero.
Well, is this a house of monsters or what?
In any case, I should get to work and leave quickly...
What?
Y-you're in Kaito Kid, right?
Don't get mad,
you'll lose that pretty face of yours, missy.
If you don't mind, I'd like to know where the sword is.
A-A-At the kendo stream.
Thank you, Miss.
Kid...
They have a dojo and everything in this house?
Don't you move!
I won't let you come an inch closer.
Drop this bamboo sword.
A pretty rose is more suitable for a pretty lady.
What a charmer!
Well, madam, if you'll excuse me...
Kid...
Oh Lord, what now?
Stop it, Kaito Kid!
I'll rip you to shreds, you thief!
Come on, another one?
Damn Kid!
How could you mess with my wife and daughter?
Don't move, Kid!
Shit, shit, shit!
You're the brightest star tonight.
Idiot, your charms won't work on my mother.
Kid...
Shit, shit!
With this body I won't be able to get out.
Oh, right, the medicine.
Maybe with it...
It's starting, I can feel it!
Oh Lord, behave yourself, father!
What a hangover I'll have...
Hey Ran, it's been a long time!
How's it going?
Pa-Father?
If father...
There's two of them?
A mustache?
Oh, no!
It's the Kid!
He has disguised himself as me!
What? Where is he?
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
Where's the Kid?
Shit!
Hey, hey, hey!
He's gone over there!
Stop it!
Finally, I'm almost there.
So...
Where did they hide it?
I see you, little swords!
Hey, kid.
Can you give me the Holy Sword?
I was waiting for you, Gaita Kid!
G-Gaita?
My name is Kaito, no hedgehog!
And I call myself Yaiba!
Not bad, Bagpipe Kid.
I told you my name is Kaito.
Thanks for the sword, no hedgehog.
Shit, I have to do something.
Maybe if I pick more...
Where's he gone?
What's the matter, Inspector Nakamori?
You're not...
Heiji!
Yes, I'm Heji... Heiji?!
Stop it, Kid!
You're over there!
So long!
Thanks for the sword.
I must say you're splendid.
You remind me of that other thief, in Jirokichi.
Jirokichi was a sort of Japanese Robin Hood of the 19th century.
XIX
Sorry, jaio.
I'm no vigilante thief.
So long, no hedgehog!
Catch, Yaiba!
What the hell is going on here?
What's all this?
Shit!
And what is this strange and inexplicable feeling I have since this morning?
Could it be what?
Exactly, the kids...
And then...
That's right, the kids...
Now I understand everything!
It's in Yaiba Kurogane!
Now you'll see.
Ready for the attack?
Ready!
Fire!
The spasaaaaaa!
Oh, what fireworks.
Oh, this sword must be...
Yes, it's the Sacred Sword that the Kid wanted to steal.
All his.
Thank you.
What do you say about the Kid?
Well, we could say that Yaiba has taken care of it.
Wow, Yaiba...
Ah, yes.
I haven't asked your name yet.
My name is Shinichi Kudo.
And I'm a detective.
That famous teenage detective?
By the way, a strange feeling surrounded me since this morning.
And I finally understood it all.
First of all, the Detective League.
The Ayumi was wearing a ribbon instead of the ribbon he always wears.
The spot in her hair that on Genta she has on the left side, she had on the right side.
And on Mitsuhiko she did not have the freckles she has always had.
Then, Detective Mouri.
The two strands of hair hanging down her front today were three.
And finally, the Ran,
who doesn't wear her bangs as usual.
Why could that be, all of it?
It's because...
Because...
Conan?
Conan?
Hey, Conan, wake up!
If you don't hurry, you won't be ready when they come looking for you.
See what happens if you stay up so late reading manga?
Then you don't get up on time.
Yes...
Go on, do it the way I have to tidy up the living room table.
I knew it.
I knew it was just a dream.
A dream and quite...
heya no mado no mukou ni Hikouki kumo wo nazotte
I follow the vapor trails from the window of the room.
Kyou kenkashita kimi no koto Bakari kangaeteta
I think of nothing but you, after we've quarreled today
Sasai na koto de tomadotte fuantei de muboubi na
I lose myself in little things, helpless in the face of insecurities
ano koro no you ni Sugus ni denwashite warai aetara ii no no ni su
If I could call you and enough, just like I used to do long ago, we could laugh together and that's it
chikazuite kuru shifuku no toki wa
When true happiness comes to me
Itami wo tomonai Nagara ashi woto wo tateru
The steps of suffering accompany it as well.
kangae sugite Fukami ni hamaru kimi no soba ni iru no ni
I think too much and get trapped, though I'm here by your side.
natsu no Maboroshi
Summer illusions
hitomi tojite ichiban saisho ni kimi wo omoidasu yo
I close my eyes and suddenly think of you
dakedo kimi to ikite yukitai kara
But I want to live with you.
taken nagara demo ii tsunaida té wo hanasanaide su
It's all right, even if we lose each other I won't let go of your hand
