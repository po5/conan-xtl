Caviar, foie gras, oysters!
I can't resist!
Anyway, I guess...
Doctor.
I guess you already know.
Low-calorie M-Food, right?
That's too bad.
Hey, Mitsuhiko, I don't know if I can eat it all.
Don't worry, just think that all this isn't just for you.
Hey, Inspector Shiratori, they call that hours d'oeuvres, right?
Yes, that's right.
Ah yes, Sato.
Since I know you like French cuisine,
I've prepared this appetizer especially for you.
Please.
T-Thank you, it looks great.
What's that?
Ah, nothing.
It does look good, eh?
What do you say, Mouri, some champagne?
Oh, yes, that's very kind, inspector.
Just a moment, dear...
This is not the right glass.
For champagne, it's this one.
From each grain you make a mountain.
I won't be able to drink anything with it.
You can't drink it all in one gulp, like you will.
This one is perfect.
Stubborn, don't meddle where you're not wanted.
Go, go, Mouri.
What fresh air.
And so much.
Are you glad you came, Conan?
Yes!
It seems that we have chosen a perfect day to come to Tokyo.
This is my first time in Karuizawa.
And me, me too!
Knowing your family, Sonoko, I wouldn't have been surprised if they had a house too.
Unfortunately, we don't have any in Karuizawa.
We have houses in Hawaii, Nice, Monaco and...
Really?
One day,
Inspector Shiratori invited his friends to a party to inaugurate his country house.
The most interesting part of the party was the inspector's collection of expensive wines.
Tell me, Inspector Shiratori.
Yes?
Where are the wines you were talking about?
Oh, of course.
Well, then, what can I show everyone?
Be careful that the steps are very high.
Here are the toilets.
The one on the right is for the women, and the one on the left is for the men.
And here we have...
This is unbelievable.
All this is the wine cellar?
Wow!
It's as big as ours!
You can tell!
In your house you have a wine cellar, too?
No, that's not it.
The Genta house has a liquor store.
I could sponsor Kojima Liquors!
A-Ah, wow.
W-What's this?
It's a dispenser for special wines made of oak.
This is where I keep my most precious wines.
For example, this one:
A '79 Ch창teau Margaux.
An '85 Ch창teau Lafite.
A '92 Le Pin.
And this is the choice for today.
A 1961 Ch창teau Latour.
Hey, I think it's got something in it.
It does.
It's gone bad?
That's what they call a sediment.
It forms in the wine over the years.
Only old wines have it.
If the precipitation process fails, it can damage half of the wine.
And say, Inspector Shiratori, is this wine good?
Yes.
It cannot be compared with a cheaper one.
When you taste it, you'll notice it right away.
Ooh, really?
Hey, the next tank is empty.
I had a bottle of 1989 Sashikaya here.
Yesterday my sister and her husband drank it.
All right, what?
Shall we go back to the dining room?
Look, Heiji, the floor of this cellar is marble.
Yes, it must have cost an arm and a leg.
Well, everyone has their whims.
I guess you're right.
Well, then, I'll go to the kitchen now and prepare the main course.
It'll be done in an hour.
What's the matter with you?
What's this face?
Ah, well, you see, Inspector Shiratori has a good fortune.
The fortune belongs to his family, not the inspector.
Yes, of course it is.
Come on, you're already a man, don't worry about something like that.
Ah, yes, Mr. Mouri!
About the case the other day...
Yes?
It's precisely because I'm a man that I lose sleep over these things.
I wonder what the rest of the house is like.
Ah yes, we could go exploring.
Yay.
What fun!
Come on, Genta!
Ah, hey, wait.
Come on, run!
I said wait for you!
Hey, why don't we take a walk around the neighborhood?
Of course, but I don't know much about it, this area.
I'll guide you.
You know it?
You know it?
Yes, Shinichi's parents took me once.
Ah, yes, that's right.
All right, let's all go.
Shall we go, Heiji?
Come on, let's go.
I'll stay, I have a little thing to do.
What do you have to do?
What do you have to do?
Just a little thing.
Are you in, Haibara?
I'll pass, but you four shouldn't miss it.
Aix...
It sure is a splendid place!
Yes.
They call this the Whispering Path.
Ah, the Whispering Path, eh?
Go Heiji, whisper something.
Ah, all right.
Stop the ear.
Come on...
You're...
A fool!
You asked for it.
You scoundrel.
This is Kyu-Karuizawa Christian Church.
Apa, a wedding!
How cool!
How romantic.
Hey, Ran.
You're already pictured here with your Kudo, huh?
What are you talking about?
I didn't imagine anything.
You didn't?
What about your dreamy face?
Well, what about you, Kazuha?
What t'empatolles?
Between us we do not do anything you think.
Oh, oh, and what exactly do not do?
Who do you mean by "we"?
XXT!
Do not say it so loud!
Oh, yes.
Here is Kumoba Lake.
I was cycling here with Shinichi from his home by the river.
How wonderful!
It's just like you said!
It is, isn't it?
It seems like it's been so long...
I don't know why, it's only been two or three years.
Kudo!
What's wrong, Heiji?
Did you get anything in your eye?
Ah, yes.
Come on, let's walk some more!
There's an island called Waterbird Island, this way.
Hey, Kazuha.
Say.
Let's go back.
What's up?
Why are we going back?
Not at all, we're going back and that's it.
Damn it.
Hey, Heiji, wait.
Ah, a swan.
Yes.
Get out of here!
Ah, shit!
Forty to zero.
Hey, and we can't use our feet?
Of course not, this isn't soccer!
Hey, Shinichi!
Where are we going, are you in such a hurry?
Just follow me and you'll see!
Oh, Mother.
It's so quiet here.
yes
Where have Hattori and the Kazuha gone to?
I don't see them.
Did they come back without us?
Oh, this Hattori.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Today's main course is ready.
I'm starving!
It looks great!
Of course it does!
What dish is this?
Roasted lamb ribs.
Ninzaburo style.
Who is this?
Did you make this, too, Shiratori?
Yes, cooking is one of my passions.
Not bad!
Series a good son-in-law.
Come on, let's go!
And now.
Come on, I'll go get the wine.
Here we are.
Ah, well returned, Ran!
Ah, so you two were already back.
I'm sorry, Heiji suddenly told me he wanted to come back.
Aren't you all right, Heiji?
Ah, yes, I'm fine now.
Sonoko, what are you looking at?
Nothing in particular.
About it, Ran, is it all right to leave it at that?
Father!
Oh, my lord.
Come on, don't worry.
You must be tired from driving all this way.
What a mess!
My Ch창teau Latour...
It's broken!
What's that?
It's terrible.
Shiratori, what was this wine worth?
To get a wine like this, nowadays, it would surely cost a few million.
One million yen is a little over 8200 euros.
A-A few million?
What a mess!
So someone must have fallen for it.
Or maybe someone broke it on purpose;
one of two things.
Dumb.
That's pretty obvious.
Oh, I suppose it is.
But who could have done it?
The problem is that it's unlikely to have been someone from the outside.
Common sense tells us it must be one of us.
In any case, we discuss this in the dining room, we don't stay here.
All right, I'll come back later.
All right, I'll come back later to clean it up.
Hey, did you find it?
No, I can't find it.
Uh, what are you guys looking for?
Uh, nothing.
We're not doing anything.
Come on, let's go back upstairs!
Ah, yes!
For all we know,
it had to happen after visiting the cellar,
and before Shiratori came back down,
the case had to take place at this time.
The "case"?
But Sato...
Of it, during this time, someone has gone down to the cellar?
Y-You guys?
We were exploring the house.
And we went back down to the cellar.
But we didn't touch it, the bottle!
You sure you didn't?
Don't be childish.
Come to think of it, what about you?
Are you sure that while you were half toasted
you didn't end up in the cellar after going to the bathroom and broke the bottle?
Come on!
How do you want me to...
Father?
In fact, I don't remember anything other than going to the toilet.
And doesn't that make you the prime suspect?
What's that?
Calm down, calm down.
Lots of people have been to the toilet.
Myself, for example...
Maybe you broke it because you were jealous, Takagi?
How do you want me to do it, something like that?
Really?
We could also talk about the possibility that you broke it yourself.
Wh-what nonsense!
Come on, stop it, both of you.
That's right, a little sanity.
What's the matter, Heiji?
You've been quiet for a while.
That's not like you.
There's nothing wrong with me.
I was just thinking.
Have you noticed anything?
Nothing at all.
But there's someone here who's hiding one by pretending to be normal.
Is she?
But where could she be?
I told you, someone has taken it and eaten it.
Come on, that's what you would have done.
Hey, guys.
You're hiding something from me again?
It's nothing important.
Genta just had grapes fall in the cellar,
and it rolled under a shelf.
But we looked at it before and it was gone.
Someone must have picked it up and thrown it away.
It was the wind...
So... maybe...
What's this?
This bottle is new!
It's strange, isn't it?
I've already noticed it.
Hattori.
This means...
That's right.
After hearing what that girl said at the end, I understood.
The only person who could have done it is her.
Am I wrong?
That you have the solution to this case?
Really, Hattori?
Yes, the culprit who broke the bottle is...
What's the matter?
What a drag, hurry up and say it.
Oh, sorry, Kud-, oh, no, Conan, you explain it to them.
What is it, Heiji?
Go on, tell us, Conan.
In fact, the culprit is a sleepy rat that has sneaked into the house.
A rat?
Sleepyheads?
You mean these animals that look like mice?
Yes.
What do you mean?
The rat has crept into the house attracted by the sweet smell of wine.
So it went down the stairs.
And at the same time, in Mitsuhiko and the other trekking in the cellar.
And in the end it has entered.
Of course!
The rat must have eaten the grape seed that fell on Genta.
Yes.
Then, when the three of them left, Mr. Mouri came down.
The rat climbed into the dispenser,
and hid in the hole of the missing wine.
Kogoro didn't notice it,
and mistakenly placed the bottle in the empty space where the rat had gone.
Eh?
So...
Exactly, when he left, the rat pushed the wine, which fell and broke.
And as proof...
Here it is.
I found it behind the dispenser cabinet.
Dormouse or sleeping rat
It has gone into hibernation.
What now, father?
He'll have to pay.
I don't think that will be necessary.
Because that wine was not the real thing.
W-wasn't it?
Wasn't it, Heiji?
Ah, yes, the real one...
is here.
It's my Chato Latour!
How can it be?
Sonoko, you don't need to pretend anymore.
Come on, you got me.
The fact is that recently at a family dinner we finished a bottle of the same wine.
So I had the bright idea to change the label with a cheaper Latour that I had brought.
Consider this a little prank.
Oh, Mother.
But Sonoko...
I'm sorry!
Anyway, seeing what happened, it's a good thing you did it.
That's right, thanks to you the wine was saved.
Well, I think we can do a tasting!
Cheers!
So, the case was closed and the party went on merrily.
Except for Kogoro, as the Eri forbade him to drink any more, and...
...on Heiji Hattori.
Hey, Hattori.
What are you doing with a rolled-up sock?
Is it for some reason?
Oh, that?
It's a new fashion in Osaka.
You broke it, the wine, didn't you?
W-W-What do you say, you, now?
Under the enrodillat sock
you have a wine stain from when the bottle was broken.
It's solid proof.
So you knew.
When I went to the bathroom, I wanted to go back to look at the expensive wines.
But once in the dispenser,
It wasn't the same place as before, and it was sticking out.
"How strange," I thought, and when I picked it up....
What a disaster.
The worst mistake of Heiji Hattori's life.
Kudo, I wanted to confess, but...
I know.
The Eri had noticed.
And he said, "This is the perfect opportunity for my drunken husband to control himself, help it along."
He had caught me.
If it was written all over your face.
It was me!
Forget it, this exaggerated honesty of yours makes you special.
The Eri only has Mr. Mouri's best interests at heart.
I won't tell anyone.
I'm ashamed, now I owe you another favor.
No, I just returned you one, as a favor.
Idiot, thanks to you I've been able to feel like I haven't felt for a long time.
But I wouldn't have told you if you hadn't taken it out of my mouth.
Futari dake no toki itsumo Iena kara
When it comes to the two of us, I could never say it.
