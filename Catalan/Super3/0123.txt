DETECTIVE CONAN
"The case of the kidnapping of the weather woman."
Towels...
A little more and we get soaked.
Downpour with thunderstorm.
Just like the weatherwoman's prediction said.
And Mr. Mouri?
He was spending the night out for a job.
There seems to be a message.
Hey, don't touch anything!
(You have a message.
(My name is Aki Asano and I'm from Nichiuri Television.
"I need to consult a matter with Mr. Mouri urgently.
I will call him back later."
-Who is it, the Aki Asano? -It's the weather woman.
She's the one who appears on Nichiuri TV.
And she's also on City News.
She's a beautiful girl, I'm a fan of hers!
What should you want to consult so urgently, Mr. Mouri?
Listen up!
The Junior League of Detectives will help the woman of the time!
Yes!
Come on...
So, you've come all the way here in place of Mr. Kogoro Mouri.
Yes!
You can count on the Junior Detective League!
-Goodness!
Soaping some kids today? -Gee, Tsukumo...
If you also have to buy the kids to get the fame,
you've got a hard time getting on the news.
What a striking make-up!
Why must you wear this nail?
I didn't intend any of this.
Children, be good children.
Try not to disturb her at work.
Caram.
She's very unfriendly!
This lady used to go to City News, didn't she?
Yes, I replaced her almost 6 months ago.
What you wanted to tell Mr. Mouri was about Mrs. Tsukumo?
As a matter of fact... What I had thought is that detective Mouri
could appear in the City News space.
Oops!
What a drag!
I'm glad it wasn't for... (ring)
What's that, what's that ringing?
A pager.
As we were leaving and I didn't know where to, I took it with me.
(ring) -Oh, wow!
How cool! -Mitsuhiko, you had a cell phone, didn't you?
-No.
That was a receiver! -And it broke, didn't it?
-Yes, sacrificed for justice. Oh yeah, it broke?
It's the office phone, it must be the Ran!
Will you give me the number of this pager you have?
So when I want to order a job from you I can get in touch.
What a cane!
Oi, Conan?
It's written here, miss.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'll put "Junior Detective League" in the memory.
That's it, it's in the address book!
Ah, it's one of those that only uses numbers!
I had one too, and we had fun writing messages with numbers.
Messages?
We assimilated the numbers to the alphabet
and we could express messages with word games.
For example, when we wrote 428, we meant Shibuya.
(All) 4-2-8?
Shi-bu-ya!
Shibuya!
Sure!
Since you've come, do you want me to take you for a tour of the studio?
Viva!
It'll be great!
Hold on a second.
Yes, I'm Asano.
What?!
Yes.
Yes, I am.
I'll be right there.
Yes... Okay, I'll be right there.
I'll be right there.
Excuse me.
I have some last-minute work to do and I have to go.
(All) Eh?
It tastes really bad to me.
-Ah, Kobayashi! Yes?
You wanted nothing?
I'd like you to take these guys to Studio A.
-I just had some work come in.
Y-Yes, no problem.
And see that they get a visitor's pass.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
Aw, come on! - (all) Hooray!
(all) Ah!
I'm hungry!
How long do you want to make us wait?
I'm sorry you have to replace her so suddenly.
You say they've threatened her?
(All) Threatened?
These kids distract me, send them away.
Yes.
(All) Understood.
The Aki is a failure: where has it been seen, you run away only to receive threats?!

Let's start the rehearsal!
I'm sorry, it's just that Kazumi hates children.
Excuse me, you said you had threatened Miss Aki, right?
We have come on behalf of Detective Mouri to see Miss Aki.
Aki.
Detective Mouri?
Well...
Miss Aki, since she's been following a corruption case.
Aki, since she's been following a politician's corruption case,
she's been receiving threatening letters and calls.
Today, we received a letter saying that she would be murdered
if she did the program.
So, Aki wanted to ask Kogoro about the threats.
You can watch City News here.
Well, then, see you later.
When Aki's cell phone rang, wasn't it a threatening call?
Of course, and that's why he got scared afterwards.
Aki is not that scared!
Don't you think so too, Conan?
Do you?
Yes.
When Aki was talking on the phone, she didn't look scared.
On the contrary, it was exactly as if she was happy about some special event.
Probably, that call was not a threatening call.
What if that call was made to lure her into a trap?
(Ring) Is it another warning from Ran?
No, it must be from Aki.
Because only Ran and Aki have the number of this pager.
Oh, do they?
(Answering machine) Hello, this is Asano.
I'm not at home at the moment.
Why are you hanging up, Conan?
Wasn't that Miss Aki's phone?
Yes, but I got the answering machine.
If she wasn't there, how come she wanted us to call her at home?
It's strange...
This is 110.1-1-0.
The 110... The police phone!
-Why do they want us, the police? -L'Aki needs us!
I'm sure he's been captured by bad people.
And she wants us to explain it to the police.
But she could have called the police herself.
Maybe in her situation she can't talk.
-It's terrible! -That's what a kidnapping is like.
9109.
This phone number is from our city.
Just because we have these messages,
we can't call the police.
Well, the Junior Detective League will have to take action, won't they?
Yes, but with this message alone we can't know where he is.
-Wow... -You're right.
(TV) "And next, today's sports section.
A match has been played at the National Stadium..."
I like Aki much better.
(Ring)
I got it!
The Deva Guardian Kings.
The Aki is somewhere where the Deva Guardian Kings are!
Come on, if you're going to deduce, you could do it more seriously.
Since 7.20 we do not understand anything of the messages he sends us.
(TV) "And a breaking news.
"Regarding the case of corruption Wangan Holdings,
politicians Maruya and Okubo have been summoned to testify,
suspected of having accepted bribes for large sums."
I know what the Aki's message means!
Really, Mitsuhiko?
It tells us the name of the politician who accepted the bribe.
The zero is 'Maru', the first character that forms the name Maruya.
The zero zero is O, the first character of Okubo.
And the 96 of 096 means black.
So 'In Maruya, black'.
The Aki is telling us that in Maruya is the corrupt one.
So what does 2003 and 5656 mean?
It is the account number they use for the bribe transaction!
They must be holding Aki prisoner in Maruya's house!
We have to go save her!
Maruya's house is a subway stop, at Teitan South.
Let's go, Conan!
Yessss... yes.
It's thunder and lightning today.
Let's run, guys!
Maruya.
Hey, Conan!
Come on, hurry!
Conan!
Watch out for anyone coming!
Mitsuhiko, hurry up!
Get out of here!
What the hell are you devil's children doing here!
Come down here at once!
Excuse me, sir!
What a nerve, you must have run away and abandoned me!
We'll have to do something about those guards and those dogs.
You're the one who has run the farthest!
Stop it!
(Ring)
(All three) Is it Aki? No.
It's Ran.
I'm going to do a trick on her.
Vaja...
It's raining again.
Hello, Ran.
What do you want? Conaaan!
Where have you been?
You totally missed my message this afternoon!
I'm sorry about that.
I'll be right home.
Hurry up!
Gee, here where you're trona? Yes.
It's raining and thundering very hard.
Well, it's nice weather here.
The moon is very beautiful.

It's pouring here.
I won't be able to come back for a while.
Conan, where are you?
If you want, I'll come and get you...
The moon?
What's the matter, Conan?
Can you feel me, Conan?
What's wrong?
That you feel me?
(TV) "And now, tomorrow's weather.
"In the northern Kanto region the situation will remain stable,
and in the north of Kansai, precipitation will fall.
South of Kanto is likely to be sunny in many places..."
Guys.
We're back on TV!
Hurry up! Wait a minute!
Tell us what's going on, Conan.
Okay? (laughs)
See reading in 2003 vertically.
Vertically?
MOON.
I can see it!
How cool!
What does this mean?
In English, Moon means moon!
Look at her.
The Aki first sent this message to 2003
because he wanted us to look at the sky.
The time the message appeared was 7:20.
At that time, the moon had risen in the southeast.
From Maruya's house we could not see the moon
because in the southeast direction there was a building.
Thus, the Aki was not at Maruya's house, the corrupt one.
Exactly.
They have the Aki imprisoned in a place from which the moon is visible!
But only by the moon we can't know where it is.
Exactly, that's why the Aki has been sending us in figures
the weather changes in the place where it is.
0 is one circle, good temp.
00 is two circles, cloud.
096 means it's a black circle, which is the rain code.
And what would that be, 5656 at 08:31?
See to imitate the sound that thunder makes in words.
(All) Goro, goro.
(All) Goro, goro.
5656 in Japanese... the sound of thunder!
So, in the place where they have the Aki prisoner it was raining
and a thunderclap sounded at 8:30.
The places where it was raining at 8.30 in the evening?
Taking the TV as the center,
it extended in a radius of one km around in our region.
It was a transient rain.
Thank you.
As it was thought in Conan, the Aki must be very close to where we are now.
Yes.
(Ring)
0109... (Ring) What's wrong?
01 was code for serene sky, right?
No, it's still cloudy.
I'm sure it has a different meaning.
0109 sure means:
"I'd like to eat a nice plate of rice and meat."
-L'Aki will be very eager. You must say this for yourself.
I'm starving...
You can't joke about these things, Conan!
No, sorry, it's not that.
Genta, you're a genius.
Thanks to you I found out where the Aki is, my friend!
(The warehouse, you say?
Yes.
We got lost when we were going with Aki.
It's the room in the north, on the second floor.
Thank you.
Wait, wait, wait!
The Aki is the storage room!
0-1-0-9 is read, just as you said in Genta, 0-10-9.
O-do-gu...
Ma-gato-mos.
The warehouse!
Many rooms must not be entered by anyone.
If the kidnapper is related to television, it is the only way out.
Have you found out who the kidnapper is?
Yes, because Aki has made it clear to us.
The game is over!
-Don't look to run away! -We already know everything!
You must surrender!
You asked Aki to meet you on the phone,
you lulled him to sleep using some drug, you locked him up
and made believe that he had fled in fear because of the threats.
You wanted Aki to be kicked out of the city!
Aki has been describing with his cell phone the weather changes he saw,
and sent them to my pager.
Except for one.
Of all the messages, only one we could not decipher.
9109.
These numbers were followed by a message 110,
which wanted us to contact the police.
As they did not tell us where the Aki was located, it could only be....
the name of the hijacker!
You will not run away!
You can't run away from the Junior Detective League!
Of course you won't!
Aki, you have to be okay!
9109 reads like this: 9-10-9.
If we reread it according to a character transcription...
we'll get... Tsu-ku-mo.
It's you, isn't it?
Miss Kazumi Tsukumo.
Come out on me!
My hatred was stronger than me.
Because City News is my project.
A program that I had created from its origin.
That only to have a slightly younger and prettier girl come in to work,

replace me with her...
No way!
She should have regained her position by proving her worth.
Crime can never be a legitimate way out of any problem.

"DETECTIVE CONAN"
So much for the noon weather forecast.
(Man) All right, let's turn it off!
Thanks for waiting!
Thank you for everything you did yesterday.
It was very difficult to understand my messages.
You are a fantastic Junior Detective League!
(All) Thank you.
You also knew your kidnapper.
I saw that the kidnapper's fingernail was very striking.
(All) Of course!
The fake fingernail!
Because the drawing he wore on the fake nail
looked like a weather map.
So, "Hail" would look good on Genta.
Look at that!
It's true, it fits your image!
Now I'll fix it!
Hey, Genta.
And not only because of the hail...
Oh!
Looks like something from the scared one!
Who the hell is it, that one?
The long-haired man?
What's he doing here?
Wait a minute...
And the next chapter:
"The Sniper Murder Case."
(part 1)
The clue to the next Conan is: a spotlight!
In the next one, an original story.
What do you mean, original?
