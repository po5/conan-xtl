Destiny is a test for deductions.
It is a light that sheds light on the most mysterious cases.
Today's episode takes place on the beach of Shirahama.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is Detective Conan!
Something 's just not right!

THE MYSTERIOUS JOURNEY ON THE SOUTHERN BEACH OF Kishua, (PART ONE)
Here you go.
Thank you.
Father, let's look at the souvenirs in the waiting room.
We don't have to look at the souvenirs.
We just got here.
Oh!
What a cutie!
Mite'ls, Mite'ls!
It's the plum man, Father!
Kishu is very famous for the pile of things they do with plums!
What do you find, as a buffoon, a guy with a plum face?
(Think) "Of course!"
(Kogoro) Where shall we go first?
Look, here.
(Kogoro) Eh?
Who the heck is he, this guy in the picture?
Father, it's Kumagusu Minakata.
We're going to the center named after him.
He's a famous scientist known all over the world.
He has done important research in the world of plants and fungi.
Ah, there are important researchers in this world?
"It would be better if you studied, before coming on a trip."
Family, why don't you stop to eat at my restaurant?
We have great lobsters!
Father, what do you think?
It's still a little early.
We'll start by visiting the Minakata Center.
"Can't we go this way?"
Conan, it's this way!
Yes!
Oh!
That's right.
The sand is fine and white!
What makes it so white?
It's because 90% of the sand is quartz silicate.
What the hell... This kid knows the most trivial things.
(Girl) I want to take some sand!
(Girl) Please.
We'll take a little piece of this sandy world in a jar!
What childish tastes you have, girl.
Earlier you also looked at a strange key ring at the station.
The one with the plum face!
Oh...
But it's so cute!
Hmm.
The only ones who go after these things are the creatures!
(thinks) "The creatures?"
Excuse me.
Are you Mr. Mouri?
Uh, yes.
I knew it!
I'm a big fan of yours!
What a thrill!
Let me take a picture of you!
Kota, you've never met him before?
(Think) "Ooooh, what a hottie!"
He's that famous detective everyone's talking about!
In Kogoro Mouri!
-What?!
-Oh!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ran, take a picture of us together, please!
Heavy.
Ready?
Hey, did you come to investigate some case or something?
No, I'm here for sightseeing.
Won the lottery trip to the shopping avenue.
Don't be impertinent!
(All: laugh)
You are all students?
Yes, from Naniwa Medical University.
Oh, so all of you are future doctors!
Yes, now we will introduce ourselves.
Next to you has our queen!
The Maki Shinjo!
Kota, don't be a ball.
Next, at Tatsuhiko Yura, the gigolo.
The Madoka Mitsui, our Madonna.
Nice to meet you.
And Kanako Miyahara, the child prodigy!
Nice to meet you.
I am Kota Fuji, the pierrot of the group!
These 3 entered an art club,
and Maki suggested we come here to sketch from life.
I'd say it's just a hobby for the little rich girl.
And I am grateful.
The hotel, train tickets and car rental was paid for by her.
Yura!
It's not nice, you talking like that!
What's wrong with that?
I broke up with her because these things piss me off!
She spends thousands of yen a month on makeup alone.
When a new one comes out, she has it shipped from Paris.
Madoka and I don't have any money,
but she doesn't look down on me!
That I'm childish is the fly in the ointment's ointment.
What are you complaining about, then?
You're lucky you traded me in for such a pretty girl.
(thinks) "But, please..."
Mm?
I'm thirsty.

Kanako, go buy something.
-I don't want to!
-Hey?
Why don't you go?!
I'm sick of doing what you tell me to do!
Kanako...
When we were in high school you helped me to study mathematics,
and thanks to that I was able to enter the university.
And I am very grateful to you!
But that doesn't mean you always have to order me around!
I never wanted to order you around.
Let her be, okay?
Since we've come on a trip, let's have some fun.
If you'd like some refreshment, I'll...
That's all right.
From now on, maybe I'll order things from Kota.
I wonder who it was...
I helped when he fainted during dissection practice.
Gee, don't tell me this really happened to you.
(laughs)
Don't be mean, Maki!
You promised me you wouldn't tell.
Well, I'm going to look for him now, wait for me here.
Mr. Mouri, do you have plans, for later?
Eh, well...
Now we were going to Shirahama Energy World.
Then we're going to see the underwater observation tower.
We'll take a walk around Sandanbeki and finish by watching the sunset.
And tomorrow?
We will go to the Adventure World in the morning.
Maki, maybe you want to come with us?
No thanks, we have other plans.
-Ah, where are you staying?
-We are staying at the Shinyuzaki Hotel.
Oh, well...
Hey, father, we have to leave.
Yes, that's right... Well, we'll leave you here.
Have a good trip.
Have a lot of fun!
I can't tell if this group are good friends or if they can't stand each other.
When you're young, there's always a lot going on.
Oh!
It's unbelievable!
This cliff looks like a screen!
We can go to that side.
I'm not going!
I'm not going!
Then why don't we go see the caves?
We can go with an elevator.
And then we'll see the sunset at Senjujiki, right?
Yes!
I'm sure it's very beautiful!
Caram.
It's an incomparable view!
I'm glad I came.
Yes, it was worth coming just to see this sunset.
Mr. Mouri!
Maki ?!
You also came to see the sunset?
Yes, because I hadn't seen it and I've heard a lot about it.
By the way, do you like sake?
Yes!
I like it moltííííssim!
How would you like to spend some time tomorrow at Toretore market
before you go to the Adventure World?
The Toretore market?
In addition to fresh fish,
there are excellent sakes with designation of origin.
Mmm!
With denomination of origin?
Look, here is the exact address.
And the timetable of the bus service.
There is a bus stop near the Toretore market.
It's bus terminal one.
There is no bus that goes directly to Adventure World,
but once you get down to Shirahama, it won't take long to get there.
You have been very kind!
I'll be sure to come!
Goodbye.
Goodbye, thank you for the trouble you have taken.
Thank you very much!
It seemed to me that Maki has come all the way here expressly
just to give us the market information.
I guess she's a nice person.
The bus that goes to Adventure World is number 3.
The next bus leaves at 1/4 of 11.
Still 20 minutes to go.
Shall we go for a ride here?
Conan, what's up?
What's the matter?
I had the feeling someone was staring at us.
I must have guessed.
If you want it so badly, why don't you buy it now?
I don't need to.
Let's go look in the souvenir store across the street.
Come on, Conan.
Come on, it won't be long now.
We should go through.
Can I go to the station store for a second?
Eh?
Come on, we have little time, hurry up!
"He's going to buy it in the end. Eh?!"
"Again... It's like someone's watching us."
This, please. (Woman) Yes.
Hey, hurry up!
The bus is coming!
(Woman) "Eh? There's only one left?"
"In addition to Ran, someone else has also bought it."
Thank you very much.
Hey, Maki!
Makiiiiii!
Ah, hello...
Hey...
Watch out for the car!
Conan, this is the bus going to Sandanbeki!
(Girl) This is awesome!
Conan, wave to him, man.
It is not necessary, I...
He's just a kid and he's embarrassed.
Is that you, Mr. Mouri?

I didn't think we would meet again.
-Ah, you are... -In Kota.
In Kota Fuji!
So you've come this way too.
Are you with the whole group?
No.
They went out early in the morning to do sketches.
Maki went for a drive until the afternoon.
Oh, did she?
I saw her earlier!
It was just at Shirahama Station!
Really?
Was it really?
Wow...
-Hey, there, it's there!
-Let's see it!
This is a laptop.
Do you always carry it?
Yes, that's why Yura usually calls me "computer sick".
"Eh? What could this be?" (Acoustic signal)
Ah, excuse me...
Yes, hello?
What?!
Tell me more slowly, Madoka!
That Maki is dead?!
What?!
Wait a minute!
Madoka, it's Mouri!
What's wrong?!
Where is she?!
How are you?
"It's in some bushes, at Sandanbeki. He's been stabbed in the chest with a knife."
"Sandanbeki?"
"That suspicious person got on the bus going to Sandanbeki."
"Shit."
(Fuji) Now we come to Mr. Mouri!
Did you call the police?
Have you told Yura and Kanako?
Not yet?
OK! (Fuji)
We'll talk to them!
Hey, didn't we just pass the entrance to Sandanbeki?
Madoka's even further.
This way!
-Madoka! -Fuji.
-Madoka!
Where is she, the Maki?
Say! -It's in those bushes.
(At the same time) Oooh!
(Kogoro) A stab in the heart.
No doubt she's dead instantly.
No sign of a struggle nearby.
This looks like a case of robbery with subsequent murder.
"So, it's possible the killer was someone she knew."
"Which is odd..."
"I'd say there was also...
"The key to the rental car."
"The killer took it and fled with the car?"
"But this key ring..."
"How could it be?"
"Work gloves!"
"What was Maki doing, wearing work gloves?"
Child!
I've told you not to shuffle for the crime scene!
Excuse me, man!
We'll wait for the police to come and do the rest of the investigation.
"This sand..."
"Eh?"
"This is..."
Thanks for waiting for us.
Ooura.
From the Wakayama police department.
-Very nice to meet you. Ando.
Shirahama East Police Station.
How do you do?
It is an honor for me to work with the famous Kogoro Mouri.
Please do not be afraid to advise us, if necessary.
(Drains the neck)
Of course, to collaborate with the police is the duty of all citizens!
I will help you as much as I can!
I will now introduce you to the victim's friends.
To begin with, this is Kota Fuji,
who has come with us from the Adventure World.
She is Kanako Miyahara, who has come all the way from Engetsu Island.
The Madoka Mitsui, the one who has found the body.
And Tatsuhiko Yura, who came all the way from Shirarahama.
Miss Madoka Mitsui,
please tell us under what circumstances you found the body.
Well, I heard Beethoven's music.
What?
Beethoven?
I was on top of the cliff of Sandanbeki
and I was starting to make a painting.
"At that moment, a cell phone melody was playing...
"And I went to the bushes where the sound was coming from, and then..."
(Melody: "Symphony number 5")
I didn't know what to do and called Fuji.
It was horrifying.
The Maki's body was spread out near the place where you were.
You didn't realize that the murder was being committed?
It's just that... I was looking the other way,
and the waves were making a very loud noise.
But on the other hand, you did hear the cell phone ringing!
W-well...
It's natural, these kinds of electronic sounds are made...
so that they are easily audible.
Hm... Yes, that's true.
Inspector Ando, give me the autopsy results, please.
Yes.
Death by shock from a stab wound to the heart.
The body does not appear to have been moved after death.
Approximate time of death is between 9:00 and 11:00 am.
Although we can further narrow down
the interval in which the murder may have been committed!
We saw the Maki at Shirahama Station.
It was 10:10 a.m. exactly.

Are you sure, it was 10 and 10?
After he passed us,
he went to his car and left.
We were about to get on the bus to Adventure World,
at 1/4 of 11.
Inspector Ando!
How long does it take to go from Shirahama to Sandanbeki?
Let me think...
We are in tourist season;
so it takes less than 15 minutes.
Let's say it took 14 minutes.
You must have arrived at Sandanbeki at 10:24.
"If he parked close to the crime scene.
"And she walked, she arrived in 2 minutes."
If we assume that she was killed immediately,
the time the crime was committed cannot be earlier than 10:26.
This means that we can delimit the possible interval of the crime
from 10:26 to 11 o'clock.
And an irregular detail,
Maki Shinjo's belongings did not include her wallet.
-The vehicle that the victim was supposedly driving was found near Sanshou Temple,
near Sanshou Temple, 3 kilometers from here.
-They have found a wallet in the water. It's Maki's!
This makes it very clear.
This case is...
Wait, wait, wait!
Did you find the car key?
Yes, it was still in the ignition of the car.
Excuse me, the rental car manager only gave you one key?
I think so...
I don't think they usually give out 2.
(wringing his neck)
This is a case of robbery-homicide!
After stabbing the Maki,
the murderer has stolen the getaway car
and abandoned her near Sanshou Temple.
(He thinks) "No, robbery-homicide is surely a set-up."
"It is possible that he was murdered by a person she knew!"
"In this case, the murderer is one of them."
The problem is you, Mr. Fuji!
The Maki has seen you there when you and Madoka were together.
And you've decided to shut her up!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...!
Shirahama sur...
(Kogoro voice) It's pretty clear that only you could have done it!
And the next Conan:
"The Mysterious Journey on the Southern Beach of Kishu, (Part 2)."
("Always")

(Heart) Always give my life!
Always give my life to you!
Always give my life!
Always give my love to you!
