DETECTIVE CONAN
The mystery of Jinnai, the god of death.
Kenzo Kuroda, corrupt lawyer!
I've come for you to accompany you to hell!
No... No!
Help me!
Your time has come!
(Snoring)
(Thinking) "We've been here 5 minutes and he's already asleep."
Too bad, father.
We come to the premiere and you've fallen asleep.
I spent the whole night with a client.
And you've been drinking too, haven't you?
The movie wasn't very good.
What did you say?
I liked it.
It's getting a little repetitive, this series.
In Hayato Nanjo!
He plays Jinnai.
(Woman) Excuse me, sir.
Aren't you the famous Kogoro Mouri?
Of course I am.
Of course I am!
I am the famous Kogoro Mouri, at your service.
How do you do?
I am Hayato Nanjo's wife.
Nice to meet you.
A very good movie.
(Think) "What a face."
I'd like to tell you about a problem we have.
It's here, Mr. Mouri.
What a nice office you have!
It's no big deal.
We've had a hard time finding a place.
-Would you like some tea? -Satomi, Kogoro Mouri, detective. -Satomi, Kogoro Mouri, detective.
I'm Satomi Yoshino, the manager at Hayato Nanjo.
Satomi, show Mr. Mouri.
-But Miyuki... -Don't suffer.
Let me see.
Understood.
Gee, what is this?
"Tonight I will come to take me to Hayato Nanjo."
"Jinnai, god of death."
(Think) "A notice from Jinnai?"
I found it this morning in the mailbox.
-Have you reported it to the police? -No, because...
Because it's not necessary.
It's someone who jokes.
-But, listen... -Yes, I know.
I told you not to do anything!
I think you'll have to leave.
But, Mr. Nanjo, your wife is very worried.
Yeah, but even if the note was real, I can take care of myself.
Yes, but still...
Besides, I've got a lot of work to do now!
Please leave!
Satomi, you can fold now.
Thank you very much.
Behind me is the office where Hayato Nanjo has an office.
This actor has received a death threat from Jinnai.
The dilemma is whether he will appear in Jinnai, the god of death.
He has also come to solve this mysterious case
Kogoro Mouri, the famous private detective.
Hello!
I'm Kogoro Mouri, the famous detective!
(Think) "How ridiculous."
Perfect!
We've got it!
All right, we cut here.
Don't suffer, madam, if we are all here,
the author of the threat won't be able to do anything.
It's too risky.
Au, Mr. Mouri, don't be so dramatic.
Mouri, don't be so dramatic.
In Jinnai, he won't show up.
What do you mean?
I'm sure you want to advertise in Hayato Nanjo.
How dare you!
You big shot!
Calm down, Mrs. Nanjo.
I'm going to buy something to drink.
Come on, Conan! Yes.
Hey, look.
Isn't that Miss Yoshino, the manager?
Yes.
She didn't leave after all...
What's she doing?
She has a perfect view of the office.
She must be worried too.
Let's go, Conan.
It's getting late, and Mr. Nanjo is alone.
(Where is he, the Ohno?
-She's gone to the washroom. Have you let her go alone?
I'll go get her.
(Man) Eh?
What's the matter?
That's...
The god of death!
The camera!
Give me the camera.
Get down from here!
Damn, he's escaped!
Kogoro!
Mr. Nanjo!
Oh, shit!
Miss Yoshino, what's wrong?
I saw Jinnai enter the building where we have the office!
What's he saying now?! (Gunshot)
Let's run!
No, Conan!
But...
Conan, look at that figure!
The suspect is the seventh floor and I just saw him!
Okay, okay, okay!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Where the hell did it come from, this tape?
(Think) "Duct tape?"
(I scream)
The mysterious killer has disappeared from the crime scene, Kogoro?
That's right, Inspector Megure.

We were told that the windows were closed.
To get down to the lobby from the seventh floor
you have to go by elevator or fire escape.
We haven't seen Mr. Nanjo's killer anywhere.
Are you sure no one has left this block?
The reporters and I haven't moved from the front of the building.
What about the fire exit?
Inspector...
The fire escape leads to the first floor.
There's only one door there, to get out of the office building.
I didn't see anyone go down the fire escape.
It's as if the killer has vanished.
Hey, what's the matter, Conan?
There's something I don't understand.
When the lights went on in the room,
the killer was on the side of this window.
But the switch is next to the door.
How did the killer turn on the lights? Yes, it is strange.
Why should the murderer have turned on the lights after the murder?
And why...?
Caram.
Why would the murderer have left the tape?
Surely, he must have left it for us to entrebanqu√©ssim,
so he'd have more time to get away.
But only Mr. Mouri has been hindered!
"They ask him to revise the article."
(Think) "2/4 of 11, shortly before Mr. Nanjo was killed."
"It's the time in Jinnai has appeared, but..."
Ouch!
Don't touch the evidence!
This is for the interview we were supposed to do next week.
It's the fax Mr. Nanjo was waiting for.
Nanjo was waiting for.
Let me go!
We found this suspect hanging around here.
What do you think you are?
I'm not a suspect!
Where have you been all this time?
When I came out of the washroom I went to look for you in the park.
You killed my husband!
And now, what the hell are you doing?!
You're the only one who doesn't have an alibi, Mr. Ohno.
I resented him for that accident three years ago.
Don't talk nonsense.
What happened, 3 years ago?
I work directing TV shows now,
but I used to be a film director.
Until there was an accident
when we were shooting Jinnai, 3 years ago.
"One day, the stuntman didn't show up for the shoot."
We'll do it without the stuntman.
Don't talk nonsense, Hayato.
It's dangerous.
You could do it.
Oi, Hiroyuki?
If you want to be a big star, you should do these things.
Eh?
Yes!
Director, I'll do it.
But...
"As in Hiroyuki agreed to do it,
Hayato half-forced us to shoot that scene."
"But the car overturned and ignited."
"In Hiroyuki he died."
"They held me responsible and sent me away."
Since that damn day, I haven't directed any more films.
I first blamed it on Hayato Nanjo,
but there's one person who can hate him much more.
Miss Satomi was Hiroyuki's girlfriend.
Is it true that you are...?
Yes, in Hiroyuki Kitano was my boyfriend, Miyuki.
We were from the same agency.
I was an unknown actress.
It was an accident.
But I never hated in Hayato because in Hiroyuki he killed himself.
Satomi was with us when Mr. Nanjo was killed.
Wow!
It's true.
Now I remember!
In the park, we filmed in Jinnai!
Maybe we watched it.
-There is a video at the sixth floor -I will prepare it.
(Think) "Why did he come to the park for us to watch, the killer?"
"And the figure in the window?"
(Shot)
On the floor below!
Shit, come on!
Down the stairs!
In Jinnai!
(Think) "What did he say?!" What?!
When he got out of the elevator, the fire door was open,
and Jinnai came out of the office, shot him,
and fled into the street.
Yes, exactly.
(He thinks) "That's strange,
it's been an hour since Mr. Nanjo was killed."
"Does this mean that the murderer has been hiding in this building?"
"And why did he shoot, the murderer?"
"It would have been easier to run away than to risk firing a shot."
Inspector...
Look, we're done here. Thank you very much.
Have you found the mystery bullet?
No, it must have gone into the fire escape.
"Eh?"
Well, it'll be hard to find.
Now we're ready to watch the video.
All right... let's get started.
"Eh? What's this one doing out here?"

"It's still hot."
"And they haven't rewound it."
"And if it was...!"
You shouldn't touch things.
Excuse me...
(thinks) "I knew it. I should have figured it out before."
"But I lack proof."
"Sure, I have the fax!"
Oh... Hey, Conan, where are you going?!
"I thought so. You bet! I know who killed him!"
Hey, Conan!
Stop stirring!
Look at this, Kogoro.
Look at this!
What's this?
What's this?
But it's the fax from before.
What do you want to say?
(Phone)
Yes, you say?
Yes.
Inspector.
Mr. Mouri.
Ah, thank you.
Hello.
Tell me, Kogoro.
Have you solved it yet?
(Kogoro voice) The killer hasn't disappeared from the scene,
because it has not been.
What t'empatolles?
What do you mean?
That Mr. Nanjo was already dead
when we arrived at the office building.
But you saw the killer in the window of the seventh floor.
It was a set-up made by the killer.
A set-up? That's right, Inspector Megure.
I'll prove it to you.
Please go up to the seventh floor.
Take some duct tape and fishing line.
Duct tape and fishing line?
I think we're all here, let's get started.
The killer has turned off the lights after killing Mr. Nanjo.
Then he stuck the vinyl tape on the glass in a zigzag pattern,
so that it looked like a human figure.
Next, he tied the fishing line to the box on top of the elevator.
Then he pulled the fishing line into the office,
made a baga and put it on the switch.
He pulled it to the window and attached it to the tape reel.
From this point on, everything went by itself.
All he needed to do was to bring the elevator down.
And from the outside, with the light inside, the figure looks like a real person.
And when the thread is pulled tighter, the tape comes unstuck
and the figure seems to bend down.
If you pull it tighter,
the spool jams with the elevator door,
the tape jumps and leaves the reel behind.
And the gunshot?
The noise came from a cassette tape.
A cassette tape?
The killer has used a silencer for the murder.
When he's finished assembling the elevator,
he played the tape with the shot on the stereo.
From the street, it is impossible to distinguish which floor the shot came from.
The murderer left about 15 minutes of the tape blank and took advantage of them to get dressed.
and took advantage of it to dress up as Jinnai,
go to the park and make us go to the front of the building.
Then he joined us,
we heard the gunshot and he had an alibi.
Wait a minute!
So the killer is...
Yes, the only person capable of setting up this setup...
is Satomi Yoshino!
It was you!
Then what was the function of the second shot?
That second shot was not foreseen.
She didn't realize that the equipment was programmed
for the tape to rotate automatically.
She used a 60-minute tape
and after an hour, you heard the shot again.
You said you were going to prepare the video,
but you went to pick up the fishing line.
Suddenly the shot rang out.
You were taken by surprise and ran to get the tape.
You have no proof!
Yes, I have proof.
Inspector, check the fax machine in the office, please.
Got it.
There should be a bloodstained page.
The fax arrived when Miss Satomi was killing in Hayato.
I got it.
The bloodstained page gives us the actual time of the crime.
59 minutes past 9:00.
We heard the shot from outside about 1/4 of 11,
15 minutes after the murder.
The feature was the tape that the Satomi has taken from Conan.
And besides, Jinnai's agile movements give her away,
because an actress like you is capable of doing that.
You are right.
I have killed Hayato Nanjo.
I've taken revenge because he killed Hiroyuki 3 years ago!
Satomi, that was an accident.
I thought so, too, at first.
But then I found out that the week before
he'd been offered the role of Jinnai, instead of Nanjo.
I became Nanjo's manager to find out the truth.
And a month ago, one day when I was drunk,
en Nanjo told me.
Satomi, do you remember 3 years ago,
when a young actor was killed while Jinnai?
Yes, they say the accident happened because the stuntman was not there.
Accident... He-he-he...
Accident...

I'm going to tell you a secret:
I told a lie to the stuntman
so he wouldn't show up at the shoot that day.
That beginner was about to steal my starring role!
Do you know what this is?
No.
What is it?
My amulet.
The screw on the piece that holds the front wheels!
This means that...
That's right!
That accident didn't happen by chance.
In Nanjo killed Hiroyuki!
I sent you the anonymous letter because I wanted the press to be my alibi.
When I told him it would be publicity, he agreed to it in Nanjo.
Everything went just as he said.

DETECTIVE CONAN
Jinnai, god of death, against the famous Kogoro Mouri.
In Jinnai has suffered a great defeat.
Of course!
The word "unsolvable" does not exist in my dictionary.
(He thinks) "You should thank me."
We'll have to break down the door!
(At the same time) What? What?
(At the same time) nothing has been found to the objects of the suspects?
(thinks) "Now I get it!"
"The victim was alone in the office,
but the murderer has been able to poison her!"
"It looks like he has done magic!"
In the next episode...
The case of the murder of the president of the finance company
