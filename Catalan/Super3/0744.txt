How nice!
Strike!
-Yes, well done.
-Good bowling, Ran.
Pity about the tennis, but bowling is fun too.
"There are those who are angry that they can't see girls in miniskirts
and now they drink to forget."
Hm.
Come on, now it's your turn, Conan.
-Come on, you'll do great. -Come on, you'll do great.
-Come on, cheer up, Conan. -Come on, Conan.
-Hey? -Hey...
-Hey...
And who is this guy you said you want to introduce me to?
Ah, he's a guy I've been waiting for almost 4 hours...
on the tennis court in the rain.
I guess he's gone to change his clothes and he'll be back soon.
Come on, let's go.
Don't make me suffer any more and tell me who he is at once.
I came here on a motorcycle in the rain, eh?
Eh?
Who are you?
I see you want a war, don't you?
- "He dodged me?"
- "Jeet kune do."
How interesting!
But I'm gonna rip you to shreds, man.
Hm!
"The sun warms with a dazzling radiance."
"A show of deductions that engages."
"The boy that Sonoko likes shows up...
and a tense bowling situation ensues."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a kid, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"In Makoto Kyogoku, suspect? (Part one)"
Ah... How interesting!
But I'll smash you to smithereens, man.
Eh?
Ah.
Wait, Masumi.
That's him.
Turns out he's the guy Sonoko wanted to introduce you to.
What?
He-he!
He's my friend, Makoto Kyogoku.
This is my classmate, Masumi Sera.
Ah.
But she's... but she's a girl?
I'm sorry.
I thought you were a pain in the ass who was angry at Sonoko.
Don't worry, it's okay.
I'm used to it.
They always mistake me for a boy.
Sonoko, why didn't you tell them right away?
Gee, I just wanted to see how hard he softened up,
it was funny.
Yes?
Makoto...
It has, the glasses.
What if they were made wrong?
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry...
In fact, I would have liked to fight me a good time.
Oh.
Jeet kune do... Wow, who taught you?
Well, my older brother.
But he was very tall, almost three as tall as me.
What's that?
One question...
If I'm not mistaken, you said your brother was dead.
Yes, that's what I was told.
But, I don't understand,
because the other day I felt you were talking on the phone, right?
Ah.
So you felt the conversation, huh?
I have another one, my brother, the one in the middle.
There were three of us.
He's the best.
He doesn't look anything like me, and he doesn't look like the brother who died, either.
He's more like our father in every way.
Physically, too.
And it's clear that now he has a very important job
and he can't explain to me where he is or what he does,
but he helps me make deductions by phone and text messages.
In the latter case,
he made me see that the deduction I had made was not correct,
but I remembered that you were there too and caught any mistakes.
What?
No, I wasn't.
But Shinichi sure did.
Eh?
Mm-hm...
"I can't possibly know... that I'm actually Shinichi Kudo."
(Clears throat) By the way, Sonoko,
did these clothes you're wearing get ruined in the wash or what?
What do you mean?
What do you mean by that?
Oh!
Your collar's so stretched out that you can see your bras and everything.
What the...?
It's called a boat neck and it's expressly made that way!
And the bra strap is also expressly shown!
Expressly, you say?
What do you mean, expressly?
That now it's fashionable to show your underwear?
Yes, it is.
You said it yourself.

Come on, let her be, man, she has been arranged like that for you.
Ah...
Now that I look at it, you have blood on your right hand.
Don't tell me you got hurt fighting with Masumi.
No.
I got hurt outside, before I came in.
I'm sorry.
I'm the one from before.
I'm sorry.
I came to ask how you are.
I'm fine.
I just got a scratch on my hand.
And your friend, how is he?
He's fine.
In fact, he brought it on himself.
My friend went with her in the car.
-No.
-Did something happen?
When I went to change my clothes, her friend kept bothering me...
and in the end I had to punch him in the abdomen.
It doesn't look like it, but...
It turns out he's a P.E. teacher.
Normally he's a very formal person,
but Mr.
Tanba transforms when he drinks a little too much.
-I left her sleeping in the car.
-You can tell.
And where is he now?
He was half asleep, but he kept repeating, "When I take it, I'll kill him."
Eh...
-I don't know...
-And now what?
What do you want us to do?
I wanted to ask him to teach me how to play bowling, but now...
(Kogoro) -Huh?
- (Kogoro) Ladies!
Looks like you have a problem.
Hip!
But if you want, I can teach you how to throw the ball accurately.
Hip!
(Kogoro) Eh?
Hey... (Kogoro) Wait a minute, hips.
(Kogoro) Just a moment, hips.
You must put your hips more here.
I got it.
And when you throw the ball, you must rest your weight on your leg.
The ball and the head must be aligned.
-Very good.
Go ahead.
-Okay. -Okay.
-All right. -All right.
Very good.
-Oh, oysters.
That's strong!
That's what I like.
Oh, that's good!
Teaching them to bowl is a great honor in every way,
you are two women of great beauty.
-Ha-ha-ha!
-Ah, thank you...
Ha-ha-ha!
"One of these days, this guy will get arrested for sexual harassment."
Hm!
-Hm?
-Come on, Makoto!
You sure are doing well!
Eh?
"And this one will be arrested for property damage. My goodness."
What a mess!
I'm no good, me, for these aiming games, I already knew it.
Yeah, we've already seen it.
Besides, I just got back from a trip and I'm a little jet-lagged.
Ah, if you want you can sleep for a while in my father's rental car.
Yeah, I think I'll go.
I have the keys.
Here, take the picture.
Uaaah...
Wow, the date with Makoto was a total failure.
Woman, don't suffer.
We'll all go to dinner together later.
Hey, Michiko, where are you going now?
I'm going to see what Mr. Tanba is doing.
-Of course.
-I'm a little worried.
If he's passed the monkey, I'll tell him to come.
What? He's not here?
He's not here?
That Mr. Tanba is not the car?
No, he isn't.
He must have gone out and left, I can't think of anything else.
And why didn't he come bowling with us?
I don't understand.
I have no idea.
Maybe he's fallen asleep somewhere else.
That's impossible.
It hasn't stopped raining the whole time.
Yes, I know, but...
Excuse me... If you're looking for a person, let me do it.
Yes.
The father is a private detective.
Soc Kogoro Mouri.
Hip!
-The famous detective?
-It's Kogoro Mouri?
Mr. Tanba!
Mr. Tanba!
Where did he go?
Mr. Tanba... Is it this way?
Mr. Tanba!
It's nothing at all.
It's not behind any car.
Maybe we can't find him anywhere because he's gone to drink in some bar.
If you're right, he must be bothering someone else by now.
Let's go ahead.
Let's go look for him in the bars.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-Hey? -Yeah.
Hey.
Can you give us a hand?
We should look for it in the bars around here.
How should we look for it?
What?!
Besides, we don't even know what his face looks like.
I have a picture of him.
If you want, I can send it to you right now.
Okay.
Ran, your rental car was parked here too, right?
It was.
Hm.
You mean because of Makoto?
Although, if it had bothered Makoto again,
it wouldn't have taken three seconds for him to disintegrate.
Woman, don't be exaggerated, you, now.

Geez, kid.
There's no way to find him.
We haven't seen him.
And the car hasn't come back.
I called him and, apparently, his cell phone is off.
Hm...
But where has he gone, this man?
(Bubbling)
"Eh? What's this?"
"What's that noise?"
Hm...

I've looked under the cars too,
but it's obviously not in the parking lot.
I know.
We'd better call the police and let them look for him.
Ah!
Aaaah!
-Here-in here.
-What? -What?
What's the matter?
The toilet was free, I opened the door to look, and...
"Conjunctivitis palpebralis, petechiae, frothing at the mouth."
"No swelling of the face and no strangulation marks on the neck."
(Think time) "Drowned!"
"He has no ligature marks at the ankles or wrists."
"And the fact that his clothes are wet indicates that..."
What?
That someone drowned her somewhere else
and then carried her here?
Yes.
And given the skin color and rigor mortis,
I'd estimate she was killed about an hour ago.
Around the time we started looking for him in the surrounding bars and restaurants.
for him in the surrounding bars and restaurants.
And, before we got back to the parking lot,
the killer must have carried the body in the toilet and then fled.
So who could have...?
-It can't be... it can't be...
This professor was a very big man.
She was murdered...
between more than one person,
or else the murderer is a very strong person.
(Makoto) -Huh?
- (Makoto) Sorry.
(Makoto) Eh?
What is it?
Did something happen?
Let's see, the victim is Mr. Masahiro Tanba, 32 years old,
a high school physical education teacher.
And the person who found the body is Miss.
Sunami Masaki,
a science teacher at the same high school.
-Yes.
-Is that correct?
Could you explain to me exactly how you found it, the corpse, please?
Yes, of course.
The thing is, we had a bowling date today with Mr. Tanba,
my partner, Miss Michiko, and me.
But he drank too much beer in the car on the way over here
and got a little aggressive.
He even got into a fight with a boy.
And that's why I went with her in Michiko's car,
to see if there was something wrong with her while she was sleeping.
Did you say "classmate"?
So you're also a teacher at the high school?
That's right.
I'm a math teacher.
That's perfect.
And then?
What happened?
I bowled with Sunami for an hour or so.
and then I went to the car to see what he was doing.
The poor guy had a hard time and I didn't want to leave him alone for too long.
But when I got there, he was gone.
That's why we all went out to look for him immediately.
Who is "everyone"?
Well, "everyone" is... all the people we met at the bowling alley.
Myself.
Soc Kogoro Mouri.
Ah.
Oh, my goodness!
If it isn't Kogoro Mouri!
Yes.
We looked for him all over the parking lot, but we couldn't find him.
And we came to the conclusion that maybe he had gone to drink some more.
We split up
and looked for him in all the bars in the neighborhood for an hour.
As I couldn't find him anywhere, I decided to go back to the parking lot.
I thought that there was a possibility
that he had returned to rest in the car.
And I was right, because, unfortunately, he had returned....,
but in the toilet of the parking lot, in the form of a cold and drowned corpse.
What do you mean?
Drowned?
Is it true?
Yes.
There's nothing definite until an autopsy is performed,
but from the condition of the body, it's more than likely, yes.
What's the approximate time of death?
-Well...
So around 5:00...
-Around 5:00 p.m. -Around 5:00 p.m.
That's about the time we all got out of the parking lot
and started looking for him in the bars.
-But something, let's see.
-Yes.
Why didn't you look inside the toilet as soon as you got out?
Very simple, because there was a padlock.
And there was also a sign that said "out of service" on the door.
A sign?
Are you sure?
You're right.
I saw it too.
But then, when we got back,
someone had torn off the sign and the lock was gone.
And when I opened the toilet door....
(Cries) inside there was... Mr. Tanba.
This means that someone had taken the victim here
from the moment Miss Sunami has left her in the car
until Miss Michiko came back to see what she was doing.
And while Mr.

Mouri, you and the others have gone looking for it in the bars.
have drowned it.
And, before you and the others returned to the parking lot,
you left the body inside the toilet.
Yes.
That's how it went.
You must not know if there's anyone who would want to see him dead, Mr.
Tanba?
I don't know.
But when he got drunk it would change his character
and he'd confront everybody about anything.
He had actually promised both of us that he wouldn't drink the least bit today.
Hm...
Inspector Yamamura, the victim has blue on his abdomen.
What?
A blue?
That's right.
Ah.
This must be my fault.
Eh?
He was really drunk and he provoked me.
And I punched him in the solar plexus.
He provoked you?
He started saying things like, "What are you looking at?"
Yeah.
What a great provocation, eh?
And listen to me:
You went to pick him up with Mr. Mouri and the others?
No, actually I went to sleep for a while in Mr. Mouri's car, which is parked there,
which is parked there.
Eh?
You are under arrest for the murder of Mr. Tanba.
What?
Don't run so fast, Yamamura, don't run so fast.
No one kills someone because they've been told, "What are you looking at?"
People are very angry and sometimes...
But don't you see, Mr. Mouri?
He confessed to the murder thanks to my astuteness as an interrogator.
He had the motive and, on top of that, he has no alibi.
But don't you see, you can't arrest a person just for that?
"It's always the same. What an ass he is!"
But can you know what he says?
Makoto is not the murderer you are looking for!
Eh?
And you can prove it, that the boy is innocent?
Yes.
Of course I can.
Because it turns out that Makoto is...
In Makoto is...?
A good, kind and fantastic person!
Oops, I've already said it.
Do you want me to say it again?!
Aah...
"You don't have any proof of anything."
-Huh?
-Inspector Yamamura, take a look at this.
There are burns on the left shoulder.
It's possible the victim was knocked unconscious with a stun gun.
A taser?
If the killer used a stun gun, I doubt it's him.
Oh, you do?
How do you figure?
One punch in the stomach was enough to knock him unconscious.
and, besides, if he'd punched her again in the same place,
he would have killed her without leaving any new clues.
And if the taser is to leave false clues?
It's hard to believe that a great karateka like him
would go around the world with a taser
to defend himself, frankly.
A-a great karateka, he said?
He has won many trophies in very important championships.
That's true.
He's won 400 fights and hasn't lost a single one.
Huh?
Wow...
Listen to me, and why didn't you tell me from the beginning, this?
"He did. He knew about the red handkerchief case."
Hey, Yamamura, are you sick or what's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What I mean is that you used to talk in a funnier way,
but now I don't even recognize you.
Yes, I used to talk in that way to make people trust me, but now...
Now that I'm an inspector,
it's no longer necessary for me to use such childish vocabulary.
He-he-he!
Yes, that's right.
Well, if it turns out that you were in the parking lot from the beginning,
did you see anyone suspicious?
-Like a souk, eh?
That's funny.
-I'm sorry. -I'm sorry.
I slept like a log.
Oops.
Hey, where are you going?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.
Wow, that went like a hair.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-This part goes downhill a lot. -This part goes downhill a lot.
It's sloping because you can see that the ground has sunk a bit.
They say that next month they're going to start work to fix it.
Ah, wow...
"The ground is sloping..."
"Just a moment."
"If so, the water marks on the wall..."
"That can't be right."
Wow.
It's raining again.
Oh, it's raining.
It's raining.
So let's go bowling, come on, let's go.
We'll continue talking there.
Hey, what's the matter, Conan?
What's up, Conan?
Hurry, let's go inside.
Hm?
Look.
The ventilation grille... It's strange, isn't it?
What's strange, isn't it?
It looks like the rain didn't get it wet.
And the water leaves marks.
Yeah, it's a little sticky.
Maybe there was something stuck to it.
Hey, you guys!
Come on, it better go in.
All right. (chuckles)
Water also leaves these marks on the edges of the door.

It's as if someone had sealed the toilet.
Mr. Tanba didn't suffocate, but he choked on the water, didn't he?
Yes.
But there's no adhesive marks
on the vent at the bottom of the toilet.
Even if the door was sealed, there was air coming in through there.
That's true.
But it smelled kind of funny when we got there.
Yes.
Didn't you notice?
Yes, it was kerosene!
You two!
Didn't you hear what I just said or what?
Yes, I did.
Of course I did.
We're on our way in.

Smoke marks on the ceiling?
And that's why I told you to send your men out
to ask around all the bars and restaurants in the vicinity!
-Oh!
-What?
Makoto, where are you going?
(Kogoro voice) Leave it.
-Hm?
-Hey, big boy.
Help get it all going.
You know how to do it too, don't you?
