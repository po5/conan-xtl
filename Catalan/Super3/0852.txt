to go all 3 of us to visit the Beppu hot springs in Oita."
"But Kogoro's real purpose
was to look for the missing daughter of a very important businessman,

"Luckily, we found the girl,
but when they reached her father, Mr. Nakadai, this morning,
the father's secretary, Mr. Hosogai,
and the girl's fiancé, Mr. Ehari,
something unexpected happened."

-Tell me?
-Mm?
-Yes, to whom am I speaking?
-As you say!
- "I have your daughter, the Manami."
"If you want to see her alive again,
prepare 100 million yen in cash."
What?
Oysters!

Aaaah...!
Ah..., AAAAH...!
Aaaah!
Ah... aaaa...!
(Monkeys: iii)
Hurry up!
Aaaa...!
Aaaah...!
Aaaah...!
(monkeys) Oh!
Aaaah!
Oh!
Aaaah!
Conan!
Are you all right?!
Ah... yes.
Aah!
Ouch...
Mr. Mouri, what is this kidnapping you told me you're investigating?
This morning the daughter
of the president of the Nakadai Electric Company.
The car that was carjacked
was also owned by the Nakadai Electric Company.
Oh, really?
- (Takagi) "It happened 3 weeks ago."
- (wheels: iii)
"It seemed that the culprit knew that there was money inside the vehicle."
"But, with the crash,
the trunk door was deformed and the thief couldn't open it."
"Luckily, he was unable to take the 100 million yen."
The hijacker also asks for 100 million yen,
and asks the president of the same company.
(Shinichi, thinks) "This can't be a coincidence."
"Surely the perpetrator of the two crimes is the same."
-Takagi, say?
- (mobile)
-An unforeseen emergency has arisen.
-Takagi, where are you?
How are you doing?
There has been a kidnapping that might be related to our case.
"Why do you say so?"
The daughter of the president of the Nakadai Electric Company has been kidnapped,
and the kidnapper has fled with the ransom money.
-Huh?
- "Wait."
The culprit has arrived?
Is he here?
-The culprit has just arrived.
Listen to me, Sato, don't move or do anything until he arrives.
I'm coming right away!
Sato?
But...?
Don't move!
Police, Inspector Sato.
You're under arrest for an alleged armed robbery 3 weeks ago.
Ah!
Don't resist!
Oh! (man's voice)
(Man's voice) The one who shouldn't resist is you.
(man) What?!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This... could be...?
Uh..., ah!
Sato!
He's taking my Sato!
What do you want to do to him?
There's no way I can allow it!
Let's follow him!
It's here!
One question.
Are you also involved in the kidnapping case?
Drive and shut up.
Vaaa...!
I can't let it go.
I don't see them.
See where the thief's car is?
No, I don't see it.
I don't know where they've gone!
How do you know?
It's heading north, northeast.
When we got to the sign, turn left.
Gee, how come a kid tells me what to do?
(Shinichi, thinks) "When the drone has dragged me..."
(Conan voice) Wow!
Ah...!

(Shinichi, thinks) "I've stuck a transmitter under the bag."
Oh!
It's Takagi's rental car.
Hang on, Sato, hang on, I'm coming!
-To hell.
-And where are we going, may I ask?
-In the Marine Hell.
-What?
We're going to meet Hiroyuki to split the 100 million,
50 each.
(Sato) "Who is Hiroyuki?"
(Shinichi, think) "In Hiroyuki."
- (Sato) What?
-(Sato) "I don't know, I've never seen him.
He contacted me through a website.
For some reason he wants to take revenge on Nakadai Electric.
(Shinichi, thinks) "He wants revenge?"
(Man) "He got fired when they started using drones."
And the same thing happened to you, didn't it?
You worked at Nakadai Electric until they fired you.
You drive and shut up!
Turn right.
-Oh!
- (wheels: iii)
- (wheels: iii)
-Iaaah!
- (wheels: iii)
-Aaaah...!
Spectacular, the Sato!
What a way to drive, what a mastery!
-Ah!
- (wheels: iii)
What are you doing, Takagi?
Can't you see she's running away, man?!
He won't escape!
(Man) "Go towards the entrance of the shrine."
Walk faster!
You're going like a turtle.
-Is that you, Hiroyuki?
- (footsteps: approaching)
-Photo the field, nano!
-Conan!
What are you doing?
I feel sorry for you, but your plan ends here.
But what do you say?!
You'd better surrender immediately.
-Eh?
-Sato!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Oysters!"
Takagi, don't move, don't come closer!
Everybody freeze.
If you move I'll send everyone to hell.
Eh? (Takagi, thinking)
Ah...
Hurry, look over here!
What's the matter?
I can't see anything!
Ah!
Run, Sato, run away!
Ah...!
Ah..., ah...!
-All right.
-Takagi, emmanilla'l!
The suspect's name is Ryuji Ogikubo.
Former employee of Nakadai Electric Company.
Where is my daughter?
Where is the Manami?
Tell me where she is!
I don't know where she is!
Why don't you ask Hiroyuki?
At Hiroyuki?
(Shinichi, think) "At Hiroyuki..."
-Mm?
What's wrong with him?
Uh, n-no, but we should look for the bag with the ransom money.
(Shinichi, think) "These two cases..."
"Could it be...?"
Oh!
I've already found it.
-What?!
-They're gone!
There's no money!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Sure."
"Now I see it all clear."
I don't understand, what happened?
Tell us where the Manami's ransom money is!
(Conan voice) I start to clarify.
I don't know, I don't know what happened!
I think the Manami right now is with Hiroyuki.
With Hiroyuki?
When the Manami came to Beppu, she wrote that she was going.
So, this morning, when she left the hotel,
she might as well have left a note.
What't'empatolles, now?
I have not seen any.
How do you want him to have left a note, if he has been kidnapped?
Perhaps in Hiroyuki had already warned this man and had told him
that if he found any note, make it disappear.
Yes, it is true.
I found the girl's note and put it in my pocket.
-Is it in this pocket?
-What does it say?
It's true!
This note confirms that Manami was not kidnapped.
-You're not sure of what you're saying?
-Eh?
Hiroyuki, can I uncover my eyes, can I take off the blindfold?
Yes, go ahead.
Oh!
Oysters, oysters!
Did you do it?
Yes.
It says Manami.
Why didn't you tell me anything until now?
What's it like?
The photo I sent you was an invitation.
It was supposed to be for an exhibition.
But I saw on TV that you were engaged to someone else...
and I thought that if I didn't, you wouldn't come.
I have waited for you, I have waited for you all these months.
It is you, the one who has left me alone all this time.
I've written you many letters, but you haven't answered any of them.
What letters?
I haven't received any letter from you.
-Hiroyuki...
-I already found it a little strange.
But you're right, it was my fault.
I was so focused on this work of art,
that these 6 months have flown by.
He had to finish at any cost.

so that it would be ready today, which is the anniversary.
-Our.
-What birthday?
It was a year ago today that we met, Manami.
-Oh... -Oh...
-Oh!
You remembered!
Of course I did.
We'll take the detainee to the Oita Prefectural Police Station.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
-Mm?
- (cell phone)
Nakadai, tell me.
- (all) Eh?
-Manami!
-Manami...
-Hello, Father!
I'm so glad you're well, daughter.
I thought you were kidnapped, I was so worried.
-I don't understand, why do you say that? -Segrestat?
-Segrestat?
Eh?
Mr. Mouri, can you explain it to them, please?
Ahem.
Yes, of course.
The culprit in this case tried to steal a million yen.
3 weeks ago he robbed at gunpoint a van
owned by Nakadai Electric Company.
"But the trunk door got jammed because of the collision
and he couldn't steal the money."
-Yes, exactly.
It was like that.
-Wasn't it, Mr. Hosogai?
We know that the thief used Hiroyuki's name
to recruit Ryuji Ogikubo as an accomplice.
First he asked him to steal the money, but he didn't succeed.
Then he saw an opportunity to invent the Manami's kidnapping and tried to keep the ransom money for himself.
and tried to keep the ransom money, too.
(Shinichi, think) "Very good, Kogoro."
"For once you make very accurate deductions."
One question, Mr. Hosogai.
Sometimes the Manami asks for advice from you
because her father is very busy, isn't he?
Has she ever asked you for advice about Hiroyuki?
Yes, it's true that sometimes she tells me things.
You mean he wouldn't like to marry Manami...
and then you'd also become the successor
of the president of the company?
(Shinichi, thinks) "Ay, ay, ay.... What do you say, now, Kogoro ?!"
That's why he made up the kidnapping of the Manami
and used the name of Hiroyuki.
To break the Manami's engagement with Mr. Ehari
and also to end the relationship with....
-Eh?
-Oh!
Aaaah...!
Ah...
Mm...!
Aaa..., uuuh...
Aaaah...!
(Kogoro voice) All right, now let's stop kidding around.
The culprits of the two crimes we are investigating are the Ogikubo,
who is the one who committed them,
and a man who calls himself Hiroyuki, his accomplice.
Somehow Hiroyuki knew which inn the Manami would be staying at while he went to Beppu.
would be while going to Beppu,
And he asked his accomplice to go.
"He told him to keep an eye on Manami's room
and to pass information to him."
You have to understand, Hiroyuki....
I don't want my father to suffer because of me.
What's this?
What is this?
Spying on me while I was in the room?
-A drone?
-Yes, with a drone.
A drone equipped with a surveillance camera
and a built-in microphone.
So, maybe what I saw last night through the window?
(Kogoro voice) "Saw two red lights and the silhouette of the drone,
which looked like two demon horns."
"The waterfall on the side made a lot of noise
and obscured the noise of the drone."
"With the branches of the surrounding trees,
the silhouette of the drone looked very much like that of a demon."
That's correct, isn't it, Conan?
Yes, that's why there were no traces or footprints...
at the edge of the window.
"But there were scratches on the tree trunk. They had been made by the drone."
(Kogoro voice) Don Ogikubo,
who was staying at the same inn as Miss Manami,
had been instructed by his accomplice Hiroyuki
to make the note disappear.
"He entered the Manami's room
and took away the note she had left."
"And he messed up the room to make it look like she had been kidnapped."
"If he had been taken by force,
she wouldn't have put on new shoes."
"But there was an empty box of new shoes in the room."
Maybe she put them on because she was waiting for her fiancé to arrive.
I would say that the Manami didn't know, that Mr. Ehari would come.
She put on her new shoes
to meet the real Hiroyuki, right?
That's true.
But Manami, how can you say that?
You are engaged to Mr. Ehari!
I only accepted the engagement
because you made me distance myself from Hiroyuki expressly.

You knew perfectly well that she was madly in love.
She always told you things about him and asked you for advice.
-Ah...!
-It's true, this, Yozo?!
- (Kogoro voice) So....
-N-no, I just....
We know that the man who has used the Ogikubo to commit the crimes
is pretending to be Hiroyuki
and has manipulated us all to make us believe what he was not.
He knows very well the relationship between Manami and Hiroyuki,
and that's why he was able to foresee what she would do.
And he also knew the route that the van would take.
that transported 100 million yen 3 weeks ago.
Yes, it was you!
The secretary to the president of Nakadai Electric,
Mr. Yozo Hosogai!
We found out!
Wha-what nonsense!
I haven't done anything, me.
Why should I want them, 100 million yen?
It would have been 50 million,
because they wanted to split them with the Ogikubo, if I'm not mistaken.
Why did he want it, that large amount of millions?
Maybe to get it back to the company
before someone realized they had committed embezzlement?
Yozo, is it true?
Is it true what you say?!
I'm... I'm so sorry.
I'm really sorry, I really don't know what happened to me!
Where is the ransom money?
What have you done, the 100 million?
I don't know, I don't know, where is it!
Really, I don't know anything about the money.
(Kogoro voice) Who stole the yen was not Mr. Hosogai.
Someone else tried to take advantage of this case
and keep the money for himself.
-Well, it's...
-Who do you mean?
-Eh?
-Mr. Ehari.
But... how could he even think of saying something like that?
Why should he want to steal 100 million yen?
Don't you see, it doesn't make sense?
Every year I earn 2 billion!
Mr. Ehari, I understand...
that your company isn't doing too well lately, is it?
Oh...!
I'd say that you've rushed to commit to the Manami
because you don't want to let Mr. Nakadai's fortune slip away.
Am I wrong?
How dare he?
What proof do you have, of all that you say?
Well, for example, a man like you who always follows the latest fashion...
"... when he goes to look for his promise he doesn't wear the same clothes
that you wear in a picture in a magazine."
"And today he doesn't wear his famous watch either,
valued at a million yen."
Maybe she had to sell it because she needs cash.
What do you think you're doing?
You can't accuse me just because of the watch or the clothes I'm wearing.
There's more to it than that.
While he was waiting with the ransom money bag...
Come here! Come here!
(Kogoro voice) "Come here!
(Kogoro voice) "There's been a bit of a commotion."
I have to do it.
(Kogoro voice) "He has exchanged the wads of bills for magazines."
You are the only one who has had the opportunity
and who has been able to make the exchange.
If we look under the shelves in the hut,
we're sure to find the money.
You have no proof that I have done any of the things you have said!
If you have any, show me!
-Huh?
-You have it in your hands yourself.
Conan, you marked the ransom bills...
with a highlighter, didn't you?
Yes.
If anyone has touched the money, they'll have fluorescent ink on their hands.
Ah, ah... Oh...
Oh..., no...
-Yes?
-Hiroyuki.
You've made a magnificent sculpture.
And I think with the new bulbs we've developed,
it would stand out even more.
Thank you very much, Mr. Nakadai!
-We could try it.
-Ah.
I'm so happy!
-Thank you, father!
So am I.
I'm happy for them.
Eh?
Ah...!
Eh?
Eh? (Laughs)
But... What happened?

Who would have thought,

Don't say anything to Inspector Megure, please.
Don't tell him anything, I beg you, please.
Considering that you have arrested the culprit,
I suppose Inspector Megure will turn a blind eye and forgive you.
Maybe Inspector Megure will, but I can't forgive you.
You've been playing sick to get out of work!

Now that you mention it, when I put on my shoes, something fell on the floor.
Eh?
Oh...
I'm sure you can glue it back together with some glue.
I guess what we'll have to do is ask the professor
