DETECTIVE CONAN
Murder at the television studios
(Phone)
Hello, good morning!
Nichiuri, hello?
Yes, just a moment, please!
Hey, Suwa!
Yes?
Call on line 4. It's Takashi Matsuo.
What do you want?
For that matter, it doesn't bother me.
I'll announce it at a press conference.
No, it's not that.
I wanted to tell you something.
After tomorrow's program, we could meet at the usual place.
I'd like to talk to you.
Just the two of us.
Go a little earlier.
I don't know... Very well, understood!
But this will be the last time!
You're right, Suwa... this will be the last time!
You'll see.
Welcome to the program "The Night of Mystery and Investigation".
I am your host, Takashi Matsuo!
And I am your assistant, Ayako Nagai!
Viewers report an unsolved case to us,
and our team tries to solve it live.
Welcome to the program.
Today we have a very important guest,
the famous private detective Kogoro Mouri!
(Applause) Thank you all very much!
Come on, Mr.
Mouri,
tell us which case has been the hardest for you to solve.
In fact, Miss, when I have just solved a case,
I always feel as if I'm dozing off.
And I don't remember anything! (laughs)
Oh, Father, look at you...!
(thinks) "Of course you don't remember... if you slept."
Let's move on to advertising!
What's wrong, Takashi?
Something wrong, Takashi?
I woke up today with my stomach upset.
See if you can find me somewhere in Suwa, please.
I'll be right there.
I'm in the meeting room on the fourth floor.
Don't worry, I'm already watching the program on the monitor.
Ah, hold on.
Tell en Matsuo to come when the program is over.
(TV: Kogoro) "I had been a policeman, but I have no trace, with guns."
"You went abroad for target practice, didn't you?"
"-I've been told you're a great marksman." - Man, maybe he exaggerates...
"But it's true!"
The public loves her, and the audience hasn't gone down at all...
but it's been going on for too long now.
I'll replace him with that sexy anchorwoman.
The audience will double, even triple,
if my dream comes true!
And then I'll be promoted and become the boss!
There's a lot of talk about tapped phones.
We have no way of knowing.
That's why I use my cell phone.
Mmm... that's a lot of nonsense you just said.
Portable phones emit electrical waves,
and you don't have to tap the line.
All you have to do is intercept the conversation!
(Think) "Wow, he knows something, though."
I'll give you an example.
Hello, Izumi, pretty girl, it's me, your esteemed Kogoro!
Do you mind if I pick you up tonight?
My wife?
Don't suffer, for my wife's sake.
We've separated!
Shall we go out tonight?
Well, these conversations are also intercepted.
If someone from the audience makes the leap to the couple,
be very careful!
We come to the second part of the program "The culprit is you".
And now, we will show you a 4-minute video.
Guess who is the culprit!
(TV) "My name is Joji Kirishima, I am a private detective.
How boring, so much money we have spent.
(Mobile)
-Hello? -Suwa, it's me.
Matsuo!
What are you doing?!
I see you on the monitor!
I wanted you to feel me one last time.
For the last time?
I'll kill myself.
I'll jump from the top of this building now!
-What?!
-I want you to witness my death!
Very well... You will continue to be the presenter.
Don't do anything foolish!
No... It's already too late.
(TV) Do you know who the killer is, viewers?
They are so well done, these films!
Mr.

Matsuo, you do it, the script, right?
Yes, it doesn't cost much...
You're sweating, sir, what happened to you?
Nothing, I don't have a good stomach today.
The video is running out.
Wow, who could it be, the murderer? (thinks) "The victim's sister."
All right, who would you say it is, the murderer?
The victim's sister!
I would never have guessed it.
Conan, have you guessed?
No, I had no idea!
Thanks and see you next week!
We had a great time with you!
Mr. Matsuo, I can't find Mr.
Matsuo, I can't find Mr.
Suwa!
He won't pick up his phone or cell phone.
Go see if you can find him in the meeting room.
Yes, understood.
(Thinking) "Why should it be in the meeting room?"
Mr. Suwa, is it here?
Mr.
Suwa?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Mr. Suwa is hurt?!
Mr. Suwa is wounded!
Just a moment!
I'll be right back!
The elevator takes too long!
Let's take the stairs!
The stairs go to the seventh floor?
This way, quick!
It's like a maze in here.
-Did you see!
It's death! -Oysters!
So many people!
(Think) "This man..."
The victim's name is Michihiko Suwa,
worked at this network as a producer.
The murder weapon is a pistol.
The bullet has gone through his head, through the glass...
The other bullets are stuck in the wall.
There are two back here and one by the clock.
There were cartridges in the corner of the room!
It matches the bullet holes.
And there's only one entrance door.
Allow me, sir, but there's not much of a secret in this case.
The killer has entered through the door,
cornered the victim in the window,
fired several shots until he was dead...
and ran off the way he came.
Has anyone seen any suspicious persons hanging around the building?
Mr.
Mr. Suwa has asked everyone to leave this room.
Oh, yeah? He was waiting for me.
He had something very important to tell me after the program.
Oh, well, there are no witnesses.
But maybe someone heard something.
It seems to me he must have been on the phone.
Maybe the person he was talking to felt something.
Oi, Kogoro?
What!
You're right. Aaaaaa....
Talk to the people related to the victim.
Yes, sir!
Mr. Matsuo!
Mr. Matsuo!
Hey, are you very upset?
There are rumors that they want you out of the program.
Could someone be the killer?
Stop it!
It's true, there were rumors that I'd be kicked out of the program,
but Mr.
Suwa wanted me to remain as the main presenter.
Therefore, I will fulfill Mr. Suwa's last wish.
Suwa
and I will continue to host the program!
(TV) "We will present this murder to the next program,
and we won't stop until Mr. Suwa's murderer has been caught!
Suwa!"
You have called Mr.
Suwa.
Yes, at 1/4 of 9 and he answered,
but 5 minutes before 9 o'clock, he didn't pick up the phone.
Mr. Suwa was murdered during these 40 minutes.
And why did you call her?
Because I told her.
I needed to know where he was.
I was still doing the program, and I don't know his cell phone number.
I understand you're a good shot, Takashi Matsuo.
Do you suspect me?!
I was hosting the program live, from 8 to 9.
You couldn't get away for a moment?
A 4-minute film is shown in the middle of the program.
You could have left that time.
You're right, I left the set to go to the bathroom.
But you took your gun and came to this room, didn't you?
What a nerve.
Try doing it yourself!
Get off the set, on the ninth floor,
come here, on the fourth floor, and come back to the ninth floor.
It would take 6 minutes!
What a ?!
Come on, that's what I'm guessing, of course...
Okay, Kogoro.
Come on, try to make it current.
What?!
Do I have to do it?
(thinks) "Why did it have to be me?"
6 minutes and 47 seconds.
Can't you run any faster?
No, I can't!
I feel like my heart is about to explode!
We checked the surveillance camera footage,
but no one looks like Mr.
Matsuo!
Well, I guess that clears me.
Doesn't it, inspector?
(Think) "No! The murderer is Mr. Matsuo!"

"But how did you do it, to come and return to the set in 4 minutes?"
Ran, what are you doing here?
Where have you been?
I was looking for you, Conan!
I've been with Kogoro and the inspector.
And where were you?
Don't tell me you got lost.
Oh, well, sort of...
It's just that this building is like a maze.
When they make TV studios, they make complicated structures
to prevent terrorists from occupying them.
I'm impressed.
How do you know that?
Aaa.... A man at the studio told me.
(Think) "I've got it, a maze!"
"But somewhere there must be a shortcut."
"A path that lets you go from the set to that room in 4 minutes."
Wow!
Look, there's no ladder going down.
"This ladder that goes from the ninth floor to the seventh floor is the only unguarded area.
"It could take you less than two minutes."
"A warehouse?"
Eh?
No, Conan, come back here.
"Hey! This window is just above that room!"
"Sure, a rope!"
"He could have used a rope to get down."
"No, that can't be..."
"If the killer had come through the window,
the victim would have gone to the door,
and the victim was at the window."
"Eh? These bloodstains...
don't protrude from the window."
"Besides, there's no blood on the window frame!"
You didn't find out who he was talking to on the phone, the victim?
No.
"But it's been over an hour now."
"Then the only possibility is that the victim...
was talking to the killer!"
"Why did he have to call the man he wanted to kill, if it was before him?"
"Maybe..."
Conan, where are you going?!
"I know! Now I've got it!"
"This means that my theory is true!"
"The unseen path is here!"
"But it's not enough, just knowing it. I still have no proof."
"I have no proof to prove that Mr. Matsuo is the murderer."
(Mobile)
Oh, no!
I left my cell phone on. (Riiiiiing)
Yes, hello?
Ah, it's you!
(Riiiiiing) "Yes, of course."
"You're the murderer...
and I already have the proof that will incriminate you, Takeshi Matsuo!"
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Who are we going to see, kid!
It's that famous star.
Miss Okino.
Okino.
The Yoko, you say?!
Hey, listen, handsome, you mean the Yoko is here, Conan?
(thinks) "All right, and now..."
Today went very well!
Wow, it's been great!
(Thinking) "Sir!
Could I borrow this paint gun, please?
(Thinking): Eh?
And why do you want it, kid?
It's for Kogoro Mouri, who's doing the program.
Excuse me, Inspector...
Can I go now?
Yes, we're done for today.
(Monitor: see Kogoro) "Don't move, Mr. Matsuo!"
"We need you here."
What?
But, Kogoro!
I'm about to start my program.
We wouldn't all be here if you were gone.
Because you, you're the killer!
Yes, you are!
But what does this mean, Kogoro?
Inspector.
Detective Mouri wants to see you live.
He does?
Wait a minute!
That's it.
That's it!
Like this... And now this way!
That's perfect.
Kogoro, think about what you're saying, okay?
It's quite clear that the killer has entered this room,
fired several shots and killed the victim.
But Mr.
Matsuo was on the ninth floor hosting a live show.
How do you want it to be him?
(Kogoro voice) It's true.
It seems impossible.
(Broadcast) But 3 floors above the room where I pay is a warehouse.
If he had used this window on the seventh floor,
he could have killed her in a very short time.
Because here on the set it takes about two minutes.
What do you say?!
(Monitor) Have you checked? Camera, stand back.
No kidney us, if we use this equipment without permission?
We won't know, it's an internal transmission.
What are you doing?!
-Oysters, the boss! -I'll make them stop right now!
Who said I want them to stop?
I'll take the responsibility!
We'll broadcast it live to the whole country!
(TV) "I'll prove my theory... Hey, Conan!"
"Yes, say?"
It's on Conan!
(Kogoro's voice) I think Mr.
Matsuo has taken the body out of this window
and pointed it down.

Let's see, the victim was shot right here.
The window was ajar.
He would have had to fly, to do it.
(Conan) Aaaaaaaaaaah!
I'm falling! Kogoro, don't just sit there!
We have to save!
(Conan) Eh?
(Kogoro's voice) After shooting him,
M.
Matsuo has dropped the gun.
Ouch!
Ouch!
And went into the room below.
How did he do it, so that the victim put his head out of the window?
(TV) "With the cell phone!
The person who called him before murdering him was the murderer."
He probably threatened to throw himself out of the building.
That's why the victim ran to open the window.
Wow!
You agree with me, with this expression?
And the bullet holes and cartridges that we found in the room?
(TV) "Mr. Matsuo had left them earlier."
"The evidence he shot from above is the hole in the ground."
Check it out!
(TV) Yes, sir!
"Mr. Matsuo, you've left the set so they've played the video,
and the warehouse on the seventh floor has come."
"And, as I explained, he killed M. Suwa."
"Before the video ended,
he returned to the set to continue presenting the program."
"Am I right?"
Can you prove it?
Do you have any proof of it that you have explained to us, Detective Mouri?
(TV) "Mr. Matsuo, you just made a mistake!"
"I guess you were in such a hurry, you forgot to turn it off."
(TV) Exactly.
The proof is his cell phone!
"If you don't turn it off,
the redial key is not deactivated."
"Inspector, please try it!"
(Mobile)
Is it Mr. Suwa's phone?
Suwa's phone?
(TV) "Mr. Matsuo...
you said you didn't know Mr. Suwa's cell phone number.
Suwa's cell phone number."
It's just that I've... left my phone on my desk
before the program started!
Someone must have used it!
"That's not true!"
"I used your phone during the program!"
"If I hadn't used it after me,
the phone would have called the bar where I called it."
"After my call, he put it in his pocket."
Who else could have taken it?
Answer it!
What a big mistake.
I knew it was a mistake to invite you today.
So, is it true that you murdered Mr. Suwa?
Suwa?
Yes, because he didn't want to see me removed from the program we created.
I thought that Mr. Suwa had conceived it, this program.
Suwa, this program.
The truth is, we made a deal.
"Suwa would take all the credit for the idea.
and I would be the host of the program."
"But one day he told me he was sending me away."
But... more than angry, I was very disappointed.
Well, before we started doing the program...
"When we were preparing it, it was the best time."
"You know what they say,
that the fact of preparing a party is more fun than the party."
"And it's true."
But it's no use now, regretting it.
It's already done.

(Monitor) "Congratulations, Kogoro!"
Father, you're a genius!
"You're a great detective, boy!"
What the empatolleu you?
Yes, I don't know how he figured it out!
Well, now I'm going with the others.
Quiet here, man!
What's going on here?
I don't see Yoko anywhere!
Whenever I come near you, I get sleepy.
Today I'll rip the truth out of you even if I have you...
Mr.
Mouri!
What a ?!
Yoko!
I've seen her on the monitor!
You're the best detective in the world!
He was shooting a movie, but I came running to see him!
What?
Aaa... well... it's no big deal!
Wow, lucky me, I was saved!
La Ran has moved a lot.
I don't know why she's so happy to go out with me.
But this is impossible!
Shinichi Kudo is me!
What's that?
What is it?
One, one murder?
I hope nothing happened to her!
In the next episode...
