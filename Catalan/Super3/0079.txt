DETECTIVE CONAN
"The bank robbery murder"
A strike!
I had a great time!
It's nice, going bowling on a weekday.
Today was the last day of exams for the semester!
I'm happy!
Hey, pretty girl, you're happy day in and day out.
(coughs)
Are you all right, Conan?
Maybe you've caught a cold.
No, you don't seem to have a fever.
We'd better go home.
What a head!
What's gotten into you? I forgot to go to the bank!
Father asked me to cash the check for his fee.
Is there a bank nearby? On that corner over there, Toht Bank.
We're just in time, Ran.
We'll be right over.
Wait for me, Conan.
Thank you very much.
(Coughs)
(More people cough)
Colds are the order of the day.
Ah, hello!
Hello, Miss Sonoko.
Is there anything we can do for you?
I've brought a friend with me.
Of course, of course.
Give my regards to your father for me, Miss.
Sonoko, who is this man? The branch manager.
You can tell she's the daughter of a big shot!
(Coughs)
Conan, how are you feeling? You've caught quite a cold!
Are you all right, boy?
This cough looks bad.
Here, take this candy.
Thank you. Thank you, Conan.
Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome, my dear.
Mr. Taniguchi, can you help me?
Yes!
So far, guys.
That's about it.
Let's see...
Mr. Director, I'm off to do the business visits.
Okay, good job.
Hands up!
Everybody straight!
If anyone makes a suspicious gesture, you won't get out alive!
Get out of the way!
You were going to take his clients, weren't you?
What an unfair world, this one.
You, the man over there!
Yes, you, put the money in the bag.
And the others, all on the other side of the counter.
Hold it right there!
Everybody continue without lifting a finger!
Put the money in the bag!
Hey, Ran, what will happen to us?
If we don't move, nothing will happen to us.
(Coughs)
(Ring)
My God! Damn you!
(Screams)
He shot Mr. Maejima together.
He was quite serious, but it seemed that his life was not in danger.
He says that, when Mr. Maejima was about to attack the robber,
the cell phone he was carrying in his pocket,
this phone here, suddenly rang.
Yes, the robber turned to feel it,
saw Maejima and fired the gun he was carrying.
Immediately after, Mr.
Taniguchi, rushed at the criminal.
When they saw that Maejima was shot,
the girls started to call out and panicked.
The robber looked upset and pointed the gun.
I became aware of the danger and suddenly my body moved instinctively.
I just thought that I had to force him to point the gun the other way.
Inspector Megre! Mm...
We've finished the inspection.
It can happen whenever you want.
Would you excuse me for a moment, please?
The gun is a slightly modified model.
And this angle is out of range of the surveillance camera.
The robber was also carrying a cell phone!
Inspector!
Toru Saeki, born 1970.
I will question the staff.
Do any of you remember seeing the robber's face?
(Ring)
Why, it's not me.
(Ring)
Is it Mr. Maejima's customer?
Hello?
This is Inspector Megre, from the police department.
With whom am I speaking?
Mr. Koike? It's a client of Mr. Maejima.
Look, Mr.
Maejima has been involved in a crime and is injured.
Excuse me, did you make any calls to this cell phone at 3:05 a.m.?
No call?
Understood.
Hey.
Let-let-me-hear it too.
You've recorded everything that's happened, right?

Xxxt.
Don't shout so much.
I was thinking of selling it to the media.
So, you'll leave me?
What a remedy.
(Recording) "Quiet! Let everyone continue without lifting a finger!"
I thought so!
You've had enough.
Gentlemen, I've already got a clear picture of the facts.
Inspector!
Will what you have done to Taniguchi be considered a crime?
No, if Mr. Taniguchi hadn't pounced on the robber,
maybe they would have shot them all.
Putting his life on the line is a commendable action.
Rather than being considered a crime, so much courage deserves reward.
Really?
What a break, Taniguchi.
We'll try to reward you somehow.
That's not necessary.
Mr. Maejima has had no luck.
And we still don't know who called him.
But if he hadn't been called,
he probably wouldn't have been shot by the robber.
It's not true!
Everyone is wrong!
This is the one!
(Ring)
No, kiddo!
This is very important.
Don't make mischief!
Mr. Taniguchi, we'd like to take your written statement.
Can you come with me to the police station? OK.
I'd like to go to the washroom first.
Vagi quiet.
What are you doing here?
Going to the washroom?
Mr. Taniguchi, why did you hide your cell phone when you were so nervous?
Maybe I was trying to make a call.
Or rather...
Am I imagining it, or does this case smell like a scorched earth?
And to think that you have been here during the whole incident...
A security system with a card.
It's Mr. Taniguchi's jacket.
Before... What the fuck was the robber looking for, the American?
Tobacco?
A lighter?
No, I don't think so.
Let's see...
There's nothing here.
Wait a second.
Earlier, the robber...
I'm sure, it must be this way.
That's it.
I've got it!
Just as I thought, there's a catch in this case!
In Kogoro it's not here, I'll have to count on Sonoko's help.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm sorry to cause you any more trouble.
Hey, Ran!
Am I in, Sonoko?! Ouch!
Sonoko!
(Sonoko) Inspector, I've found out! What have you found out?!
Ow, speak up!
I'm sure in this case, something smells fishy!
You're sure.
You're sure?
Sure?
What do you mean, sure? This, that I'm sure.
I have to be careful and talk like a woman.
First, the cell phone that rang
when Mr. Maejima was about to assault the robber was not yours,
but the criminal's.
Everyone confirmed that the cell phone that rang was Mr. Maejima's!
But not long ago, when Mr. Maejima's cell phone rang, Mr. Maejima's cell phone rang.
Maejima's cell phone rang,
you and Mr.
Taniguchi got confused and took out their phones,
thinking it was ringing.
So we were convinced that it was Mr. Maejima's phone.
Maejima's phone.
Indeed, it is a possibility.
How can you be so sure that the cell phone that rang was the thief's?
Because of the ringing sound.
If you compare the sound of Mr. Maejima's cell phone with that of the robber's
you will notice the difference.
If you want to check, that student has recorded the facts.
Kid!
Do you have this tape that says?
-No.
Ah...- Don't lie, asshole!
Damn, I've gone too far again.
I'm sorry.
Don't lie.
I know you have it.
If you do, we'd prefer you cooperate with the police.
All right, but then come back to me, please.
Inspector, we have the boom box!
Now we'll begin.
Yes, do...
First, Mr. Maejima's cell phone.
(Short sound)
Next, the robber's.
(Longer sound)
They have a similar sound, but the pattern differs.
And that's the sound of the robber's cell phone.
(Sonoko) -A little more enrere.-Ah, yes!
(Ring-ring-ring)
Put it back on! Yes, Inspector!
(Ring-ring)
There is no doubt, it is the pattern of the robber's cell phone.
Sonoko, it seems that the phone that rang during the robbery
was the robber's.
Did he receive that call by any chance?
Or maybe...
Probably, he was calling his accomplice.
An accomplice?
Seeing that Mr.
Maejima was going to hit him with a wooden sword,
the accomplice took his cell phone and called the robber.
He wanted to warn him of the danger.
You mean the accomplice is here, in this room?
Yes.

Mr. Taniguchi, you are the accomplice!
What a thing to say... Please don't joke.
Mr.
Taniguchi, with your cell phone, you have informed the robber,
who was outside the bank, of the exact moment when he should enter.
So that the exit door of the workers is opened from inside,
but from outside you need to use a card to enter.
Mr. Director, I'm going to make business visits.
Yes, very well.
Wait a moment.
Now I'll get you those lists.
(Ring-ring-ring) Yes, sir.
(Ring-ring-ring)
Hands in the air!
Everybody freeze!
The robber has ordered you to put the bundles in the bag.
You are the only one left behind the counter.
The robber has not been at all uneasy with you...
In his plan, the robber did not cause any victims and had to flee after you had put the beams in the bag.
after you had put the money in the bag.
Afterwards, they would meet to share the money.
But, in the middle of the plan, an unexpected event occurred:
Mr. Maejima regained consciousness!
And you wanted to do something to warn him.
You wanted to call him "Behind you!
but everyone would have found out that you were his accomplice.
So you pressed the redial key.
Even though it was the murderer's phone ringing,
Maejima thought it was yours and stopped what he was doing.
And shot him.
Shooting Mr. Maejima was the worst obstacle.
Maejima was the worst obstacle in his plan.
He got desperate thinking that the robber, deranged as he was,
might start shooting at the others.
Continuing with the plan was too risky and he lunged at the robber.
You stated that you accidentally shot him while they were struggling,
but you wanted to shut him up.
You are making it all up.
May I have a look at your cell phone?
By pressing the redial key,
the robber's cell phone will ring and we'll know for sure.
-As you wish. (Sonoko) - I knew it!
You went to the washroom earlier to erase the memory of the redial, didn't you?
Inspector!
I have definitive proof that they were accomplices.
Are you serious, Sonoko? Conan!
Yes!
Mr. Inspector, open both hands.
Like this? Like this.
What are these?
It's throat candy!
Mr.
Taniguchi gave it to me just before the robbery.
Sonoko!
Go on!
The paper in his right hand is the one the robber threw on the floor.
Immediately after, the robber looked for something in the pocket of Mr. Taniguchi's jacket.
in the pocket of Mr. Taniguchi's jacket.
Taniguchi's jacket pocket: throat candy.
Mr.
Taniguchi and the robber must have met this morning.
But both must have had a cold.
And he, who was carrying a packet, gave a piece to the robber.
Afterwards, the robber had another coughing fit
and tried to take the candies out of his pocket,
but he had already taken them all and had only the paper left.
Then he remembered that Mr.
Taniguchi was carrying candy
in the pocket of his jacket and tried to take them.
Not knowing that Mr.
Taniguchi had given them to Conan.
The proof is that the role of these candies fits perfectly.
It's true!
The fingerprints of the robber and those of Mr. Taniguchi.
Taniguchi
must have been both pieces.
Take this to the forensic police.
Yes, sir!
Mr. Taniguchi.
Taniguchi, do you have any objection?
It was Saeki who gave me the throat candy!
We met at a loan shark's office.
We conceived this heist because we could pay off the loan.
If I had known it would end this way,
I wouldn't have given you the candy.
DETECTIVE CONAN
(Coughs)
Sonoko, you've solved a case again!
Well, I don't remember anything.
But I feel a prick in my neck.
Help me!
Shinichi hasn't been in the limelight for a while.
From now on, everyone will rely on Big Suzuki,
the beautiful and charming student detective!
Casum Dena, I shouldn't have used!
I'm such a jerk!
Let-let-me-me!
Are you all right, Genta?
This is...!
She's been strangled with a rope or something!
A murder?
This case isn't a normal robbery.
She's the murderer!
But I don't have any proof!
