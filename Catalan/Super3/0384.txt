Are you all right?
Do you want me to order a cab?
(Drunk) No..., I'm fine!
Oops... Good night, thank you teacher.
Be alert, have a good night.
(Kogoro: laughing)
Oops, oops, oops...
Mm?
Aaaaah!
Aaaaah!
Be careful, you little animals!
Luckily I was passing by and I was able to dodge it, otherwise...!
THE TARGET IS Kogoro Mouri
Father!
Be still!
Oops!
Ran, it stings!
Can't you do it more gently?
What are you ruminating about?
You're an exaggerator.
Don't be a crybaby and put up with something!
I'll say four fresh ones to whoever is in charge of the construction.
(Phone)
-Who should it be, at this hour?
- (ring)
Ah, it's a message.
(ring) What?
(ring) What?
Father, what's wrong?
Eh?!
It says: "Next time I will not fail. I swear I'll kill you..."
It wasn't a random accident, but an assassination attempt!
You filthy rat.
The culprit had ambushed me.
Father, can't you think who could have done it?
No!
No, I have no idea!
I would say that I have not done anything for them to have a grudge against me.
So it's someone who hates you for no reason?
Yes.
And if he has one, we'll find out who he is in no time...
Every crime has a motive.
This time it's me they want to see dead.
If I look for who might have something against me, I'll know who the culprit is.
Father, this cell phone is not yours.
What are you saying?
Let me see it.
It's true!
Oops!
And this jacket isn't yours either!
What's that?
Look, there's a name: Kimura.
I mean, this phone and this jacket are not yours...
but of someone who seems to be called Kimura!
So, it's not me, to whom this message has been sent.
What a thing...
Hey!
And now where are you going?
What a bore!
I'm going to sleep.
Got it!
Conan!
(thinks) "How ridiculous."
Conan... What do you think of this?
Kogoro has been tried to be assassinated
because he took Kimura's jacket by mistake...
That's what you mean, isn't it?
Yes... That's right.
I'll try calling the father's cell phone!
What kind of person must he be, the owner of the phone?
There's no answer.
This is definitely Mr. Kimura's jacket.
Mr. Kimura came by last night?
-He came when you were sleeping on a seat.
Around one o'clock in the morning.
Listen: do you know where he lives, Mr. Kimura?
I don't know... He hasn't been coming to this establishment for a long time.
And I only know his name
because I put it on the label of this bottle.
Ah, I get it...
I'm sure he'll show up sooner or later.
Now oblidem's-in for a while.
What does he have that you already know?
The artisan cheese this man makes is super spicy.
It makes your cells start to burn and you sweat like crazy.
But if you taste it once you can't stand it anymore.
(Laughs outrageously)
(Thinks) "That's why he took off his jacket."
After investigating the phone from which to send the message,
we have verified that it is a number registered under a false name.
And between yesterday and today there has been no accident with a Kimura.
It was probably a prank...
The police have things to do, you shouldn't give them any more work, Ran.
But, Father...
Besides, I'm sure it's not me they're after,
but a man named Kimura.
But if the culprit doesn't realize he's made a mistake,
he'll make another attempt on your life.
This is obvious!
What will he do then?
That's why the Ran is worried.
You don't have to take seriously what this girl tells you.
The Lemon bar...

It's seen that you look for all kinds of bars to drink, right?
(Flow) Hey, a week ago,
I got a coupon
for the first anniversary of the bar's opening.
With it you can drink whatever you want for free.
I went to check out the place.
They're going to serve me superpicant cheese along with the drink.
-Aiii!
-Takagi!
We have a witness statement.
Last night a student who lives near the building under construction...
saw a man running out of the crime scene.
But he didn't get a good look at his face.
"Looks like the culprit had a scar on his elbow."
Can you think of who that might be?
Unfortunately, we haven't found any prints,
and we haven't found anything else either.
You'll have to look for Mr. Kimura
and track down the things I'll find from now on.
You talk as if it's not about you!
What the fuck do you think you are?!
I'm not Mr. Kimura.
This all happened because you're going to the Lemon bar!
Hey, Kogoro!
If we don't hurry, they'll attack Mr. Kimura again.
Mr. Kimura?
Since Mr. Kimura's jacket is the same size as his father's,
he must have the same physique as my father...
We haven't seen anyone like that in the laundry.
Oh, my...
Watch out!
Ran!
(thinks) "A scar on the left elbow!"
So the truck was stolen.
This means that it was a premeditated attack.
- (phone)
-I think so too, Inspector.
(Ring)
Mouri, what... what's wrong?
Inspector, they have finished treating the owner of the laundry!
He will be discharged here 2 or 3 days.
How dare you involve other people?!
Mouri!
Where the fuck are you going?
Where do you want me to go?!
To catch that guy!
Au, man, you don't even know where he is!
How do you plan to look for him?
Mr. Mouri.
He gives me!
I'm going to find him at all costs!
But may I know what you're saying?!
Stay in a safe place until we find the culprit!
They are right... There is someone who wants to kill you.
I can't do that!
I, in Kogoro Mouri, am as well known as the sun...
and no, I can't hide... like a poor wretch.
Stop it!
You don't have to get cocky!
Oi, Conan?
Eh?
The Milhomes?
You must think I have a lot of humors, right?
Deus joking!
That a person wants to kill me!
Perfect!
We couldn't find a better opportunity to catch him!
As long as we don't know who this Kimura is,
I'll be the bait so we can find the culprit, and they'll catch him, right?
Wait a minute!
May I know what you're up to?
If I stay hidden forever, we'll never, ever stop him!
Eh?
Inspector!
All right, all right, all right!
But I'll leave you this pair to act as bodyguards.
No way!
This will put the culprit on guard and he won't let himself be seen.
No!
Leaving you alone is too dangerous!
I hate to have told you this, Inspector,
but this time I won't listen to you...
I, in Kogoro Mouri, can't stand and don't want any more victims.
But if anything should happen to me,
I beg you to take care of what is necessary, please.
Mouri, uh, wow...
We've only managed to get him in more headfirst.
It's not reasonable at all.
Mr. Mouri...
Well... Now, we have to find that Kimura caller!
Yes, sir!
Let's go, Takagi!
Hurry up!
(Takagi) Eh... Yes!
"Since the last attack, you've been around for 3 days?"
"Yes, Inspector... Do you know anything about this Mr. Kimura?"
We've done everything we could to find him.
If the culprit has something on Mr. Mouri,
we'll find him eventually.
But the fact is that they are threatening his life
because they have mistaken it for this Kimura end.
Besides, after that second attempt on Mouri's life,
the culprit left nothing behind, no footprints.
I hate to say this,
but we're stuck and we can't get anything clear.
(Think) "Fingerprints..."
"He doesn't want his prints investigated."
"This means that the culprit's fingerprints are the police record."
"That is to say, this person has been arrested before...
"That he is fixed by the police, and he knows in Kogoro, perhaps?
"But he has no motive against him. Wait!"
"If the culprit knows in Kogoro because he had already seen her..........,

"It could be that..."
(Kogoro voice) It's me, in Mouri.
It's been a long time...
I'd like to ask you something about a case I solved.
"We're having a busy night tonight. Mm?"
"Come out where you're from! I know what you're hiding here!"
"I recommend you come out of where you are before t'esclafi mercilessly!"
"I'm telling you for your own good! Don't try to do anything, that won't do you any good either!"
"If you don't come out, I'll come and get you! Come out!"
"No, please don't! Please forgive me!"
"I'm sorry... Tor-I will return what I have stolen."
"Father!"
"Eh? What the hell is going on?"
"Father, you're fantastic! You caught a thief!"
"In that case, luck and coincidence went hand in hand."
Conan, why don't you rest?
I wonder if this Kimura,
in addition to looking similar to his father, resembles him in face.
Don't they say that in the world there are 3 people who look like you?
"3 people with this face?"
"People who look alike."
(Boy) Yes, I received a call from Mr. Kimura's wife,
and she finally realized that her husband wasn't wearing the jacket.
Mr. Kimura has gone to take pictures.
It's his hobby.
Mr. Mouri, Mrs. Kimura just told me...
that this morning a strange man was hanging around outside her house.
He had a scar on his right elbow?
And where is he now, Mr. Kimura?
At Beika Lake?
He says that strange man is following him...?
Understood.
But, Mr. Mouri, are you going too?
- (communication cut off)
-It's too dangerous, too much.
What an impulsive man.
A coin?
Yes!
I dropped it and it went under the car.
Word well!
I'll move the car and we'll look for it.
Will you really?
That's nice... Thank you very much!
(thinks) "I thought so."
"Manicure?"
Thank you very much, sir!
I've already found it!
(Kogoro voice) Inspector?
I'm in Mouri.
I've found out who Mr. Kimura is.
How do you say?!
(Kogoro) Mr. Kimura!
Where is Mr. Kimura?
Please answer me!
Mr. Kimura!
Hey, it's freezing cold, eagerness sy appear!
(Phone)
Yes, it's me, in Mouri.
Oh, Inspector!
I've already found out where Mr. Kimura is.
It's in the bushes.
(Megre voice) Be careful not to catch cold.
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Mr. Kimura!
Mr. Kimura!
(CLEC)
Mr. Kimuraaa!
The one on top of the boat, isn't he in Mouri?
It's in Mouri!
Totally in the open and well visible!
He has nothing to fight against the sniper!
It is too dangerous!
Something has shone on the left side of the shore.
It's a rifle.
It's a rifle.
It must be that of the sniper who wants to make an attempt on Mouri's life!
Yes, sir!
Hurry up, Takagi!
(Gunshot)
Mouriii!
Mouri!
We have to save!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Come on!
-Go get a boat.
- (at once) Yes, sir!
(thinks) "We must save at all costs!"
Eh?
Conan!
Inspector!
Where is he in Kogoro, now?
(Sato) Inspector Megre.
We found this... in the water.
And then?
We couldn't find Mr. Mouri.
The gentleman from the Lemon Bar!
(Boy) I received a call from Mrs. Kimura
and I made a mess looking for the address she gave me.
But now that I had it, I had to give the message to Mr. Mouri.
I didn't know things would end up like this.
Aaa-aaatxum!
Wow, when the sun goes down it starts to get a little cooler!
Mouri!
Mouri!
Are you all right?
Aaah... I picked this up.
You're right!
You put a dummy on the boat and...
You wanted to bring out the sniper.
I'm so happy!
This is the great Kogoro Mouri!
Ah, Inspector!
Have you found Mr. Kimura yet?
Ah... (Kogoro voice)
(Kogoro voice) Relax, inspector, you don't have to worry about him at all!
(Kogoro voice) What do you mean?
To begin with, there has been a person named Kimura.
In other words, it was me.
To hide his cell phone,
the sniper has invented a character and called her Kimura!
Invented?
The cell phone?
Yes...
If he killed me, the police would do a thorough background check on me.

and I could find the sniper from there.
But if I was killed because I had been taken for a Kimura,
it would greatly complicate the investigation,
because there would be nothing to connect me to that man.
"This means the accident at the building under construction,
"The attempt to run him over with tea and the warning messages..."
were a smokescreen that the sniper had planned?
Can you prove that Kimura has never existed?
Let's take it one step at a time...
Who is he, the sniper?
Mr. Inoue, you carry a briefcase in your car, don't you?
Hagan, go ahead.
Do you mind if we take a look?
-It's the trunk.
-I'll take a look.
By the way, Mr. Inoue.
You took advantage of the free service coupon
and invited me to things, to get me to frequent the Lemon bar...
hoping that an opportunity would present itself.
When I fell asleep after getting drunk,
he put another jacket on me and put the phone down.
No, he came in Kimura and....
Came, drank and went home?
What to drink water?
Inspector!
I found it.
Inside the bottle was only water.
Is this...?
The rifle you wanted to shoot me with.
Do you have any proof that I wanted to shoot you?
Inside the chest of that dummy is a bullet from a rifle.
If we compare the bullet with the traces it left behind...
and if the rifle matches, it will be incontrovertible proof.
But I have no reason to want to kill Mr. Mouri!
Of course you don't.
You detest me for a reason.
Conan, please see the dossier!
(Conan voice) Yes!
Here!
(Kogoro voice) What is this?
(Kogoro voice) You hate me because I made you stop.
This is his photograph years ago.
After serving his sentence, he had plastic surgery,
and procured a new identity.
Mr. Hiroshi Ukita!
This is his real name.
If you insist that I'm wrong,
we'll remove the lacquer coating on your fingertips
and we'll treat your fingerprints!
(Cries) He had finally managed to find a bride....
and he needed money to marry her.
That was the last job I ever did, but you took me.
She left me.
And I swore I'd come back for you.
Stop talking nonsense!
I wouldn't have been happy with money that were the fruit of a crime!
You don't see it?!
It's nonsense, you blame Mouri for what you did wrong!
(Kogoro) You never know when a person like me,
an intelligent detective, will be the target of a sniper.
This Kitada from the class next door is a mess.
Eh?
A thief!
Conan, hold my wallet.
Wait, it's in... Ah!
What's that?
Father?
What the fuck are you doing, with this line?
If you see anyone suspicious, let me know right away.
(Think) "You're the only one who looks suspicious here."
(Kogoro) I'm going to see a family of musicians.
They have a composer with a perfect musical ear.
A perfect musical ear?
A Stradivarius?
Kogoro, please park the car under that window, hurry!
Wait, wait!
What are you doing?!
And the next Conan: "The cacophony of the Stradivarius. Prelude."
