Victory, sincerity, tests for truth.
An inexhaustible drive to try to be the best!
I finally get in touch with the Men in Black Organization.
Finally, a terrifying target is revealed!
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

WITHIN ARMS REACH OF THE ORGANIZATION, (PART 4)
(Woman) Mr. Domon!
Mr. Domon, a question!
Thank you, thank you very much.
Door pistol?
Gun?
Yes I carry, why?
And a silencer? Oh... I do carry.
And now would you be willing to shoot where I ask you?
Nobody has to notice anything!
I've already told them.
I'll shake your hand later.
Mr. Domon, you have my support.
Do a good job, please.
Yes... He-he-he-he-he.
Thank you very much!
I suppose I'll be able to have these images at my disposal during the elections.
Yes... of course.
Did you get it, Korn?
I'm going to shoot him in the head...
"And you in the back."
(Korn) I want to... shoot him in the head.
All right, help yourself!
Kir, what's up?
Hurry up and make DJ sit down!
- (Gin) "Kir?" - (people: chattering)
Mr. Domon.
We should get the interview started, please.
Yeah..., I guess so.
Excuse me, would you mind leaving some space?
We'd like to record the interview now.
(thinks) "The sprinklers?"
It's raining?
Wow, what a drag...
That's all we need.
Au, headquarters at once.
Run.
Ah..., thank you.
(Korn) DJ has a blue umbrella.
Can I shoot?
(Korn) Hold on.
Shooting through the umbrella will reduce accuracy.
This is all very strange, it's not raining on this side.
Here now... it's started raining too.
It's finally started to rain.
Finally, thank God.
(Gin) "Chianti..."
Kir, Korn... Retire-e for now!
I'll be waiting for you... in an hour... at the agreed place.
And now, while we're at it, will you explain it to me?
What is the synopsis of the second act... of the murder drama?
The rain gives us no respite.
We continue the interview in the house in this park.
-Yes. -Au, shall we go there?
Uh... Excuse me, can we come with you, Mr. Domon?
Yes, of course!
-I'm coming too! -And me!
Oh!
"What luck!"
Wait a minute.
"I'd better get the transmitter and microphone back now while I can."
"Very well. It's mine now!"
No... You little...
"He's seen her!"
Don't tell me... you followed me... all the way here?
No..., wrong.
It's just a coincidence.
Of course...
Thank you very much... you did me a favor by picking up the shoe.
Thank you, really.
Director!
Can you put someone in my place to interview the candidate?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
My throat's been feeling a little sore for a while now.
Don't tell me.
"Gin..."
(Agasa) Has that presenter seen you?
-She saw you and I'm sure she found out we were following her.
No..., I think I convinced her otherwise.
And she didn't realize she was carrying the transmitter and the microphone either.
So why didn't you get it back?
All you had to do was tell her
she had something on the bottom of her shoe and pick it up.
Yes... I had thought of that possibility, too.
But then she...
Thank you so much, really.
It's given me a strange feeling.
Don't worry, because thanks to you, we can continue the chase!
Besides, it looks like her plan to assassinate him won't end here.
Yes...
But, wait a minute.
We can't leave things as they are!
The TV crew that she has taken with her
is now with the candidate Domon, right?
These others are not involved!
I'm sure she's come up with some excuse.

To move to the fringes of the network team.
"So those people will surely get together somewhere.
"And they will agree on their next plan."
Well, now leave the rest in the hands of the FBI.
You guys go home with the scarab.
But we'll take this boy for a while!
And may I ask how you plan to follow them without any vehicle?
No problem.
My head has volunteered to be my chauffeur...
Goodbye, doctor!
Take care of Mr. Kogoro and Ran.
Invite them to your house and don't tell them what's going on.
Very well, all right.
Just in case,
we'll assign 2 or 3 of our agents to be on the lookout.
I'm counting on you!
Wait! What?
I guess you already know.
The main objective is to retrieve the transmitter and the microphone!
If you let yourself be blinded
by curiosity and a sense of justice,
you will lose... absolutely everything!
Yes, yes, I know.
And you shot the sprinklers
to make them believe that it had started to rain
and dissuade them from continuing with their plans.
That's how you got all the people and the target to open their umbrellas.
No wonder you respect this nano so much.
I myself would be happy to recruit him for the Federal Department.
It's in James.
You knew him quite some time ago... didn't you, Conan?
The last time I saw you
was that Panda car incident.
You saved my life!
"Panda?"
What?
A police car?
That's right!
The message James left us was the P and A words.
It's in a police car!
How is it that the P and A should refer to a police car?
Take the symbol for the letter "y" lletreja'l,
and put it with the P and the A!
Let's see... P and A... I don't get it...
-P, A, N, D, A...- P..., A..., N..., D..., A?
Sure, a panda!
Sure, a panda!
A police car is black and white, like a panda bear!
Come on!
Afanyat't!
We'll use the hostage and run away!
Yes, sir!
Help us!
Help us!
What's going on?
What... what's going on?
-Mr. Policeman! -Help us please!
Help, help!
Excuse me a moment, please!
I'm Takagi from Metropolitan Central!
Help us catch that kidnapper!
Be alert, don't make the slightest noise.
All right, we'll go with them for a while...
and then we'll take a detour down the road!
"They've fallen into the trap!"
Get ready, it will soon be time to take a detour.
(Horn)
If you can't turn left, turn right!
In we have... another one to the right...
(horn) -All right.
Then we'll turn back!
Brake and when we're behind...
-I don't like that.
We're being followed by another car.
What's that?
Another one?
Look!
Now we can't get out!
The police have us completely surrounded!
"Don't smoke, this James was also an FBI agent?"
But how do you understand that they're trying to attack Yasuteru Domon
if they haven't even chosen her yet?
Surely it must be
because her father was a famous government official,
he's well known in the world of politics,
he has charisma and is reputed to have a great sense of justice.
They even say he will run for prime minister.
I can see that.
They want to get rid of anyone who can stand up to them and go against them.
and go against them.
This... this is their way of doing.
Besides, if they assassinate him now,
they can make it look like Kiriko Busujima's doing.
-Kiriko Busujima? -Yes.
The head of the Deisan Organization who's under suspicion
of having sent a hitman to assassinate him.
I understand.
Break left at the next intersection.
What's up?
How do you have it?
Do you hear them talking?
No.
Although they are too far away to feel anything.
By the way, come to think of it, you know where it is in Shu?
Ah, nothing.
I've been looking for the Akai for days too.
I guess you've also explained to him what our situation is, right?
Yes, and I told him about this boy's transmitter and microphone.
And that's what he told me on the phone:
(Jodie) "Really?
(Jodie) "That's it."
I haven't heard from him since.
(Jodie) "That's it." I haven't heard from him since. He lost his girlfriend and he's changed a lot;
he's just withdrawn into himself.
Although he wasn't exactly an outspoken man before, either.

Xxxt!
I feel something.
This voice...
(Gin) And at 4 o'clock on DJ will cross a bridge.
"It will be there, where the murder."
"It's in Gin!"
(Gin) This time the Chianti and in Korn will act as reinforcement.
(Chianti) What?
As reinforcement?
I want to... shoot.
Man, no offense.
Your vehicle is a custom-made armored car.
The park device wouldn't work.
I don't agree!
Besides, protected by 2 bodyguards on both sides...
"Who have been trained in the Self-Defense Forces."
The 7.62 millimeter bullets they fire...
may be able to penetrate the thinnest window...
but they will never touch DJ.
So, how do you plan to kill him?
What do you want me to do?
That I'm gonna hitch a ride in a hitchhike..,
get in his car or something?
(Motorcycle: approaching)
(Vermott) Holy cow, Chianti.
Now that's a good idea.
Vermott!
I'll go with this motorcycle
and drop right in front of DJ's vehicle
to force him to stop the car.
And when he gets out...
Then, I'll come up from behind... and execute her.
Your job at that point
will be to get rid of the 2 bodyguards
who will get out of the car along with DJ.
But...cautious as he is,
I doubt that man will want to get out of the car so easily.
-Ha-ha-ha!
Don't worry.
If he sees that a woman has a bleeding head
because her helmet has blown off and she's lying on the ground badly hurt....
A man of justice like him will not hesitate to come to her aid,
don't you think?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Stop joking!
There will be other cars on the bridge too.
If a famous actress like you gets badly hurt...
You fool... The face you'll see... is this!
The Kiriko Busujima of the Organization!
Vermott, it's prodigious.
You're right!
Yes, of course, that's why we had to have one more woman for the plan!
Gin, what's the exact location?
Assassins in DJ a... Vein B.
Oh!
Vein... B.
(James) "Vein... B?"
That's where they're going to try to assassinate you this time?
Yes.
It will be at 4 o'clock.
It looks like they're going to kill Mr. Domon
when his car goes over a bridge in the city.
I get it!
That is, the B in "Vein B" stands for "bridge".
But if we can't pinpoint exactly which bridge it is,
we won't be able to stop the murder.
Quiet!
Right now... they're checking the map.
Maybe now they'll say the name of the site.
Korn, you're here.
Chianti, in this position.
We're counting on you, do a good job!
Where's my motorcycle?
Ah, it's behind that container.
Thank you. Thank you.
Come on, we'll meet you in front of Vein B.
Hey, Kir.
Don't tell me you...
you're with this story.
Nonsense.
This is impossible.
"What was that?"
Well, I'll move on for now.
Cover for me if anything happens.
This plan to assassinate him... there's something about it that gives me the creeps.
(Chianti) You can count on it.
If things start to get ugly
and you run the risk of falling into his hands,
it won't do me any harm to put a bullet in your little head.
Yes.
If the time comes, will you do me a favor and point it in my face?
It wouldn't be much fun for the world to know
that I had a hand in this murder... for many reasons.
Vermott, is there anything really bothering you?
No, it's just a feeling I have.
Don't worry about it.
Well, we'll get going, too.
"Let's see, I don't know how much you know about us,
"But do you really think you'll be able to...
"Stop us...,"
"... esteemed thoroughbred?"
In the end we couldn't figure out which place it is.
No, it's been a while since the sound has become much harder to feel.
The only clue we have is that it might be the bridge somewhere.
I have an idea!
Maybe we'll find out by calling candidate Domon's election office.
Let's ask them where he's headed at the moment
and which bridge he will cross.
I have called them several times, but they have refused to tell me anything.
I have been so insistent that now they think I am going with bad intentions.
What a mess.
Unless we find out what the 'Vein' in 'Vein B' means,
we won't be able to change that the wind is blowing against them.
"The direction of the wind?"
"Vein" could be V-A-I-N.

It has meanings like useless, worthless or sinning in vanity.
You mean that in Tokyo there must be a place with a name like this.
No, it is not that.
It's not "Vain", but "vane", from V-A-N-E!
Eh?
You mean the term "vane" from the blades of windmills?
Yes.
A word that at the same time
refers to the feathers of the arrow of a bow.
And the name of the place we have nearby
that suggests this arrow is Toriyacho!
In other words, Vane B is the Toriya Bridge,
i.e. the Toriya Oohashi!
This is to celebrate!
We still have 2 hours until 4 pm,
the time they will commit the murder!
Finally we have a way to follow their trail!
There are 6 people in total.
3 women and 3 men.
2 of these women will move by motorcycle
and the other 4 will arrive in different cars,
one of which will be a Porsche 365 A.
Anyway, we will send the vehicle of our investigators...
to the bridge immediately
and order them to block the roads leading to the bridge.
That way we will surround them all, right?
No.
We'll keep a cool head and sneak up on them.
We'll make sure we catch them all, one by one....
Goddamn it!
Doctor, why should a famous detective like me...
should be at home playing with a video game console?
(Agasa) What's wrong with that?
I had nothing to do either, right?
It's a game of deductions that I created myself and I'm proud of it!
I wanted you to be the first to try it.
But a lot of crimes happen in this game.
This is already the third one.
So much is this!
Nobody is really going to die here.
And if you can make the player suffer from the deaths,
it serves its purpose.
I wish people would limit killing to video games.
The sadness one experiences when someone dies for real
doesn't even compare to what you see in video games.
By the way, where is he in Conan?
Doctor Agasa, wasn't that with you?
Ah, yes...
You have returned home before us
because it started pouring rain.
I guess I'll be going home too, then.
I'd hate for Conan to go hungry.
-Well, it's just... You can't go!
Conan won't be hurt, really.
Don't worry about him.
But don't go!
Please don't go!
Please don't go!
Calm down.
We understand each other.
If you ask me, I'll stay.
Are you happy?
("Thank you for everything")
