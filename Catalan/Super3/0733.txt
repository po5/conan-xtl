(Bell: ringing)
Viva!
Long live the bride and groom!
(Man) Congratulations, couple!
(Shouts of enthusiasm)
Congratulations, Masaru!
Many congratulations!

"A wedding feast and two shots."
Yam.
The food is not bad.
Oh, I don't know if we were right to come, Conan and me.
We don't know them at all, the bride and groom.
Don't worry, woman.
What table do you think they would have put me at, if I had come alone?
At the other tables there are only rich, old, uptight men.
Besides, when I go alone to this kind of places, I keep being approached by...
unknown parents who want to introduce me to their children
and they don't even let me eat in peace.
Yam.
Caram.
It's really hard, the life of rich girls!
Yes.
Something similar would happen to Masaru.
Until he fell in love at first sight
with the maid they had at the country house.
How romantic, isn't it?
He-he-he-he!
Dear guests, sorry to interrupt the fun.
It's time for the speeches
and it's my turn to introduce the people who will make them,
but first I have some news for you.
-News?
-What is it?
Masaru and Miho have celebrated their wedding in the church with a solemn ceremony.
with a solemn ceremony,
but the truth is that the day before yesterday
they already signed the marriage certificate at the town hall.
What?
Did you know, mother?
And now!
For me, it's the first news.
He has not consulted me at all.
I ask you, then,
to give them a round of applause again.
What a disaster!
The wine is finished.
Come on, Alisa, you've had enough.
You stay out of this.
I wouldn't have come if you hadn't insisted so much.
That one over there is one of the girls who wanted to marry Masaru.
Is that so?
What do you want?
More wine?
I'll bring it right away.
Yoshifumi.
Do me a favor, you're the bride's little brother.
It's not your turn to fetch more wine.
It's getting tiresome, sitting for so long.
It's good for me to stretch my legs once in a while.
He can't sit still even on a day like today.
He comes from a family of butlers, what do you expect?
How strong!
When I think that woman will have our fortune at her disposal.
The father wouldn't believe it, if he raised his head.
Now Mr. Kenshiro Hatakeyama,
president of Hatakeyama bank and uncle of the groom,
will say a few words to wish the new couple good luck.
(Applause)
In the washroom.
Hey, Conan, where are you going?
Eh?
Ep, man.
Where you going?
In the bathroom?
You know where it is?
Yes.
I know who you are.
Yes, thank you.
You came with the Suzuki consortium girl, didn't you?
Hm.
And you're Yoshifumi, the butler of this house.
Yes.
Years ago, when the mansion was built,
the butlers were my father and mother.
But they both died in an accident.
Oh... And what did they do, before?
They were farmers.
But in this area, the monkeys and wild boars wreak havoc.
So they decided to leave the farm and take up butlering.
Ah.
Oops, I didn't think so.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You were going to the bathroom, weren't you?
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
-How are we doing, girls?
-You think he was going to tell me that? -You think he was going to tell me that?
I hope you liked the food and everything.
Yeah, it was all very good, really, thank you.
That's good, I'm glad.
When the Miho and I get back from our honeymoon,
the three of us should come to see you at home in Tokyo.
Yes, of course we will come.

Will you bring us a souvenir?
Ha-ha!
Come on, let's go.
Let's see if I remember.
Hey, shouldn't you be with the girlfriend?
She'll get jealous, if she sees you talking to two such pretty girls.
-Don't worry about me.
-What?
I trust my husband.
That's strong, that's love.
Not feeling well, Miho?
You don't look well.
No, I'm just a little tired.
I'll take care of the guests, go to the hotel and rest for a while.
-Yes?
-Yoshifumi.
-No, I can't drink alcohol.
-Did you drink?
Will you do me the favor of accompanying Miho to the hotel with my car?
Oh, so much.
Aaah...
I think we should leave too.
You're right, you're right.
We'll say goodbye to Masaru.
Ui.
Where did he go?
He said he had a call from the Miho and left about 10 minutes ago.
(Man) Help us, please!
What happened?
A-to the parking lot... where the van is...
-What?
-It's-the boyfriend who's lying on the ground. -It's the boyfriend who's lying on the ground.
It can't be.
What?
-Oh, my God!
-What?
What?
(Think: Shinichi voice) "He's been shot at point-blank range."
Stop!
Masaru!
Don't touch anything until the police arrive.
Conan.
Ran.
Call the police.
Yes.
Is it true they found Masaru unconscious?
-Uncle...
-Hm.
(Shot)
Oh! (Gunshot)
What was that?
Looks like it was coming from across the river.
"It can't be."
Yes, it's where the hotel is.
Miho!
Miho!
Oh!
Oh!
I get it.
The ones who heard the shot were the same ones who are here...
plus Conan, who left a moment ago, right?
Yes.
In Conan called us and told us not to move in here,
to stay here and wait for the police.
Right.
Let's take a look at the other crime scene.
Yes.
What are you doing, Takagi?
What are you doing, Takagi?
We're looking for clues the killer may have left behind.
I've already found him.
Ah. (Takagi)
(Takagi) There's no doubt that this gun is the murder weapon.
Can you come over?
I need a couple of photos.
"Bamboo? What's it doing here?"
(Kenshiro) Tatsuya.
I know it's not the ideal time to talk about these things,
but what will happen to the shares I had in Masaru?
What worries me the most is that the employees are starting to get restless.
In Masaru he has died without descendants.
Therefore, his legitimate heirs are his mother and me, his sister.
No.
If the investigation shows that in Masaru has died before the Miho,
she would have automatically inherited
everything that Masaru had at the time of his death.
What do you mean?
What is the meaning of this?
Haven't you heard the master of ceremonies?
They were married the day before yesterday.
Eh?
And now what will happen to Masaru's fortune?
If it is true that the Miho has died after en Masaru,
those who will inherit the fortune will be the Miho's legitimate heirs.
Oh!
It can't be.
And now!
I will not consent to nonsense.
We can't do anything, that's what the law says.
I don't understand how there can be such unjust laws.
I am sorry to have to stay here at such a hard time.
The mother is very affected
and we have left her resting in her room.
It is all right.
For the time being, we have let the rest of the guests go,
once they have shown that they had an alibi
at the same time as the two murders were committed.
Does this mean we are suspects?
For the time being, no.
It means that you all had a close relationship with the victims.
I understand this is a difficult time,
but I have to ask you to cooperate.
Tatsuya and I were at the side of Masaru's body
when we felt the trait that the Miho has died.
We have alibi, at least as far as the Miho's death is concerned.
Yes.
We have learned that the bullets we have extracted from the two corpses
were fired from the same gun,
the one we found in the hotel flower bed.
Therefore, we can be almost certain...
that both crimes are the work of a single culprit.
This proves that we are...
But if I am not mistaken and if I understand correctly..,
at that time the ladies Rikako and Alisa had retired at the hotel.
Calm down, don't be hasty.
Are you insinuating that I am the murderer?
All these are only hypotheses.

It has only been a few hours since the crimes have been committed
and we have not discovered what could be the motive of the person responsible.
First I would like to speak to Mr....
Yoshifumi, the bride's brother.
Yes?
The inquiries we have made so far have led us to discover
that he owes a debt of a few million yen to various lenders.
Hm?
Eh?
What the...?
I need you to confirm or deny it.
Yes.
I do have debts.
But that doesn't make me a murderer.
Besides, my sister was the only family I had.
Hey, Chiba.
What were you doing?
Hey, Conan.
I was reviewing the camera footage.
It's the entrance camera that's installed in the lobby,
so it also includes the flower bed where we found the gun.
I've reviewed all the images you've recorded tonight,
but no one's gone near the flower bed.
So how did it end up there, the gun?
I don't know, maybe they dropped it from some upstairs window.
Hm?
"What must these 4 grooves be?"
Oh!
(Man) Yes, they called me this afternoon to tell me...
that there was a streetlight that was out.
Well... now that you mention it...
And you didn't see anything strange?
-Eh?
- (door: closes)
Hm?
What time was it?
Let's see, let me look for it...
(door closes) Here.
I got the call at three quarters to five minutes to 10 o'clock at night.
So, it must have been three quarters to 10.
"Three-quarters of 10? What does that mean?"
"At three-quarters of 10, the Miho had just left the mansion."
"That's half an hour before we found Masaru's body."
"I got it!"
"But then..."
Eh?
(Man) Ep, boy.
You shouldn't be roaming the streets at that hour.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
There's plenty of starving monkeys around here
that could really dig in for a good bite.
Ah.
"Oh, right. If you've used the..."
We had no reason to kill at Masaru!
But if you had long wanted to get rid of you
because your husband could preside over the Hatakeyama group;
I already know you.
I have never heard such nonsense!
You really wanted to kill the Miho, who had stolen you in Masaru.
Maybe she found you out in Masaru and you had to kill her too.
What a fool you are!
They said that in Masaru she had died before her.
What's the matter, have you got greed in your head, or what?
What?
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
Inspector Megure.
Y-yes?
We've had enough of this...
Aaah!
Aaah...
Sonoko.
Has the inspiration come to you yet?
(Sonoko voice) I've never liked to meddle in other people's lives.
But, if I don't say anything, the only thing to gain is the murderer.
So-Sonoko.
Does this mean you've discovered the culprit?
What do you mean?
Yes.
If the police did their job properly,
it wouldn't have been necessary for me to get involved.
Rikako.
You only said one thing that was true before.
I did?
The first one to die was the Miho.
What!
At that time only Rikako and Alisa had returned to the hotel.
-Me neither!
-I already told you that it wasn't me!
I know, it was neither one nor the other.
The crime took place just after the Miho arrived at her bungalow.
That's why she was still wearing the same clothes.
You accompanied her by car
and killed her after she was in the system at the bungalow, right, Yoshifumi?
What?
What?
What are you talking about?
You've been up to your neck in water for a long time.
You thought you could pay off your debts
when your sister got married,
but there's been a snag.
That's why tonight you slipped something in her drink
and took her to the bungalow when she started to feel sick.
There, you killed her with the gun you had hidden in your pocket...
and you used a mattress to muffle the sound of the gunshot.
(Shot)
Next, you called Masaru from the Miho's cell phone
and killed her in the parking lot in the same way.
(Shot)
Wait a minute, stop the car.
What about the murder weapon?
They found it in the hotel flowerbed.
I have been with you at Masaru's side
until the police arrived.
How could I have gotten rid of the murder weapon?

This is what made my head dance the most.
Why had the killer thrown the gun precisely there?
Until I realized.
In fact, he didn't throw it there.
It fell by chance.
The mansion and the hotel are opposite each other, with the river in between.
It was humanly impossible
to carry the gun in person across the river once killed in Masaru.
Unless you had a trick used.
And why should I have done?
And why not?
Masaru's family was talking a while ago.
To make sure that the Miho would inherit Masaru's fortune
and it ended up in your hands,
you needed the police to determine at all costs
that she had died after him.
To achieve this,
it was imperative that the gun turn up on this side of the river.
Th-that's your imagination.
You have no proof.
Do you remember seeing a man carrying a ladder?
Huh?
He was the hotel maintenance man,
who had gone out to fix one of the streetlights.
You remember seeing someone running out of the bungalow.
Just before Masaru was killed.
This is enough to prove that the Miho died first.
And the being we heard from the parking lot?
It came from the other side of the river.
The feature has been the icing on the cake
of the ingenious alibi you've put together.
Go ahead, please.
Oh!
Does this machine look familiar?
I'm sure it does, because we found it in your house.
What... what is this device?
A scarecrow.
It shoots firecrackers that are used to scare away birds
that come to eat the rice grains in autumn.
It turns out that in this area they also use it to scare monkeys.
Oh, and know that it was programmed to fire a single firecracker.
The noise you felt came from here.
Oh, shit!
It's my sister's fault!
She was supposed to marry the heir of a multi-millionaire family
and she told me she wouldn't give me anything.
How can you be so insensitive!
(She cries)

"Poor Ran. She's really touched."
"I guess that's normal, after what happened at the wedding."
Hey, Ran, what do you say we have a special dinner today to cheer you up?
Come on, I'll offer to be the cook.
The other day I saw a program on TV
where they explained how to make a finger-licking curry.
No way, no way.
Curry has too many calories.
Although the last case was very tragic,
when we got home I weighed myself
and I had put on two kilos!
Can you believe it?
Two kilos!
"Heh, heh! That's why she's so depressed."
(Sonoko) Raaaan!
(Sonoko) Good morning.
Hey, good morning.
Sonoko.
What a face, girl.
Ouch...
You know what?
When we got back from the wedding,
I weighed myself and I had gained 3 kilos.
I've put on two.
If we don't lose weight before the summer we won't be able to wear our bikinis!
But... next week, don't you weigh yourselves at the school check-up?
Wow!
What do we do, Ran?
Exercise.
We must run, come on!
Come on, let's go!
"Oh, my goodness. I'm getting thinner by dint of disgust."
(Agasa) Oh!
The cherry trees are all in bloom.
It's a perfect day, you can't ask for more.
Super good luck.
I have some bad news, Shinichi.
There's been a murder.
I feel like I just witnessed a crime, I tell you what.
Five-yen coins painted with black marker...
Could it be... in Kurobe?
