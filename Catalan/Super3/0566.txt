-Thanks.
You'll like it.
- "Buy yams!"
What a face... Crying gets you everything you want, doesn't it?
Be careful, it burns, you have to blow.
That's it.
There you go, Tasta'l.
Eh?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Noel!
Have you seen a two-year-old boy named Noel?
He's about this tall.
He's wearing a lilac sweater and green pants.
Noel!
Where have you been?
Noel!
Noel! XXT, shut up.
Noel, where are you?!
Noel!
Watch out!
Over there!
Over there!
What?!
This can't be, Noel.
Stay close to me.
There, there! What's wrong?
Flights look at the cars, now? No, no!
"Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano."
"When we meet face to face the mystery begins."
"A little boy with a very cute name will make Conan sweat."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"My friend Noel."
One, two;
one, two;
one, two... What?
That the father asked you?
Yes, he asked me to keep an eye on him.
Go on through.
(All) Yes!
One, two;
one, two;
one, two;
one, two...
What's your name? Santa Claus!
Santa Claus?
Lucky you, you have a very original name.
And how old are you?
Two years old!
How cute!
Ran! Father!
-What are you doing here?
-Mom!
Mother!
Conan, I hope you haven't let him out of your sight.
No.
Let me introduce you: this is Shigeko Ishikawa.
How do you do?
What?
You've been given a push?
On the catwalk?
Yes.
A person wearing a helmet pushed me and made me fall.
I work in a laundry delivering clean clothes to homes.
While I was carrying an order...
(Squeals)
Luckily, yours truly happened to be passing by.
This time it hasn't gone wrong,
but he says that for the last four or five days
that strange things have been happening around him.
It's like I'm being watched.
Always, day and night.
If they were watching her from afar, there would be nothing to do,
but a push is something else.
"Here's an interesting case," I thought.
So I noticed, left Conan babysitting....
and I started to investigate immediately.
(Think) "What animal..." That he doesn't have a family anymore?
No.
My husband died last year, so we have no one.
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Mouri.
You must be very busy.
Don't suffer, woman.
I'm a single father and I have a daughter, and I know it's a very hard life.
If something were to happen to you, unfortunately,
this poor child would be left on the street.
And my sense of justice
does not allow anyone to play with something so serious, never!
(He thinks) "The intention is good,
but I just need to see a pretty face to start talking nonsense."
Excuse me, madam, you have no idea who the person in the helmet might be?
-No, no idea. Well, come on, let's go!
When I catch this wretch, I assure you, he'll really feel me!
(laughs)
One, two;
one, two;
one, two...
Vaaa...
Relax your shoulders and act normal.
-Don't let them suspect I'm here.
-Yes.
(Think) "Perfect! I have an excellent view from here."
What a stick, I spend my time cleaning up after you.
Have you set out to fuck me or what?
(Liquid: mana)
Chof!
Ouch...
Ouch...
"And we continue. Yesterday a beautiful panda cub was born at the zoo."
- "It is one of the few cubs..." - (doorbell)
Good morning!
I come from Sun Sun Cleaning.
-Go ahead, you can come in now.
Thank you, thank you.
Well... Why did you do that?
What's wrong with you, Noel?
What's the matter, Noel?
Ah!
What's wrong with you?

Not here, hold on a little bit!
Not yet, not yet!
(Toilet chain)
For me?
A candy melted... Poop, 'fallacies.
You're welcome, thanks for the candy.
Now that I didn't expect.
You caught me off guard.
Conan!
Is he okay, the kid?
Noel!
Conan!
Noel!
What's wrong, Mr. Mouri? Ah, Conan!
Are you all right?
A man has kidnapped the Shigeko and taken him away.
He's kidnapped it? Yes.
The coward was hiding in a customer's house waiting for her...
and kidnapped her.
Who would want to harm a mother of a family?
Don't worry, Mr. Mouri has already arrived.
We will report him to the police.
It will be all right, my boy.
What then?
Did you find the Shigeko Ishikawa?
No.
In the back seat of the car, we found small traces of blood.
Maybe he did himself wrong trying to resist.
The car was stolen five days ago in the Haido district.
There is a report.
(Thinking) "The man in the helmet again?"
The culprit didn't take the purse.
This means that the motive for the kidnapping
was not the victim's money.
Shigeko is an attractive woman.
The culprit may be secretly in love with her,
lost his patience and resorted to force.
A great love taken to the extreme!
He will pay for it!
But if he was in love, why did he push her?
Conan, how many times do I have to tell you to mind your own business?
Get out of my sight! Yes...
(thinks) "The bag is open and the contents have fallen out."
"No, it's scattered. That I was looking for something in the bag?"
Thank you very much, Noel.
(Think) "Just as I imagined."
"The culprit was looking for something. He came around half past one."
"He must have kidnapped the Shigeko and taken the key."
"What was he supposed to be looking for?"
"A bird feather? What's it doing here?"
(Knocks)
Hello, Noel.
How are you?
I brought you a little present.
Wow!
What a scattering you've done, right?
It's just that we were playing wrestling.
Who are you?
He's a friend of yours?
Yes.
Soc in Minoru Moriwaki, the upstairs neighbor.
I study at Beika University.
Nice to meet you.
Do you know if there are any birds in this house?
I found this feather on the floor.
But the windows were closed, so I don't know how it got in.
It must have fallen to someone who had it stuck to his clothes.
You must have carried it yourself on the soles of your shoes.
(Thinking) "Maybe someone carried it without realizing it."
"Could it have been the culprit?" Let's see?
It's a feather from Mejiro.
Shall we look at your bird book, Noel?
Book, we look!
Look, the Mejiro has white around the eyes.
It's from the sparrow family.
There's another one called "Meguro".
Oops, this one is endangered.
Hey, hey!
Didn't I give you a figurine of a Mekkiro the other day, Noel?
My friend gave it to me!
You gave it to a friend of yours?
(Think) "A Mejiro's feather, a Mejiro's figurine..."
"What a coincidence, isn't it?"
"Maybe it has something to do with the Shigeko kidnapping."
Hey, Noel, which friend did you give the figurine to?
What do you remember?
There, there, here!
Ah, I see you have many friends.
And now where do we have to go, Noel?
Where is the house of that friend of yours who is waiting for a gift?
There!
(He thinks) "Too bad! I'll end up dragging my ears on the floor."
Mm?
Oh.
Look at that.
(thinks) "No. Don't make guilty faces."
That doesn't stretch my ears!
Look at that!
Oh!
Ay, ay, ay, ay!
All straight, right? Let me see it!
Come on, Noel, where do we pull now?
You're not telling me anything?
Noel, wake up, please, we have not finished yet.
Noel!
"Momir."
I know you're sleepy.
Hold on a little longer, come on.
No!
"Momir!"
(thinks) "I do feel like crying."
Mr. candy.
Mr. Candy?
What gave you this?
Yes.
(Laughs) All right.
Wow!
This afternoon at five?
(thinks) "It's half past five. I don't have much time."
(Stirring)
Noel, are you okay?
Do you know if your neighbor, Mr. Yamanaka, has a pet store?
Yes, if my memory serves me correctly,

told me that came birds and aquarium fish.
Would you give me the name and address of the store, please?
-'plau!
-Yes, it was Beika's district three.
But it seems to me that it had to close.
(Think) "What? Today at five o'clock in the closed store?"
"And if Noel's mother was there?"
"What a good time she has! Well, she'd better laugh than not cry."
"I get it!"
"It stopped him from running off after the candy man."
"That's why he got so mad."
Hello, senyor.
Who are you?
We've lost someone.
Actually, we're looking for your mother.
It's here, isn't it?
No.
There's no one else here.
I'm all alone.
I'm sorry, children, but I'm very busy.
Go home.
Hey, that little bird you've got locked in the cage is a Meguro, right?
What do you mean?!
No, it's a Meguro.
Oh, is it?
Well, it's right here in the book.
"Meguro. Species protected by law."
"Named for the black spot around its eyes."
"It is characterized by the yellow plumage that covers its chest."
"Its favorite food is papaya."
No, you're wrong!
If this bird is the endangered Meguro's bird
it could sell for a fortune.
Go away and leave me alone!
By the way, haven't you been to the Shigeko's house?
The feather I found on the floor proves it.
She must have had it stuck to her clothes
and it fell off without her noticing.
What's that?
No, not me.
Are you sure?
If you turn yourself in to the police,
maybe they'll reduce your sentence.
To the police?
And why should I go, if I haven't done anything wrong?
I don't have time to play with you!
If you don't leave right now, you'll hear me!
It's just that I haven't finished yet.
It's all been a misunderstanding.
What do you mean, misunderstanding?
You found this figurine on your doorstep, didn't you?
You want to know who left it?
You tell him, Noel.
-Noel! -It can't be...
You gave him a candy the other day, remember?
Well, you gave him back the present.
What?
Do you know why he wants to be called Noel?
Because he loves Santa Claus.
And he also wants to hand out presents to people, like Santa Claus.
Santa Claus... Presents...
The... The figurine was a... was a present?
Sure, now I understand everything.
Look, you can tell that this creature appreciates you very much,
and, besides, I think she trusts you.
You wouldn't want me to end up crying, would you?
Noel, I'm sorry.
Mom!
My business was not going well and I was accumulating debts.
I went to the mountains of Ogasawara to die
without anyone knowing
and I found a Meguro,
a bird native to the islands that is in danger of extinction.
In Kurata, the man who leaves me the money I need,
told me that he knew a bird enthusiast
who was interested in buying it.
But the other day, on my way out,
I found a figurine of a Meguro on the door.
and I saw a woman smiling at me enigmatically, as if she had discovered me,
as if she had discovered me.
I knew she wanted to sell the bird!
I imagined that the figurine and the smile were a silent threat.
were a silent threat.
We had only come to bring him the figurine.
Then how come you hired that famous detective?
I searched his house first
to take away any evidence against me
that could compromise the sale of the bird.
So it was him.
I was so amused by the look on his face as he stared at the ball machine
that I gave him a piece of candy, but I didn't know how to interpret...
that he had come to return the gift.
You know what?
From now on I will do everything I can
to become a man worthy of receiving gifts from Santa Claus.
Hm.
Take care of the Meguro, please.
Sir.
You have.
Wow, a Meguro! Take a good look, sir.
This bird is a meguro.
What?
A Mekkira?
No, it's got black around the eyes, I'm sure it's a Meguro.
You're wrong, what happens is...
the white paint has fallen off and you can see the black underneath.
What is it?
It's true!
The paint has worn off!
The greed has blinded my sight
and I did not notice this little detail.
Noel, I'll take good care of it.
Take care!
I've had enough of cheesiness.
Go to the police, if you want.

I'll take the bird.
Stop!
This bird has to go home!
Shut up! Stop it!
-You stay out of this, brat! -I'll call the police!
If you want, call him.
Go ahead...
Hang up the phone.
I'll do what you tell me, but please don't hurt him.
I'll take the creature away until it's in a safe place.
Noel! Kurata!
(Thinks) "It must have broken down when I fell to the ground."
-Kurata!
Stop it! -Everybody freeze.
Nobody move.
-Aaai!
-Aaaah!
Now!
He's got it!

The police told me
that they will take into account the circumstances in Yamanaka.
-Really? -Yes.
Oh!
You're very kind, Noel.
Mm?
That you're dressed up?
-Where are you going with this bow?
-It's a present, Ran put it on.
You look beautiful, Haruka.
Gorgeous?
No way!
-But she's a girl in Noel? -Yes.
And you, Ran, how did you notice?
It seemed to me before, when he hugged me.
I had heard that girls, when they hug you,
they support you with their whole body.
Conan.
And you, did you know that too? No, and now.
(Think) "In fact I didn't realize it until I took him to the bathroom."
You've spent the whole day with her without knowing she was a girl?!
No way!
Hahaha!
What's so funny?
You can come and play whenever you want, you feel?
And take the mother!
(Think) " 'Take the mother'.... I knew you'd say that."
Hot springs park? Hey, that looks like fun!
What do you want us to do? For starters, we'll go to the caldera.
(Thinking) "This is so weird."
Someone who wanted to kill him has thrown it expressly
from the wall, it was not an accident, but a murder.
(He thinks) "I have discovered the trick the culprit has used."
