THE MIRACLE OF KOSHER.
DO NOT SURRENDER TO THE INVISIBLE DEVIL.
(Announcer) Just one more player eliminated
and Kohnan High School will win the championship!
No way!
If the game ends, the man will blow himself up with the bomb!
We don't have time to go to the Alps or the away stands!
(He thinks) "Why is there nothing written?"
"The fact that there is nothing written means? A zero? Nothing? Blank?"
(Audience: shouting)
He hit it!
An interesting ball is going to the left!
Will he be able to catch it?
Will he be able to get out?
Will he be able to change the score?
Will the game be over?
Don't take the ball, you fool!
He lost the ball!
Good! Very good!
That's good!
"He's lost it."
"Wait a second. If I'm not mistaken..."
As the ball is being driven through the outfield,
the player runs to third base...
Hey, Kudo!
What's wrong?
The runner is thrown out at second base!
The ball goes past third base and back towards home plate!
Salvat!
That's fantastic!
Wow, he hit a home run!
They've turned the score around!
Heiji!
But...
What's the matter?
Did you find anything?
Ask this guy here...
Hey, look at this map.
In the same way that at the entrance of the stadium,
the entrances from number 1 to 24 are indicated...
But 17 and 22 are missing!
They are not there?
The entrance number...
Number 17 and number 22... That's right!
That's why there is no numerical code!
I think they blocked the 17th and 22nd entrances quite a long time ago
to build some kind of facility.
But which is it?
17 or 22?
Where do we start looking?
I know we do.
We have no choice.
We start with number 17.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Looks like we won't have that much time...
(Radio: announcer) "Let's go for the big closer."
"We're in the bottom of the ninth inning,
"And we've got 2 players out and on base!"
"Ohgane has gained a point and they're tied."
The next batter is known for the 3 big hits he has made,
by 3 reached base and one at home plate.
(Megaphone: female) "Nagashima, number 4, third base."
Now they are really screwed up, yes sir!
Besides, he's the only one who scored.
(Kogoro) They won't want to risk him hitting a ball
and lose the game after all this.
Strike!
Wow, right down the middle!
How direct!
Hey, wait a minute, is this a duel?
I thought so... That pair are like Shinichi.
They're like Shinichi. Huh?
Like him?
Like Shinichi in high school,
during the soccer championship final...
They were in extra time and were losing by one goal.
The others scored when there was only a minute left to go,
all was lost...
"How I wanted to see the look on Shinichi's face,
"When the ball came back in the middle, I looked at him through the binoculars."
And I saw him smiling.
He was smiling?
Yes.
I asked the other guys on the team.
What do you think he said at that moment?
What did he say?
What did he say?
Well, he said...
"We're screwed."
"If we won now, we'd become a legend."
Oh!
How cute!
-Yes, speak! -Yes, speak!
-Well?
How did the match end?
Well, in the end... he lost.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Life is never as we would like it to be!
They lost the penalties...
Eh?
Penalties, you say?
This means that...
Yes... There was one minute left and with Shinichi's goal and assist...,
they made it to penalties.
"But in the end it was Shinichi who failed to score..."
"But seeing Pedro on his back, with the sad post,
"Made him so attractive..."
Oysters...
Oh.

But just... just a little bit, a little bit of nothing....
And I thought that those are very much like Shinichi then.
I mean they are tadpoles of the most and they are reluctant to lose.
As if they were creatures...
I'm sure they are.
I don't know if Heiji has it, that.
Strike two!
"Just hit the air! Twice useless."
Casum!
We are cornered!
This is awful!
We won't make it...
-Mr. Ohtaki, baseball can't say anything until the last minute.
Don't waste your time getting bogged down with it
and try to find the meaning of the code!
Yes, I'm trying.
"In Nagashima, Kohnan's crack is cornered!"
"Will he be able to pull off the match?"
(Think) "Nagashima?"
Of course!
The missing number!
What?
There's no number in brackets because it's a number they pulled out!
That they took it out?
Between gates 21 and 23,
is the locker room of a professional team that trains here!
And they took out the number that showed where their gallery was!
But wasn't the area between entrances 21 and 23 where we were at the beginning?
"Eh? Ran!"
- (shouting)
- (ring)
"Damn it! Not being the phone with the screaming crowd!"
The INAO pitcher makes his 100th throw!
He's already thrown it!
He's hit it!
-Tanoca!
-Has it gone too high?
The outside center fielder opens his arms and waits for the ball to get where it is.
No more tackle for the Kohnan!
"Don't take it!"
"I'm coming, Hiroshi."
"Don't take it! Don't take it!"
"I'll join you..."
"Don't take it! Don't take it!"
Now, the INAO thrower makes his 100th throw!
He has already thrown it!
He's hit it!
-Tanoca!
-Has it gone too high?
The outside center fielder opens his arms and waits for the ball to get where it is.
No more tackle for the Kohnan!
"Don't take it!"
"I'm coming, Hiroshi..."
"Don't take it! Don't take it!"
"I'll join you..."
The 9 Ohgane players are making joyful gestures
because they already look like winners!
The outside center is still in good position to catch the ball
and slowly backing up.
Even though he is backing up...
(Big ovation)
He's done it!
He's done it!
He's hit a home run!
They've tied it!
They've tied it!
The Kohnan, in the last minute of the second half of the ninth inning,
with 2 players out, they're up 2-2 on the scoreboard!
-He's done it, he's done it!
-This high volley....
Blow...
(Think) "What is this? What the hell is going on?"
Dead ball!
That's already the second player this has happened to!
Ohgane's ace suddenly throws uncontrollably!
The home run there must have affected him.
He would have had to let the 4 walk to first base.
What airs and graces he puts on.
If he gets tagged once and then gets out of control?
It's all over now.
He didn't touch anything!
Very good!
I don't understand this pitcher...
The match is 2-2 and will be extended!
(Ring)
What is that noise?
A telephone?
(Ring)
Kazuha, it's behind your feet...
(Ring)
Apa!
(Ring)
A cell phone again?
What a nerve...
Shall we answer?
He... Heiji?
Hey, you!
I found the last cell phone!
Dig in and show yourself at once!
Heiji!
The game isn't over yet.
This is an extension.
An extension?
"Yes..."
"The Koshien demon's favors will be seen...
"Just before the game ends."
What?
It says this is an extension but there's no code here!
What a rage!
Mr. Ohtaki, please look it up!
I'm convinced that it must still be this way!
(Mobile: pip)
"A message?"
Mr. Ohtaki, I'll look on the right,
you take care of it from the left!
Wait!
Looks like we won't need to look for him any longer...
You can tell we're in the Koshien finals!
It's a fantastic match!
"This place isn't so fantastic."
"Exactly."
"If you guys weren't crazy and tadpoles who wouldn't stop cheering."
"If this place didn't exist...,"
"My son shouldn't..."
He dropped the ball!

He dropped it!
The catcher has missed a very simple volley!
The Ohgane school is playing the second half of the tenth inning
as if the Koshien demon has possessed them!
The erratic hitting, the defensive play that has been chosen and the error committed,
added to having the bases loaded,
has put them in a critical situation!
Plus, the next batter is... number 3, third base....
In Nagashima!
Now they really are... between a rock and a hard place!
Ohgane's 9 players gather around the mound!
The catcher to whom the ball has fallen can't lift his head.
"Of course he can't."
"He's made a fool of himself in the middle of all these people."
"The other nine teammates must have taken a dislike to him.
"And both the player and his parents, siblings and relatives...
"will have to endure the embarrassment."
"Just for a silly thing like this."
(Inaudible)
(Kazuha) They are smiling.
That pitcher is smiling...
Really?
The Ohgane return to their positions with a smile!
They're not giving up!
They can't be... How can they keep smiling?
How can they do it being the way they are?
So this is baseball.
You can't play baseball...
unless you have a team of 9 players.
I'm convinced that Ohgane's pitcher...
is thinking for himself and for the rest of the team...
and for the catcher who has made the error,
that this ball will be his
even if he has to break his arm to get it!
He's given it to him!
But the ball has veered slightly to the left and has gone out!
And well, that player...
wants to make his teammate get to the base of goal
and bats with all his might.
But, still, you don't know who's going to win!
It's ridiculous.
If they make an inordinate effort and take wrong, they will not be able to be professional!
They could throw away their sporting career!
Say!
What the hell is wrong with this Koshien?
(Announcer) Devastating!
This time it's good!
The ball has gained quite a distance!
Will he make it?
No good!
Another one out!
There's nothing...
Naturally, I think there are kids who want to excel...
and become professional players.
But this is before the game starts.
Once you put your feet on the field and it feels "ball in play",
for those kids it's a battlefield
where you can only... win... or lose!
Out!
With 3 players on the bases, they have not been able to get any runs!
-They just want to win, win and win...
And get the championship.
(Ohtaki) At that time...
they don't think about what things they can win or what things they can lose...
It's a very simple feeling.
And since you are very involved in baseball, you know how it goes.
Am I right?
Mr. Yukio Torimitsu,
advisor to the Teito Jitsugyou High School baseball team?
Your son was not run over
because of the truck or because of the Koshien...
Your son trained too hard that day
and braked too late...
Yes, it's true...
I knew it...
I knew it, but...
I couldn't bear it if I didn't blame it on someone.
I had to do it to appease the heart...
that was broken when I lost my son...
But... You allowed me to set off the detonator.
You...
and these two teams, neither...
Of course you didn't.
From all over Japan,
this is where the most tadpoles who can't stand to lose gather!
That's true!
-Yes...
-Shall we go?
(Megaphone: female) "We are in the first half of the eleventh inning..."
"Ohgane school at bat."
(Ohtaki) Yes, that's right... Yes...
Okay, thank you very much.
A person from this jurisdiction will come and get it.
It's amazing that we managed to decipher that code
(Ohtaki) I came up with it all of a sudden.
Yes... We found out that 812 was in the Alpine stands right away...
Thanks to the man with the most ridiculous jokes in Japan.
Aaa... aaaaatxim!
Did you catch a cold?
What's wrong with him?
Silly!
I never catch a cold!
It's just that these seats are in the stands, in the outer field...
Aren't we the Alps?
He-he-he-he-he!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Kogoro) What a good joke!
Yes?
What's up.
Ran!
(Kogoro) Mr. Kimura!
Mr. Kimura!

Mr. Kimura!
And the next Conan: "The target is Kogoro Mouri!"
