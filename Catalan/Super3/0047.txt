(Off) "The cases he investigates in Conan get more complicated every day.
"Today's case happens in a sports club.
"The truth always comes out in the end!
"He looks like a kid, but he's got the brains of an adult
and he's... Detective Conan!"

DETECTIVE CONAN
The sports club murder case
(Off) "The sports club had made renovations,
and we had won a prize
which gave us the right to try out the facilities
the day before they opened."
Oysters!
I can't take it anymore!
I'm exhausted... I can't move.
You're a mess.
This is what you get for drinking too much and not exercising.
Detectives use the body from the waist up.
(Think) From the waist down, in your case.
Mrs. Reiko, what can you tell us?
The reform of the sports club was a dream we had for a long time.
And it has finally come true.
As a former trampoline jumper, I consider sports to be important.
And in the hope of helping people, we are reopening this club.
Hey, Conan.
Mm?
Let's go check out the new pool?
Yes!
Wow, that's nice, it's all glass!
Hey, looks like someone's doing some jumping jacks.
-Bravo!
Very nice!
Splendid! -A perfect jump!
Did you see how well he does it?
He's a jumper from this club.
They said his name was Saijo.
Come on, Keiichi!
Give it a try!
(laughs) What are you doing, man?
And you're a jumper for life?
Come, I'll tell you a little something.
I have to train, but we're busy preparing for the inauguration and...
-It's just this?
Lack of practice? -What do you mean by that?
That with a jump like the one you did, you can see who will win the competition.
What... What did you say?!
Please stop!
There are people watching and reporters.
Be careful, Kijima.
Don't order me around, now.
What?
And now... I didn't mean to give you any orders.
It's all very well that you look like a sissy, with this earring you're wearing.
Do you think you have the right to talk to me in that tone?
Keiichi, let's go to Entrain-us-e!
It's on Hisa Kijima, former rival of Naoya Saijo.
He lost his championship title when he won at Naoya Saijo
and now he is a swimmer.
This is the pride of our club.
A competition pool for racing and diving.
We will be able to see how the jumpers train.
Watch out!
Naoya!
The competition is coming up, so don't do any more dangerous jumps.
You'll get hurt, and you're our ace.
You mean, Reiko?
It seems to have tasted bad to you, that I didn't get hurt.
Ah... Naoya, you're such a joke!
I can't cheat, can I, Miss Saeki?
(Punch)
You're a disgusting person, Naoya!
I know why you say all this.
Maybe there's no proof,
but if I spread this rumor, the tax inspectors would come.
(Thinking) The IRS?
What are you doing, Conan?
What are you doing here?
Aaaaaaaaaa...
Oh, Naoya...
above all don't forget, the party is in the office at 8 o'clock.
I think I'm going back to training.
(Think) "A picture taken secretly?
The boy is in Keiichi."
Hey, he dropped this!
He dropped this.
Sorry, I always put earplugs in my ears when I'm training.
Thank you.
Any more and I lose the lunch voucher.
(Think) The lunch voucher?
Aaaaau!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Oh, goody!
You exercised too much.
Quit smoking and drinking, if you want to go back to the gym.
After health is the only merit you have.
That sports club is the best!
I'd like to join.
And you, Conan?
Yes, I would.
Come on, father, cheer up.
Hey, hey, hey!
Look!
Look!
There's a message!
Come on, Father, please.
Let's have a look.
I hope it's a job.
Oysters.
(Answering machine) "Hello, Kogoro, it's me, Inspector Megure!
Inspector?
"Sorry to bother you.
"Could you come to the Saeki Sports Club?
"Come with Ran and Conan.
They found Naoya Saijo's body."
What?!
No way!

Inspector Megure!
Ah... thanks for coming, Kogoro!
Sorry it took so long.
What's happened?
It seems to me that it's a pretty clear-cut case.
We'll have to wait for the coroner's reports,
but from the degree of stiffness, she died between 8 and 9 p.m.
She drowned, right?
Let's not jump the gun just because we found her in the pool.
Conan's probably right.
Eh?
All signs point to Naoya's drowning.
He's got foam in his nose and mouth and a small hemorrhage in his ear.
The water has entered his nose and mouth
and has put pressure on his inner ear.
These are characteristics of an ofegat.
How do you know this?
Aaa... I saw it in a mystery movie...
they did on TV...
I know he used to jump on the diving board, but he was a great swimmer.
It seems strange that he drowned.
What?
In the front, did he sting something?
There's a mark here.
Yes, that must be it.
He must have jumped and miscalculated the jump.
It would be a very dangerous jump.
I asked you to come here because I was told that he had come here
and that you saw how he made the jumps.
Yes.
A little more and he'll give it to you in the afternoon.
Listen, Mrs. Saeki: nobody saw the accident?
He was training alone, in Naoya?
Shut up, kid!
Stay out of it!
Was he alone?
Yes, we were all in the office.
We were making the final preparations for tomorrow's inauguration
and we were celebrating.
It was getting close to the competition, and I was training whenever I could.
That must have been what he did tonight.
Kogoro, I have a witness who confirmed it.
A witness?
Yes.
An elderly man who lives on the second floor of that building.
He says he saw a person jumping.
But he didn't see the accident, did he?
No, you're right!
He didn't see it.
I told you to stay out of it!
Inspector, I just remembered
that Naoya wore earplugs when he was training.
Yes, it's true, my men have taken them out.
These are the ones.
They're not the ones I wore this afternoon.
They must have been changed.
It wouldn't be so strange.
Can't you find, Inspector?
And the cap?
What exactly do you mean, Conan?
That, normally, jumpers don't wear a cap.
But look, pretty, he was not a normal jumper, and he wore!
You're a woodworm!
Conan, come back! Leave it.
Was it locked, Naoya's locker, Mr. Policeman?
Was it?
No... it was open.
Why do you want to know, that, kid?
It's the kid from Mr. Mouri's office.
Mouri's office.
(thinks) "What is it, that smell?
"It's chloroform!
There's no doubt about it!
This has been a murder!"
Although there are some unclear details,
everything indicates that it has been an accidental death.
(He thinks) "What does the inspector say now? It was a murder.
Thank you very much for coming, Kogoro.
Ah, you're welcome.
They don't deserve it, Inspector Megure.
Come on, it can't stay like this."
So, tomorrow we can do the inauguration as planned, sir?
I suppose so.
We'll have the results of the investigations tonight,
there won't be any problems.
Everybody felt it?
It was unfortunate, but it was an accidental death.
We open tomorrow.
We should go over all the details of the ceremony again.
(Thinking) "I have to hurry.
"When Naoya was killed, the guests were already outside.
"And it's very unlikely that someone from outside came in.
Most likely, someone who was in the club killed him."
Excuse me, gentlemen!
What's the matter with you, kid?
What's the matter, kid?
They've had a party here, haven't they?
Did anyone leave before the party was over?
I don't think so.
Everyone was having a good time, we wouldn't have noticed.
Thank you, gentlemen.
(Thinking) "This means that anyone could have left.
"In Naoya I had 3 enemies, as far as I know.
"The Reiko Saeki, because he was bribing her for tax evasion.
"On Hisa Kijima, who had taken her title.
"And on Keiichi Naruse, who was blackmailing him
with the photo proving he had a mistress.
"Surely the murderer is one of them.
"The only thing that fails me is that witness...
"His statement demolishes my theory.

I'll have to go talk to him."
(Doorbell rings)
What do you want, handsome?
Good evening, sir, my name is Conan Edogawa.
My uncle is a private detective and he wants me to ask you some questions.
Ask me questions?
Oooh!
Gee, you're a painter!
Old man stuff!
I do it to amuse myself.
Did you paint it from here, this drawing?
That's right, boy,
I picked up the brush at the same time every night.
At the same time?
Yes, tonight I did this one.
I was told that the victim was a Mr. Saijo.
That's what he gets for making dangerous jumps with the lights off.
Had the lights been turned off?
Yes... he jumped, with the full moon in the background,
it was just a silhouette.
You didn't see his face, the jumper?
No, but it was a very pretty sight.
It glowed.
It was so inspiring,
I started painting nonstop.
It's called "Moonlight dip".
(thinks) "A beautiful vision?
"If he had hit the diving board head first,
he would have lost his balance and wouldn't have made the jump properly.
"I get it!
I know who he is, the murderer!"
Marrec!
Where the hell have you been?!
We were worried about you.
Oh, he's coming!
I'll punish you!
Come here!
Yes, what else!
Do me a favor and come here!
Come! No!
Stop running!
Come over here!
(Thinking) I'm sorry, Kogoro.
Oh!
Oysters!
This time in the ass.
(Thinks) Oh, it's falling!
Father, are you all right, are you all right?
Conan!
(Kogoro voice) Ran, tell everyone who comes!
(Kogoro's voice) Eh?
Let's see, what do you want, now, Kogoro?
The truth always comes out in the end.
I know who the murderer is!
The murderer? Wasn't it an accident?
No.
The killer wanted it to look like an accident.
Are you sure about that?
I was suspicious about the earplugs he said in Conan.
The killer made a mistake.
(Off) "He used chloroform to put him to sleep
and while dressing the victim in a bathing suit,
he put earplugs in the victim's ears that were not the victim's."
Then there was the cap.
Was there blood, the trampoline, indicating that he had taken a blow?
No, we didn't see anything unusual.
You mean the cap would just be camouflage?
That's right.
He killed Naoya by the pool,
but he wanted to make it look like he died doing a jump.
What's that?
Oh, geez!
Afterwards, the killer took the victim's clothes,
put it in the closet, but didn't lock it.
Everything you've told me so far is only indirect evidence,
have you forgotten about the eyewitness?
Given that the eyewitness
goes out to the gallery every night at the same time,
then you'll change your mind, Inspector.
What?
Every night at the same time?
What does this mean?
That it wasn't a coincidence, because someone wanted me to see it.
What... what do you mean?
Someone wanted me to see the accident?
Could it be a suicide?
So, you didn't have to turn off the lights to see the silhouette, did you?
Did you turn off the lights?
But why?
You didn't want his face to be seen?
Of course he didn't!
The witness saw someone else!
That's right!
And the person who jumped out is Naoya Saijo's murderer!
Mr. Hisa Kijima,
you are a former diving champion, but now you are a swimmer, right?
Didn't you have a grudge against him at NAOJ because he took the title away from you?
Plastic caps are a must for swimming, aren't they?
You put the cap on him so that no one would suspect a thing
when they found no trace that he had taken a stroke.
It would only occur to a swimmer, this stratagem.
Therefore, he is...
Exactly, that he has murdered her
and set the whole thing up to look like an accident!
What?
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
You accuse me of being Saijo's murderer
based on some ridiculous indirect evidence?!
Do you have any irrefutable proof?
Inspector!
I took the painting the witness made.
It's by the staircase of the tower.
Unpack it, please!
This is a picture of... Of Naoya.
He painted it tonight.
The subject is Naoya Saijo practicing trampoline jumping.
So... this is the assasssí.
Take a good look,

has deliberately turned off the lights to obscure the jump,
but there is one piece of evidence that was reflected by the moonlight,
and which you have painted exactly as you saw it.
Exactly?
A slope.
That's absurd.
And another thing, Inspector.
If the murderer was someone who hadn't left the premises,
he couldn't have disposed of the murder weapon,
and it must still be somewhere in this building.
But why?
Did he commit a murder just because he lost his title?
Probably because he had lost it unjustly.
He had threatened her, hadn't he?
Yes, that's true.
(Off) "Six months ago,
I had a motorcycle accident due to carelessness.
My girlfriend was seriously injured."
Naoya heard about it,
and threatened to explain it to Mrs. Saeki
and the members of the championship committee.
And I pretended I was sick and gave her my title.
But I couldn't forgive him!
He didn't deserve to be a sportsman.
His big mistake was that he made too perfect a jump.
It was the most important jump of my life.
I knew what I had to do in order not to arouse suspicions
but I couldn't make a bad jump.
My pride as a champion didn't allow me to do it.

(Off) "They found a cement block in the office trash.
"Analysis of the wound on Naoya's forehead
confirmed that it was the murder weapon
and en Hisa Kijima's fingerprints were found on the block."
Come on, father!
Come on, Father, come down!
(Think) Gee, no!
I had forgotten about Kogoro!
Father, let's go home!
What a snooze.
I'll get off.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
