(Phone)
Father, you don't answer the phone?
- (Phone)
-Yes, just a moment.
- (man) "Is it Kogoro Mouri?"
-Tell me?
Mouri Detective Agency.
- "I've put a bomb in a place."
(man) -Yes.
Who am I speaking to, please?
What? A bomb?
A bomb?
"And it will explode at 15.30 sharp."
"If you want to avoid it, you'll solve the riddle I'll tell you."
But what are you saying?
Is this a joke?
For a threat like that, I can report it to the police.
-But what are you laughing at?
- "(man: I laugh)"
-Eh?
What are you looking at the street?
- "Look in the street."
And what do I have to look, if I may ask?
But what an outrage!
Father...
(People: shouts of panic)

DETECTIVE CONAN
The ELEVENTH FORWARD

DETECTIVE CONAN.
The NINETEENTH FORWARD

"I am Detective Shinichi Kudo."
"One day, I went to the amusement park with Ran Mouri,
"my best friend and classmate,
"And I witnessed
a suspicious exchange between two men dressed in black."
"I was so focused on watching those two men,
that I didn't realize there was another one behind me."
"He made me swallow a poison
"And, when I woke up....
(Conan voice)... my body had shrunk."
"If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was alive, they would want to kill me...
and the lives of those around me would be in danger."
"That's why Dr. Agasa advised me
to hide my identity."
"When the Ran asked me what my name was,
I randomly told him I called myself Conan Edogawa."
"Since Ran's father is a detective,
"I decided to go live with them
to get information about the Men in Black."
It does take time, Dr. Agasa!
What do you bet he can't find his driver's license?
It's always the same for him.
Well, if we don't hurry, we won't be able to get Hide's autograph.
For once we get something...
I still can't believe it, that we get to attend...
a training session with the league players.
"Ayumi, Genta and Mitsuhiko...
they've been my classmates ever since I shrunk."
(Mitsuhiko) Ah.
It's coming, it's coming.
Sorry, guys, I couldn't find my driver's license.
-You were right.
-What did I tell you?
He should be tied with a chain around his neck.
"He is Dr. Hiroshi Agasa. And she is Ai Haibara."
"They are among the few who know my real identity."
Conan, can you tell me what you're chewing on by yourself?
Come on, hurry, let's go to the camp.
But if you want to stay here, it's up to you, eh.
Don't you neglect anything?
No?
No.
You know that, man.
The usual.
Eh?
Ah, you're right.
Soc small, but I have the brain of an adult.
A detective who solves all mysteries.
The truth... always comes out in the end!
(PA: female) "Welcome to this special training session for children
with the players of the Japan Professional Soccer League..."
The players themselves!
(Genta) The Endo and Konno!
(Ayumi) Narazaki and Nakamura are also there.
(Ayumi) What?
Is it okay if we start, guys?
Yes!
(Ayumi) Eh?
Hey, you, number 10.
"...on Seigo Narazaki of Nagoya Grampus...
"On Kengo Nakamura of Kawasaki Frontale..."
What is it, Conan?
He told me to rest for a while.
First they do an exercise with 4 players.
(Man) Excuse me, you're Kogoro Mouri, if I'm not mistaken, right?
Soc at Shinzo Yamamori,
head of Nichiuri TV's sports section, nice to meet you.
-Aiii!
-Ah.
You too.
I can't tell you how excited I am to meet you!
I've been looking forward to it!
He's so famous!
Kaoru, take a picture of us together.
Yes, right away.
Thank you.
May I introduce Kaoru Koda, she is the photographer of "Nichiuri" newspaper.
I used to cover cultural news,
but this year he's been sent to the sports section.
I don't know if I need to bore you with all these details.
Well, I know that he has been told....
that if he gets any juicy sports news,
they'll take it back to the culture section.
-Well... let's see if there's any luck, then.
-Ah... yes.
Likewise, because I've also felt...
that if you don't manage to increase the soccer audience..,

risks having to leave the sports directorate.
Ah... That's right.
If you have any advice on how to improve the ratings, Mr. Mouri?
"You don't know what you're doing, asking him for advice."
-Oh, is that so?
-Yes, I have one.
He could invite me and Yoko on a show together.
I'm sure the ratings would go through the roof.
(Yamamori) Yes, but I'm sure Yoko has a very full schedule.
She has a concert on December 3rd at the Shiodome Arena.
Hey, look, look!
These kids have improved a lot, have you noticed?
Yes, I can see that.
It's unbelievable!
It's not long since I saw them.
Very good!
(Agasa) It is normal that, if they are trained by a professional, they improve quickly.
Now that I think about it, Ran, but you have never been interested in soccer.
It's not true, from time to time I watch a game with Conan.
Just... once.
But you've never played, have you?
I think it was the first year of high school.
In Shinichi kicked the ball to me and... Of course, that's when...
Nothing, it's the same.
What was it?
It was when what?
If it's... the Miracle!
It's the prodigy player.
In Kazumasa Nakaoka.
The Miracle?
What do you mean, "Miracle"?
They called him that because he made the Haido High School team
high school team to win the national tournament 3 years ago.
Then he signed for Tokyo Spirits.
And he was also a candidate for best player,
but just a month after the finals he had a motorcycle accident
and since then he hasn't been able to play soccer anymore.
No.
Well, he hasn't given it up completely.
I can see he's still a bit involved.
(Hideo) Guys, he's done very well, but now we'll make some changes.
(Children) Yes!
(Hideo) Hey!
Number 10!
Mm-hm.
Conan, Conan, he's calling you.
"How nice, they finally let me play."
They're very good, eh?
Hello, Mr. Mouri.
My name is Ryosuke Sakaki, from Beika University.
Ah!
The one with the own goal!
Yes.
Own goal?
This man scored an own goal in the last league game.
And, because of him, Beika University lost the championship.
Well, I see you still remember.
Of course I do.
I remember perfectly well.
I was there that day.
-It's been 10.
-How many years ago now?
It was a trauma for me, and I still have nightmares about it from time to time.
Father.
That's enough, poor boy, you have to remind him of this...
Ah... Yes, I'm sorry...
And now... what do you do?
I work as a teacher in a gym
and I also coach children's soccer teams.
Ah.
Well, that's great, kid.
But the truth is that I have come
to ask you if I can introduce you to someone.
It's someone... who admires you very much.
If you have a moment, I'd like to say hello.
-Thank you very much.
-Oh, yes, of course.
I'll be right back, I'll look for him.
- (children: exclamations of admiration)
-What danger!
Ah... (children: exclamations of admiration) Very well, very well.
I give up.
(children: exclamations of admiration) -Hey!
-All right, Conan.
-All right, Conan.
-Oh, you're a cracker.
"It's been proven, he's a footballer at heart."
Yeah.
Very good, eh, Conan.
-Hey? -Yeah.
-Hey. -Oh.
-Oh.
-But how handsome!
-In Shinichi Kudo...
-Oh, but it's in Higo! -Oh!
Of it...
Do you know him?
Shinichi?
You know him, Shinichi, you?
I do.
Yes.
I went to see him play once and I'll talk to him for a while.
And you look a lot like him.
And watching you play the ball makes me think.
Yeah, it's not so strange,
because I've learned to play soccer with him.
I can see that, and the truth is that he has taught you very well.
Yes.
Keep it up.
Best of luck.
-Al√ßa, nano!
-What luck!
That in Higo has congratulated you personally, eh.
Yes, what envy!
If I were you, I wouldn't wash my head for a while.
Well, maybe not.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Wash-you.
Please, Conan, let me touch your head.
Stop it!
Stop it.
Leave me alone!
(They speak at the same time)
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Mouri.
-Ah...
-If you have a moment, please...
May I introduce Mr. Keiichiro Motoura,
owner of a workshop in the Haido district.
Mr. Motoura
is one of the main sponsors of the children's league.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Mouri.
I've heard a lot about you.
Hello, nice to meet you.

Mr. Motoura is a great admirer of yours,
and he's been very insistent that he'd like to talk to you.
And why is that?
I would very much like to take the opportunity
to show him some photographs.
-Yes.
Look, here.
-(Ayumi) Can I see them, too?
- (Ayumi) May I see them, too?
-Ah, thank you.
(Genta) And me?
(Ayumi) "Eh? This man..."
(Ayumi) Eh?
Yes.
Conan, come look at the pictures.
(Kogoro) Who is this boy?
(Motoura) It's Tomofumi, my son.
Look, if you want, there are a few more.
(Kogoro) Okay.
He looks very happy.
And it's not this way?
You didn't come?
No, it's just that... Tomofumi died last year.
It was August, due to an illness.
-I'm sorry.
-I was in the fourth grade.
My son had not been in very good health
and the doctor told him not to do physically demanding activities.
So here he is playing.
(Motoura) Because he insisted so much that he wanted to play soccer,
that he asked Ryosuke to give him some lessons,
even though we knew he couldn't do much.
We took the pictures one day when he played
one day when he played a game and scored a goal.
And this is the moment he scored.
(Ayumi) How nice!
What a nice goal, huh?
(Mitsuhiko) He must have been a good player, right?
(Kogoro) It's very nice, yes.
But why did you want to show me these photos?
I just wanted you to see Tomofumi when he was alive and was so happy.
But now I see that maybe I've spoiled them.
the good time they were having.
(PA) "Attention, the second part of the training..."
I find that it has left us a bit bored.
-Ensopits?
-Mm-hm...
Ah!
It's the ideal moment!
-Here we are!
-No way.
I'll give you one of my riddles that you like so much.
Ready?
Everybody attentive.
The footballers, so they can go with their cars,
which are always very showy,
must do something that, in soccer, would force them to stop the game.
What is it?
I will give you 4 options, attention.
First: offside.
Second: hands.
Third: corner.
And fourth: yellow card.
Is it too complicated, today's enigma, or what's going on?
Yes, the good one is...
Conan, do you know?
The second one.
I'd say it's "hands", because of the handle.
The handle of the car.
Without making "hands" with the handle, they couldn't drive.
But in soccer, you can't make "hands".
-Oysters!
It's unbelievable, Endo!
-Correct!
Not only do you play well, you're also very smart.
(Boy) Hey!
-Yes, it's late.
-Sorry I'm late.
-Who's this late comer?
-I overslept.
It's Takahiro Sanada.
One of the youngest players in the league and Higo's replacement.
What a face you have!
You skipped the whole first part.
(Sanada) I do not understand me much, with children.
And one thing...!
I am not a simple substitute.
I'm the best substitute, that's for sure.
(Hideo) Come on, come on, Takahiro.
Hideo, you'll be my rival, okay?
Then we'll see which one of us is better.
First make sure you play the next match.
Of course I will.
Mm?
A declaration of war?
Very interesting.
(Yamamori) The next match is the most important match of the season
and will be broadcast live on our channel.
The Spirits against Big Osaka in a match that will make history.
Best of luck to both of you guys.
Mm?
-Why not?
-Hey, you can't watch this.
-But what do you take, now? -Because they're my notes.
-Because they're my notes.
"K, K"?
"What do you mean?"
You don't have to do anything.
-Yes, I do.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Takahiro.
-Hideo, weren't you going out first? -Yes.
I'll see you at the final match at Tohti stadium.
Hideo is very handsome, and he runs a lot too.
-Neither am I.
-Well, I don't run at all.
-That's not true.
-You'll never play in the league like that.
In fact, there are many good players in the League who are not great runners.
Do you really mean that?
If you're not a great runner, you can get ahead of your opponent in other ways.
Yes, but, in order to do that,
you have to be good at reading the movements of the game
and guess where the game is going to go.
Yes.
In other words:

more than being quick with your legs, you have to be quick with your head.
There are great players who have been able to develop this ability
to see the game precisely because they are not very good runners.
Certain limitations may seem like a disadvantage,
but sometimes they can be exploited in such a way,
that they can end up being a great advantage for the player.
What a lesson!
Those are words full of wisdom.
Yes.
Any of you want to ask us any other questions?
Yes!
Can you teach me how to shoot a foul properly?
Hey.
Don't overdo it, you, now, that takes a long time.
-Eh?
-Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We still have a few minutes left.
If you want I can show you.
Yes!
Of course you can!
Yes.
From the front, it's best to shoot with spin.
The ball should be kicked to one side, rather than in the middle.
Goal!
(Man) Yasuhito Endo has scored a perfect shot!
With 4 minutes to go, Gamba Osaka win!
How strong!
It's the same shot he taught me to make!
-Can I know which team you're going with, you?
-Hey, Conan.
You're from the Spirits!
You can't cheer for Osaka from this side of the field.
No, I know that.
Put this cap on, let's see if you can cheer for the Spirits.
What about you?
But what about you?
Don't worry, I bought another one.
From Big Osaka?
You mean you...?
Don't be mistaken.
I bought it because I liked the color.
Ha!
What a show-off!
But what an outrage!
Father...
(Man) "And there will be another one."
"If you don't decipher the code I'll give you."
"A blue boy and a blue zebra. Rain falls from above."
"The boy's left hand points to the tree on the left..."
One... one moment.
What did you say about the left?
"The child's left hand indicates the tree on the left."
What is it that indicates the tree on the left?
-Ah!
- "The hand!"
"The hand! The little hand!"
In other words, the left hand indicates the tree on the left...
"Come on, start the game."
A game?
"Yes, and if he loses, many people will also lose their lives."
But why do you do this?
Tell me why you do it.
"You'll find out soon enough. Good luck, then."
Wait a minute.
That alone won't do anything.
Give me a hint.
- "(man: river)"
-A clue!
"Next stop: Beika. Next stop: Beika."
-One moment.
Listen.
Listen!
- (communication: cut off)
Father...
Shit.
He hung up.
"A blue boy and a blue zebra.
Rain is falling from above.
The boy's left hand points to the tree on the left."
And the other clue is: "Next stop: Beika. Next stop: Beika."
(Takagi) No matter how much I rack my brains, I don't understand anything at all.
Inspector Megure, we have already identified the explosive material.
They've used plastic explosives with a remote control programmed
so they can be detonated with a cell phone.
I agree.
We were lucky that no one was seriously injured, then.
Who knows what could happen, if he sets off another bomb.
We only have an hour and five minutes to figure out the riddle.
It's true.
We have to crack it any way we can before the hour is up.
That's it.
I've got it!
I know where we can find the other bomb.
In Haido Park.
In Haido Park?
I've dropped "Next stop: Beika. Next stop: Beika."
I don't know what you mean, Mouri.
It's the subway stops.
The one before or after Beika.
It could be either Haido station or Midoridai station.
But near Haido station is the park,
and the park has a water fountain.
A fountain?
Is it because of that "rain falls from above"?
Yes, because I remember that in the fountain
there are sculptures of a boy and a zebra.
And the missing things, what do they mean?
We will find out when we are there.
(Audience: shouting)
-It's impressive!
(Audience: shouting) - Very good!
Very good!
Yes!
Over there.
-Let her through.
-Everybody out.
Let them through.
(Sato) Out.
(Sato) Let them through.
That's right, there's a statue.
The fountain.
-It's not a zebra, it's a mule, that's it.
-But it's not...
It seems the description doesn't quite match.
And it's not blue, either.
But it must look like it to him.

One moment, one moment.
Discover the mystery right away.
-Mr. Mouri, what are you doing?
But, father!
Hurry, we have to close the park immediately.
Yes.
Evacuate everyone.
Everybody out.
A blue boy and a blue zebra.
Rain falls from above.
The boy's left hand points to the tree on the left.
There!
The bomb is under the tree on the left.
What tree?
But which tree?
Okay, it can only be us, here.
Okay, you and Ran leave the park.
You and Ran hit it out of the park.
(Announcer) The Spirits try to get back on the scoreboard.
Naoki goes up on the left.
He crosses.
A perfect pass.
On Hideo comes in and...
- (Audience: ovation)
-Goal!
Goal!
Goal!
Goal!
Goal!
The combination of Naoki Uemura with Hideo Akagi
has brought the score level!
The combination of en Hideo and en Naoki is unstoppable.
No bomb?
Surely?
No, there was absolutely nothing under that tree.
(Kogoro) And the other one, the one on the side?
(Kogoro) Have you checked it well?
(Shiratori) Yes, we searched everything...
to make sure there was nothing under any of the trees.
I'll order them to finish looking all over the park,
but maybe the park isn't the place the clues indicated.
It must be.
Have you seen how many people?
Yes, and all the stops are full, at the halfway point.
Let's get determined or we'll still be here when the second one starts.
(Mobile: vibrates)
"It's the Ran."
I'm coming.
I'm going to the bathroom.
"Pick up, Shinichi, please."
"Hello, this is Kudo, I can't talk right now,
but leave me a message after I hear the beep."
No.
It always goes to voicemail!
(Telephone: beep)
Shinichi, someone has called my father threatening that there was a bomb.
But we can't figure out what the riddle is.
Shinichi!
"Hello, Ran, I felt you."
"Tell me what he said."
Yes.
"Shall I dictate it to you?"
And the last clue is "Next stop: Beika. Next stop: Beika"?
"Yes, and he said the bomb will explode at 15.30."
Yes, I know.
"Only 40 minutes left, Shinichi!"
But be calm.
"A blue boy and a blue zebra. Rain falls from above.
The boy's left hand points to the tree on the left."
"It reminds me of something, but..."
"Ah! It's on the tip of my tongue...!"
(Woman) And let's see who knows how to tell me
the names of the mascots of the Spirits and the Gamba Osaka?
The Spirits' is called Zebra.
So that the zebras nail some good foot strikes.
And nobody knows what the mascot of Gamba Osaka is?
-It's a boy named Gamba Boy.
-I do.
He's blue, right?
Very good!
We all know everything.
Gamba Boy cheers the team a lot...
"The zebra... and the boy."
"Sure!"
Got it!
The zebra and the blue boy
refer to the mascots of these two teams,
Gamba Osaka and Tokyo Spirits.
Gee, how could I have missed that before?
It was easy.
So..., the bomb is here, somewhere in the stadium!
"Wait a minute. There was another clue."
"That's what I thought. I get it."
From "rain falls from above" we take the character of "rain".
"From "the child's hand" we take the character for "child".
From "the left hand" we take that of "hand".
From "indicates" we take the whole of it.
And from the part of the tree, we take the character of "tree".
We take the empty parts and fill them to create new characters.
And then, if we put it all together, we get the word "video scoreboard".
And the clue "Next stop: Beika. Next stop: Beika"...
was to emphasize that it was a digital display like the ones on the subway.
"I have no doubt,
the bomb was placed on one of the video scoreboards in the stadium."
"But, if so, this will be a massacre."
"I have to check it right away!"
I don't know.
I find it takes too long, on Conan.
Mm-hm.
I hope he didn't get lost.
Dr. Agasa!
He must have left me the car keys.
-Where have you been, man? -Where have you been, man?
-Hey, Conan.
The second part is about to start.
Ah... He's got it.
I can't now.
Hurry, go.
(Warning beep)
(Announcer) The second part begins!

The Spirits reacted and just before the end of the first half, they made a partial comeback to level the score.
the partial comeback and equalized the score.
For the moment, they have taken an important step forward.
But if they don't get their act together, they won't make it to the final.
"No way, I can't go up anywhere."
"That way!"
Come on, let's go!
(Woman) Aaaah!
But what's that kid doing over there?!
Come on, let's go!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
I've gone a little.
(Announcer) In Rafinha and Kihara fight for the ball.
Rafinha passes to Endo, Endo opens to the side,
who is very well positioned.
In Takei tries to cut.
He crosses, and in Shimura manages to finish it off.
"Where is he? I don't see anything anywhere."
The Akagi dribbles, the Endo doesn't let him for a second.
The Akagi returns the ball.
From en Kihara passes to en Shimura, who makes a good cross.
En Shomodaira has cut with his head.
Akagi recovers it and continues to dribble, looks to focus....
and the goalie rejects the ball with his fist!
-Go ahead.
Go ahead.
-Come on.
It's going.
Yes!
"Oh, no!"
"But... It can't be!"
Oysters!
Oh.
Aaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What's this?
(whistle)
The Spirits protest the referee's decision.
-He has expressly thrown himself to the ground.
-Oh, yeah.
This is not a penalty.
It was clear, wasn't it?
Where are you going, Ay?
(Announcer) Prepare the ball.
The one in charge of taking the penalty is obviously Yasuhito Endo.
- (ovation)
-Goooooooooooooooooooool!
Two to one.
Gamba are back on the scoreboard!
(Mobile: vibrates)
(Mobile: vibrates)
What are you doing here?
"Just in time, Ay."
"In Genta and the others haven't seen me, have they?"
No, do not suffer.
(Mobile: vibrates) What?
A bomb?
Yes, although I haven't been able to confirm it,
but there's a very good chance
that it was planted in the stadium scoreboard.
I'll call you later.
I'm sorry.
But, Shinichi... Shinichi!
"I've already found it. There are a few."
"They're attached to the beams supporting the video scoreboard."
"Wait a minute, this means...
the criminal wants to bring it down on top of the audience."
-Come on.
Don't let up.
-Go ahead.
Let's go.
(cell phone vibrates)
Eh?
Tell me?
What's that?
Shinichi?
Ah, Shinichi.
Yes, yes, yes.
What are you saying?
That there are several bombs in the stadium's video scoreboard?
-To the video scoreboard?
-Tohti Stadium?
Yes, you should evacuate the whole stadium, especially the Spirits' stand.
"Okay."
"They are very simple bombs,
but I don't have enough time to defuse them all."
"Here, here, think."
"There's got to be some way to stop this."
"Oysters."
"If I can't defuse them all..."
(Mobile: vibrates)
What are you talking about, you?
You hung up on me.
I'm sorry.
Please, listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you.
"Yes, I have found some bombs."
The criminal wants to bring down the video scoreboard
on top of the Spirits fans.
It is scheduled to happen at 3:30 p.m. sharp.
It can't be.
But it's only 30 minutes away!
Yes, but they'll soon start evacuating the crowd.
You now go back to the guys and don't let them move from where they are.
Understood.
And you, what do you plan to do?
As much as possible so that the scoreboard doesn't fall down.
(Announcer) The Spirits attack.
It is clear that they want to score another goal before the end of the match.
Shimura crosses, Itawa head in,
Uemura's header is cleared by the defense and Uemura ends up hitting... the crossbar.
The rebound comes to Akagi, who shoots and GOOOL!
Akagi has just scored the second goal of the match.
The Spirits have just equalized!
-Yes, we scored.
We scored!
-Goals.
Goal!
Let me be, Genta, you're hurting me.
-What?
Have they stopped?
-Something's wrong.
Watch.
(But... what's going on now?
A member of the organization has approached the referee and they are talking.
-The match is not over!
-What's going to happen?
Hey.
Hello, Ay.
Did you see the goal that Hideo just scored?
-What's wrong with you? -What's wrong?
-What's wrong with you?
(PA: female) "Ladies and gentlemen, this is an emergency."
I don't know what it is, all of it,
but I hope Shinichi has nothing to do with it.
"...follow the staff's evacuation directions."

Shinichi told me
that a series of bombs have been placed on the stadium's video scoreboard.
What?
What are you talking about?
"We repeat: all spectators in the Spirits' stand...
must evacuate the area immediately."
-He says the stadium must be evacuated.
-Well, there is something wrong.
Shouldn't we get closer to see what's going on?
No.
Don't go anywhere.
Conan told me that when we leave, we'll all wait for you in the car.
He'll take care of something important.
"I hope he comes back."
Let's see...
It's impossible, I can't do them all.
I have to stop this beam from falling anyhow.
"I only have 10 minutes left. Oh, man. I don't know how I'm going to do it."
(Man) All the spectators on this sideline,
move in an orderly fashion towards the center of the field.
Slowly, without running.
Please do not separate from the person in front of you and do not stop for anything.
Please do not stop for anything,
continue forward to the center of the field.
-No idea.
-No idea.
What's going to happen?
But I'm sure it's something serious.
The media, too.
Everyone has to go to the center of the field.
Yes, but we can't fly, this stuff is too heavy.
Leave the material where it is.
It's an emergency.
-Yes, man!
What do they think they're doing!?
-What? -What?
We can't leave the material here.
And couldn't they explain what's going on?
No.
Eh, where?
Stop right now!
Hurry up.
We have to hang it up!
We must post the images on the networks.
Yes, I take full responsibility.
Do as I say!
Do you understand me?
I have the news.
Entire rows D3 and D4 have been evacuated.
Thread F, all of it.
Row E, also.
Row G, also already empty.
Calmly, but without dawdling.
Everybody towards the center of the field.
Try to advance to the center of the field.
Children, hand in hand at all times.
"Only 35 seconds left."
"Here's one more and then..."
I hope it holds.
Aaaaaaaaah!
(People: screams of panic)
Oh, my God!
It can't be!
Shinichi...
Yes!
I got it!
"With this, the ratings will skyrocket!"
The scoreboard exploded.
It can't be.
But it looks like a movie.
That's it.
I already have my news bomb.
(Shouting)
Follow the indications.
The police indicate us where we have to leave.
(PA: woman) "Attention, attention."
"The management of the Tohti stadium requests..."
Calm down.
Please, everybody follow the directions.
"Please follow the directions calmly. No running."
"Calm down, please. Slowly."
"Follow the directions of the police."
(rumbling)
Has he held on?
Let him hold on.
Let him hold on.
No.
It's going to fall!
Get out of the way!
(Shouting)
It's all right.
Let's stay calm.
-That's awful!
Nothing is happening?
-S'ensorra the video scoreboard.
-What's wrong?
This is dangerous.
We get out of here right away.
We can't.
Everyone is too scared.
The exits have collapsed.
No.
There's no time.
Shinichi...
Is it over?
(Woman) It's stopped.
It's a miracle.
You have to hold on... a little longer.
Stretch!
- (man) It's awful.
- (woman) What a disaster!
- (woman) It seems impossible.
-How could it happen?
Good morning, today, Monday, November 21,
we open this space with the news of a terrible fact
that took place yesterday during a match of the Japanese League.
The video scoreboard of the stadium exploded during the match
and rushed into the stands.
We can offer you the images.
It was in the second half
of the match between Tokyo Spirits and Gamba Osaka.
Suddenly, the stadium's video scoreboard exploded due to a bomb.
Fortunately, there were no fatalities.
But it has come to our attention that the explosion may be related to a case being investigated by detective Detective
to a case being investigated by Detective Kogoro Mouri.
That is why we have sent a special team in front of his agency.
Come in, Miyuki.
Good morning, this is Miyuki Tabet from the Mouri Detective Agency.
Yesterday, Mr. Mouri deciphered a cryptic message he received...
and was able to save the lives of the thousands of people in the stadium.
Although it was very serious, it could have been a real tragedy.
(Kogoro) Hello everyone.
Thank you very much for coming.

I can't go out because I'm surrounded by journalists
who would follow me everywhere.
Yes, and no wonder,
because everyone thinks you solved the riddle.
In Kudo you asked me
to keep your name out of the media.
Why don't you come in and sit down while I make you some tea?
Hello!
Yes, thank you very much.
By the way, Mouri...
Ah.
It's you.
I'm told you've discovered something else about the criminal.
Yes, well, in fact, it wasn't me at least, but the boy.
On Conan?
Yeah, he hasn't stopped asking me...
all the details of the call I got from the suspect.
I wanted to tell Shinichi about it in detail.
He was very worried yesterday.
That's normal.
But can you tell me what you found out?
These are the words the suspect used.
"The hand, the hand. The little hand!"
I remembered I'd heard something like that before.
Yeah, the good one is...
Conan, do you know?
I'd say it's "manos", because of the handle.
It's very curious, isn't it?
It's not very normal, that he would say "manita", the mysterious voice.
No, isn't it?
I think he got nervous because he didn't understand it.
And, without realizing it, he said something he had heard.
I suppose he must have repeated it involuntarily.
It is a mistake of the wrongdoer, yes.
Who felt them, these words that were said in training?
If we take out the players who were on the field afterwards and us,
4 suspects are left:
"In Shinzo Yamamori, Kaoru Koda,
Ryosuke Sakaki and Keiichiro Motoura."
I consider that all 4 are susceptible
to have heard the phrase and repeated it.
One person is missing.
A person who was on a bench, very close.
"Mr. Kazumasa Nakaoka."
What he scored at the National Stadium on the day of the big snowfall?
-Yes.
-Do you know who that is, you?
I went, to see that game, it must be 3 years ago now.
"My nephew asked me to take him to see it.
"It was supposed to start at five past two, but because it was snowing so much,
in the end it started at three quarters minus 5 of 4."
"They had to go into overtime because they were 0-0."
"And when there were 4 minutes left, there was a penalty kick."
"In Kazumasa scored the goal
that gave his team the victory."
"The match was over at three-quarters and 5."
Well, including in Kazumasa Nakaoka, we have 5 suspects.
It is possible that the criminal
said these words purely by coincidence.
But, if that's not the case...
and his intention is to pose a personal challenge to me,
we can't rule out any of those who attended that training.
Very well then, we immediately investigate the 5 suspects.
Once we've investigated the suspects we have identified,
we'll pool our findings.
Yes.
Shiratori.
First we'll talk about Mr. Yamamori, because, thanks to the explosions,
his show's ratings skyrocketed
and that saved his job.
Misfortunes always win the audience.
Second, Miss Koda.
The photos she took have also helped her win positions
to return to the culture section of her newspaper.
She has also gained a lot, eh?
The next suspect, Mr. Sakaki,
so far has nothing
that directly links him to the stadium explosions.
However, I think it would be wrong of us not to take into account....
that he might be intent on taking revenge on Mr. Mouri.
Shortly before saying the famous words,
Mr. Mouri laughed
at a goal he had scored in his own goal.
Ah!
The own goal!
But I didn't mean it in a bad way.
He laughed too!
Well, maybe he laughed on the outside but inside he was boiling with rage.
These things happen.
The other suspect is Mr. Motoura.
In Tomofumi, his only son,
died last August of a heart attack while he was watching a game on TV.
while watching a Japan League soccer match on TV,
at Tohti Stadium, too.
He was rushed to the hospital by ambulance,
but there was nothing they could do to revive him, he arrived dead.
Tohti Stadium?
An ambulance?
Anything comes to your mind?
Yes, all this has rung a bell...
-I'm not sure, but...
-Of what, of what?
It's just so familiar, all of it.
Ah.
Maybe I'm imagining it.

"I can't stand it, when he makes these ramblings."
Ahem, ahem... And, finally, Mr. Nakaoka.
On February 2, two years ago,
after having a motorcycle accident, he underwent emergency surgery.
But it looks like after 6 months of rehabilitation
they saw that his leg would never be 100% recovered again,
and the Spirits terminated his contract.
- (Chiba) Yes.
-The Spirits?
He had to quit soccer and went to South America,
but after a little over a year he came back.
That is, last August.
And when he returned to Gunma, his hometown,
he went to work part-time at a motorcycle store.
In other words, both Mr. Yamamori and Ms. Koda....
might have had reason to want to plant the bomb at the stadium
and, moreover, they had privileged access...
which made their job easier.
But it's hard to believe that they did.
And it is also very unlikely that Mr. Mouri's little joke
made Mr. Sakaki so angry
that, in a fit of rage, he decided to carry out an attack.
Exactly, there was no malicious intent.
What strikes me
is the case of Mr. Motoura's son,
who died of a heart attack
while watching a Japan League game on TV.
Yes.
It's the same for me.
There is no reason for this man to resent the league or the players.
or the players,
because the death is related to the illness he had.
And finally, there is Mr. Nakaoka,
who, according to the information given to us by Inspector Yamamura...
From what I have been able to ascertain,
this nano is crazy and totally unpredictable.
So to speak..., it's as if he were a wounded and desperate wolf...
waiting for death to come to him.
Because of the accident he had,
her career was cut short.
Perhaps frustration has led her
to resent Tokyo Spirits for kicking him out.
That's why we decided that we had to keep a close watch
to uncover any involvement in the case.
The one with the motorcycle.
Stop!
What is this?
May I ask why you are following me?
Excuse me, but we have not followed you at any time.
Why not?
I've seen you all afternoon in front of the store.
-Calm down, please.
-What do you want?
Let's not get nervous, okay?
We stopped him for a routine check.
Yes, man, sure!
If they're looking for me..., I'll do something crazy.
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Mr. Kazumasa Nakaoka,
you're under arrest for attempted assault on a law enforcement officer
and obstruction of justice.
Eh?
Kazumasa is under arrest?
Yes..., well, it's just that last night, when we followed him,
he got so angry that he tried to assault me.
This morning he was calmer and it was easier to talk to him.
And I think we can rule out
that he resents the Tokyo Spirits.
What did he say?
What did he say?
Is he sure?
It's just..., when we hinted at this possibility, he said....
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
They don't know anything, they piss off the test!
I don't hold any grudge against you, me, the club.
On the contrary.
-Count s, please.
-That's a lie.
What I will tell you did not appear in the media.
It wasn't the club that kicked me out of the starting line-up.
It was me, who decided that I wanted to fold.
-What?
-This is the truth.
After the accident,
Tokyo Spirits paid for my hospitalization and rehabilitation.
And even though they knew that my leg would never recover, they offered to keep me on as a starter,
they offered to keep me as a starter and let me continue to play,
even though I could only play 15 minutes a game.
Why didn't you accept it?
Because I have my pride, like everyone else!
It meant staying on the bench.
Because if you can't play 90 minutes, you can't consider yourself worthy of playing.
Especially not as a starter in the Japanese league.
I have verified that what he said is true.
And we also received this from the owner of the motorcycle store.
He sent it to you when he made the trip to Latin America.
Well, it's in stark contrast
with the version Inspector Yamamura gave us about him.
(Sato) Behind it is a written text.
"I already knew, I, that I couldn't give up soccer".
Well...

I guess it just goes to show... you can't trust appearances.
He's a good guy, likes to play with kids and has a passion for soccer.
"Well... if it wasn't him either,
who's left for us?"
"Ah! By the way, that day..."
"Suginami Athletic Field,
6.00, K, K."
"What does 'K, K' mean?"
"Let's see if once here I can figure out what they mean... the letters K K."
"Eh? But if it's..."
Good morning.
You're early, eh?
Ah... Hello, good morning.
"Sure, K. K. stands for King Kazu,
which is what they call the player Kazuyoshi Miura."
Hello, excuse me.
What do you want, handsome?
Do you know Miss Kaoru Koda, the reporter of "Nichiuri" newspaper?
Kaoru Koda, from "Nichiuri"?
Ah, yes.
I don't know how she did it,
but one day she found out that I was coming to the park to train.
and he came here to take some pictures of me.
But I said no.
Oh, you did?
That's great!
The photos only have to be taken on a playing field,
during a match, and not while I'm training.
And if they catch me scoring a goal, so much the better.
"So, it has no relation to the case."
Eh?
Come on, kid.
Yes.
You like playing soccer?
You go ahead.
Yes!
You come to play?
You're pretty hot, huh?
Come on, let's run.
Thank you very much.
Go, and now xutem.
Very good!
What a great goal!
A good shot, congratulations.
Thank you very much.
How cold!
This Conan... Where did he go so early?
But what's this doing, here, so early in the morning?
I hope it's not a threatening letter.
Ah, no.
It's advertising for the father.
Oh.
"By Detective Mouri."
Huh? (chuckles)
Yes.
Hey, kiddo.
Thanks for keeping me company this morning.
You've helped me a lot.
And now!
Thanks to you.
Here, I'll give you this.
A wristband!
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
I've only given two.
You and a red one to another child.
And about 14 or 15 years ago, already.
One day I also met him like that,
he was about your age.
And he also had a good shot, it must be said.
And do you know if he is now a La Liga player?
I don't know, because I didn't ask him what his name was.
But I'm sure that if he continued playing, he could be a professional now.
Thank you.
Goodbye, have a good one.
-Yes.
-We'll see you later.
Ah!
What's he doing?
Don't you have eyes on your face, or what?!?
-Huh?
Ah, Miss Koda...
-Mr. Yamamori...
Excuse me, I'm in a hurry.
You must have a lot of work, after what happened, right?
Yes, but perhaps not as much as you.
This sly smile
makes me think that in ten minutes you'll have a headache.
-Well, good luck to you.
-Oh, yeah?
You don't know.
But do not take me any exclusive, eh?
-Hey, wait.
-Don't suffer.
Well, I gotta go.
This one's got a sure thing.
She's dropped her notebook.
She dropped her notebook.
(Shiratori) "By Detective Mouri. Don't think this is over.
On the contrary, at the site of the next explosion...
there will be many more people than last time,
and there will be a real panic there.
I will give you more details soon.
Good luck, then.
This morning there was a very fat envelope coming out of the letter box
and when I picked it up, I saw this letter underneath.
But...
I see what you mean.
But do you think it's from the suspect?
Couldn't it be a prank?
No, I'm quite convinced it's from him.
In the previous message we didn't take it into account,
because we were looking at the enigma of the message,
but then he also said these last words.
What words?
"Good luck, then."
"Good luck, then."
That's right.
Yes, and here he put it exactly the same, at the end.
Oh, boy!
It's him again.
But this time he hasn't posed a riddle, has he?
No, he just gives a clue.
Yes, when he says:
"On the contrary, at the site of the next explosion...
there will be many more people than last time".
This means that he intends to place a bomb
somewhere where there will be many more people than in the Tohti stadium.
Considering that there were about 80,000 people in the stadium....

It means... that the place of the next attack will hold more than 80,000.
Where can this be?
I got it!
Here it is.
On the poster!
Speak up, Chiba.
As it says here, the "100,000 people" concert is coming soon.
It's on December 3rd, at the Shiodome Arena,
and a lot of young artists will perform.
"Eh? On December 3?"
Wait a minute.
Isn't there Yoko, performing at this concert?
Yes.
The Yoko too.
I mean, Miss Yoko Okino will also sing.
-We can't do anything.
-No.
We can't afford it.
If we assume that the next bomb
must explode at a concert of Miss Okino,
who is a friend of Mr. Mouri...
I doubt it's a coincidence.
Then we must consider the possibility
that the suspect is someone who resents Kogoro.
But, of the 5 suspects we have,
there's not one that fits, in this hypothesis.
Wait a minute.
I don't think it has anything to do with Mr. Mouri,
but rather with the organizer of the concert: Nichiuri TV.
And Mr. Yamamori works.
And, as has already been made public,
the TV station wants to broadcast part of the concert live.
Of course.
And if there was an explosion during the live connection....
The audience would break records again.
In Yamamori, yes... Now that we're talking, I remember that...
Well, good luck, then.
Good luck to you all, guys.
We got it.
Well, we have to keep in mind that it's a very common phrase,
but we can consider it a clue, for the moment.
And it seems that Miss Koda
has a special enmity with Miss Okino.
What?
With Yoko?
A person who works with her told me that she's very upset
because Miss Okino has a lot of security guards
who won't even let her get close enough to take pictures of her.
"Come to think of it, to her notebook..."
Wait a minute.
On the day of the training, I saw Miss Koda's notebook.
and on one page she had written the name, date and place of the concert.
What do you mean?
Yes, and there were also Yoko Okino's initials.
Eh?
But how come you didn't tell us all this right away?!
Don't be alarmed, Mr. Mouri.
Father, please!
Father, please!
This doesn't mean that Miss Koda is guilty of anything, yet.
But they are both suspects again.
Yes, and at the moment, more than the others.
By the way, Ran, do you have any idea when she might have left the letter?
Since when was it in the mailbox?
The last time I opened it was last night,
and there was still nothing there.
So, they put it in later.
So that means it couldn't have been in Kazumasa, right?
Eh?
Why is that?
Well, because it's still at the police station, you come here yourself.
You can't leave until this afternoon.
Ran, do you have it here, the other envelope that was in the mailbox?
Yes.
I imagine it arrived first thing in the morning.
says
it's from the Tokyo Spirits fan association.
There are several messages of thanks
and also a gift tie.
Sorry, the glue must have come undone from the sides of the envelope,
I got dirty too.
Ah.
That's all right.
You're welcome.
Thank you. Thank you.
At the moment, the idea that the culprit...
is related to the Tokyo Spirits club or the Japan League...
has lost steam, hasn't it?
Let's focus on investigating Shinzo Yamamori and Kaoru Koda now.
(Ai) You look a little worried.
Yes, it's for that concert to be held on December 3rd.
(Ai) What?
The same day as the final day of the league?
You see?
You've fallen for it too.
Besides, I don't understand why this time...
the man wanted to give us such straightforward information
where he's going to plant the bomb.
So that it will increase security
and make his job more complicated.
Yes, seen this way, you are right.
Or maybe he thinks that, even if there is more security,
it's impossible to catch him
for some reason that escapes us.
And we should think about whether there is any other place in Tokyo...
where more than 80,000 people can congregate,
other than the Shiodome Arena.
And we have to consider the possibility that he is not telling the truth.
No, we must keep in mind...

that these types of criminals always tell the truth.
I am sure of that.
What can be...
What could it be?
What could it be?
It may be playing with words.
To mislead selected.
(TV: male) "The time has come for sports information."
"The final day matches of the Japanese League
will take place on December 3rd."
"There was a possibility that they might be called off because of the explosion
"There was an explosion at the Tohti stadium,
"But, today, the head of the League...
has announced that they will all be played as planned."
"Therefore, it will be on the 3rd,
"Coinciding with the big concert of 100,000 people,
"The 'Power of the Music', a concert organized by producers,
record labels and media, who have joined forces..."
(Loudspeaker: woman) "Attention, please, as a security rule....
it is mandatory to show all bags to the agents at the entrance."
"We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you..."
Thank you very much.
"...but for your safety we are compelled to ask..."
See you later, Yoko.
I'll see you again.
Best of luck.
See you later.
-Yes, all ready and waiting for orders. -Yes.
-Are you all set?
You never know what can happen, on a live shot.
-Yes, of course.
Everyone be on the alert.
Inspector, it's not clear to me that the Shiodome Arena...
is the place where the bombs will be.
But what are you coming out with now?
It's just that...
There's no other place where 80,000 people can gather at once!
It must be there.
You know what?
You and Ran could go to the movies or go for a ride.
Go ahead, Conan.
Tell us exactly what's on your mind.
Today is the final day of the League.
How come it's all on the same day?
Isn't it a bit strange?
Yes, it's quite a coincidence.
Au, don't talk nonsense.
It's not good for us, since you say things without thinking, to be misleading.
No.
We have also thought about it.
And what we have done is to ask for security to be reinforced.
Yes, the matches of the final day start at 15.30.
That is, right now.
(Announcer) If the Tokyo Spirits win this match,
they will be the outright champions of the league.
On the other hand, if Big Osaka loses, they risk relegation to the second division.
In other words, both teams have a lot at stake today.
The time is half past five o'clock.
The match begins!
(Audience: cheers and songs of encouragement)
Look, Ran, they are already playing.
But I'm sure they've just started.
Hey, why did you tell my dad we were going to the movies?
What?
Ah, yes, sorry.
I thought that if we told him we were going to watch soccer at the National...
he wouldn't have let you come.
And today is the last day of the season I'll be able to see Higo in person.
Come on, Higo, we'll win!
-It was.
Higo!
We will win!
It has gone well little, to in Higo.
-But a little, eh?
-I'd like a little bit, too. -Now.
I'm going to buy something.
I'm going to buy something.
What's wrong with him, Fig?
(Mitsuhiko) He hurt his thigh, he's lying on the ground.
(Ayumi) I hope it's not serious.
(Ayumi) Wow.
Look, if she has to be changed...
Yes, you know, the opponents are always against the best.
-Oh!
-I've changed my mind.
-I've already changed my mind.
-Takahiro, get ready.
-All right.
-Come on, then, let's see if you score.
-Yes, be calm. -Yes, be calm.
-I'm sorry, Takahiro.
We're counting on you.
Because for me you can be injured for a whole year, if you want.
What do you say now, donkey?
Go on, go.
(Mitsuhiko) They've changed in Higo.
He replaces Takahiro Sanada.
(Mobile: vibrates)
Hey, like this way?
Say.
"No."
Have you seen anything strange?
No, I haven't.
There aren't 80,000 people here, we don't have to suffer.
"And the guys?"
It's pretty cool, being able to watch all 10 games at the same time from here, isn't it?
Yes.
Yes, so we have the excitement tenfold.
(Ayumi) "It's fantastic."
(Ai) "What? What do you think? Did you hear them?"
"Tenfold excitement? Oh!"
"No way! What he wants is just that!"
Azusa.
Relax, she's the waitress at the coffee shop downstairs.

Excuse me, someone called with a very strange voice...
Oh, yes?
And he said there was a message for Mr. Mouri
in a phone booth in district 2.
What?
What?
"Warning: I have bombed all 10 stadiums of the Japan League".
What are you saying?
"That's what I thought!"
"All the bombs will explode
at the exact moment when the match is over, there will be no extra time.
But, if they don't have any chance to avoid it, it won't be any fun,
so I'll give it a try.
In the second half of the matches,
if the visiting team does exactly what I say,
I will stop the countdown.
In order to know that the explosion has stopped....,
the video scoreboard will flash on and off twice."
Oh... Again the video scoreboard.
"But it must be made quite clear that these instructions
can only be given
the coach and the center forward of each team.
The other players cannot know.
If during the matches I see any suspicious movements,
if they try to evacuate the spectators or send teams to look for bombs,
I will also blow them up immediately.
I also want the forwards of each team
to wear a red wristband on their left arm.
Finally, the only way to stop the explosions is..."
Eh?
What's going on?
"What can be deduced... from this warning I've sent out."
What?
"If in the end there were no explosions,
you can't look for the bombs
until 35 minutes after the end of all matches.
In the event that this was not respected,
the lives of the people in the stadium would also be endangered.
Kogoro Mouri, if you want to stop me,
you will have to be the eleventh striker and come and get me.
Good luck, then.
Fuck.
Repeat that again.
What a rage!
"So there was a play on words to throw us off the scent."
He's got us trapped.
All the final day games started at the same time.
If we add up the number of spectators in each stadium,
it's well over 80,000.
Of course, it didn't say anywhere that the 80,000 would be at one location.
Takagi, what time do the games end?
Let's see, I estimate around a quarter of 6. Oh!
Wow!
We have just over an hour left!
- (man: call)
- (knock)
What's wrong, Sato?
That the heading of this message, the word "warning",
seems to have been written after all the pages have been handwritten.
If you look closely, you can see perfectly well....
that the middle character is written on top of the staple.
Yes, it is.
"The question is to know
why he has handcuffed the papers before writing this."
"The staple... is at the top and right in the middle of the sheet,
and it seems to be marked in red specifically."
"I see it now, so that's it."
Hey, you!
What are you doing?
"I've figured it out. I see what game he wants us to play."
Have you figured it out?
What is it, Conan?
Yes, it seems to me that the frame around this paper...
looks like it's drawing a playing field, doesn't it?
-Can you tell me what's wrong with you now? -What's wrong?
-Eh?
Yes, the rectangle outside symbolizes the soccer field.
The staple marks the place where the goal would be.
And the shape of an unstapled staple also looks like a goal, doesn't it?
Let me see.
And if the part of the character that is just underneath it
elongates until it enters the goal, this indicates...
The direction of the shot.
What does it mean?
That you want them to score a goal through the goal?
Wait a minute, inspector.
To score a goal means that the ball passes between the 3 posts
and enters the goal.
But, if so,
you should have made the red line before you put the staple in,
it would have to pass underneath the clip.
But, instead, as it is done now, the red ink goes all the way to the staple,
the red ink goes all the way to the staple and stops.
Right.
For the red line to stop just as it reaches the staple
and doesn't go under it means
that the ball must touch the crossbar of the goal.
Everything seems to indicate that the criminal is telling us
that we have to make it hit the center of the crossbar.
All right, call all the clubs right now.
Yes.
(Mobile: vibrates)

"I am in Shiratori."
Megure, tell me?
"We have a suspect who seems to be the person we're looking for."
What?
Do you know who the culprit is?
(Audience: cheering)
(Sanada) A bomb?
Really?
Yes, the police just told us on the phone.
What do you think?
Are you going out?
If you think not, tell me.
You have every right to refuse.
-Who will you ask?
-We'll ask someone else.
Who else can you ask?
Who do you think can replace me?
This man said he has to be the best striker in the team.
And if Higo can't play because he got injured today,
now the only center forward is me;
I have to take over.
Takahiro...
I don't mind, on the contrary.
If I stop the explosion this way, I'm sure I'll become a star.
I don't know how I'm going to get the girls off my back.
Thank you, Takahiro.
Put this on your left arm.
No, it's just... I'm shaking from the excitement of the match.
We're counting on you, Takahiro.
Thank you, Coach.
Who do you think will win?
The Spirits?
No, Kashiwa Reysol.
The players are coming out!
(Mitsuhiko) Yes, the second half is starting.
(Genta) It's about time.
-I believe it.
-I'm looking forward to it, too.
(Mobile: vibrating)
"Listen to me carefully."
Tell me?
In the end the criminal will perform in the Japan League.
What?
The ones with the red wristband on the left arm.
"All right. I'll let you know if I see anything strange."
Thank you.
I'm off to see what I think the culprit is.
(Police: siren)
Hold on.
"Excuse me, I'll call you back."
You know where we're going, don't you?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Yes.
Hey, but you...?
Come on, get in, Mouri.
But what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Yes.
Anyway, we don't have time.
-What a scream!
-What what?
Ah... Excuse me, guys.
Y... who are the chosen forwards of each team?
The ones wearing the red wristband.
It says in Conan that the time of the explosion is scheduled at a quarter of 6,
when the games are over.
(Agasa) And can't they evacuate the stadiums somehow?
(Ai) No.
If they try it, it will explode the bombs with a remote control.
(Agasa) So the only solution is for the strikers to do
is for the strikers to do what he says.
Yes.
The lives of all the public in every stadium depend on them.
The only ones who can save us are the 10 best strikers.
Yes.
Iah!
Very good!
In Takahiro has hit the crossbar.
Yes, they have said it to the transmission.
Are you sure, Conan?
(Kogoro) Okay, at the National Stadium has already been disabled.
No, not so much mail.
He said that, if the bomb was defused,
the scoreboard would go on and off twice,
and my men have not yet confirmed it to me.
(Kogoro) You mean it hasn't been defused?
(Kogoro) "What's wrong? But I touched it!"
(Announcer) "Look at the video scoreboard with a face of despair."
-What a rage!
-Hey, Takahiro.
Don't you love it!
Takahiro!
How could you miss, this!?
Put on glasses, man!
Sonoko, yours.
Ooh... Why did you have to injure Higo?
I came to see him.
If he doesn't play, it's no fun.
Takahiro!
If you send the ball to the post again, you can get ready!
(Audience: exclamations of disapproval)
What's going on?
Now everyone is sending it to the post.
But what are they doing?
-And how come everyone is so happy?
-There's no way to score a goal like that.
That's what you expect from the best strikers,
that they know how to send the ball exactly where they want it to go,
despite all the pressure from the outside.
Yes, they are very good.
(Man) "Inspector, we have confirmation that the bombs on the Cerezo and J√∫bilo fields have been
and J√∫bilo have been defused."
Good!
Very good.
Copy that.
Mm-hm.
Only 4 left.
Ah.
This is it.
Mr. Mouri, too?
May I ask what's going on?
How come they're all coming?
Well, we don't have much time at the moment,
I'll have to get to the point
and I will only be able to give you the essential details of the situation.
Listen to me well, because we have investigated the death of your son Tomofumi...

the day last year's final match was played.
We have learned that his ambulance
passed by Tohti's side of the stadium to go to the hospital,
and we also found out that,
due to the large number of people outside the stadium,
the vehicle had difficulty passing.
Supporters on the street blocked the way for a few minutes.
It is seen that a group of people
people stood in front of the ambulance to protest and made it stop.
And it turns out that one of the people leading this group was....
-Yes, it was Mr. Mouri.
-Yes, I remember.
What?
Yes, you do.
He was very angry because he had lost a lot of money in gambling.
Gee, how come I didn't remember until now?
Now I understand.
In that ambulance, unfortunately,
was his son.
But how long did they keep her, the ambulance?
It was only one or two minutes.
But it doesn't matter, because it's a time...
that, as insignificant as it may seem, maybe...
maybe it could have saved my son's life.
But we will never know.
I love soccer, too.
And my son loved it.
The Japan League especially.
But...
I can't forgive Mr. Mouri and the others for doing that to him.
No... I can't forgive it.
From which club were the supporters who stopped you?
I don't know, I didn't see the people outside.
I only know that the ambulance could not pass
because Mr. Mouri and other supporters prevented it.
And as I didn't know which team the supporters were from,
he decided to put bombs in all the stadiums where the game is being played today.
-Mr. Motoura...
-Eh?
In the end we have been able to decipher the messages we have received
and we have confirmed it with coach Sakaki.
We are convinced that you are responsible.
But what does it say?
How was the goal you scored in Tomofumi in your only match?
What was it?
It was a direct shot on goal that hit the crossbar,
but it went in and made the goal.
Which is the only way we have to avoid explosions.
That the balls hit right in the middle of the crossbar.
What do you have to say about all this?
I'm telling you that I have no idea what it's all about.
all these messages and riddles they say!
Mr. Motoura, maybe you do not know,
but the ambulance story doesn't end here.
Mr. Mouri and all the other followers stopped the ambulance
because they wanted to save another person.
- (Kogoro) Exactly.
(Kogoro) -Huh?
A few minutes ago I had called for an ambulance
because a poor old man had fainted.
I took care of him and kept him company
"...until I felt the ambulance coming."
Ah, here it is.
Everybody move aside to let the ambulance through.
Damn it.
But how can that be?
It's going somewhere else.
Hey, hey, hey!
He's here!
Luckily, the ambulance that I had asked for came afterwards
and the poor man was saved.
(Motoura) I didn't know.
Although I did not know that in that ambulance was his son,
I apologize for having stopped it.
And I understand that you are hurt with me.
But it is unfair that you want to make it pay
to people who have nothing to do with it.
- (Shiratori) Mr. Motoura...
(Shiratori) -Huh?
Please stop running and deactivate all the bombs right now.
What you want to do is not right at all.
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
But I don't know what you are talking about!
You mean it wasn't you
who put the bombs in the soccer stadiums?
- (Shiratori) Do you confess?
-(Shiratori)
(Shiratori) "This attitude you have is very strange."
Yes.
Inspector, Shiratori..., we talked.
We're not going anywhere like this.
We should have some clearer evidence to charge her.
We must be aware that there are only 10 minutes left in the game.
"He's puzzled,
but he's not nervous."
Seriously, please believe me.
Now I understand why you have all come here, and I know the situation is serious.
But I have nothing to do with it, really.
I also think that he is not responsible.
If it were him, wouldn't he be more worried...
about the time the games are over and to know how they are going?
And, on the other hand, Mr. Motoura has never once looked at the clock.
Not even now, when they've turned away and weren't looking.
Mm-hm.

I haven't stopped watching him.
Are you sure about that?
Thank you.
"But this is the only way to stop the explosions...
"Is with a shot against the crossbar,
"Which is how he scored his only goal in Tomofumi,
it can't be a coincidence."
"What a rage, we're like at the beginning."
What?
Inspector.
Another stadium.
The only thing left to do is to deactivate the one at the Estadio Nacional
and they'll all be there.
We've done it!
Mr. Motoura, could you please turn on the TV?
- (Chiba) Only 5 minutes left.
-(Chiba) Yes, sure.
The scorer of the Big Osaka is in Takahiro Sanada.
(Kogoro) No, it's in Higo.
(Kogoro) Wow!
(TV: man) "There are only a few minutes left..."
"There is very little time left,
but we must rely on Takahiro to stop the bomb."
"In the meantime, all I can do is find the culprit,
and the faster the better."
"These are the photos that Mr. Motoura showed us the other day."
Eh?
"Here at Tomofumi... he doesn't look at the camera."
"Who should I say hello to?"
Excuse me, this man who is here in the background of the photo...
and he's carrying a video camera, is that you?
Is that you?
Ah, yes, I recorded it.
The photographs were taken by my wife from the other side.
And the camera you used is this?
Would you let me look at it?
Thank you, thank you.
Sure, go ahead.
"Let me see if I can see...
"Who was... next to...
his mother's."
- (men) Oh!
- (TV: the audience calls)
-So much.
-That's not a foul?
It's the perfect opportunity.
Mr. Motoura.
Please turn up the volume a little.
Ah, yes. (TV: announcer) "It's a foul.
(TV: announcer) "It's a foul."
"A foul has been committed against Takahiro."
"The Big Osaka has a foul almost in front of the box
and slightly off to the right."
Takahiro!
Hey!
Above all, keep a cool head.
(Announcer)... and this free kick will be taken
(Announcer)... and this free kick will be taken from the best position to score a goal.
It looks like it will be Takahiro himself.
So far, this player has not been very accurate.
-Y... goal!
- (shouts of enthusiasm)
"Big Osaka could have scored in the last minute of the match!"
He touched it, didn't he?
What then?
Costa to see, on TV.
Stop it, come on.
Let me.
(Announcer) The teammates congratulate him very effusively.
But the Tokyo Spirits are not so happy.
The clock is about to strike the end of the match.
No!
I didn't touch it?
(Kogoro) Time's up.
-Maybe it's a mistake by the criminal.
-And the bomb hasn't exploded.
No.
It probably didn't explode
because it had already been defused in a previous shot.
What happened is that the marker
must not have worked as he expected.
Be that as it may, we were lucky.
Yes.
Now all that's left...
is to find out who's responsible for all this.
I've already told you that I had nothing to do with it.
"If the culprit is someone here, he probably knew the child."
I beg your pardon.
Was there anyone who took a special interest
on the day of your son's death?
Mm... Now that you mention it,
I do remember that someone came to talk to my wife.
But I couldn't tell you who it was, exactly.
"I knew. And this person... must be the culprit."
"The glue that hooked the label
of this Tomofumi figurine has come undone.
The glue must have come undone from the sides of the envelope,
I got dirty too.
Wow!
Watch out, kid!
"The culprit must be him, I'm sure."
"And that means the timer on the bombs hasn't stopped."
- (cell phone: vibrates)
-Coi as a kid!
(mobile: vibrates)
- (man) "Is it Kogoro Mouri?"
-Yes, tell me?
- (laughs)
-A new one?
What are you laughing about?
Can you tell me where he is?
"I see you've been unable to find me, haven't you?"
What do you mean?
"Now... you no longer have the right to be the eleventh striker."
(Whistle: two short touches and the third longer touch.)
(Announcer) And the referee whistles the end of the match!
This year's winning team is Kashiwa Reysol!
(Announcer) "No way. It's impossible to make it in time like that."
(Car: horn)
Yes, but what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Are you all right?

The doctor explained everything to us.
I don't understand why you didn't tell us anything.
And now!
You wanted to take all the credit?
Did you?
Besides..., you're easy to find.
Aren't I?
What a face!
Doctor, at Tohti Stadium, hurry up.
(Agasa) Come on!
Come on, please, we have very little time left.
(Agasa) I know.
But I don't understand why we're going to Tohti Stadium.
They must still be fixing it.
Because that's where it all started
and it's the ultimate goal of this criminal.
What's that?
Hey.
If it isn't Ran and Sonoko!
I'm watching the season finale ceremony
and look, they're on TV.
They are the miss fans of the day.
I didn't know they went to the National Stadium.
"No, I'm sure nothing will happen to them there."
"But now all the more reason we have to find the culprit."
You must now be on the alert in case you see any suspects.
In the meantime, I'll look for the bomb.
-Yes, so far.
-All right.
I'm sorry, if you expected me to come in Kogoro Mouri.
I came instead of him.
By the way, I woke up...
all the security guards that you had stunned,
so I don't think the police will be here soon.
I've already figured out the trick you used
to leave the letter in the mailbox.
You put it on the same day as the bombing at Tohti Stadium.
It was before you called Kogoro Mouri and everything.
"But to make sure it was straight,
you had it wedged between the top and bottom of the mailbox."
"That way, even if someone looked inside,
it was very difficult for them to see it."
"And if other regular letters came in, it wouldn't be seen either."
The next day, only one larger letter had to be delivered
from the Spirits fans.
It had to be really wide and really long
to make sure that it would stick out of the mailbox
and that the mailman would push it hard to the bottom of it all
to prevent it from falling.
You also had to make sure that the sides were filled with glue
so that the envelope at the bottom would catch on it
and, when they picked it up, they would find it too,
as if they had arrived the same day.
That way you had the perfect alibi,
because everyone would have thought that the letter was only from the morning,
because, obviously, at night nobody would have seen it.
That is to say, it was immediately clear to me that the person...
who had the perfect alibi for the middle hours of the day...
had to be the culprit.
I'm not wrong, am I?
No, I don't think so, because I've given it a lot of thought...
and in the end it became clear to me.
During these hours you were detained at the police station
and you couldn't be a suspect.
And, besides, you had been the center forward...
at Haido High School, weren't you, Kazumasa Nakaoka?
You're pretty hot for a kid.
And what... you told me your name was?
Conan Edogawa, and I'm a detective.
-Yeah.
-There's no one here.
Then why don't we go help Conan look for the bomb?
Yes, that's right.
So this is huge.
We'll make more track if we look for it together.
No way.
It's dangerous, getting in here.
We won't move from here until I get back in Conan.
Oh!
-Hold on a minute.
-Hey, where's he going?
(Genta) The Junior Detective League springs into action!
(All) Yes!
(Genta) No way.
We've got to get them back right away.
You wait here.
I'll take care of it.
Do not turn off the engine of the car
in case we have to leave quickly after the culprit,
I don't want him to escape.
So what?
Tell me when you met Tomofumi?
What?
And how do you know that I knew him?
I know because I could see the video of Mr. Motoura.
You come out greeting him when his mother took a picture of him.
I must have met you in your last year in high school, right?
And I'd say it was Haido Park,
some day you went to train alone.
But how do you know?
The dormitory at Haido High School
is next to the park.
And since I knew that your family is from Gunma,
I assumed that you lived in the dorm during the week.
You started talking to the boy
when you saw him watching you while you were training, right?
Just like... what you had done with King Kazu
when you were little in that same park.
-Yes.

-What, pretty, do you like soccer?
Yes...
The first time I spoke with Tomofumi
"...was towards the end of my junior year in high school."
"I would go alone in the park to run and train."
"Yes."
"The boy was in delicate health and couldn't do much physical exertion,
but from that time on he never stopped accompanying me in training."
"Tomofumi and I trained together until winter came."
"That's when I played in the high school championship."
"I scored a goal in the national final and everything."
"In Tomofumi and I celebrated together."
Hey, I wish you had this.
I hope one day you can play a game and score a good goal.
Thank you very much.
Yes, but then you had the motorcycle accident,
in February of the following year,
and your relationship with Tomofumi ended there.
Yes.
First I had surgery, then I did 6 months of rehab,
but I didn't recover at all.
Fatal.
"And I went to South America, to get away from it all."
"After many months of not going, I met him in the park."
Tomofumi!
"I learned that he was already in the fourth grade
and was a member of the children's team at Haido School."
"Since he had that health problem,
"He always had to sit on the bench,
"But he told me that his coach had asked him
if he wanted to play for a while in the next game."
"And I promised him that if he managed to score a goal,
we'd celebrate together."
"And, just as we had talked about,
Tomofumi shot straight at the goal."
"For me, seeing that made me decide to try again,
but then..."
That's why you wanted to take revenge
on Mouri and the supporters who had stopped the ambulance, right?
Yes.
And where did you get them, the bombs?
In America I met a man
who was a professional in all these matters.
And of course, today you have dedicated yourself to bombing the nine stadiums, haven't you?
The tenth one was not the National Stadium, but this one, Tohti Stadium.
I'm not mistaken, am I?
Actually, the National Stadium was a bombing defect, wasn't it?
That's why Takahiro's shots had no effect on the score.
I guess you have excluded it from the explosions
because for you it is a sacred place.
Instead, you've decided to put it to Tohti's,
because this is where you lost
your chance to play in the Japan League.
And I guess it's set to go off at 17.50
with the intention of killing you along with Kogoro Mouri,
because you were already counting on me to find you out.
Because 17.50 is the exact time that the Haido High School team won the Japanese national championship in Japan at 17.50.
won the national championship of Japan in which it snowed so much.
Therefore, to the warning,
instead of putting "at 17.50" directly.
you are going to put "when the match ends".
It is true, for me, that game was the last as a player,
the last and the most important,
that's why I wanted to end my life here, too.
You said that someone who can't play for 90 minutes is not worthy of playing, that he is not worthy of playing, that he is not worthy of playing.
is not worthy to play, that he is not a good player,
but I think it's not true.
Oh no?
So that would mean that in Tomofumi,
just because his physical condition did not allow him
play a whole game, he was not worthy to play, either.
If you know that you can only play 15 minutes of a match,
what you have to do is try to make the most of these minutes.
But what should he know, a kid like you?
Not much.
But I'm sure that any good player in the league would tell you that it's you.
would tell you that it's you who doesn't know anything about soccer.
Certain limitations may seem like a disadvantage,
but sometimes you can take advantage of them and they end up being a great advantage.
What's more, there's still another thing you don't know.
And that is...
(Audience: ovation)
Yes!
(Audience: cheering) Very good!
Yes!
"I hope they were able to defuse the bomb
"at the Shiodome Arena concert."
"There is no news."
"I'm out of battery."
Not true!
At Kogoro Mouri and the other supporters
didn't want to save another person's life.
No, it isn't.
That's the truth.
That is a lie.
Look, Kazumasa...
You're not going to make me up with a made-up story.
No!
Don't you see that what you want to do to Tomofumi would make him very sad?

I'm sorry, but there's no turning back now, kid.
No!
-Separem selected to find them.
-That doesn't look good at all.
Wait a minute!
Genta!
Ayumi, wait for me, please.
Come on, let's go.
I've got to hurry to get them all out here.
Right now there's only one way to stop the bomb.
Look at the video scoreboard.
Although, actually, it doesn't make much sense right now,
because it was all designed
to test the best strikers in the league.
But hey, now there's going to be an explosion every minute.
And if this bag explodes,
the bombs in each stadium will also explode and level everything.
The killer detective and the other supporters will also blow up.
On Mouri and the others, you mean?
Sure, because there is only one mistake, in your deductions,
but it's a serious problem.
No.
It can't be!
The bomb is not here?
This stadium was not one of the ones I included in the letter you read.
Because at that time I had not yet put any more bombs here.
So this is not the tenth stadium,
but it is the eleventh.
So what is the tenth?
"The National Stadium! I get it."
"That's why you asked that no one should look for the bombs
until 35 minutes after the end of the game;
you weren't interested in them being found before they were exploded."
"Exactly."
"The bombs at the National Stadium
are programmed to go off at the same time as the bag."
"I programmed them with four minutes to go.
"Because those were the minutes left to the end of the game
when I scored the goal at the National Stadium."
"Being such an important place for me,
I wanted it to mark the end of my life."
Yes.
Are you sure, Mouri?
This guy wants to settle a score with me here.
Okay, I'm going to look at the CCTV footage from the control room.
I'm going to look at the videos from the cameras in the control room.
Okay, you don't move.
You don't move.
(Sonoko) Hey!
Higo, over here!
- (cell phone vibrates)
-Higo.
I love you!
-I love you!
- (mobile: vibrates)
I love you so much!
Ah... Who would that be?
No.
How come you hung up on me?
Please, Ran, pick up.
(Female voice) "The number you have dialed is out of range."
Hurry up and get out of here.
(Female voice) "Why? Ran!"
I have nothing against you.
The only thing that can defuse the bombs is the eleventh center forward.
But he hasn't shown up.
From here only two minutes from now, my revenge will be over.
And I'm sure that Tomofumi will finally rest in peace.
I don't believe it.
What happens is that you could not fulfill your dream
and you resent it.
And you want to use Tomofumi's death as an excuse.
The one who decided you couldn't play anymore was you.
You were the coward who gave up your dream.
The only child here is you!
Look, kid, watch what you say.
You always blame everything on others.
If you don't like something,
you deny it by saying it's a lie and you want to tear it all apart
because in reality you are a selfish and spoiled child.
You don't get it, though?
The soccer that you denied yourself,
is the soccer that Tomofumi wanted to take advantage of.
By destroying it all, what you're doing is ruining his memory!
Or haven't you realized it yet?!
It's true..., he's right.
Oh... Tomo... smoke...!
How can it be that you have the wristband?
It's the one I gave to Tomofumi.
No... it can't be.
It can't be.
It's nobody's fault for everything that happened.
-No...
-Stop everything, please.
Are you telling me I was wrong..., Tomofumi?
I... all I wanted... was to avenge your death...
and then go with you.
How can it be that now you're turning against me too?
There's no more time.
Kazumasa...
Tomofumi..., run away!
What are you doing?
No!
Now is not the time...
to give up... to give up.
A child doesn't have enough strength to make this shot.
"I will do it. I'll stop the bombs even if I give up my life."
Come on, come on!
That's it!
It can't be.
"I only had this one ball."
"And now, even if I had another one, I don't know if I could."
"What can I do?"
"If this was the third explosion,
that means there's less than two minutes left."
"What can I do?"
"There's all this debris in the way, I can't even see the crossbar."

"Think, it goes. I don't have any more balls, either."
(Ayumi) Conan!
"What can I do?!"
We've come to rescue you.
No!
Ayumi?
Run, get out of here!
This thing will explode!
(Genta and Mitsuhiko) Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
Mitsuhiko.
Genta.
Hey, guys!
You must run away from here right now!
I have no more balls, I can't stop the stadium from exploding!
"The one signed by Hide?"
I do have one.
I don't quite understand what's going on,
but if you can stop the explosions with it, go ahead.
-Huh?
But, are you sure?
-Go, Mitsuhiko!
Go on, I'll pass it to you.
Teva!
Yes!
Come on, let's go!
Ayumi, you're in charge of passing it to Conan.
Ready?
Teva!
Ouch!
I got it.
Hold on, hold on.
I got it now.
All right, Ayumi!
-Mm-hm!
Ah...
-Run, pass it to Conan.
But how do I do it?
I don't... I don't know how to kick that far!
Just kick it over the debris.
Think of the kick they taught us.
"Guys..."
I'm sending it to you..., Conan.
Aaaah!
Oh! (Laughs)
Wow!
In the end... I always pull your chestnuts out of the fire myself.
How nice!
-Thanks, Ay.
Hurry up, Ay, don't dawdle.
Pass it to Conan, run!
Okay, okay, okay.
"Kudo, now the whole world depends on you."
Take it!
"All right, you guys are the best."
I don't get it.
Who are these kids?
"What do they think? That they'll be able to avoid the explosions by themselves?"
Run, we're running out of time!
"No, they can't, there's not even a minute left."
"I can't aim straight at the crossbar,
because there's all the debris in front of it, it's impossible."
"But if I shoot just like Endo taught us," he said,
"With spin, skimming the ball and hitting it from the side...,
I'll make it."
"I will, Endo."
"By skimming the ball
and hitting it to the side."
Vingaaaa!
Impossible.
It doesn't have enough spin, it won't come out.
Turn, go!
What?
Is it already?
-Yes, it is.
What a shot!
-Great, Conan!
Very good, Conan!
Very good!
What a kid...
So it's you in the end, the eleventh striker,
Conan Edogawa.

When I think...
that there was a bomb in the stadium where we were, I shudder.
It's very scary, yes.
Come to think of it.
What was that thing you said?
What was it?
Yeah, what you said about when you went to high school
and Shinichi kicked a ball.
Hide's kick!
Ran, watch out.
What?
White.
-I didn't expect it from you.
-Al√ßa, Conan.
This brat...
-Little-loose!
-Mm?
White what?
Conan...!
Ah, no, I was talking about...
Eh?
Ah, sorry.
(At the same time) "I could have also stopped with my head, couldn't I?"
