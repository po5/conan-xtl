DETECTIVE CONAN
The abduction of the crabs and the whale.
Ah!
Delicious!
There's nothing like a good beer in summer!
Stop it!
You can't just drink.
You should eat too!
Yes, I know, daughter.
(thinks) "What a disaster!"
"I thought we were going to have a nice meal
and here there's only beer and snacks."
"Who would think of that, taking a kid to a brewery for dinner?"
(He thinks) "This man has come to a brewery
and he hasn't even touched the beer."
Gee, father, no way, you're already drunk?
No, not yet.
Ran.
Where are you going? I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.
Yes, you're going wrong.
It's no here, the washroom.
You're a case, father!
Come, it's this way!
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?
This is Endo.
Yes.
Yes... I'm alone.
What do you say, now?!
Why won't you come?
I have the money, and I haven't reported it to the police.
Let me hear Keita's voice again!
Listen to me!
(Think) "This man... who knows if...?"
Kogoro!
Ran!
Come on, hurry!
We've got to go!
Conan, what's wrong with you?
(Quietly) I can't speak up.
It seems to me that someone has been kidnapped.
What are you saying?!
You were right.
It is very likely that they have kidnapped a child
and that he would have stayed at the brewery to pay the ransom.
And he didn't tell the police.
Listen, sir, it's important, don't lose sight of the front cab.
Yes, right.
He's a dentist.
What can we do?
How can we help you?
In a case like this?
Honestly, I don't know, daughter.
We should talk to him,
but you don't know from where they can watch you, the kidnappers.
We have to be very careful.
Wait a minute, I have an idea!
I'll pretend I'm a patient.
A patient?
Very good.
Come on, now.
My tooth hurts!
Ran, it hurts!
It hurts!
Please hold on a little, Conan.
Ai!
AIII!
Father will ask the dentist to look at it.
It hurts!
It hurts!
It hurts!
(Intercom) Yes?
Sorry to bother you at this hour.
My son has a toothache.
Could he visit now, please?
Ouch!
Ouch!
Father, it hurts!
Ouch!
Ow! (Intercom) Okay, come through the office door.
(Intercom) Okay, come through the office door.
Aiiiiiii!
It hurts!
It hurts so much!
Come in, sisplau.
It hurts so bad!
Thank you very much, Mr. dentist.
It makes me m...!
Wow!
I'm sick of feeling you scream!
Fly away, Conan?!
Don't hit him, sir.
It must hurt you very much.
No... Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Kogoro Mouri, private detective, Mr. Dentist.
Eh?
In Kogoro Mouri... the great detective.
What do you say now?
In Conan did you feel how he was talking on the phone?
Mr. Endo, do you feel like explaining everything that happened?
If what you say in Conan is true, I'd like to help you.
Understood.
I will tell you everything.
Destiny will have willed it.
The boy is right.
My son has been kidnapped.
Keita is called.
This afternoon he was playing alone in the front yard and all of a sudden...
Keita!
Do you want to go to the park?
Keita?
"We have your son."
"If you report him to the police your son will die."
Wait for a call?
This message is written on ordinary paper.
And what did the kidnappers say to him?
From the voice, it must be a young man.
He wanted 30 million yen in bills used at the Starlight Hotel,
at 6 o'clock in the evening.
It took me a lot of effort to get that money together.
He told me to take it to the brewery.
But shortly after 6 o'clock,
he called me and told me he wasn't coming.
Did he tell you why?
Well, no, Mr. Mouri,
but he said he'd call me back tomorrow morning.
Did something happen to the kidnapper?
(He thinks) "The kidnapper had already foreseen that he would not pick them up".

"He was probably watching him from the beer
to make sure that Mr.
Endo had not alerted the police."
By the way, Mr. Endo,
the first time you were called, you heard Keita's voice?
Yes.
I told the kidnapper that I wanted to talk to him.
And how did it seem to you that he was, in Keita?
Well, the truth is that he seemed to be very happy.
That's strange.
The normal thing would be that in Keita he would have asked for the mother.
She has no mother.
She died last year of an illness.
That's probably why Keita was so fond of her mother.
the kindergarten teachers and the neighbors in our street.
Of course, of course... Mr. Endo, I understand everything.
The kidnapper must have an accomplice
who knows how to entertain the children and who takes care of Keita.
(He thinks) "In Kogoro he must be right."
"The thing is still serious,
but we know that there is someone who takes care of Keita."
(Kogoro) I should advise you to report him to the police,
it's the best thing to do.
I can't do that!
If the police get involved,
they might catch the kidnapper, but...
but there is no guarantee that Keita will come back.
But Mr.
Endo...
-Mr. Mouri! -Say, say.
For the moment I can only trust you.
Please, please, please!
Help me to get my son back safe and sound.
Please help me!
All right, you understand!
I, the one who has come.
I will do everything I can to solve this kidnapping.
Thank you very much, Mr. Mouri!
But for the moment it is too risky for us to stay here with you.
We are going to leave, and we will communicate only by phone.
Is that clear, sir?
-I'll keep this photo of the child.
-I'll keep this photo of the child.
-I'll keep this picture of the boy.
Don't worry, sir.
I won't stop until it's sorted out.
I'll get your son back to you safe and sound.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. Mouri.
Thank you very much, Mr. Mouri.
(Thinking) "I've already prepared the sender."
"We just have to wait for the kidnappers to call you."
(Phone)
Mouri Investigation Agency, say.
What are you saying?
They have already called you?!
And what did they tell you?
(Endo) Now they're asking for 20 million yen more.
I've convinced them that I needed two hours to prepare them, but...
Two hours.
And you were able to talk to Keita?
Yes.
I did what you told me and they let me talk.
He said something strange.
(Kogoro) Something strange?!
Keita?
Keita, is that you?!
-Dad? -Keita!
Are you all right?
-Yes, daddy!
It's full of crabs! -Crabs?!
(Man) Hey!
What t'empatolles, kid?
Keep it in mind, if you tell it to the police...
(Keita) There's a whale that draws water!
(Man) Stop talking!
I'll call you back.
Keita?
(Man) Hey!
(Keita) Hey!
The kidnapper said: "What t'empatolles" to the child?
Yes.
Very well.
Understood.
Please hurry, prepare the ransom money.
If all goes well, in two hours you will have Keita at home.
What... what do you say, now?!
It would make me so happy, Mr. Mouri!
What father, do you have any clue about the kidnappers?
Yes!
In Keita is in a place with crabs and a whale that draws water!
Crabs and a whale? You don't think it's the sea, do you?
You're such a donkey!
In the sea it would be impossible to see a whale spouting water
unless you went to Ogasawara.
In Keita I didn't see a real whale, but a sculpture.
A sculpture?
And we could find it...
...in an aquarium!
What does it say?
No sculpture of a whale, here?
No.
There are lots of crabs, but there's no whale.
Oh, shit!
Must be in another aquarium.
I don't have much time!
Let's go, let's go!
Hey, Kogoro... Mm?
Could it be that they're not real crabs?
What are you saying?
When in Keita said, "It's full of crabs,"
the kidnapper said, "What the t'empatolles, now, kid?".
This means that the kidnapper didn't see any crabs where they were.
Mm... could be.
But then, they wouldn't have called him from an aquarium.
Where the hell did they call him from?
Father!
Look at this!
A whale!
Of course it's a whale!
The character from the TV ad campaign!
What if Keita had seen this blimp?

This would mean that it must be somewhere it can be seen from!
I got it!
The TV people have told me that when the hijacker is called,
the blimp was passing over the Beika park.
Yesterday I had to take the money to a hotel in Beika!
Very good!
We go back to Beika and look for a place with lots of crabs!
Keita must be that way!
How did it go?
Nothing!
Me neither.
We're running out of time.
The kidnappers must be about to arrive.
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
They called you two minutes ago.
He was told to wait on Platform 1 at Karajuku Station.
Karajuku Station? That's right!
Ran and I will go.
Stay here and look for the crabs.
(Think) "Even if they don't catch it, there's a transmitter in the suitcase!"
"At least we'll know where he's gone."
Maybe he'll get him on the train, the hijacker.
Yes, sometimes, the rendezvous point can be somewhere else.
Hey!
Tiri'm the suitcase!
Do you want your son to stay alive?!
He's already screwed us!
Ran!
You say he has fled?
Yes, but Mr.
Mouri has photographed the license plate of the bike.
It won't take long to find him.
The signal is coming from a specific point and he's not moving.
The kidnapper is close!
A little more!
You turn the corner and...!
Oh, shit!
He has put the money in another suitcase!
But in Kogoro he's taken a picture of the license plate, so...
What if it was the kidnapper's?
It would be a fake license plate!
We've already smoked it!
(Thinking) "We must track down the kidnappers."
"Now that they have the money, Keita...!"
"I have to find the place where there are crabs and the airship!"
"Wait a minute, if I'm not mistaken,
Keita said, "The whale draws water."
"That blimp doesn't draw water!"
"It wasn't the blimp, what you saw in Keita?"
"Or maybe..."
"Eh? Maybe...!"
"I wouldn't see it, from here."
"I've got it! The Starlight Hotel!"
"Surely you'd see it, from there!"
"Beika Park!"
"I get it!"
"In Keita has seen the smoke coming out of that incinerator."
"And he would only have been able to see it
from the point where the incinerator and the park coincide!"
"More or less here!"
"But you can't see it, from this height."
"Because it looks like it draws water,
it should be at the same height as the blimp."
"And if it was in this hotel ?!"
"Gee, how dangerous, I could have hurt myself..... Eh?"
"The tables and chairs..."
"And if the crabs were...!"
"I can see them! The crabs!"
"Looking at it from above, the tables and chairs look like crabs!
"I have no doubt about it! In Keita is in this hotel!"
Madam!
Do you know which room it is, this child?
Ah, I know him!
He was on the floor below,
but a moment ago he left with his parents.
Thank you.
(Think) "I've already found them! In Keita is still alive!"
Yaiba, hit him!
Hit him!
Fort, don't be afraid!
Come on, come on!
Yaiba, hit him!
Hey, you mean we've got to get rid of the kid?
Flights stop!
Now don't get sentimental on me, you!
Come on, let's go.
Stop it! Stop it!
Keita!
These two are kidnappers!
Catch them!
Shit!
Do not move!
If you move I'll kill the child!
Go apartu's-e!
Quickly!
(thinks) "There's nothing to shoot?"
I've got the bike parked here in front.
When we're out, run!
-Ready? -Yes, we're ready.
I've got you!
All right.
It's settled!

Keita!
How happy I am!
I'm so happy!
Are you okay, Keita?
Dad, you're hurting me.
How did you manage to find out I was here?
It was a coincidence!
I was looking for that crab coi and suddenly I saw Keita.
I stood so still that I called "kidnappers"!
And the kidnappers got scared!
They are miserable bastards!
Kogoro!
Ah, Inspector Megure!
Conan explained everything to me.
Why didn't you warn me, when you heard about the kidnapping?

Don't you trust me, Kogoro?
Ah, no, it's not that, it's not that, inspector...
"Inspector Megure gave Kogoro a lecture."
"But it suits him now and then."
What happened?!
(Kogoro) It's murder!
It's impossible to get out of this window.
(Thinks) "Why is there blood, here?"
"The Ikuta was right here, in the dark."
"Maybe...!"
