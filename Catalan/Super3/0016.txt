DETECTIVE CONAN
The collector's murder case
(Kogoro) I would put my hand in the fire.
Your wife has a lover, Mr. Maru.
Look at the mole under her eye.
This woman is his wife, Mrs. Ineku Maru.
She has jumped again!
(Think) "Gee. How much longer will he keep us waiting, Kogoro?"
"I was already wondering why he invited us to eat at the restaurant..."
"I don't know of any detective
Who's going to report a case of adultery with a child to his client."
"A visitor?"
Listen, detective, this man, who is he?
Well, I don't know yet.
(ringing)
A visitor.
(Hey!
(doorbell rings) Come on!
Do not open the door?!
Ah, it's true...
As you were coming, I told the servants to go away
so that we could talk in peace.
I'll be right back, I'll send the visitor to the living room.
Do, do.
I'm sorry it took so long.
Wait a moment in the living room.
(Phone)
Don't stop, this phone!
Mr. Maru!
(Ring)
It will be in the living room and you won't feel it.
(Ring)
(Ring)
(Ring) Eh?
Fuck!
What's wrong, Conan?
Didn't you hear a strange noise?
No, I didn't hear anything strange.
Ran, don't you find it takes too long, that man?
That's right.
What's he doing?
(Phone ringing)
Now it's stopped ringing.
(Think) "It's only rung once?"
How much longer are you going to make me wait?
(Phone)
(Thinking) "Again.... What's the meaning of this?"
I've run out of patience!
I'm going to the living room!
(Thinks) "Oh... how hungry I am." (I scream)
What is this?
What's going on here?
But who are you?
First tell me who you are.
We are the servants of this house.
What is it, this commotion?
-Mrs. Maru! -Mrs. Maru! -Mrs. Maru! -Mrs. Maru!
What's going on here?
We found this man hanging around the house!
Oh!
A burglar?
I'm a detective and I've been hired by the owner of the house.
A detective?
And may I know why you hired a detective?
-Ask this to your husband. On is it, my husband?
He went to open the door and didn't come back.
-Please go and look.
-Yes, madam!
Y... what did you find out, detective?
I'll pay you twice as much as him!
Guardi'm the secret, please!
Keep me!
One moment, madam.
(shouting)
What's the matter?!
Aaah! Aaah!
Aaaah! It's death, death!
Ran!
Go call the police, run!
Yes!
The victim's name is Denjiro Maru, 51 years old.
He's the owner of this house.
He practiced sword fighting, right?
Yes... he was on the third level.
Mm... so he knew strength.
This Japanese sword is his, then?
Yes, it was on display in the room.
Based on the state of the room,
there must have been a good fight.
The killer must also be a good swordsman.
Huh?
Is that the victim's schedule?
He was a very busy man.
Hey, Conan, you told me earlier you saw the visitor, right?
Yes, but only the legs.
Let's see, who should Mr. Maru meet today?
Kogoro Mouri, Yuji Suwa, Ikuya Hatano, Makoto Akutsu...
4 people.
Inspector!
We've caught a suspect!
What do you say now?
This man was hanging around outside.
I didn't do anything.
Oh, it's Dr. Hatano!
Hatano?
Mr. Ikuya Hatano from the address book?
Yes, he's my husband's doctor.
He visits him every week.
A doctor...
Let me go!
Let me go!
I said let me go, you fools!
Don't you know who I am?!
I am the great sculptor Akutsu!
Akutsu?
It's Makoto Akutsu?
Already 3 of the 4 people listed in the agenda have appeared.

The murderer was an old acquaintance of the victim.
Once again, gentlemen, "case solved"!
That I have done something?
Excuse me, I'm in Suwa.
May I know what it is, all this dreadfulness?
And who the hell is it, this child?
He won't stop!
Sir, you're a swordsman, aren't you?
Eh?!
How do you know that, child?
It's very easy, by the left hand.
The left hand?
You have a scar between the big finger and the index finger, don't you?
Swordsmen get a scar right here
from all the times they put the sword in the sheath.
That's why I figured it out.
Is this true? Yes.
I've had the scar since I was young.
So the murderer is you!
Murderer?
But what's wrong?
How, how could it happen?
Maybe you accuse me of murder, you?!
Just look at all the signs!
The murderer is a good swordsman.
So it was you!
I was just coming to return 5 million yen that he left me in Maru.
To return money?
That's right.
I have the money here.
Where were you at the time of the crime, between 3 and 5 o'clock?
At that time I was in the training room doing meditation.
Do you have any witnesses to confirm that?
Well... I don't think so.
It's suspicious.
Father, isn't that a little strange?
Isn't the corpse holding the sword with the other hand?
He's right... look at this photo.
Mr. Maru is holding it with the other hand.
They put the sword in her hand when she was already dead.
No matter how much they fought...
it's not normal for there to be so many cuts on the ceiling and walls.
He is right!
The murderer wanted to put the blame on Mr. Suwa, who is a swordsman.
But he made a mistake when he put the sword to the victim.
Mr. Akutsu, why did you come here?
I had also asked you for a loan, 10 million.
You came to return it?
No, no, I came to ask you to pay me back.
And between 3 and 5 o'clock? I was alone in my workshop.
So you don't have an alibi, do you?
And what were you doing here?
Me, you tell me?
Of course, Kogoro!
You were also meeting with the victim.
And now!
I was coming to take a report of an investigation
about your wife's infidelity.
Mrs. Maru's infidelity?
(He thinks) "What an ass!"
"How can it be that a detective talks about an investigation?"
Doctor, where were you at the time of the crime?
From 3 to 5 I was in Ginza watching a movie.
(Think) "Eh? What smell."
"Door woman's perfume. It's very familiar to me, that smell..."
Conan, stop!
It's rude to go sniffing people!
Aaaaaaaa... You're right.
"It's the smell of this woman!"
"This means that maybe..."
Madam, it makes the same smell as the doctor.
Yes, it's true, they wear the same perfume.
Do you always wear women's perfume, you?
Ah, no... it's... what do you know?
Ah, I get it!
It's Mrs. Maru's lover, you?
-Oh!
-That's right!
It's useless to keep it a secret.
So, I'll confess.
Dr. Hatano is my lover.
But we are innocent,
because we have been at the Beika hotel from noon to night!
And if they have agreed to alibi?
What did he say?
"Anyway, apart from Kogoro,
the other suspects don't have an alibi."
"Who is it, the murderer?"
Hey, kid!
Here we go again!
(Answering machine) "I'm at Hatano. Mr. Maru?"
"Well, anyway, I'll come at 5 o'clock as arranged."
(Answering machine: female voice) "4:30 minutes past 4."
(Piiiiip)
"I'm in Suwa."
"I was supposed to come at 6, but I'll come a little earlier."
"I've already arranged everything for next month's test."
"I'll explain later." (Piiiiiiip)
(Answering machine) "4 and 41 minutes."
Dr. Hatano was supposed to come at 5, and you at 6,
but he's called to say he'll be here earlier.
I left a message too! Oh, did you?
It said, "I'll ask for a postponement, but I'll give you your money back.
If the dragon statue is sold, I will kill him!"
I will kill him?
I was just saying that, because he threatened me,
and told me that if I didn't return the money, he would sell the statue.
What statue was it?
It is this dragon!

(Thinking) "It's suspicious..."
"This statue..."
I'm so glad they didn't scratch it.
Sir, how lucky you were!
Eh?
It's the only one that's not damaged!
Yes, now I'm absolutely sure.
Mr. Akutsu, the murderer is you.
Why do you say so?!
You murdered Mr. Maru,
and you wanted to put the blame on Mr. Suwa.
But you made mistakes:
You made a mistake when you put the sword in the victim's hand.
And he did not scratch the statue of the dragon!
He may have committed murder, but he failed to scratch the statue.
It must be a coincidence!
Then why did he lie when he said he had left a message?
It's true that I left it!
"We felt 3 calls."
"The last two were short,
but the first one rang many times."
(Riiiiiiiing)
Sir, nothing happened, when you are called?
It didn't take long for the answering machine to go off?
Now that you say it, it's true: it rang for a long time...
We have the phone programmed
to turn on the answering machine when it has rung 10 times.
Exactly, that's what I said.
Cap, what time must you have called?
It was just before 4.
He must have felt the call to the crime scene,
when he was killing Mr. Maru.
That's why he's making up this lie.
No!
I made a call!
(He thinks) "If he is the murderer,
why does he explain such an unbelievable lie?"
"But your message is not the answering machine..."
"Wait a minute!"
"One of the suspects has left a strange message."
"It's not logical what he said."
"If so, the murderer is..."
Ma'am, are there any valuables in this room?
The key to the safe is in the drawer.
Oh!
It's not ?!
It's gone!
It was you, wasn't it?!
Ah...
Well, it's in another drawer...
Oh... Mrs. Maru...
But it's very strange, my husband always left it here.
"This chest of drawers!"
"The stripes on the sword don't match!"
Hey, listen, is there an instant camera, in this house?
Why do you want it?
The inspector needs it right now!
Well, I'll go get it.
Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiii!
Coi de chiquillo, don't get in the way!
"Too bad!"
"Anyway, I got what I wanted."
"It's coming out, it's coming out. Let's see..."
"I'll cut out the drawers with the scratches that don't bind."
"That's it!"
"I thought so!"
"I have solved the mystery!"
Come, accompany me to the police station.
Why?!
Come, come, all the evidence accuse him!
Let me go!
I said it wasn't me!
But what is he doing now, this jerk?
Come on, come on boy!
(Kogoro voice) Just a moment!
Mouri, what...?
Inspector!
This time I'm sure!
I know the identity of the murderer!
So who is it, the murderer?
The murderer is...
It's you, Mr. Suwa!
You're an expert swordsman,
you wouldn't have made a mistake when placing the sword.
That's exactly what fooled us.
Mr. Suwa had it all figured out.
But what do you mean?
He crossed out the room with the sword
and placed the sword in the victim's hand
so that all the clues would point to him.
But to exonerate himself, he put the sword in the wrong place.
So it would seem that they wanted to accuse him,
and that this would make them rule him out as a suspect!
Mr. Mouri, please,
you accuse me of murder with this grotesque assumption?
Mouri, you are right.
Besides, how do you explain that the statue is not scratched?
You said the murderer was the Akutsu!
(Kogoro voice) Well, it wasn't true.
Why wasn't it true?
Mr. Suwa didn't scratch it
to put the blame on Mr. Akutsu.
It was the first day I had seen Mr. Akutsu.
How could he know the statue was his?
By answering machine.
Eh ?!
For the call the Akutsu said he had made.
Surely you have felt it while committing murder!
(Answering machine) If you sell the dragon statue, I'll kill you!
Then it must have occurred to you to charge the dead man to the Akutsu.
But the Akutsu's message has not been recorded.
There is left, but in Suwa there is engraved its above.
But this could also have been done by Dr. Hatano!
Mr. Suwa, to your message...

confessed that the murderer of Maru was you!
What a ?!
He called and left a message saying he would come early.
Isn't it strange, that he wanted to come early
knowing that the other person was not at home?
He only said that because he knew that Mr. Maru was dead.
(laughs)
Mr. Maru had told me that he had someone between 4 and 5,
therefore, I figured that even if I got there earlier,
I'd probably find him at home.
What, even if you suspect me, Mr. Detective?
It's not that I suspect you...
it's that I'm sure it was you.
The murderer is you!
How do you know that?
Because in this room, there is the proof that proves it.
But... And where is it?
(Kogoro voice) The reason for all the scratches
is that he wanted to camouflage something.
Camouflage something?
The scratches on the calaixera.
Eh?
Isn't it true that there are places where the marks are truncated?
Of course, it's true!
So that the murderer has expressly moved the drawers.
To put them right,
change the second drawer from the left of the top row to the right end of the same row.
to the right end of the same row.
Then change the one on the far left of the second row,
to the left end of the fifth row.
The second from the second row to the left by the right end.
And the second from the left of the third row to the right end of the fourth row.
to the right end of the fourth row.
Eh?
It says here...
...Suwa!
The victim must have written down the name of his killer
while Suwa was listening to the Akutsu's call.
Mr. Suwa, you noticed and moved the drawers around.
Then, you crossed them out so we wouldn't notice.
But, the dresser would have been the only one scratched out,
And you decided to cross out the whole room!
And he thought that we would not see the message on the chest of drawers!
Why did he do that?
He took the money I owed him.
For the sword.
For the sword?
The one the victim was holding?
It's not a worthless sword.
"It's been in my family for generations."
"The "Kikuchio"!"
"It was collateral for the loan, but he..."
Ah, yes, the sword... it turns out I sold it to me.
I didn't get paid very well for it.
I'll keep the money for the sword as interest.
When I realized, I had already wounded it.
Yes.
It was like that!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Everything went just as you said.
But it's so cute, seeing me coming and not moving.
You are a very brilliant detective, Kogoro Mouri!
The biggest mistake I made
was not knowing that someone as brilliant as you was here.

Oh father I congratulate you!
You have taught me a lesson again!
Eh?
Eh?
Look, Father, you've got something on your mind.
Eh? (Kogoro) Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Kogoro) Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Kogoro) Blood!
I'm going to die!
Call an ambulance!
"A curiosity:
Kogoro Mouri's wound was a 3 millimeter cut."
Don't wake me up, that's why!
What, is it a robbery?!
You have arrived in Genta?
Hey, pretty, you will not prepare me dinner today?
May I speak to Inspector Megure? Oh, my lord...
They've already got us!
A department store?
What if they went there?
Hey!
Come on. Come on.
Calm down, Ran!
In the next chapter...
