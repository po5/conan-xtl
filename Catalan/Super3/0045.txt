DETECTIVE CONAN
The face mask murder case
Mrs. Kojima!
We are from Beika security.
Do you have a problem?
We're coming in!
Mrs. Kojima, we'll open the door.
-It was! -Yes.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Excuse me, gentlemen, did I scare you?
No, no.
I was late because I was putting on a mask.
Your alarm went off.
Did something happen?
Well, no... nothing happened.
What's strange...
Mr.
Kawamura.
All right, we know who did it.
This cat must have passed in front of the sensor.
And since it's sensitive, the alarm went off.
Please, madam, close the door tightly, okay?
Thank you very much.
Ah, what a tech, right?
They say there's nothing like Chinese food,
but this restaurant's food was delicious, wasn't it?
(Think) It's hard to say, if you only taste noodles.
Gee, it's late.
Today they are doing the series that Yoko is in.
Yoko, beautiful, I'm running to see you!
Hey, Father, watch out!
Father, no!
-Did it go wrong, sir?
-Imbecile!
You have to watch out!
Aaaaaa... excuse me..., I...
You have to look ahead, when driving!
It was also your fault, to cross without looking.
He is right!
What did you think? (Mobile)
Yes, you say?
Yes.
Mr. Megure?
Eh?
The Metropolitan Police?
Hello, Inspector, it's Mouri!
What the hell am I doing here in the middle?
It doesn't matter, that's all.
Are you investigating some crime?
What's he saying?
A murder suspect?
Okay, sir!
I'll take care of myself!
Hey, Kogoro!
Come here, you!
Give it up, boy!
I'm sorry but you're out of luck,
because you've run into the famous Kogoro Mouri!
I don't know what this is all about!
If you want to say something, tell it to the police station!
(Think) How strange for the police to call a suspect on the phone....
But what if...?"
Hello, Inspector Megure!
Come this way!
Hello, but I'm busy.
I, the famous detective, have brought you the suspect!
Eh?
What's the matter, you, now?
Think a little, Kogoro.
If it were true that Taeko Izumi is a suspect, would you have called him?
Yes, of course, now that you say so....
(Think) Sure, I thought about it.
You are at Taeko Izumi, from the Beika investment company,
and you came to this house tonight, right?
Aaa... well... Yes.
You arrived here at 8 o'clock... and left at 8:40 minutes past 8 o'clock.
Is that correct?
Yes.
How can you be so precise, Inspector Megure?
So that the security camera of the house has filmed it.
It must have been him after all! He couldn't have done it.
When Mr. Izumi left, at around 8:50,
his daughter came to see her.
We think the lady was alive at that time.
The guards from the security company confirmed it.
The security guards?
A cat set off the alarm and the security guards came.
I called Mr.
Izumi to ask him some questions about Mrs. Kojima.
Kojima.
Ah, you guys...
By the way, Inspector, who is this lady?
She was the owner of an electronic components store.
Her name was Miyako Kojima, and she was the president.
She was strangled to death.
Since I think we're all here, we might as well start, right, Kogoro?
The Chizuru, the victim's daughter.
This is Mr.
Yoshioka.
He discovered the body.
Who is this man?
I am the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
Kogoro Mouri?
Of course he's famous!
Let's see... according to the surveillance camera,
M.
Izumi arrived at 8 o'clock, and left at 8:40.
Chizuro arrived at 8:50 and left at 9:10.
Then Mr. Yoshioka came at 9:00 a.m.
Yoshioka, at 20 minutes past 9 o'clock.

He discovered the body and called the police at 9:31. Agreed?
We have to agree by force!
(Thinking) It doesn't seem that his mother has just died... How strange!
Your mother was alive when you left?
Of course, so much!
Hey, are you insinuating that I murdered her?!
Oh, no, and now, no way!
The time of death,
must be between ten past nine and ten and twenty minutes past nine.
Was the house locked?
When Mr. Yoshioka arrived, the front door was open
and all the other doors were locked.
Therefore, the murderer must be one of the 3 people who came.
Considering the time of death, we can rule out Mr. Izumi.
This man had a motive to kill my mother!
My mother wanted to denounce this man,
because she had lost 3 billion in the stock market because of him!
Eh?
And now...
-It was you! -No, I didn't...
First he made it look like he was leaving and then he snuck in, didn't he?
I don't think it was him.
But, Conan!
There's an important detail.
If the time of death is correct, he couldn't have killed.
Why not?
Because at around 9:50 minutes past 9... At 9:50 minutes past 9?
Of course it is.
What do you mean?
Mr. Izumi was with us in the Beika area, then.
I get it.
It would take about 50 minutes to an hour to get here.
So, he's innocent.
Hey, inspector, maybe he has done some cheating!
I agree with her!
Of course...
you also had a good motive to kill the president, didn't you?
What does it say?!
What the fuck does it mean?
Her mother couldn't see her
because she had married a man she didn't like.
She must not fuck anything up!
If it were true, I had no reason to kill her!
You asked her to leave you money, but she wouldn't let you.
You two got to be very close, didn't you, Chizuru?
One day when you were arguing about some company problem,
you told her you'd kill her!
-What?
Don't talk nonsense!
-Let it go!
According to the circumstances,
the crime must have been committed by one of you two.
Why did you come here, Chizuru?
So that the mother would tell me.
So she could lecture me.
And you strangled him because you had an argument?
Cut it out, you sleazy detective!
You're a sleazy one?!
Don't worry, Kogoro, don't be silly.
Mr. Yoshioka, why did you come here?
To discuss important company matters.
(Think) All signs point to one of the two of them.
Just to confirm, we'll play the video from the camera.
If you notice any important details, please call me.
First, at 8 o'clock, Mr. Izumi arrives and enters the house.
Izumi arrives and enters the house.
He leaves at 8:40 minutes past 8.
Then Chizuru arrives.
It is 50 minutes past 8.
Then, 10 minutes later,
President Miyako opens the door and talks to security.
So Mrs. Kojima was alive at that time.
(Thinking) What could it be?
I see something different.
Chizuru leaves at 10 minutes past 9.
At 20 minutes past 9, Mr. Yoshioka arrives.
Yoshioka arrives.
When no one opens the door, he enters and finds...
the corpse of President Miyako.
Hey!
Just a moment!
Rewind it, please.
Here.
Why did you go out on the street, sir?
To go and tell the police I'd found her dead.
There'd be a phone in the house.
Why did she go out?
It's strange.
I was scared.
And I called them from the cell phone.
It's understandable, if you go in and find a dead body...
But he found the body and stayed inside for 10 minutes.
Now that's weird!
What did he do for those 10 minutes?
And he's got something in his hand.
Look, that.
Please explain yourself, Mr. Yoshioka!
I get it...
These documents prove
that you had appropriated money from the company.
I had come to talk to her because I didn't want her to make it public.
Of course, but since you didn't understand them, you strangled him, didn't you?
No!
Mrs. Miyako was already dead!
Who are you trying to fool?
It's all true!
But I thought that these documents would make me a suspect.

And he called the police after hiding in the car.
That's right.
Well, we'll just explain it to the police station, that's all.
It wasn't me!
I assure you she was already dead!
Believe me!
It wasn't me!
(thinks) "What could it be?
"There's something strange about this corpse.
If she knew visitors were coming, it's curious that she was wearing a bathrobe."
How strange...
What do you find strange, Ran?
His mouth is open, but there are no wrinkles on his face.
(Thinking) "I get it.
It would be like some kind of death mask."
Inspector Megure, we'll take the corpse.
Very well, understood.
(Thinking) Not oysters.
They're already taking the corpse.
There's something strange about this corpse.
What do you mean?
Apart from wearing a bathrobe, he's wearing a face mask.
What's strange about it?
She was expecting visitors, but dressed for bed.
You're right, Conan.
What's it like?
But she was expecting her daughter, wasn't she?
And I was also expecting Mr.
Yoshioka, who came when she left.
Besides, Mrs. Miyako has been strangled to death.
The Ran says it's strange that the mask isn't wrinkled.
Is that so?
Ah, yes.
If she had been strangled and fought back,
there should be some wrinkles...
Check it out.
Yes.
So this means that...
That the killer put the mask on her after she was murdered.
And then put the bathrobe on her.
But why?
Was she dressed like that when you arrived, Chizuru?
Was she?
Yes.
What, what's wrong?
I'm not the only one who saw it.
The guards too!
Yes.
When we came to check why the alarm had gone off,
Mrs.
Kojima was dressed like that.
Why did the killer put her mask back on?
Did you see anything unusual, sir?
Well, not as far as I remember, no.
Are you sure it was her?
The eyes, the mouth... do you see everything the same?
It's hard to say.
Her face was covered...
I remember that I stood still
because she had her lips painted purple and they stood out.
She is not wearing lipstick!
Was the lipstick the same color as hers?
Yes, it was that color!
So, you were the person who talked to the security!
You have murdered your mother because she has not left you the money!
But the problem started when you inadvertently set off the alarm.
If you didn't open the door,
the guards would have entered and discovered the body.
He got scared, and disguised himself as his mother.
She ran to put on a mask and a bathrobe,
so the guards wouldn't realize she wasn't her mother.
As they are mother and daughter, they look a bit alike.
But, in her haste,
she opened her lips without removing her make-up.
She took out her mother's lipstick,
so that the mascaras are applied when you've removed your make-up.
Yes, it's true, I opened the door and put the mask on my mother.
But she was already dead when I arrived.
As everyone knew that we were not Avenières,
I thought that if I left things as they were, they would suspect me.
That's why...
Believe me!
It was not me!
No!
(Thinks) "The masking she has prepared.
"But apart from fé'ns-e believe her alibi,
she has mistaken the time of death.
"Of course!
"If the time of death wasn't correct.....
Gee!"
Listen to something, sir.
What do you want?
We haven't found any.
(Think) "How strange, you haven't found it?
What if it was...?"
Listen, can I go now, Mr. inspector?
Ah... yes, thank you very much.
But maybe one of these days we'll have to interrogate again.
Yes.
Okay, Mr. Inspector.
Ouch!
What are you doing, Conan?
How can I say it's not annoying!
I'm sorry, Mr. Taeko.
It's the same, it's the same.
(Thinking) "I thought so!
Now I'm really going.
Around and around."
Ouch.
Oh!
Here we are...
Kogoro! Father! (Kogoro voice)
(Kogoro's voice) Wait, Sir.
Izumi!
(Kogoro voice) Eh?
We can't finish the comedy,
if the protagonist leaves the stage.
Excuse me, but what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?
Now I know who he is, the real killer.
But father...
Didn't you say it was Chizuru?
No.

I have only discovered the plot she has concocted to protect herself.
The masking of the Chizuru
has made us miscalculate the time of death.
She inadvertently gave the killer an alibi.
You mean the killer is...?
What? He must be joking.
You must be joking.
I was in Beika's area at the time of the crime.
Don't you remember?
If what she said was true,
the crime would have been committed before 8:50 minutes past 8:00.
And you could have committed it too!
It's absurd!
Do you believe her story?
What proof do you have that I murdered him?
(Kogoro voice) Chizuru, was your mother short-sighted?
Was she?
Yes.
But because she was conceited,
she didn't want to wear glasses and wore contact lenses.
Please take another good look at her.
She's only wearing the left eye lens.
She only wears the one on her left eye!
We haven't found any contact lenses.
It's not worth looking for, because the murderer has it.
Yes!
The other contact lens has been left inside...
...of the fold of your pants, Mr.
Izumi!
Excuse me, Taeko.
It's here!
How... how could it be!
It couldn't have just happened to end up here.
It must have been very close to the victim.
And that means you're the murderer, Mr. Izumi!
He said he'd report me, that he'd take the case to court.
I had only followed your instructions
when it came to investing.
But when he started losing money, he blamed me.
Please, I beg you not to report me.
I will return your money...
It's already taken care of.
The land where your parents live...
must be worth a lot, right?
What's that?
But...
Your parents told me they'll pay me back the money,
even if they have to sell.
You should thank them, because they love you very much.
I couldn't forgive him for wrapping up my poor parents.

I congratulate you.
Thanks to you, we have solved another case.

I'll let you know, for another complicated case.
Thank you, sir.
What a joy!
Ran, Conan!
We'll celebrate!
We'll go to dinner!

Am I a cheapskate?
Viscaaaaaaa! Viscaaaaaaa!
We'll celebrate with a bowl of noodles with caaaarn!

(Think) Why his with the zen posture?
This means that the murderer is one of you, gentlemen.

...that it has to be her, the murderer!"
