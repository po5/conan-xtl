Ah!
Look, it's already dark.
No wonder,
because you've spent more than an hour eating your dessert session.
Look who's talking!
If it's you, you've spent an hour chatting with the waitress.
What are you talking about?
I didn't talk, I listened attentively.
She explained me all the problems she has, poor thing.
(Woman) Aaah!
(Woman) Oh.
Ran!
Call an ambulance!
And the police, too.
Yes.
Yes.
It looks pretty good that he fell.
Hm?
Look.
Eh?
Oh.
Ooh!
Hey!
What's the matter with you?
Oysters!
Huh?
"A black cloth splattered by crime
is filled with color with a brilliant deduction."
"A beautiful and mysterious woman... witnesses a deadly fall."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"Beauty, lies and secrets."
Right, right.
You represent that this man attacked her when she was going to get the car?
Yes.
And that's why I started running
and went straight to the emergency stairs.
(gasps) Ah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
I was so scared.
I thought he wanted to kill me.
Of course he did.
And you say you don't have the slightest doubt that it was the same individual
you saw the day of the robbery at your house?
Yes.
I'm absolutely certain.
Inspector, what robbery are you referring to?
A robbery with murder.
Eh?
A robbery with murder?
Eh?
A week ago, at night, a burglar broke into Mrs. Takizawa's house...
Takizawa's house...
through the second-floor balcony.
"He threatened her husband
"and made him open the safe in his study...
to steal a jewelry collection worth 100 million yen."
"And then killed Mr. Takizawa."
I didn't wake up
until I heard the sound of the glass tablet breaking.
I rushed to the study, but my husband already....
Oh!
And you're quite sure,
that the thief was the same man who attacked you in the parking lot today?
Yes, indeed.
The assailant's name was Takeshi Yaginuma,
he was the manager of a jazz bar...
which Mr. Takizawa had apparently frequented on a regular basis...
for some time.
We had already identified him as a possible suspect.
All that was left was for Mrs. Takizawa to identify him.
Now I understand, and that's why he attacked her in the parking lot.
It's obvious that she wanted to avoid at all costs that he could identify.
Hm.
Come in.
(Door: knock)
Inspector, when we searched Mr. Yaginuma's premises we found this
hidden under some tiles in the storeroom.
Let's see what's there...
Please, take a look and enjoy.
Could you tell us if these are the jewels that were stolen?
Yes, indeed.
They are mine.
Hm.
Well, so it all fits.
Hm.
It's a pity we didn't enxamp√©ssim it earlier.
But now we can send all the information to the judge
so he can close the case of the robbery.
I'm glad you got the jewelry back.
But one thing...
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
How come you went to park the car on the third floor of the parking garage?
Eh?
I say this because before I noticed
that the first and second floors were practically empty.
That's why I don't quite understand
why he parked on the third floor, really.
It seems a bit strange to me.
Did he do it for some special reason or did he just...?
Shut up, brat.
Don't get involved, if you don't want to receive.
Haven't you seen it, Mrs. Takizawa's car?
You can't park a car like this just anywhere.
She went up to the third floor to avoid being robbed.
Thieves always look at the lower floors first.
Don't they?
Haha!
I guess...
Ah, right... I'm sorry.
I hadn't thought of that.
Since I've never been, in a car like that.
Yes.
Conan, right?
Your name is Conan?
Yes.
You like cars?
And you don't know how excited I'd be to ride in one like yours.
Oh.
Well, one day I'll take you for a ride.
Hey, kid.
Don't overdo it.
Yeah?

And when will it be?
No, I'm saying that because it's very likely that we won't see each other again.
All right, well, if you want, I can take you right now.
-It's all right.
-We don't want to disturb you.
But I'll have to go alone after everything that's happened.
Well, I'll go with you.
Hehe!
That's great!
Conan, you know you're the first?
Eh?
You're the first man to get into my car.
Oh, is that so?
How come your husband never got in before?
It's just that his heart was a little delicate.
And he said he was afraid of how I drive.
Oh, really?
(Wheels: squeaking)
Oh...
Oh... (tires screech) Ah...
Sorry, eh.
Every once in a while I get this sudden rush of acceleration.
It's an adrenaline rush.
Who, me?
Do you smoke, Mrs. Takizawa?
No, I don't smoke.
Why do you say that?
Because look... this gray stuff here is cigarette ash.
And I don't think it's your husband's,
because, if he had a delicate heart as you say, I doubt very much that he smoked.
And if you don't smoke either...
I don't understand where it could have come from, this tobacco ash.
Maybe it's not cigarette ash, but a bit of dust.
You want to be a detective like Mr. Mouri when you grow up too, don't you?
Quiet.
Yeah, sort of.
It's a secret compartment.
Hm.
I'm sorry. I'm just...
It's just... I'm curious by nature.
You're curious about everything, I can see that.
You want to see what's in there?
Uh... Yes.
Well, I have no choice.
I smoked myself, in the car.
Why not? I couldn't smoke in front of my husband.
I couldn't smoke in front of my husband.
He didn't like tobacco.
When we got married, I hid my smoking from him.
He didn't even suspect it.
Oh, he did?
You told him you didn't smoke?
Did he cheat?
Happiness is based on lies and secrets, my boy.
Things you'll understand when you're older.
"Lies and secrets."
By the way... he sure has a nice, big house.
Does he?
Yes.
I'd like to see it.
Can you show it to me?
It's just... I haven't been back since the day of the robbery.
I'm afraid to go alone,
and since that day I live in a hotel room.
Don't worry, don't suffer.
If you go with me, you won't be alone.
(Kogoro) What are you saying?
That Conan has gone to Misaki Takizawa's house?
Yes.
She called a while ago saying that they were both going.
And now!
But what a bar he has!
Besides, Sonoko wrote me a message...
saying that Mr. Takizawa's family are very, very rich people.
And for generations.
It seems they have a lot of property, they're millionaires.
So what?
What's the matter?
Well, about a year ago, when Misaki married Mr. Takizawa,
who was 30 years older,
the world said he only married for the sake of money.
Nonsense!
This is what envious people say.
Misaki is a poor victim.
In case you don't remember, her husband was murdered a few days ago.
Yes, I know, but...
And may I ask since when...
Conan's brat has been so interested in women?
Oh.
How many butterflies there are!
My husband was very fond of nature.
He would have been very happy living in the country.
Ah.
Sure, that's why there are plants everywhere, even in the garage.
Eh?
Yes, and I don't like it.
I can't stand insects.
Excuse me, Conan.
I'll go upstairs and change.
You sit wherever you want.
I'll be right up.
"I think he said the studio was the second floor."
Oh.
Oh!
"Gee... It must be the other side."
"It must be here."
Eh?
Huh?
"Oh. A glass. This means..."
This isn't right, Conan.
You don't have to go into places without permission.
He's got a point.
Excuse me.
I saw that there were a lot of records and I went in for a moment.
Mr. Takizawa was a big jazz fan.
Are you thirsty, Conan?
Would you like something to drink?
There's only orange juice left.
Loud jazz helped her overcome stress.
Of course it did.
Now I understand why this room is soundproof.
How do you know?
Well, I noticed that the door was very heavy and thick.
That's what you do to soundproof a space.
Of course it is.
But... it's strange, because he explained...
that you were awakened by the noise of the glass coffee table, right?
Yes, that's right.
How could he have felt it,
if it's a soundproof place and the door was closed?
I doubt it very much, to tell you the truth.
No, you don't.

It was open.
When he was killed, Mr. Takizawa was listening to a record.
So I'm sure the door was closed.
How do you know he was listening to a record?
Because..., as you can see, even though there's the needle on.
Since she has the records, she treasured them.
I doubt very much that he would have left it like that, if he wasn't listening to it anymore.
You're right.
Well, maybe he opened it at Takeshi Yaginuma, the gate.
In Takeshi Yaginuma?
Yes, it seems to me that after stealing the jewels...
she tried to take my husband to my room.
Maybe he wanted to kill us both so we couldn't recognize each other.
But if you were sleeping, he said.
I'm not Takeshi Yaginuma, I can't know what was going through his mind.
And one last question.
You have, the orange juice.
When you came running over here,
after hearing the glass of the tablet was broken,
they'd already taken the jewels from the safe, hadn't they?
Well, take a good look at this.
Yes, they were gone.
The safe door is hidden by this one,
but it turns out...
there's a glass tablet in here.
Yeah, and what happens?
Well, so that there is a glass in there to stop,
I would say that the door should be towards the side of the safe.
But if it was there, it means that it covered it and could not be opened.
In other words, the safe was opened....
after the glass table was broken.
And, therefore, after Mr. Takizawa was killed.
If this is true, how did you, Takeshi Yaginuma, open it?
You opened it yourself.
It was like that, wasn't it?
Hahahaha!
Hahahaha!
I didn't expect this one!
What are you saying?
That I'm a liar, or what?
In fact, I've already heard you tell more than one lie.
Earlier you said that when you got here you saw the thief's face
before he fled over the balcony.
But this is impossible.
Impossible, no.
Because I saw his face.
No, because... from here,
the mercury lamps outside were too much backlighting.
You can't see it to me either, now, can you?
In fact, I've come to the conclusion that you didn't need to see the thief's face,
to see the thief's face.
Because I knew for a fact that it was Mr. Yaginuma.
I am convinced that they were accomplices.
Surely you yourself explained to him in detail
how you had to steal the jewelry and kill your husband.
And then you met him in the parking lot and killed him to blame him for the robbery.
to take the blame for the robbery and murder.
Conan, you are so cute...
I think I'll take you on a trip with me, far away.
I'd say I'll put my head in my suitcase and everything.
Hm...
(Mobile)
It was a joke, sorry.
Answer, I don't want anyone to worry about you.
(Kogoro) "Hey! May I know where you are?"
Yes, say?
(Kogoro) "What?"
At Mrs. Takizawa's house.
(Kogoro) "Still?
I hope you don't want to sleep over, you, now.
(Mrs. Takizawa) "No, man, you don't need to suffer, Mr. Mouri."
-We're a little late.
-Mrs. Takizawa...
but I'll personally see to it that Conan gets home safely.
Ah, no.
And now!
What hurts me is that he bothers you so much.
For me you can leave him on the street and let him come back alone, this little boy.
"Hahaha!"
He has.
Since when do you suspect it, that I killed him, Mr. Yaginuma?
Oh.
Since the beginning.
Because... I saw his hands
and I noticed that they were completely clean.
Yes.
Hands?
Because when someone falls from such a high place,
they try to grab on to anything they can, instinctively.
And the railings in parking lots, because of the smoke from the cars,
are usually very dirty.
If he had been drinking, he would surely have gotten his hands dirty.
But no, he had them very clean.
On the other hand, I did see that he had ash all over his chest.
Therefore, Mr. Yaginuma had smoked until just before he fell.
So the logical conclusion that we can reach....
"Is that when he approached him and sprayed him with the insecticide, he was smoking."
"And of course..."
Aaaah!
"One of these sprays, if sprayed too close,
can do a lot of damage to the eyes."
"Surely when you have instinctively covered them with both hands,

took the opportunity to push him against the railing."
A great deduction.
But of course, if everything had gone as you said,
it would mean that right now you're alone with a killer in front of you, wouldn't it?
Because it's just you and me here.
Eh?
Because she killed me, you mean?
Aren't you afraid, boy?
No, not at all, because, if I don't go home,
logically you'll be the first suspect.
Not necessarily.
I can say that I've left you in front of your house
and I'm convinced that everyone will believe me.
Well, I do.
I don't know.
Because... in everyone's eyes, I have no reason to kill you.
Oh, boy.
I see you don't mind telling more lies.
I've already told you,
happiness is built on lies and secrets, boy.
Well, I don't think so.
But... I must confess that I've cheated on her too.
Eh?
When I put the phone back in my pocket, just now,
I pressed the call back button.
(Kogoro) "Hey! Don't do anything foolish! I've already called the police."
"They know everything."
"The inspector and his officers will be home in no time at all."
"Hand it over and it won't hurt you."
I'm sorry, Mrs. Takizawa.
Let's see, may I know who you are?
Conan Edogawa, a detective.
("Futari no Byoshin", Takuto)

According to what he has confessed,
she and Takeshi Yaginuma had been friends for a long time,
and she would say that they had already planned the whole coup
long before she married Mr. Takizawa.
Really?
This time in Conan she has been the key piece in solving the case.
I'm sure he gave you instructions in Kudo as well.
He did?
Ah... sort of.
And now!
He would never have put Conan's life in danger.
Woman, it's no big deal...
But how did he come up with this?
Yes, exactly.
What would he have done, that one, if anything had happened to the boy?
Don't worry, he's all right now.
Well, I...
And luckily nothing happened to him.
If they had let me go from the beginning...
Hehe!
Father!
Don't imagine strange things with Mrs. Takizawa!
What's that?
What are you talking about?
I haven't imagined anything!
And so much, you have imagined things!
You imagined what would have happened if you had stayed alone with her.
It's not true, I didn't think anything.
What are you saying?
I didn't...
If I had gone, I wouldn't...
If you what?
What?
Come on, inspector, what do you think if we're going to have a drink to celebrate...?
Don't get distracted, we're talking!
Don't get me in the middle here.
(Kogoro) I don't get distracted, and we don't have to talk about anything!
Why don't you go fight at your house?!
Haha!
Haha!
Conan, what do you say we have noodles for dinner?
I'm fine with that.
Could you cancel the reservation
we had for this evening at that French restaurant?
"Would you rather eat noodles than a plate of French cuisine?"
Hey you, hey!
What are you doing?
(Girl) You make a very loud noise.
As if you were performing some kind of ritual!
How scary!
Eh... A ritual?

'Noodles so good they kill two (part one)'."
