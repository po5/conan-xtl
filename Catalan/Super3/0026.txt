"My name is Conan Edogawa."
"I used to be Shinichi, a young detective,
until they made me drink a potion that made me shrink."
"Today's case involves a dog, John."
"There is always a truth!"
(Tune from "Mune ga doki doki")
DETECTIVE CONAN
John and the murder case
(Ayumi) -John!
(Genta) Hey, John!
(Mitsuhiko) John!
John! (Ayumi)
(Ayumi) Come, John!
It's coming!
-It's beautiful, John! -How old must he be?
When I was 9 years old, he was a puppy,
he'll be about 8 years old.
What s'empatolla, Conan?
Hey!
Hey!
Don't mind me, guys.
(Think) "Gee, it slipped out..."
"John, now I'm not Shinichi Kudo, nor do I go to high school..."
"Now I'm Conan Edogawa and I go to elementary school."
Ah, it's you!
Hello, good morning! We're back!
Good morning, guys.
It's good to see you.
Come in.
(All) Yes!
It's been a while since we had dinner out!
It was pretty good, this restaurant, wasn't it?
Here lives a dog named John.
I know it, this house.
When he was little, Shinichi stopped by many times.
He would save the bread from lunch to give to the dog.
Masayoshi Sakaguchi?
Well, well, it rings a bell, this name.
He told me he was a lawyer.
That's right.
Yes, now I remember, he's a famous lawyer
specializing in teenage cases.
Listen, father, I'm not entirely sure,
but wasn't it in this house, that a boy committed suicide?
(barking and screaming)
What was it, this?!
(barking and screaming) Hey!
What's happened?!
What happened?! The dog!
What happened to John?!
It attacked Takeshi and...
Conan!
You're in the way, here.
Wait in the other room!
John!
It's me!
(laughs)
You tickle me, John!
(phone) Listen!
Takeshi!
What's the matter with you?
Can you feel me?!
Mr. Sakaguchi, it's me, Conan! What's up?
At Conan?
Mr. Sakaguchi, where are you?
I'm in Izu, working.
I heard that Takeshi called.
What happened?
You should come.
In John has done something terrible.
What?!
The deceased is at Takeshi Maebara, 20 years old.
He lives next door.
Mr. Sakagushi had asked him to watch the house.
Yes.
Miss Sanae Sugita, you were invited to Takeshi, weren't you?
Well, could you explain exactly what happened here?
Yes... yes.
"This evening I arrived around 8 o'clock."
-What a big room! -Are you glad you came?
It's fantastic! (telephone)
(phone) Oh!
Oysters!
(phone)
What are you doing?!
Now I was just starting to set the mood!
Yes, say, what do you want?
Ah, Mr. Sakaguchi!
Yes, no problem.
What?
In John, you say?
He's all quiet at the top of the stairs.
You want John to get on the phone?
All right, I'll call him back.
John!
Hey, John!
You don't pay any attention to me...
(Dong-dong...)
John, your master wants to talk to you.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
And then we came in.
What the fuck did she catch, the dog?
I don't know, but I think he just attacked her.
John doesn't attack anyone, just like that!
Takeshi didn't do anything wrong!
Inspector, what's going to happen to this dog?
I haven't made any decision yet,
but if it's true that it has attacked a person,
then we'll have to put it down.
What do you mean, what...?
What will have to be put down?!
But first we'll have to talk to Mr. Sakaguchi.
"A seventh grader commits suicide
because a classmate bullied him."
The classmate who bullied Masato is identified as "boy A".
(Think) "John is very well trained,
and he doesn't attack people for no reason."
"Wait a minute."
"John has attacked
after Takeshi put the earpiece in his ear."
"And if Mr. Sakaguchi had sent him on the phone to attack?"
"But... he would be able to do something like that, such a peaceful man?"
Inspector Megure, where is it, John?
He must not have been sacrificed.
Don't suffer, Conan.
It's locked up in the kennel, but we haven't made a decision yet.

Hey, Inspector, what did he say, Mr. Sakaguchi?
That he thought it was impossible that John had attacked someone.
I find it impossible too!
This must...
Will you stop talking, you little devil boy?
Inspector, please continue.
I asked him what conversation they had had on the phone, but...
Let's see, what did you say to the victim?
"Is everything all right at home?"
And, "How are you, John?"
Then, "You put the phone to his ear, John?"
And why?
Because I always say good night.
Li said "Good night"?
If I'm not mistaken, earlier I said... "John, are you okay? Are you okay, John?"
And then, I heard him barking and Takeshi called.
It was horrible.
He didn't say anything else, Mr. Sakaguchi?
No, I'm sure he didn't.
My assistant confirmed it.
Ran, didn't you say yesterday...? Eh?
...that Mr. Sakagushi's son had committed suicide?
Ah... yes...
Yes, it's sad but it's true.
A colleague was making his life impossible.
The victim, in Takeshi Maebara, must not have been this classmate, right?
So Kogoro, it was precisely him.
(Think) "So it was him!"
According to Mr. Sakaguchi's version,
his son Masato and Takeshi Maebara were high school classmates.
"At Masato he had written everything in his diary."
"He said that at Takeshi he martyred and that's why he hung himself."
"Mr. Sakaguchi, who read the diary,
said that at that time he hated in Takeshi."
"He had lost his wife and in Masato was his whole world."
"When in Takeshi apologized to the funeral, he forgave him."
But the only one he martyred was Masato?
It is seen that yes.
But at Takeshi he changed schools
because his father went to work in Kansai.
Two years ago, he came here again to go to college.
Now he lived next door.
That's a coincidence.
What a strange thing fate has in store.
"Mr. Sakaguchi was very upset to see him again."
"But he no longer had a grudge against Takeshi."
"Sometimes, he even invited him to eat at his house."
But what if that wasn't true, even if he had a grudge?
What do you mean, Kogoro?
What if Mr. Sakaguchi had trained in John,
and programmed her to attack with a specific word?
What if, yesterday, he had said that word in John's ear...?
John, are you all right?
Are you all right, John?
...and Mr. Sakaguchi would have taken revenge in this way?
He couldn't have.
What?
Why not, sir?
Don't you remember?
When we were interrogating Mr. Sakaguchi,
he repeated what he had said in front of John.
But the dog didn't react, hearing those words.
Oh!
Wow!
Just when I thought I had it...
Come on, Kogoro, you don't have to look so pitiful.
Masato...
Eh? (Ringing)
Conan, I'm glad you came.
I thought you might be alone, without John.
Thank you very much.
Sir, is it John's habit to always sleep at the top of the stairs?
Oh, yes, always.
And why doesn't he sleep downstairs?
You see that door over there?
Yes.
That was my son's room.
In Masato, my son, he wanted very much in John.
But his mother, in heaven be, didn't want John to come in,
and John got into the habit of sleeping in front of the door.
It's been 8 years since my son died,
but John still waits for me to come out and say "good morning."
(He thinks) "The cordless phone is there?"
"This is a corded phone."
Excuse me, but wasn't there a cordless phone, there, yesterday?
Ah... yes, sometimes I change it for the one in the studio, it's more comfortable.
What's wrong, Conan? No, nothing...
(Think) "How strange..."
(Dong-dong...)
"If I'm not mistaken, it was also 9 o'clock in the night
and the clock also chimed..."
"Sure! I got it!"
"The key to how Mr. Sakaguchi sent John to attack!"
The phone is different?
There was a corded phone today.
He said he had the cordless phone, in the living room.
Why?
Well, I don't think it's of any importance.
No!
Yes, it does!

It suited him that it was wireless, whatever he caught on Takeshi.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
If it had been a normal phone,
it would have been impossible to carry it up the stairs.
That's why he had the cordless phone in the living room!
Just like that!
Although do you think Mr. Sakaguchi used it on John to murder?
With this phone detail, I'm sure!
But I don't know how he transmitted the order to attack!
Our clock doesn't strike the hours, does it?
The clock in Mr. Sakaguchi's living room strikes every hour.
The clock!
When John attacked Takeshi, it was 9 o'clock!
I got it!
In Kogoro Mouri is so cool that he solved the mystery all by himself!
What the hell are you going to do now, inspector?
Just a little experiment.
Please, when I give him a signal, tell him what you told him yesterday.
Eh?
Alright, alright...
(Dong-dong...)
Now, Mr. Sakaguchi!
Yes, yes, now.
John, are you okay?
Are you okay, John?
Call more, don't sit down!
John, are you all right?
Are you all right, John?
Wow!
That's a good one!
(thinks) "Was I wrong?"
Shit, this time I was sure he'd get it right.
See ? your suspicions were unfounded.
I can't believe he took revenge by using the dog.
At first, it seems the most logical thing to do...
but after doing some research,
we found out that it's been three months
Mr. Sakaguchi had been taking the dog somewhere on Sundays.
According to Mr. Sakaguchi,
he was simply taking it out to the field to run it.
Can't you see that during this time he has trained John?
I know, but we have no proof.
I'm sorry to have to tell you this...
but they've decided to put John down tomorrow night.
What?
What's the reason?
It's orders from above.
Mr. Sakaguchi agrees.
(Thinking) "Shinichi... where are you?"
"If you don't come back, they will put down John, the dog you loved so much."
"Shinichi, come back soon... please."
"You are the only one who can save John."
"Please come back!"
What?!
What are you saying?
This afternoon they will sacrifice John?
-They can't do it!
-Can't we do something?
I haven't stopped thinking about it, I couldn't even sleep, but....
(beeping)
(beeping) All right!
Next!
Go, in position!
Ready?
(Think) "Sure!"
Now I understand everything!
What happened to him?
-Go to know... -To know...
What is it, this time?
I thought we'll do that experiment again.
(Phone)
(Think) In position. (Riiiiiing)
Yes, say, Inspector.
(Dong-dong...)
(Think) "Ready..." (dong-dong)
All right, please say those words...
(Dong-dong) I can't!
I've lost!
What do you want to confess?
That you trained the dog to attack on Takeshi Maebara?
That poor wretch couldn't remember anything.
Eh?!
He didn't even remember me, nor Masato.
He had forgotten the person he had forced to commit suicide.
That's why he went to live together.
I am a lawyer specializing in teenage cases.
I have always worked to help lost kids
to rebuild their lives.
8 years ago, when I saw him apologizing at the funeral,
I decided to forgive him.
He was just a young boy.
If he regretted what he had done,
Masato's death wouldn't have been useless despite his loss.
But that boy...
to meet me again and not remember the incident!
In fact, he hadn't changed at all!
He was the same!
-Torna'm that!
It's my wallet! -I'll give it back to you!
Don't suffer, man...
when I feel like it, I'll give it back to you!
But I have no idea when that will be.
"When I saw that, my stomach turned."
If everything was still the same, why had I died, in Masato?
Why did I forgive that evil beast?!
And he used his dog.
That's right!
If the law did not punish him, I had to take care of it personally.
In John is happy to see that I have avenged the death!
What a terrible thing to say!
You were not the only one who was sad, when he died!
How sad you were, John!
Although now he sits at the door waiting for you to come out in Masato.

I would not have imagined that he would use it for murder.
Masato would not be happy at all!
I understand that he can't easily forget that his son was killed
because of a boy that he martyred
and I take responsibility for his feelings,
but I doubt he stopped to think about John's feelings.
She has used him for murder without him being aware of it.
John's feelings...
Come on, you can come out now, John.
Oh, John!
Mr. Sakaguchi, John still trusts you completely.
Please try to understand his feelings.
John... forgive me, please!
John!
John! John!
John!
(Tune from "Step by Step")
DETECTIVE CONAN
So, they didn't have to sacrifice John!
No, they have decided that a friend of Mr. Sakaguchi's will take care of him.
How fortunate!
Everything has been solved thanks to the brilliant detective Kogoro Mouri.
But now John will no longer live in that house.
What a pity... so much we liked to play with him.
You will soon make friends with another dog.
Look at that dog over there!
He looks just like John!
Yes, he does!
Come on, boys!
Come on, let's go!
Miss, let me tell you, but you have a very nice dog.
You should know that I like dogs very much, too.
Shall we go to the cafe to talk about our dogs?
No, thank you...
Come on, let's go!
Just a little while.
A little while, a little while!
-Look how he's running!
-Stay still!
(thinks) "What a shame!"
Have you bathed together, just the two of you?
Yes and so much;
What do you think, father?
It was very good!
We rubbed each other's backs and...
Wow, is there blood coming out of your nose?
Have you been too much in the bathtub?
(thinks) "Your father will kill me, when he finds out who I am!"
Suicide is putting a gun to your head and squeezing... Eh?
In the next episode...
Kogoro's class reunion murder case
