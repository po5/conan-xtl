(Agasa) Oh... The cherry trees are all in bloom.
It's great to come to the temple every year to see them, isn't it?
Of course, of course.
Besides, the weather is very nice.
It's a perfect day, you can't ask for more.
And I've already got my stomach ready to make a nice meal.
Oh... Genta, always the same.
Ha-ha-ha!
We already know that in Genta you have your priorities.
Listen, doctor, if you don't mind, while we go to consult the oracle,
can you grab us some room and spread out the tablecloth for us?
-Perfect.
Let's go, then!
-Of course, you can count on it.
-Conan, come on, let's go.
-Thank you very much.
Yes.
(Shinichi voice) Eh?
What's wrong with you?
You look like you're looking for someone.
I'm looking for someone?
No, and now!

"The memories of Jodie
and the optical illusion of the cherry blossoms".
(Think) "Gee! And just today."
-Mi says "moderate good luck."
-Mi says "I'll be very lucky.
Mi says "a little future luck".
Better than nothing.
Come on, come on, let's go tie up the fortune papers.
-Where are you guys going?
-Come on.
I see you have some good luck papers, take them home.
According to tradition, and as it has always been done,
the slips of paper must be tied to leave the bad luck behind
and have a lucky day.
I don't know why, the custom of tying all the slips of paper has spread,
the good ones as well as the bad ones, but it is not like that.
In other words, the only thing that has to tie the slip of paper is you, Conan.
"Wow, this one has seen it for me."
(Conan voice) And you, Ay?
What did you get, you?
Actually, no.
Do you really want to know?
If you're so eager, I'll show it to you, I don't mind.
(Conan voice) Oh!
Super good luck!
-You're very lucky.
-Wow, that's nice. -Oh!
Why don't you exchange it for me?
I understand that bad luck hardly ever comes out,
so deep down it's good luck.
If you look at it that way, it's not so terrible, pretty.
Hello, Jodie.
What a surprise!
Miss Jodie!
Hello!
Have you come to see the flowers too?
Oh, "yes".
I love cherry blossoms, you know?
-Mm?
-Now I get it.
You were looking for someone, yes.
You're meeting Jodie here to talk in secret.
It's very common for spies to hang out in parks and temples,
they're places they use to exchange information.
Come on, guys, let's go somewhere else.
This couple wants to talk in private,
who knows what they have to say.
But keep in mind
that the security agents keep a close eye on them, these places.
So you'd better be careful.
Okay, so...
So what?
What is it you wanted to tell me?
If I'm not mistaken,
you said you saw Mr. Akai with a burn on his face, right?
Yes... I noticed it during the bank robbery case.
Shuichi.
Shuichi, wait a minute.
Shuichi!
Oh.
"Sorry."
"Shuichi..."
Shuichi...
Shuichi, it's you, isn't it?
Isn't it you?
Tell me it's you.
"The scar from a burn..."
That man...
That man wasn't Mr. Akai.
The man you saw was one of the members of the Men in Black,
in Bourbon, in disguise.
Eh?
He was doing it to check whether Mr. Akai was really dead or not.
He approached people who knew him disguised as Mr. Akai.
If it turns out that the FBI was faking his death...

they could find out from people's reactions.
"Even though during the incident at the Bell Tree Express
it appears that it was Vermouth who disguised himself as Mr. Akai"
instead of Bourbon.
To the Bell Tree Express, you say?
So, the train explosion was also his doing?
Yes, it seems so.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
If, as you say, that was a member of the Men in Black in disguise,
that means that in Shuichi...
"That in Shuichi is..."
Well, the next time that man with the burn shows up,
I'll rip off his disguise and find out his identity.
What?
I already know, his identity.
I know where you can find him.
And I know where you can find him.
This is him.
He goes by Toru Amuro.
He works part-time at the Poirot cafe,
which is right below the Mouri Detective Agency.
Well... I don't know.
P... Why?
That's exactly why I asked you here,
because I'd like the FBI to investigate...
why the Amuro is still working at the Poirot cafe,
if he's already achieved his goal.
Ah... Yes, it's...
His target?
(Man) Eh?
Excuse me..., sorry to bother you,
but aren't you the foreign woman
who was held hostage with me during the bank robbery?
I was behind you, diagonally,
for the entire duration of the robbery.
My wife was the one
who taped her eyes and mouth with duct tape,
the robbers made her do it.
Do you remember me?
Yes... Yes, now that you mention it...
That man next to you,
who had a burn scar on his face, was he your partner?
No, he was not my partner.
Why do you ask me that?
Calm down... Relax, I didn't mean to offend you.
It's just that I saw him a couple or three days ago.
Answer me.
Listen.
Where did you say you saw him?
- (woman) Thief!
-(woman) Huh?
-There's a pickpocket!
- (people: frightened)
Ay, ay how bad!
-Has it been done wrong, madam?
-Excuse me, is it wrong?
I... I'm fine.
I haven't done anything.
It's just that someone put his hand in my bag and I got nervous.
It's true,
places where a lot of people accumulate, there are usually pickpockets.
Yes.
Ah!
Yes, and so much, it's... it's true.
You have to be very careful.
In crowds of people there is always someone who takes advantage.
Well, then, goodbye.
I'll see you later.
No, Genta, what are you doing?
This water is not for drinking.
You can't drink it?
No, it's just for rinsing it out and then spitting it on the floor.
What then?
Do you know where you saw it?
Or don't you remember yet?
Uh... No.
Yesterday I spent the day in bed with a cold and the truth is...
He's got a bad cold and his voice is very hoarse.
Yeah, maybe you should gargle with the temple water.
What's that?
No, I'd better not.
I don't want to give anyone else a cold.
I've already washed my hands a while ago.
I heard something.
And couldn't it be that you found it
in front of a coffee machine somewhere?
Da-ante a coffee machine?
Does he like it?
Yes.
He drank a lot of coffee, all the time.
Even that day
those men were about to attack the hospital.
-Eh?
-Shuichi...
Doesn't this man's face look familiar to you?
He's the agent that headquarters sent us for backup.
Yes.
I don't have much of a memory, but...
I never forget the faces of my enemies.
Well, it's only natural that you remember this man.
He's an FBI agent, like you.
Yes.
But this dog face doesn't give me a good vibe.
"Shuichi..."
He-must have been tired, poor guy, if he dropped the coffee can.
-Ah.
No, no, nothing.
-And what was he saying, about a seizure in the hospital?
That man and the man with the scar are two different people.
It doesn't matter.
If you remember anything else, call me, okay?
Of course I will.
"How strange!"
"To the Bell Tree Express... in Bourbon said
that he was convinced that Mr. Akai was dead."
"Why would he have to impersonate him again?"
"Exactly. For what reason?"
No, Genta, watch out, man.
You're not doing it right, you mustn't play so loud.
Father told me that I should ring with all my might.
-Eh?
- (woman) That's right.
Your father is right.
This rattle has the mission to announce to the gods

that you have come to the temple.
If you don't touch it with all your might, they won't know you're here.
-Come on, then, touch it hard.
-I didn't know that.
What's that?
Listen...
The man you were talking about a while ago, who is Akai, who is he?
Well, because...
(Shinichi voice) Why?
I have a feeling that he looks a lot like a person I know.
What the...!?
You mean you can't imagine it?
(Man) Death?
Besides, Mr. Akai is already...
-(Man) Yes.
-(Man) Really?
There's a lot of commotion behind the toilets, everyone's gone.
(Man) -Okay.
-Let's go see what happened.
(Mobile)
Hello, doctor.
What's the matter?
I have bad news, Shinichi.
There's been a murder.
I feel like I just witnessed a crime, see what I mean.
What do you mean?
You say you just witnessed a crime?
"Come as quickly as you can."
"There are already many onlookers watching. Hurry up."
"I'm sure you'll find the place right away."
"I'm sure he's there."
(Shinichi voice) Hey, doctor, did you get a glimpse of the killer?
"I only saw the silhouette of him."
"He stabbed the victim several times
with a kind of cane about 30 centimeters long."
"A stick of about 30 centimeters? He was beaten to death?"
Hey.
Get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way.
"This woman..."
-It can't be!
-No way!
The victim is the woman who bumped into Jodie a while ago.
But why?
She wasn't killed long ago, it's very recent.
5-yen coins painted with black marker...
Could it be... in Kurobe?
A famous pickpocket.
In Kurobe?
They call him that because when he dresses you
he puts 3 black 5-yen coins in your pocket or in your purse.
And why does he do this?
They say it is a play on words.
"Go", for the 5 yen, "kuro" would be for the black color.....
and "san" for the 3 coins.
Go-kuro-san, means "thank you".
That is to say, it is as if he is thanking the victim...
to earn the money he stole from him.
-Hello, doctor.
- (Agasa) Look, officer, look, it's here.
(Agasa) Eh?
What are you doing here?
Move away from the victim right now.
(Agasa) Excuse me.
I'm an FBI agent.
My name's Jodie Starling.
Huh?
FBI?
Have them lock down the entrance and exit of the temple immediately.
-Yes, right away.
-And notify the inspectors.
You mean the murderer is the thief who calls himself Kurobe?
No.
The purse he's carrying is full of 5-yen coins.
And all the coins are painted black.
Therefore, the most likely hypothesis is that Kurobe was this woman.
And look also at this bundle of banknotes tied with a rubber band
she was carrying in her bag...
Look closely.
Inside is a GPS transmitter.
A transmitter?
With a cell phone you can locate the signal
with a maximum error of 5 meters.
And, if the transmitter was inside the wad of bills...
that the pickpocket had stolen, this would mean that...
Exactly, it is most likely that the victim of the theft...
is the person who killed her, the murderer.
(Takagi) Look, you must understand,
we give the orders here.
You're an FBI agent.
(Takagi) Yeah, okay.
But we are in Japan, right?
And besides, you're on vacation, right?
If you start giving orders to everyone, you'll make us look ridiculous.
-I'm sorry.
-And that's not right, is it?
It's habit, I couldn't help it.
This place is pretty far away
from both the entrance and exit of the temple.
And it hasn't been long since that woman was killed.
I have had the entrance and exit of the temple closed,
I'm sure the murderer is still here.
Mm-hm.
Oi, Conan?
What do you say?
Yeah... Well...
The truth is that you have acted correctly and this has helped us...
Is it true, what you say?
That this woman who has been beaten to death... was in Kurobe,
the pickpocket that the third division had been trying to catch for years?
I think we can be pretty sure.
When I opened the purse she was carrying on her back
I found a large number of 5-yen coins painted black.
They say that in Kurobe he always leaves 3 black 5-yen coins in the pocket of his victims.
in the pocket of his victims.
Doctor Agasa, is it true that you saw how the murderer killed the victim?

Can you explain it in detail, please?
Yes.
I went to the bathroom and when I came out I could see
how the murderer beat the victim to death.
As this place is in the shade and it's dark,
at first I thought he was hammering something.
And did you see his face?
No, I only saw the silhouette.
What I did see was that he was wearing a hat or a cap,
and that he was holding a kind of cane that must have been about 30 centimeters long.
Okay, so we know what the murder weapon was.
Any other characteristics of the murderer?
Let's see, let's see...
Come to think of it,
when he was leaving I noticed that he was a little lame in his left leg.
And I even asked him if he had hurt himself.
And what did he do, then?
The murderer had a limp?
He pretended not to feel me and left.
When I realized that he wasn't hammering, but that a person had died,
but that a person had died, he had already disappeared.
Understood.
Thank you.
Inspector, if the killer wanted to leave the scene of the crime...
as soon as possible and he was a little lame...
It could be faked.
It doesn't help us narrow down the list of suspects.
We have few leads.
And so, to find out who the murderer is among all the people...
who came to the temple to see the cherry blossoms...
It's going to be practically impossible, isn't it?
I think you can narrow it down.
In that woman's bag was something a little strange.
Mm?
A strange thing?
A GPS transmitter wrapped in a wad of cash.
Co-how did she have something like that?
Since no one knew who the pickpocket Kurobe was,
it was impossible to identify him
until the victim received
the famous 3 5-yen coins painted black.
So the murderer had "the" Kurobe, in this case,
stole his wallet,
and thanks to the GPS transmitter has located.
Then he waited for her to be in a slightly secluded place and beat her to death.
In other words, the Kurobe's victim is the murderer?
You mean this?
That's right.
But pickpockets often work in groups.
Couldn't it be that the Kurobe
had a fight with one of her colleagues?
I think Kurobe was working alone.
That's true.
She herself called "thief!"
before colliding with Jodie.
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?
It's a trick a lot of pickpockets use.
When they sense there's a pickpocket,
most people check to see if they still have the wallet.
With this system, pickpockets can see where they keep it.
If the Kurobe had had an accomplice, she would have had him do this task for her.
would have made him do this task, don't you think?
That's why I think he has taken your wallet too.
Eh?
Oh!
I can't find it.
I don't have it, it's true.
She probably took the opportunity to steal it from you
when you helped her up.
Oh, my goodness...
And now that the pickpocket is dead,
you'll tell me how we'll manage to find the victims she's stolen from.
Don't suffer, it seems to me that soon...
(Transmitter: acoustic signal)
(Mitsuhiko) "Hey, Conan, I found one."
Inside the wastebasket
(Transmitter: acoustic signal) "Hey, Conan, I've found one.
(Genta) "I found one too."
In the wastebasket near where I drank the rinse water.
(Ayumi) "I have one too."
It is to the wastebasket there where the rattle is being rattled.
The temple owner is taking it out right now.
My was inside the wastebasket
near the sink where the victim was found.
They were about to empty it,
but I asked them to let me watch for a moment.
Okay, take the wallets and purses...
and try not to touch them with your fingers.
- (Ai) "Okay."
- (Genta) "Okay!"
Of course, the wallets!
The pickpockets take the money
and they throw the wallets to the wastebaskets;
so, if we look inside the wallets...
Good thinking.
By looking at them we will know the identity of the owners.
Exactly.
These 4 wallets are all the ones you found in the garbage cans?
Yes, the workers said...
that they always start emptying the garbage cans
because of the one I was removing.
That blue wallet... is mine.
So, you are also one of the suspects.
-What nonsense!
No, you're not.
-What?

He's been with us the whole time since he ran into that lady.
It's true, he hasn't had time to kill anyone.
Well, in this case...
Ahem... The thing is clear, isn't it?
Most likely the murderer
is the owner of one of the 3 remaining wallets, indeed.
Oh!
The owner of this wallet we can find him right away.
Inside is a driver's license.
Eh?
We saw this man a while ago.
Yeah, I'm sure we did.
That's what he came in to talk to Jodie.
He said he had a cold and was wearing a mask.
In-understanding, guys.
It seems to me that the only one with a driver's license in it is the black one.
Ah!
I know who it is.
You do?
A picture?
What's that?
This woman I know, me.
She's the one who taught us how to ring the bell really loud.
And with any luck she's still around.
Let's see what's in the last one, the red purse.
There's just a little piece of fortune paper that says "a little bit of luck".
I don't think we'll find him, the owner of this purse, will we, guys?
Huh?
I think it's from that older gentleman we saw.
He said we had to take the good luck slips home with us.
Yes.
Besides, I got a good look at him.
He was in front of us
when he took the money out of his purse to buy the little piece of paper
and I noticed that it was red.
Yes, it was red, I noticed it too.
He was shouting for attention, for an old man like him, isn't it?
Yes.
Remember what it looks like?
-Esperi'ns here.
-And so much.
We'll go look for him.
Hey, guys, watch out..., that person could be a murderer.
Inspector Takagi, take them, please.
We understand.
If any of the suspects are carrying any kind of 30-centimeter cane,
it won't be necessary to look any further.
I think we'll be able to identify him even if he's not carrying it.
Eh?
What do you mean by this, Conan?
The killer has left 3 black 5-yen coins at the crime scene,
near the victim's body, as if to say:
I pay you with the same coin.
5-yen coins are rare.
There are so few, it's not easy to have a few, right?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I understand.
The person who doesn't have the five black yen
that the Kurobe has put in his pocket must be the murderer.
Yes, that's right.
