"Mysterious adventure in the land of fire and water (Aso episode)"
(Shinichi Voice) "The members of the Junior Detective League.
"We have traveled all the way to Kumamoto with Ran and Kogoro
to go sightseeing."
"To Kumamoto there are many fountains and springs,
"And it is the Japanese city
with the cleanest groundwater."
"It's surprising that mineral water comes out of an ordinary tap."
How good!
"But Kumamoto is a city known mostly for..."
For beef steaks, sashimi and spicy lotus root.
They go perfectly with rice liquor, which you drink... in one gulp!
"No, I didn't mean the food."
Kumamoto noodle soup is healthier.
"He-he-he-he-he! The most important thing about Kumamoto is..."
(Conan voice) Eh?
(Ayumi) Look, Conan.
(Ayumi) Eh?
It's Mount Aso!
That's right, besides being a water city,
Kumamoto is known as the "land of fire".
(Matsuhiko) Before we go to see the crater
we should learn a few things about the volcano.
(Genta) What a stick!
(Genta) Ha-ha-ha!
He-he-he!
(Matsuhiko) Fantastic!
(Matsuhiko) It turns out that Genta is what's having the time of its life.
They call it "Mount Aso", but it's made up of five mountains:
Mount Taka, Mount Naka, Mount Neko,
Mount Eboshi and Mount Kishima.
All are formally known as the Five Mountains of Aso.
The volcanic crater we will visit next is.... Mount Naka, right?
Ah!
(Bummer)
Gee, I'm so sorry!
No, it's nothing.
What did you hurt yourself, kid?
By the way, don't call me "kid".
My name is Justin, Justin Takamori.
Nice to meet you.
How cute!
(Shinichi, think) "Justin?"
Oh, a lot of people say that to me!
But the truth is, you're even more so than me.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Eh?!"
Eh?
He smiles at her, winks at her....
He knows perfectly well that with this tactic
he can melt the heart of any woman.
Eh?
Looks like you have a rival.
However, you are in second place.
My mother, obviously!
Is that so?
And who is in first place?
-Mm?
-Just so!
How many times have I told you not to stay away from me?
Excuse me, mother, I'm sorry.
By the way, I want to show you something very cool.
You don't do anything, do you?
(All) Mm?
(All) Oh!
Very cool?
-Jeez, you got a lot of stamps, already. -Oh, wow.
-Oh, cool!
He-he-he-he!
-That's true.
Yes, but he's a very cocky boy.
He collects stamps, he's a kid.
(Conan voice) No, no, nothing.
You were saying nothing?
You really are a kid.
Caram, you have a very nice son, ma'am.
Ah, thank you.
Well, I haven't introduced myself yet.
I'm sorry. I'm a well-known detective, you know.
I'm a well-known detective, you know.
I'll give you a... card.
A... card... Eh?
Where did I put them?
Where are they?
Where are they?!
What do you say we get going, Justin?
-All right, mother.
-Go on, say goodbye to your friends. -Bye.
Good-bye!
Mm!
Mm... I've got it!
Here, my card.
Eh?
Eh ?!
Where is it?
But...
Okay, okay, okay!
Father, what are you doing?
We're leaving!
(Matsuhiko) How nice!
We're finally going to visit the crater.
Yes!
(All) Aaaah...!
I love it, it's beautiful!
It's breathtaking!

You can't always visit this crater, did you know that?
-Yes?
Why is that?
-We were very lucky.
Because Mount Naka is an active volcano.
From time to time it emits toxic gases and then you can't go there,
they don't allow visitors.
(Shinichi, thinking) "That's true."
"It was worth it to come all this way and be able to visit."
(Mitsuhiko) Look, guys, there's a lot of animals here!
He-he-he-he!
-Let's go!
Look, stuffed Kumamons!
Can I go see them for a moment?
If we buy souvenirs now, we'll drag them around all the time.
You're right.
Better do it at the end.
I'm going to look at the bones.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Now he says that to her, but then he won't remember."
Hey, look, look!
They're asking for food!
They're asking for food!
That's what I like!
-Of course, if you haven't stopped eating!
-Renoi, I'm fed up.
Oh! (Laughs)
Oysters.
A man just dropped off a Kumamon at the bank and took the bag.
Okay.
When it's in a more isolated place, we'll stop him right away.
- (mobile: female) "Okay."
-Wait for session.
- (mobile: male) "What?"
-There's a girl.
-Hey?
-Hey!
-Punyeta!
-That's yours, right?
Stop! Ayumi!
Ayumi!
Aaah!
You won't escape!
(Shinichi, thinks) "That little boy!"
He's very cute.
-(Shinichi, think!)
Ah!
-Get out of the way!
(woman) Mother!
- (woman) Justin!
(woman) Justin!
-Oysters.
Stop!
Hey, did you hurt yourself?
Oops!
Oops!
-Just, did you hurt yourself somewhere?
We meet again, eh?
I'm fine, I'm fine.
-Still lucky! -You're still lucky!
-This grass has made me a pillow. -Ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha!
(Man) Where's the Kumamon?
You don't understand!
Without that Kumamon my business is...
My company... is finished.
-No idea.
-What happened?
-Yes...
-That's it.
You see?
Cured.
What will I do now?
What am I going to do?
I have to recover at all costs.
Can you... explain to me what's going on?
-Yes, we could put it that way.
-You're in charge of that child?
Let me introduce myself.
Look, my business card.
"Kogoro Mouri"!
So, you're the great detective Kogoro Mouri!
It seems to me that we have inadvertently interfered with your investigation.
If you don't mind,
would you mind explaining to me exactly what happened?
It went like this.
A couple of days ago a thief broke into Kumamon Foods, my company,
my company.
-Kumamon?
Kumamon Foods?
My name is Monkichi Kumada,
Kumamon is a play on my name.
I've been called that since I was little.
Understood.
So you are the original Kumamon.
-What have you done, what took you so long?
-Mr. Kumada, I'm here. -Mr. Kumada, I'm here.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Excuse me, what are the police doing here?
I called them myself.
It doesn't matter.
Why don't you tell these gentlemen
what happened when the thief broke in?
Yes, of course.
When I arrived in the morning
I saw that someone had forced the office door.
I went in with the flow,
but I didn't see it too messy.
This calmed me down quite a bit, but then....
Discovered that my stuffed Kumamon was missing.
The Kumamon in Kumamon.
Yes, but I'm still gone.
Then I had a bad feeling,
I looked in the desk drawer
and saw that the memory stick
with confidential company information was missing.
There was information about a very innovative type of candy with a totally new flavor.
with a totally new flavor
that our company has developed.
But, unfortunately, we haven't patented it yet.
We are a small company, but we have developed many new products,
and patents help us to get ahead.
But if the data on the new product goes to a competing company, such as Higo Foods....
a competitor, such as Higo Foods, a giant in the industry,
we're already lost!
-So much for that.
-Has there been any more news about the thief?
The next day I received a call from him.
(Phone: mechanitzasa voice) "If you want to get the memory stick back, you will pay me ten million yen.
pay me ten million yen."
"If you go to the police, the deal will be off, okay?"
And today was the day they had to make the exchange, right?
Yes.
The thief told us that he was going to take the memory stick

with all the information about the new product inside the Kumamon,
and that he would exchange it for the bag with the ten million yen.
Why has such a complicated system been invented, the thief?
-Mr. Kumada, what shall we do now?
-He must have wanted to hurt me.
The thief made it very clear that if we tipped off the police.
the deal would be automatically voided.
I know, but the police assured me they would catch her!
I don't know why I trusted them, because so far nothing at all!
(Mobile)
"This is Koda. We have apprehended the man who fled and recovered the stuffed animal."
Okay.
Good job.
Mm?
You make a bad face... Even though your wound hurts?
Yes.
"Wound"?
A criminal stabbed Officer Koda and fled.
He just got out of the hospital yesterday.
"No, it's not that, I'm fine."
"It's just that inside the stuffed animal that man had...
we didn't find any memory device."
-It can't be, it's impossible!
-What are you saying, now?
And she didn't have it on her when she was searched?
"No, she didn't have it on her.
"She explained to us that she met a man in a bar
who asked her if she could exchange the teddy bear for the bag."
"He insists he knows nothing about the theft of a memory stick."
At least he knows what the thief looks like, right?
"Well, he says the man was wearing sunglasses and a mask,
and that he didn't get a good look at his face."
Dang!
It could be that the thief had planned from the beginning
to collect the ten million yen
and not to return the memory stick when the exchange was made.
Excuse me, officer...
When that man ran away, he ran into a child, didn't he?
That's right, a half-American, half-Japanese child.
Well, if I'm not mistaken,
that boy was also carrying a stuffed Kumamon.
What?
Maybe when they collided they exchanged the Kumanons
without realizing it, right?
-Yes.
-Is it true, this?
It is true that there was a mother who looked like a foreigner
with her little son.
Well, go out and look immediately.
But where do we start?
We have no idea who they are.
We met them today by chance.
It's at Justin's.
What is it?
No, I don't know.
So, do you know where they've gone?
But I did notice...
that Justin was carrying a stamp pad.
I guess he must have gone somewhere
where he could put another stamp.
That's a good lead, but there's a lot of touristy places around here...
where you can stamp the notebook.
Yes, I know that...
But when he showed us the notebook, we..,
we were at the Aso Volcano Museum.
I already had the stamp of the cable car of Aso
and the Aso cultivation fields.
So those two places can be eliminated from the list.
Understood.
Not counting... those two places, what's closer to here...
I think it's the Aso temple.
Yes, of course, of course.
You can put a seal there, right?
Wow, I'm surprised!
You have incredible observation skills and a great memory.
Are you serious?
Well, come on.
Take this nano with you and go to Aso Temple.
I'll go to the Kumamon Food factory with Mr. Kumada.
Maybe the thief will call you back sometime.
Very well.
How... can it be...
it ended up like this?
I have to do everything I can to find Justin!
It wasn't your fault, Ayumi.
I got him into this mess.
He's right, don't worry.
Besides, we have to uphold the reputation of the Junior Detective League!
I'll take full responsibility.
I take full responsibility, don't suffer.
-All right, then.
-To the temple of Aso there's a shortage of people!
(Man) A foreign mother with a half-Japanese boy?
Well, I've seen them.
-Yes, it must be about an hour ago.
-Really?
Are you sure?!
You've stamped your booklet.
-Yes.
-So... it was him for sure.
They didn't make any comment about where they were going next, by any chance?
If I'm not mistaken, he said something about a place where there's someone...
who gives you a big welcome while you're lying asleep.
A big welcome and he's lying asleep?
I heard that at the dairy farm

There is a very nice little piggy... who spends the whole day sleeping.
-It's over there!
-You could mean it.
Just a moment.
Let's take a look at the map.
If we follow Justin's itinerary so far,
he's visited the Aso Volcano Museum,
the kingdom of the adorable animals and the Temple of Aso.
He is heading north,
but the dairy farm is located to the south-west, isn't it?
That's right, looking at the map it's in the opposite direction.
Yes, and besides, it says here that the dairy farm...
is only open until four o'clock in the afternoon.
Can you tell me what time it is now?
What time is it now?
It's five minutes to 4:00.
Considering it's pretty far away,
even if they'd left an hour ago,
I don't think I could have made it before closing time.
Obviously if we go, they'll be closed by the time we get there.
If you go north there is El Patio Farm,
but there are no animals there to give you a big welcome.
The only tourist attractions to the north are the Kokuzo temple
are the Kokuzo temple
and the view from the top... of Mount Daikanbo.
(Shinichi, think) "Mount Daikanbo?"
"Sure!"
(Conan voice) He didn't say that someone was giving you a big reception,
but that he was going to see the great Buddha!
What is the great Buddha?
From the top you can see the profile of a Buddha lying down.
Although Justin's mother is not of Japanese origin,
I'm sure she knew the story.
It's a big Buddha lying asleep.... Of course!
From Mount Daikanbo... it looks like you see a big Buddha lying down.
Inspector, we know where the nano could be.
-Well...
-Mount Daikanbo.
That's what this naughty little boy said.
We can't know for sure.
If he says so, we can be pretty sure.
(Kogoro) Oh...
(Kogoro) It's true!
He looks like the Buddha lying asleep!
(All) Oh...!
Hey, we'd better hurry up and find out where Justin is.
(Woman) Aaaah!
Yes.
No!
It's Justin's, let it go!
-Let her be my mother!
- (woman) Oh!
-(woman) Ah!
(woman) -Turn-me!
(woman) -Oh!
-Stop!
-(woman) Hey!
-Let go of me!
What are you doing?!
-Ah!
- (wheels: squeaking)
-Inspector!
-Kajiyama!
Follow the car that just passed, hurry!
-Let's go, then.
-The thief has hijacked the nano.
He must intend to hide when he gets to Kumamoto.
(Mobile)
- "I'm Inoue, from Kumamon Foods."
-I'm at Kosugi, say.
"We just received a call from the thief."
Don't let them follow him anymore.
-What did he say?
He says if they don't stop, he'll kill the child.
- (mobile: end of call)
-Wow.
- "What? Why?"
-Kajiyama, we're stopping the chase.
They've received a call from the thief saying that if we follow him,
he will kill the nano.
(Kajiyama) "Okay."
On Justin... he just wanted to help me.
Poor thing!
Don't worry, I'm sure nothing will happen to him.
(Shinichi, thinks) "How strange!"
"How could he know, the thief, that at Justin was at Mont Daikanbo?"
"And how did he know that the memory stick
was hidden inside Justin's stuffed Kumamon?"
"We didn't realize the confusion
until after the arrest of the fleeing man."
"The only ones who knew about it were us," he said,
"The Kumamoto police officers.
"Inspector Kosugi and Constable Kajiyama,
plus Mr. Kumada and Mr. Inoue of Kumamon Foods."
"But when the thief has kidnapped in Justin,
Mr. Kumada and Mr. Inoue were at the factory."
"We were at the crime scene, and we all have alibis."
"Does that mean that...
there is an accomplice of the thief among us?"
"And what's more important: who must it be, the thief?"

Now it turns out that they have kidnapped a child?
What the hell are you doing, the police?!
-You shut up and come with me.
-Hey, where are we going now?
(I've found her!
There's an intruder!
He's doing it expressly to let us know where they're headed.
(Conan's voice) And so much.
It is very clever.
(Justin, thinks) "That boy sure is..."
(Conan voice) Don't miss the next episode:
"Mysterious adventure in the land of fire and water".
