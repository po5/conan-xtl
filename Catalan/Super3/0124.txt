DETECTIVE CONAN
The assassination of the mysterious sniper, part 1
You can imagine.
What a mess!
It has, Conan.
Thank you.
There were a lot of people in line,
but the one talking to the oyakata let me pass.
He is the president of a dyeing company.
Do you know him?
No, I don't know him, but look at the fingers.
Fingers?
If you spend all day making dyes,
it's not just your fingers, even your nails get dyed.
But it could be anyone else in the company.
How do you know it's the president? Look at the hands and compare them.
His right hand is brown, but not his left.
In other words, he often plays golf!
If he didn't play often, he wouldn't have such a brown hand.
Since an employee cannot play golf often, he must be predident.
Prize!
Careful, man!
Signi'm an autograph too, please!
I'm a big fan of yours, Mr. Kaze-kabuto-seki!
I am at Kaze-Iwata!
Excuse me, please...
Ooooh.
You scared the shit out of me.
Without that damn coattails
there's no way to tell one sumo practitioner from another!
Behave yourself!
Shame on you!
Please don't act like a thief!
Instead of paying for my services
you have foisted on me the invitations to this festota!
(Woman) You are Mr. Kogoro Mouri?
I am Miss Yukiko Tanaka.
Can you spare me some of your time, please?
YES!
You can have it!
You can have it all!
And I can marry you while I'm at it!
-Come on, segueixi'm.-And so much, until the end of the world!
What a face...
Wow, so you are the president?
Yes, we produce and commercialize aeronautical engines,
and also precision components for the computer industry.
-What can I do for you? -Tanaka?
Yes.
The president has received a threatening letter.
Threatening, you say?
"You are a human being who does not deserve to live!
I will kill you at any cost!"
We want you to stop the person responsible!
Hey, Conan, what do you see in that man?
The one on the left.
Although the man on the card looks like a manager,
he has such a servile attitude, I'd say he's powerful.
He must be the son of a very influential and rich family.
I don't see it that way.
He must be the secretary of some very influential politician, no?
Maybe he is...
By the way, look at that gentleman.
Who?
It's as if he were in a place that doesn't belong to him.
He's been doing the same thing for a while, watching people's movements.
Let's see, what does he do for a living?
-Has he done anything to bother anyone? -Of course not!
Why hasn't he been reported to the police?
The president hates the police.
Besides, the police wouldn't do anything until a serious incident happened.
Really excellent, you have left nothing to chance.
From what I can see, you are very well informed.
And not only about the police,
I've also been very well informed about you.
I have chosen you.
You chose me?
I judged you to be the most suitable person.
Wow!
You did?
I suppose you'll accept our offer.
Of course I will!
If you don't mind, I'll stay here with Mr. Ishimoto.
Yes.
The method of investigation is up to you.
(Thinking) I won't be separated from Yukiko either!
Hello, kid!
What, you want a souvenir photo?!
Ran, let's take a picture!
Hurry up!
Come on, let's go!
All right, ready?
One plus one...?
Two! Two!
I have done nothing to provoke the enmity of another!

But when you have a long life,
you don't know if someone you don't know has been harmed.
But I am not to blame!
Ah, right...
And now, we offer you the words of our guest of honor!
Master Masao Takada, speaker of the lower house of Parliament!
Go ahead, master, follow me.
Do you see him?
He was a politician's secretary.
It's true!
You are a genius!
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much!
Shining a spotlight on a person in the middle of the darkness is impressive!
It was prepared: either they have previously determined the place,
or they have connected the microphone on his chest to the spotlight.
And why doesn't he go directly on stage?
Well... He'll want to attract all the attention.
(Thinking) Mi-te.
Welcome, Mr. Ishimoto.
-Hello. -Hello.
What's happened?
Chairman?!
Ni... Ikura...
Master!
Master!
Master!
Conan!
Where are you going?
(Thinking) Shit, the guy's fast on the run.
Something abominable has happened to the master!
Call the party members!
Hello, this is Niikura!
Someone was threatening Mr. Ishimoto
and wanted to make an attempt on his life.
And I had accepted the case.
The bullet that was aimed at Mr. Ishimoto has deflected
and hit Deputy Takada.
Yes, as you say.
As there were many people in attendance, maybe we'll have some witnesses.
Takagi!
Have you gathered all the attendants?
Yes, they are in the next room.
Quiet!
You know you don't have to run around everywhere!
I was so nervous and I went to the washroom... Kogoro!
If you have to tell me about the case, shut up!
It's just that I've seen a suspicious man.
Suspicious?
That gentleman, at first, was leaning against that wall over there,
but when the shot rang out, it was up there.
Well, you mean?
From there, it would be easy to aim at his target!
What kind of man was he?
That's him.
He sure looks like a killer!
But what are you doing, Mouri?
Let's go, let's go!
Wait a minute.
We have a picture of the possible killer.
We do?
Yes!
It's him, I can't be wrong!
Conan, don't touch anything, eh?
Inspector Takagi, what's this?
Fragments of the clip-on microphone worn by Deputy Takada.
What's where the bullet hit? This is what it looks like...
Ouch, let's leave it here, Conan.
Excuse me, Inspector Takagi.
I'll take my eye off him and do the same.
Conan, come on!
Conan!
Now where are you going?!
In the toilet again.
I'll pee myself!
You can count.
Which toilet?
What fun!
(Think) "She looks scared of something.
"Who the hell is it, that one? Who is it, the long-haired man?
"It's not...
"Even though an attempt has been made on the president's life,
he met with a man on the sly.
A lot of explanation is needed here!"
I have already finished my statement.
If you'll allow me, I'll turn back.
Mr. Ishimoto, the wound is superficial,
but they tried to end your life!
Go to the police station hospital!
The police would complicate things!
We have to go to your personal doctor's hospital.
Besides, everyone is free to decide if he wants protection.
Well, you are also right...
But then, who will protect Mr. Ishimoto, Miss?
You, Mr. Mouri!
Please do it.
Okay, I'll protect him!
I'll stay with you tonight!
Well then, Chairman, let's go to the hospital.
Ah, Mouri, I wanted to talk to you about the man in this photo.
What did you take?
We looked for it in the registry book but we couldn't find it.
But as the nearest emergency exit was guarded,
we may be able to stop him soon!
Mr. Mouri, what the hell are you doing?
Don't leave me alone, I beg you!
Yes, yes, Mr. Ishimoto, I'll be right back!
Which one of the police hospitals will you go to?
They say they detest the police.
I'll stay with Yukiko and be her bodyguard.
Hey!
We're not responsible, you feel?
Go ahead, get in.
Come on!
This car is awesome!
Get in, Miss Yukiko, go ahead.
For safety's sake, it would be better if the chairman stayed between us.
Well... Yes, you're right...
Prous shenanigans and we go home.
Entesos.
Let's see... the subway was for there...
Conan!

(Thinking) "In the middle of the crowd,
shooting Mr. Ishimoto was extremely complicated.
"If it wasn't done by a professional it was impossible.
"What are they, these marks?
"Adhesive and fresh cracks?
"What's this doing here?
"Wait!
"Microphone fragments....
The lighting control room..."
A... this is amazing!
More than a hospital, it looks like a luxury hotel room!
You will spend the night in the room we just went through.
That is, there is only one way out.
If someone tries to get into it, they have to go through your room.
Indeed, you are amazing, Miss Yukiko!
You are very alert to security details.
It's only natural.
My company depends exclusively on the president.
If the president were to be assassinated, it would come to an end.
By the way, Miss Yukiko, where will you be spending the night?
I only see one bed.
I'm going home.
With you here, I don't need you.
Ah, of course...
What, Mr. Mouri?
Isn't it a nice room?
Do a good job!
Yes, I'll work hard...
President, how's it going, the care?
That gunman was an apprentice.
I only got a scratch.
I leave it in your hands about Deputy Takada!
I'll arrange everything without any negligence!
About Deputy Takada, you said?
He means the funeral and the financial compensation.
The deputy has died nowhere his... Now I was going to pay them a visit.
Ah, so he's on his way.
I've arranged to meet Mr. Niikura here for an hour.
-I'll keep him company for a while. -Serious?
Hurray!
Would you like something to drink?
All right, beer!
No, sorry, a cola.
About that, can I ask you something, miss?
Yes, so much, tell me.
You said you chose me with the computer,
but detectives, there are many others.
Why me?
What... what... What made you decide?
There are professionals with experience and talent as detectives.
There are plenty of them!
But if you're looking for someone human and attractive...
The conclusion is plain to see!
Should I have chosen someone else?
No!
Your decision is right, Miss Yukiko!
(Think) I'm glad to be alive!
Wow, this cola is really good!
Another glass!
(Phone)
Yes?
That's right.
Wait a moment.
Mr. Mouri, it's for you.
Ah, thank you.
This is the famous detective Kogoro Mouri, speak up!
What a load of crap... You call yourself a "famous detective"?
Ah!
Inspector Megure!
I was calling about the suspect who disappeared from the party.
We found him in the criminal register!
Really? Yes, he's an abject man!
Shiro Hiraoka, 35.
He manipulates company secrets
and uses it to extort money from them.
He is said to suck his victims to the limit.
She is called "Hiraoka, the sucking piranha".
If Hiraoka is on him, it means....
That Mr. Ishimoto, for some reason,
might be the victim of Hiraoka's extortion!
Mr. Ishimoto should refuse to give in!
In Hiraoka he must have been out of his mind
and wanted to make an attempt on Mr. Ishimoto.
(TV) "That the assassin named Snake is looking at you has been your undoing!
But, you still have a chance to save yourself!
Take this, you will have to win!"
You suddenly disappear, and now I find you watching TV down here!
Go to sleep!
Do you hear me, Conan?
I'll turn it off! Wait a second!
Sure, sure!
That's what it was about! What's wrong?
(Think) "The murderer has stopped us a bait
and we swallowed it!
"What a well-planned crime!
But to prove all this, I still lack evidence!"
(Phone)
-Mr.
Mouri!
The phone is ringing! - (riiiiing)
What an ass I am, I've fallen asleep!
Excuse me!
Hello?
Thank you for waiting.
I'm on Mouri!
We have problems, Mouri! Mr. Inspector?
What's happened?
We found Shiro Hiraoka's corpse!
As you say?!
Where the hell did you find him?
He fell down a flight of stairs in an abandoned house!
The blow to his head has caused a mortal wound!
Was it an accident or...?
We don't know yet!
Now we're going out there!

I will update you.
This is unit 25. Send reinforcements.
Good morning, sir.
Huh?
You're serious?
Yes?
You're serious?
You won't come back until Mr. Ishimoto is sure?
Yes.
Yes, yes, understood!
Did Kogoro call?
Yes!
They found the man they think is the murderer dead,
and who was in our photo, is a certain Hiraoka.
And this is not a murder?
Maybe it was an accident.
Since he fell down some stairs...
He slipped in the abandoned house where he was hiding.
(Thinking) "No, it's not an accident!
"If the hypothesis that I have built is correct, this is a murder!
"The murderer knew the secret and has wanted to shut him up!
"The events that began with the threats against Mr. Ishimoto
"The events that began with the threats to Mr. Ishimoto hint that there is an unfortunate truth behind it all.
"I will find him no matter what.
I will find the head of this tangling thread of truth!"

In fact, she has a boyfriend named Kenichi Shibata.
(Think) "I knew it!
That's good!
Now we'll talk straight for once!
The real murderer is you!
And the next chapter...
The murder of the mysterious sniper, part two...
The clue to the next Conan is... A remote control!
What's the title of the new mask? Eeeeh!
I've left it "K.O.".
