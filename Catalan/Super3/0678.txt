- (woman) Aaaah!
A murder!
- (thump)
How could this happen here?
Well, it's a bad business, Mr. Glover.
But I also have ways to defend myself.
I wouldn't be surprised if the magistrate of Nagasaki
would take advantage of this to stop the session.
By stopping, goodbye to our business and the Satsuma-Choshu alliance.
No, don't worry.
Refute all accusations that may fall on me.
I'm Ryoma Sakamoto for a reason!
(Shinichi's voice) "Summer memories are so vivid
that they impose on the passage of time and solve mysteries."
"A film of the Edo period in Nagasaki."
"Where is he, the missing screenwriter? The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult, and he's Detective Conan!"
Kimi no Namida ni Konno ni koi shiteru,

(Conan Voice) "The Nagasaki Mystery Theater.
(End of the Edo period)"
(Shinichi, think) "We had gone back in time? It seemed so good."
"But it wasn't like that."
(Both) Aaaah!
"As usual, the Ran hit the jackpot....
the business district lottery."
"And that's why we traveled to Nagasaki today."
(Bell: ring)
"The Glover's garden is the garden
"of the mansion of English merchant Thomas Blake Glover..,
who supported activists of the 'shishi' movement,
such as Ryoma Sakamoto, at the end of the Edo period."
"He has many visitors, in Nagasaki."
How strange.
What is he looking for, Ran?
What?
A heart of stone?
A stone heart, I'd say.
Yes, of all the paving stones in this garden,
there seem to be two that are shaped like hearts.
And there are many, many legends surrounding these stones.
It is said that if a couple finds them, they will get married.
Or that, if you touch them, your love will come true.
I found it!
How beautiful!
Where could it be, the other one?
Let's see if I can find it...
I'm so fond of stones.
What I want is to try the "chanpon" and the "saraudon".
(Woman) Aaaah!
A murder!
What-what was it, this?!
It has felt that they called "a murder"!
(Woman) Eh?
Let's run!
Get out of the way!
Everybody stay where you are!
You can leave the case in the hands of the famous detective Kogoro Mouri!
Eh?
How strange.
How's he dressed, this man?
-Eh?!
He's risen from the dead!
-Eh?
(man) Huh?
- (man) Cut!
-Can I know who you are?
He's done well, this man.
(Shinichi's voice) I've made it salty.
(Kogoro) It was just to be wrong.
(Shinichi, thinks) "They were filming a historical thriller.
"two-hour historical thriller for television,
set in Nagasaki at the end of the Edo period."
"At the Glover mansion, a murder takes place,
"And Ryoma Sakamoto, who was in hiding,
is commissioned to investigate it."
"The help of the Ine, a young doctor who studied western medicine
thanks to her knowledge of Dutch."
"Between the two of them they solve the case, and in Ryoma can clear his name."
What do you think, Ine?
They used a gun, to kill him?
I wouldn't have said something like that would happen in our country.
I'm sure this will complicate things a lot for us.
I have no doubt.
The cause of death is the gunshot wound.
Cut!
That's a good one!
Hey, hold on.
You mean she's fine?
Isn't it over the top, for a doctor to talk so excitedly about a medical issue?
She's done well.
It seems that she has only recently become a doctor and it is normal for her to get excited.
And you, Benichiyo, you have been splendid, as always.
That's true.
It was a great performance.
Did you like it?
Thank you very much.
In the next scene appears for the first time in Chubei Soneya,
the merchant friend, the victim of the murder.
-All right.

-Go ahead, Sazanami!
Get me out of here, Sakari!
Ah.
Don't suffer, Chojiro.
-I'm coming.
-Where are they, the accessories?
Don't worry, director, they're all here.
You mean it's not a bit flashy?
N-no.
And this look isn't too over the top, too?
Please, but it's from none other than "Madame Butterfly".
Gee, I can tell you're an opera enthusiast, Sakota.
But we're already going out with the film, Keisuke?
Can we start shooting without knowing how the story ends or who the culprit is?
or even who the culprit is?
(Conan voice) Eh?
Yeah, but we are sure that it will be a great masterpiece.
Because the author is Tatsumi.
This young girl who plays the doctor is very pretty, isn't she?
You mean Futaba Nanao?
She's a breakout actress who is expected to become famous soon.
What are you saying, now!
We can't let it go!
But you can't be airing it.
You have to convince them any way you can.
Sonoko told me that in Kyonosuke Sasahara is single
and he's always in demand
the handsome leading man roles in the movie world.
He seems to have a problem.
Mm.
Maybe the problem has to do with women.
What a disaster!
What do you say, now!
In Ta-Ta-Tatsumi he's stood us up!
-Huh?!
-What?!
I knew it was stuck, but this disappearing...
Just when we had met again, the friends we used to work together...
we used to work together.
And if we wait a little bit, let's see what happens?
No, impossible, we can't wait any longer!
Mm.
It can't be like that, eh?
Eh, wait!
I've got it.
-Mm?
-Do you know who that is?
So, it's you?
-Y-yes.
-Are you the Sleeping Kogoro?
I beg you, find the culprit of the movie murder...
with your famous Sleeping Kogoro deductive skills!
(Shinichi, think) "Oh, mother."
As you say?
"The screenwriter of this detective thriller, in Kosaku Tatsumi,
is a well-known writer who has won quite a few awards."
"The script, although it has historical characters,
is a work of fiction."
"And since its development has been delayed,
he started shooting the film with an unfinished script."
"Future plot twists, let alone the name of the culprit,
are known only to Tatsumi."
Mr. Mouri, if we fail to finish the film,
our production company will go down the drain!
If only you could tell us who is guilty of the murder,
then we'll be back on our feet one way or another.
- (Kogoro) Okay, I will help you.
- (both) Please, Mr. Mouri!
- (Kogoro) That's impossible!
- (horns)
From this incomplete script of the movie,
no matter how much we rack our brains,
there will be no way to deduce who the culprit is.
But you told them that you would solve the problem.
That there was no mystery that the Sleeping Kogoro could not solve.
Well, maybe I've exaggerated.
(Shinichi, thinks) "It's true, he's right, there aren't enough clues."
(Conan voice) What are these?
These are...?
What are they doing here, these cutouts?
But what is it, all this stuff here?
I got it!
They talk about a gang of art thieves.
The plot of the movie is based on real cases!
So, you mean the culprits are a gang of thieves?
It doesn't come out anywhere, in the part of the script that they do have.
Because you haven't introduced them into the plot yet!
I don't see it at all clearly.
(Shinichi, thinks) "If you wanted to introduce them,
I wouldn't have these clippings hidden here.
Yeah, okay, I'm leaving the hotel right now.
For God's sake!
You must fix it, please!
How did all this happen?
Ah..., I'm exhausted!
Well, in the end, it can't be said that we found many clues, right?
I've already told you!
I'm sure that the culprits are a gang of thieves!
-Eh?
-Good evening, Mr. Mouri.
-Eh?
Hello to all of you.
- (both) Eh?
Soc Andrew Hatta, I play Mr. Glover.
What?!
Without the makeup I still look more like the statue of Mr. Glover
of Mr. Glover in the mansion garden, don't I?
Ah, man...

(Shinichi, think) "Even though, if I remember correctly,
Mr. Glover, Mr. Sakamoto's friend, was about 30 years old."
(Conan voice) Eh?
The boy detective!
You were thinking that I am much older
than Mr. Glover of that historical moment, weren't you, that I'm not wrong?
Well, no.
You should know that Mr. Oki-san's production company
is going through a very delicate moment, financially.
And that is why,
thanks to the intercession of Mr. Oki and the director,
most of the actors in the film
have agreed to charge lower rates than usual.
Will you also charge less, Mr. Hatta?
Yes, I will.
We have known each other for many years.
The director told us that you were all former colleagues,
who hadn't seen each other for a long time.
That's true.
At Sakakibara, Oki, Benichiyo and I had worked together...
many times in different drama productions
when we were still strangers.
It's nice to meet again, isn't it?
And with Tatsumi too, of course.
What happened is that, to play the role of Mr. Glover,
they only had me.
And that's why they decided that I should be a middle-aged man
who was already married to the Tsuru character.
Surely this must not have pleased Tatsumi at all.
He always wants historical facts to be respected.
And do you think it could be because of that,
that he disappeared without finishing the script?
I have no idea.
(Conan voice) In Kogoro he asked me to ask them if they knew anything.
I'm sorry, kid, it doesn't ring a bell.
-Neither do I.
-And you, Keisuke?
But Tatsumi was investigating things
that later on could be that he could make the scripts come out.
Let's see, can you tell me what we're going to do?
Now it's just a matter of time!
(Girl) Hello, boy.
(Girl) Hello, boy.
You're the boy who came with Mr. Mouri, right?
(girl) Eh?
Father, the Futaba says he's from Nagasaki.
Mr. Mouri, I thought that,
since you've already filmed the scenes featuring my character,
I could come with you.
-Oh, well, I'd be very grateful!
-That way I could be your guide.
Visiting famous places with a beautiful actress as my guide...!
(Shinichi, thinks) "You could bite your tongue!"
Taking Tatsumi's photos and notes as a reference,
we visited the places he wanted to take to his movie.
Isn't this the gun that the Kid stole some time ago?
(Conan voice) Yes.
"The dawn of Japan is about to come!"
In Nagasaki, we call stars "flags".
Ah, this is the bridge of the glasses, right?
Eh?
Conan, can I borrow your?
Oh, how interesting!
Aaah!
Wait a minute, take it easy.
Come back me-las, Ran!
Come on!
Oh, gee.
Aaah!
I'm starving!
This is...
It can't be!
It's the Sleeping Kogoro!
This is the restaurant where they invented "chanpon".
I can't wait to try it!
Well, their "saraudon" is also very good.
This pendant of yours is very pretty.
(Kogoro) Lo-lo!
Ah, you mean that?
I bought it at a store near the Glover's garden.
(Kogoro) Ah!
It looks very nice!
It's so good!
I'm so hungry!
It's really good!
It's so good!
Of course it is!
What, do you like it, Conan?
It's delicious!
Is it?
But you don't eat?
Do you?
It's just that... I remembered that a few days ago...
Tatsumi didn't get hit by a car for a few days.
What?
What did you just say?
He said he thought he was hit by a push.
How come you didn't say that until now?
Did you really?
B-because, on reflection...,
it just came to me that maybe Tatsumi had gone missing
because he thought his life was in danger.
It's a pity,
we haven't found any clues that would bring us any kind of news.
What?
It's in Tatsumi!
Futaba!
Let's follow him!
A-ay!
Ah! (Shinichi, thinks)
(Shinichi, thinks) "He's run away from us."
"Why was he running away so desperately?"
Oh!
Oh...
(Mobile)
Yes, hello?
Hello, Mr. Oki.
What?!
That Tatsumi has sent you the continuation of the script by mail?!
And can you tell me if the name of the culprit comes out, if you have been able to look at it?

What?
So the end is still to come?
Watch out!
Eh?!
-Oh...! -Oh...!
No, it's nothing.
-It's done wrong, Mr. Mouri?
Yes, it's strange.
These tubes were very well caught.
Be more careful, when you tie them again.
Wow, you!
I was very impressed.
Aaa...
Was this karate, miss?
It may not look like it, but she won the Kanto tournament.
She's a real champion!
Ha-ha!
(Woman) Aaaah!
(Shinichi, thinks) "With the continuation of the script they've received,
the movie isn't over either."
"But what's new is that a second murder comes out."
"The crime scene is the house of the boss of the Dejima trading post."
"The victim is a spy hired by the Nagasaki magistrate, who,
before dying, writes on the ground the kanji character for the number 9."
Please can you explain to me what he told you?
If you want to know more details,
ask the daughter of the Miura's agency.
-Workshop!
She is good!
-The girl's name is O-Tei.
We are on schedule with the shooting schedule,
but with the new part of the script an unexpected problem has arisen.
Oh yeah?
What's that?
That a new character appears
that we didn't have any reference to in the first part.
Besides, this character has a lot of dialogues, and very mysterious.
It has to be an important character.
We don't have any actress who can play the role.
Nor time or money to have someone come from Tokyo.
God-hay-do, it's a very big problem, isn't it?
Yes, it's a problem.
Eh?
I recently turned 17.
Hey, how old are you?
Ah... What?
Yeah, that's right!
Yes, this is the solution!
(Shinichi, thinks) "No way."
You've got to be kidding me.
I can't do it!
They left this for us!
How do you want me to...?
I won't do it, no way!
(Conan's voice) You throw yourself!
Help me, Father!
Conan, please!
-That on the other side!
-Don't be afraid!
I'm so sorry.
Gee, amateurs!
No, I was wrong!
My goodness, you mean we'll get out?
This is not a school play, guys.
Take it easy, don't get overwhelmed.
You say your lines
and we'll take care of the rest, don't worry.
Ah, a-a-a-all right.
Hey, what do you think, then?
Shall we do a test?
For starters, you can read the dialogues in the script.
And... action!
Ah... wait a minute, wait!
Mr. Sakamoto, I'm O-Tei, the Miura's daughter.
In-in-in what can I serve?
Oh, my gosh!
These clothes are what western girls wear,
what they call "dress", right?
The Miura's daughter is known all over town
for her exotic attire.
By the way, that man at the trading post boss's house...
was able to write the number 9 in the ground before he died.
Do you have any idea what this means?
The 9?
Numbers are very important.
It's the numbers that will solve everything.
Won't they?
Y-yes.
Yes, Miss.
(Shinichi, thinks) "I've been beaten too!"
- (both) Oh...!
-Workshop!
It's good!
Rest!
What a strange intervention.
"The numbers will be the ones to solve everything".
What does that mean?
Come to think of it, it's true that there are many actors and actresses...
with numbers included in the characters of their names.
The Andrew Hatta, who plays Glover, has one, right?
So does Benichiyo Yamashita, who plays his wife.
You're right.
And the same with Futaba, whose last name is Nanao.
- (both) Eh?
-Well, there are also in the team.
For example, Mr. Oki, the producer, is called Taiz by name.
And Sakota is called Kazuomi, first name.
Yes?
Mr. Sakamoto, I don't know if you know.
In this river, the Nakashima River, lives a monster.
Are you serious?
But you don't need to worry about him.
His weak point is the second tooth of the lower jaw...
starting from the left.
Cut!
It's good!
(Shinichi, think) "The monster's weak point..."
"That's another mysterious phrase."
"Eh? What's this?"
"This sentence is written in a different font."

"There may be more?"
"These phrases could be a coded message from in Tatsumi?"
"If the O-Tei Miura is a created character...
"To convey this message....,
then here is the explanation for Tatsumi's disappearance."
"And therefore..."
"And that's the only thing I know.
This is the only thing I can tell you, and that is the only thing that..."
Now I'll take them to the first restaurant that made Western dishes.
(Sakota) I've had enough!
Count me out!
(Sakota) -Ah!
Aaaah!
- (thud)
It looks like she was assaulted with her hands, without any object.
-Where is it, the ambulance? -Where is it, the ambulance?
-Hold on, Sakota!
I have already warned them.
They'll be here soon!
Oh, my God!
Who did this to you?
Did I do it?
What do you mean?
-Ran?
-Ran?
What do you mean?
Wasn't she a karate champion?
(Shinichi, thinks) "It can't be."
But I... I didn't do anything.
-Sakota!
-Come on, Sakota!
Hold on, go!
Secret love.
Secret love.
Kimi ni ZENZA kyoumi nai, uso you are my perfect guy.

(Shinichi, think) "Why did he point out the Ran, in Sakota?"
"I can't explain it."
So, can you tell me where you are, right now?
I'm leaving the hotel, right now.
Suddenly, someone has jumped on me and hit me.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Sure, I got it!"
"The meaning of the message is..."
(Sleeping Kogoro voice) "I wanted to reveal to them who was the person
who attacked Sakota and Chojiro."
"It is none other than... Ran Mouri!"
(Conan Voice) "Don't miss the next episode:
"The Nagasaki Mystery Theater (The Present)."
