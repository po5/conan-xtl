The water that flows has no form.
The wind that blows cannot be seen.
In a quiet town a war has broken out.
And the town bus is out of control.
The truth comes out in the end.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

(Off) "La Ran, Kogoro and I decided to go on a trip
"To Kagekuwa, a mountain village."
"But along the way, a murder occurred."
"The victim was Deputy Mayor Okumura.
"None of those who did not want to use the bus to promote tourism."
"The arrest of Mr. Yabe-favoring the measure-
"It heated up the town."
"Besides, it was all related to an accident...
"that the bus had had seven years ago."
"During the investigation,
"They attacked Mayor Funaki - also pro-tourism -
"And the Ran was nearby!"
THE TENTH PASSENGER, (SECOND PART)
Ran!
Conan!
Are you all right?
Did he hurt you?
No, I'm fine, easy, easy.
It doesn't matter.
But that man over there is hurt.
Al... Mayor!
(Thinking) "Right through the heart, death was instantaneous."
Ran..., did you see the killer?
I don't know if it was, but I saw the man who bumped into me.
What did he look like?
Don't you remember anything?
Age, height...?
It was Mr. Yabe.
The head of the League......youth.
What? "It can't be...!"
What?!
The mayor died in Yabe?!
-We don't know that yet. Take me home!
I have orders.
I've spoken to the police station and we must wait for them to arrive.
Listen to me!
My daughter could have ended up like the mayor!
Take me to Yabe immediately!
No cork!
And so much... And so much.
Yabe!
Show your face!
Don't play with me!
Calm down, please!
Yabe!
Come out!
Casum everything!
He has fled!
The evening paper is still in the mailbox.
And if he has not returned home?
In this case, he will surely have called the mayor...
after she was released, to kill him!
And now he's running for his life.
She had it all figured out.
Mr. Mouri.
Let's go, let's go!
The exits must be cut!
Yes, sir!
(Think) "Eh? A bankbook!"
"For 2 years now, he's had 200,000 yen transferred every month."
"How come he uses a bank... with no branch in town?"
"You mean that money...?"
(Off) "With the new day begins the search for en Yabe in the surrounding area."
Well, detective, I'm told we already have a shot, no?
I don't like working with you,
but I can't have that bad piece on the street.
So we'll have to collaborate.
(Off) "The townspeople also want to collaborate."
"But the tension between the two groups is the limit."
"Is that what the killer intended?"
"Or did he have another objective?"
"What's more: the man we are looking for is in Yabe?"
"In case he had planned the murders," she said,
"He would have taken the notebook!"
"There are too many things that don't fit."
"The mistress's frightened face when she dropped the silver!"
"Why was she crying at the cenotaph?"
"And the Toko was watching her."
"I'm convinced it's all connected to the accident seven years ago!"
Shit, I can kiss the million yen goodbye!
You'll pay for it, Yabe, you bet I will!
Ah.
(Phone)
(Agasa) Tell me?
Hey, Shinichi!
You're involved in a big case, eh, my friend?
Yes.
I need you to check the newspapers 7 years ago!
Sure, I can check the website of any newspaper you want without any problem.
It's here!
Follow him!
Hold it!
You do not escape!
I want my money!
Let's see... 7 years ago, 7 years ago...

This!
Behold!
Bus accident in Kagekuwa!
2 dead and 8 slightly injured.
Very good!
Yes!
Does it say the names of the dead, Dr. Agasa?
Yes, it's a local newspaper: names and surnames.
First, slightly wounded.
You're under arrest!
Surrender!
It wasn't me!
I didn't do anything!
You ran away, this means you're guilty!
Takuro Yabe, you're under arrest for murder!
What the... What?
That the Okumura isn't on the list!?
Are you sure?
Well no, I don't see him anywhere, this name.
(Think) "Then they could have killed him because..."
Here's the name of the two dead, look: Yoichi Tezuka, 28 years old.
And Kohei Moritsugu, 55.
Doctor!
I need you to locate the family of these two people.
(Yabe) No!
You're mistaken!
I heard the mayor calling and I went over to see what was going on.
That's when you came to your daughter!
I knew that if I stayed there they would suspect me,
I tried to run away and we collided!
That's a lie!
So what were you doing, the shrine?
I was summoned by the mayor!
The mayor?
You?
Why would he want to see you in such a secluded place?
Well... It's just that...
You're not telling us anything, but you expect us to swallow your story.
Isn't that asking too much?
Explain that to me.
We found this notebook in your house.
You've had 200,000 yen transferred to you every month for 2 years!
And you have the money in a bank that's not from here...
And that means...
the people here must not know that this money exists, right?
I was passing on information.
-Information? -So, you're a spy for the opposition?
Yes, the deputy mayor who died on the bus...
he was the leader of the opposition,
and he paid me to... know the mayor's plans and his schedule.
What could be so important
for Mr. Okumura to have invested so much money?
Every time a new project is launched,
the municipality's funds go to companies that support the mayor.
Of course, those linked to the opposition are excluded.
That's why it was important to sabotage projects before they started.
That's when the mayor found out
and summoned you to the sanctuary?
Yes, sir.
While you questioned me the first time,
he broke into my house and found the notebook.
So, you killed the Okumura to avoid being discovered...
and, then, you had to peel in Funaki because you were found out!
That's not true!
You're wrong!
I didn't do it!
May I have a word with you, Mrs... Koma?
Yes.
What if these murders,
which seem to have been provoked by a struggle between ideologies,
are related to a bus accident 7 years ago?
The accident 7 years ago?
No way!
But if they were, Yabe would be innocent!
Because that day, 7 years ago,
he was on the bus that crashed!
And you... you... too!
Tell me what happened... on that bus!
That's it, go ahead!
Here's what really happened on that fateful day seven years ago.
(Thinking) "I knew it!"
"That's why Mayor Funaki was afraid that the truth would come out.
"And he paid so much money to keep it a secret!"
(Intercom: beep-beep)
Tell me?
I have located the relatives of those who died in the bus accident!
They were in a later article.
Yes, understood.
What did you say?
But it's...!
Okay, thank you!
What time does the bus leave, the bus that covers the schedule...
of when the accident happened?
It must have left by now.
Hell, no!
Madam, I'm counting on you!
You must catch the bus!
"I have to stop anyone else from getting killed! Come on, we have to get there in time!"
No way!
The brakes don't work!
-What's he saying, now!?
-Are you joking!?
Well, it's not funny!
We're going down!
What?
That he killed them in Yabe?
Yes, they're sending him to headquarters this afternoon for questioning.
So, your investigation...
Yes, it's over.
Not only did I lose the money, but I worked for nothing.
I've come out of it all right, this field trip!
I'm on it.
Come on, let's go!

By the way, where is it, in Conan?
I can see it!
It's there!
(Wheels: squeaking)
Kajita, do something!
The handbrake doesn't work!
They've cut the cable, and it doesn't work!
The brakes have already started to fail!
Quick, Mrs. Koma, put the car in parallel!
What?
What are you going to do?
I'll get on the bus!
Don't do it!
It's too dangerous!
No!
It's... It's what happened 7 years ago!
You're right, you're right.
Even we are the same.
It can't be.
It's a coincidence, isn't it?
No, it's no coincidence!
Conan!
How... did you get on?
Someone explained it all to me.
What happened when, that day, they were all on the same bus!
Even the mayor, who is already dead,
and Mr. Yabe, a murder suspect,
were traveling that day.
10 passengers!
You remember how it was, the accident, don't you?
Mrs. Koma, now the owner of the hostel....,
was the guide then.
(Man) Don't be narrow, woman!
(Man) -Drink a little with me!
(River) -Help-me!
-(Man) -Help me! -Don't be unfriendly, come on.
-Come on... come on, give me a little kiss! Somebody stop him!
Help me!
Stop it!
Leave her alone!
She wants nothing to do with you!
What did you say?
I'm just doing it for fun;
So shut up, you feel me!?
(Off) "The two people who died
"Were the man who was bothering Mrs. Koma...
"And the man who was trying to defend her."
"Miraculously, the other 8 passengers were unharmed."
But after the accident, everyone remained silent.
They preferred to attribute the accident to a drunken brawl.
By their silence they caused the death of a brave man
and wanted to hide the guilt in their hearts.
After all that has been said, they should have realized by now.
The two murders are the work of the same relative of that man.
One of Mr. Moritsugu's sons.
And the motive is revenge!
Isn't that right, Toko?
Natsume is his mother's maiden name.
Your name is Toko Moritsugu!
-The Toko is...? - Your daughter?
What do you mean?
What are you saying?
That right now the killer of those two is on the bus?!?
Can you tell me who it is?
I don't know, Mr. Hino!
But the bus has run out of brakes!
-Hey!
Notify headquarters, quick!
-Yes!
And the most serious thing is that the child is inside.
What?
That in Conan has gone up!?
To find out how his father had died,
Toko began to investigate until she found out the whole truth!
Mr. Kajita, who works with her and appreciates him, must have told her.
By the irony of life,
one of the men she wanted to take revenge on, Mr. Yabe,
was arrested because he belonged to the opposite group of the victim.
He waited for the moment
and knowing that you would be boarding the bus today,
he manipulated the braking system to kill you!
In the same place as that accident!
Am I very wrong, Toko?
No... it can't be!
And now, where did you get this?
Where did you get this from?
It's no use pretending.
How else can she be so calm?
She's ready to die, isn't she?
She'll die with the others!
Caram, boy, you're a pain in the ass!
Come down, Conan!
Check in when you cut the next curve,
with any luck you'll only get scratches!
Admit I'm right, then!
It's all down to you.
Yes!
I admit it!
I killed the lieutenant and Mayor Funaki because they deserved it!
"I took advantage of the commotion
"to put the poison in the Okumura's bottle!"
"And I hid in the shrine bushes for stabbing the mayor!"
Yes.
Yes, it was me!
I have come to take revenge on those who were on this bus!
My father was a man of honor, with an unquestionable reputation.
He only did the right thing: trying to help those who were in trouble.
But that day...
If only one of you had taken him aside...!
Hurry up!
You have to jump, Conan!
Hurry up!
It's too late.
No matter how much I jumped,
nothing would change the fact that he killed the wrong person!
Eh?
The deputy mayor, your first victim,
was not on the bus that day.
You have made a grave mistake!

What are you saying?
This is impossible!
As a guide of this bus,
you've seen her get on every day and you know that she always said...
Yes, sir, it's been 40 years since I've been here!
However, I am sure...
that she wanted to confirm her connection to the accident.
Did you ask him if he was?
Of course, I asked him personally!
7 years ago?
Of course, he was sitting right here!
As I always do, child!
Yes.
He told me himself!
But that day, he was cold and had a high fever,
he stayed in bed!
That's why his name doesn't appear in the newspapers!
Oh... Bullshit.
I read the papers myself.
I was so convinced that I didn't even take a good look at the listing.
So, who... was it, the tenth passenger?
Someone who died a couple of years ago of illness.
Mr. Okumura had nothing to do with his father's death!
He was totally innocent.
My God...
You forgave Mrs. Koma, didn't you?
Yes, I did...
Forgive me... Forgive me... (cries)
When I saw her suffer, I was unable to kill her.
But she is not the only one.
I think that everyone who was on the bus that day
carry a burden on their conscience and will carry it for the rest of their lives.
Forgive us, Toko!
We were cowards.
Accept our apologies!
(At the same time) Accept our apology!
(Cries)
Maybe if we were to fall off the cliff in the same place,
who knows if the Toko's father could forgive us and rest in peace.
No!
Conan has nothing to do with it!
Do something about it!
I can't do anything.
I can make the next turn, but the one with the accident is too tight.
Don't give up!
There must be a way to stop us!
In the ditch!
Wheels in the ditch!
It's no use!
I can't slow down!
Of course you can!
Professor Agasa's elastic straps.
No matter how much you pull them, they return to the original length!
Holy cow!
"Shit. I don't know if they'll hold a 10-ton bus!"
Oh.
Ooooh...
We've... stopped.
Conan, who are you?
A boy who likes to play detective!
Thank you. (chuckles)
You're my private detective.
You've had our hearts in our hands!
That's great!
(Thinking) "Chizuru... Who are you arguing with?"
"Gee, no!"
He's got this!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Eh ?!
Hell, no!
Sorry, your wife is long dead.
No one has entered this room!
"How can that be?"
And the next Conan: "The Dark Wings of Icarus (part one)."
