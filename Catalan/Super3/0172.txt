A message just before death, part one.
(Sonoko) Ooooh!
That's great!
So many kids!
Look, look!
There are so many good looking ones to give and sell!
This is amazing!
It's my dream come true!
Hey, Sonoko!
Sonoko!
What about in Kyogoku?
Eh?
Aaaah...
It's just that Makoto, rather than a charming prince charming
he looks like a stiff and proud samurai.
He hasn't called me since he left.
He doesn't care about anything, this guy.
If you say that, you'll be left without a boyfriend again.
In Kyogoku he has a lot of fans.
Will you stop putting me in the same bag as you?
I'm not like you,
who takes patience and waits for your man to come back.
Who said that, waiting for Shinichi?
Hey, hey, I didn't say anything about Shinichi.
Hey, pretty girl!
I'm sure that if you insisted that we come here to skate...
it's because you used to come here often and it brings back memories.
I don't have any good memories.
When we used to come here, I didn't know how to skate and he wouldn't stop laughing at me.
So, he taught you right, left, right.
You really want to fuck up today, Sonoko.
All I'm saying is that you should teach this boy how to skate today.
Ah, no, not for me there isn't.
Hey!?
What?
You know how to skate?
I do.
It's the first time we come here together.
You already know?
Ah... Ah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Wow.
You should never have come.
Today it's us who can laugh at him.
Stop it, Sonoko.
(Thinking) Sonoko Coi...
Aaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Move aside, move aside!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Move aside, guys!
Get out of the way!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Co... Conan!
What did you hurt yourself?
That you are well?
That's too bad!
Why don't you help me, Yasuhiro?
Why are you going so fast, if you haven't mastered the technique?
It's just that...
She'll soon run out of that, playing chard to attract men.
Chihiro, curious little princesses lose interest at the age of 30.
What a face you have!
Why do you always tell me that?
Because you make me black.
Come on, let it go.
It's been such a long time since we went skeet shooting...
Skeet shooting?
It's a fun sport.
What is it?
You fly a skeet and you have to hit it by shooting at it.
This afternoon we got the group together for a training session.
It's a lot of fun to do it as a group.
We haven't seen each other for six months, since the accident.
Six months ago there was an accident?
Yes, a terrible accident.
Do you want to know what happened?
It's scary.
Shut up!?
Are you stupid?
How can you even think of explaining it to a child?
Besides, I've made it clear.
If anyone talks about that guy, I'm leaving.
Ooh!
Wow!
What a handsome guy! He's a samurai through and through...
Hey, Oda!
Where are you going?
We're going to dinner later.
I'm going to smoke a cigarette and I'll be right back.
It's because of this blessed girl that I've remembered everything.
Just because I'm handsome doesn't mean I have to put on these airs!
Man, Chihiro, if you hadn't brought it up...
I didn't say anything out of the ordinary!
It wasn't to insult me!
It's his fault.
I really dislike him!
He's always sad, he's foul-mouthed and he's the most different of the group.
(Thinking) The most different?
It's been a long time since we started talking about it.
Why is he so different?
Eh?
You still don't know?
I don't believe it!
About it.
I don't know either...
Neither do I.
Why is it different?
Tell us about it.
You really don't know?
I don't believe it.

We don't tell you to tell us about it!
What a rage!
Well no, I won't tell you, Izumi!
Look where!
Since you're not curious little princesses, you'll never know.
Where are you going now?
I'm going to the bathroom!
If you still don't know when I get back, I'll give you a hint.
Ah... what a rage!
And you, curious little princess of the Suzuki financial group,
do you know why the Ode is different?
No.
Aren't there more and more people? Yes.
Maybe it's because of the fireworks.
Ah, the ones they do every day at 7 o'clock?
From the ice rink, you can see them at the back of the castle.
Wow, you really know it well.
That's why we're here too.
I'll pass, as usual.
I'm going for a coffee.
I've seen them so many times...
Hey, Mizawa!
You're not staying either?
I'm hungry.
I'll be back before they start.
Wait here.
What do you mean, wait for me?
I feel like going to the bathroom.
We're not going anywhere around here.
We'll save your place.
When your friends come back, we'll tell them to wait.
I'm sorry. I'll go as fast as I can.
I'll go as fast as I can.
Can I trust you?
SIII! YES!
Gee, it's only 5 minutes away.
What should you do?
If you don't hurry and get there right away, the fireworks will start.
Aren't they coming back yet?
No... Conan, Ran.
I'm going to the washroom, too.
Where are you going so late!
He'll set it up-Lala... I'm going to the bathroom...
Eh?
What's going on?
She's being cleaned.
Oooh... Gee, no...
Wait... Wait a minute, wait a minute!
How can you say that I was to blame for that accident?
Besides, even if you hide your face,
if you shoot me, everyone will feel the gunshot.
and when they come to see what happened, they'll catch you.
Ah... You won't...
(Sonoko) Listen!
How long will it take?
(Knock on the door)
Listen, how long will it take?
What do I do now?
If I have to go to another toilet, I'll have to take off my skates.
(Fireworks)
Oh, no!
The fireworks have already started!
What a rage!
Oh, how beautiful!
Wow, this beginning is spectacular, isn't it?
You finally came to see them!
Yes.
I thought it's been a long time since I've seen them.
Phew!
I made it!
I didn't think I'd make it in time.
Eeeh!
Where are you, Chihiro and your friend?
Eh?
You haven't met in the bathroom? No, we didn't see each other.
As the one here was being cleaned,
I took off my skates and went to another one.
By the way, the Sonoko is taking too long...
(Scream)
This scream was from...
(Think) Sonoko!
Hey, kid! Sonoko!
Sonoko!
What's the matter?
What happened?
Sonoko speaking!
A... there...
(Thinking) "Una sa !?
Una ese..."
Father! (Knocks on the door)
(knocks on the door) Father!
Wake up, Father!
Wake up!
What is it, Ran?
Didn't you turn on your voice when the fires were over?
What's the matter, now!
There's been a crime!
A crime!
They found a dead person in the bathroom on the side of the track.
Let's see...
A safe has been stolen from the rink's washroom?
Come on, Father!
Come on, Father! Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Why... why, Chihiro?
Why did you...?
Police!
Let us through!
Move back, please!
Move back.
Oooh!
Now that's loud!
Yes...
Good.
So no one came in, right?
Well, when we arrived we found this little boy.
Conan, what are you doing here?
So, there must also be...
Well... Exactly by chance!
But don't get angry, Mr. inspector.
Not at this point, man!
Inspector!
It seems obvious that the murder weapon is this shotgun.
Well, let's go.
Let's start by checking the license number and its owner.
That's me.
It's the shotgun I use for skeet shooting.
It was in the closet with those of the other members of the group.
Those of the other members?
Yes.
These 3 people are my clay pigeon shooting partners.
So, who has closed it, this cupboard that says?
It was me...
We all know the combination.
When we started coming here,
we decided that the number to open it would be 9-0-1-7.
That's good.
So, all we have to do is analyze the four of you.
Whoever we find powder residue will be the killer.
You will find all 4 of us!
This afternoon we went skeet shooting.

Also, the locker may not have been locked properly.
Anyone could have taken it.
No.
That's impossible.
What did you forget?
The case for storing the shotguns is rectangular,
so you don't know what's inside.
The Izumi's is a normal case.
In addition, to store the gun, it must be disassembled.
It is impossible for someone to have assembled it.
Well, well...
The only ones who knew that there was a shotgun in it
and who would have known how to assemble it...
...are the four of you.
B-but...
Let's see.
Takagi, find out if at the time of the crime anyone saw a suspect
hanging around near the washroom, please.
Okay, okay, okay.
About it... I...
I saw someone!
What?!? Eeeeh!?
I saw the killer come out of the sink!
Are you sure, Sonoko?
Yes.
There was a sign on the toilet door saying he was being cleaned.
(Off) "I knocked, but no one answered,
I waited outside the door.
"Then the fireworks started,
"and I went to the window to see them.
"It was then!
"A suspicious person came out of the washroom,
with a long coat and a hood."
Did you get a look at his face, Sonoko?
No.
He was wearing a hood and a scarf.
For the killer to have timed the shot to coincide with the noise of the fires
and was unrecognizable,
proves that this was a planned murder.
First, we will hear their separate statements,
each in a different room.
Then, we will know which of you 4 proposed to come to this park.
Just a moment!
We'll decide between all of us, inspector!
You'll tell us when we interrogate him.
It seems to me that there won't be.
When I saw the crime scene, I already had a feeling,
and with Sonoko's explanation, I've finally linked it all together.
Miss Itami was killed by...
...Izumi Sano!
It was you, wasn't it?
Confess this!
Just a moment!
Don't talk nonsense!
Why me, huh?!
There are 3 factors that prove it was you.
The first is that the murder took place in the ladies room.
That there was no one in the washroom because the sign was there,
but the fact that the victim was here proves that she was meeting someone.
The second factor is your relationship with the victim.
From what I'm told, the two of you were always fighting, weren't you?
You want us to believe that I'm the culprit just because of that?
And the ultimate proof is the blood trail on the wall.
A blood trail?
In her eyes, maybe it's just a trail she made at random.
But I know how to interpret it properly.
It's a message the victim made before she died.
It's the one...
...of Sano!
Before the inspector arrived, I asked for their surnames, didn't I?
The only one of the surnames that corresponds to the message is Sano!
You killed him!
(Takagi) -I'm wrong? (Takagi) -I think so.
E
Aaaaaaaaaah!
What does it say?!
It seems to me that only by looking at the victim you can guess.
He was shot in the heart and died instantly, right?
I find it difficult that he could have written anything afterwards.
You are right.
Besides, just because he went to the ladies' room
doesn't mean he had to be waiting for a woman.
Well, what about the ese, then?
Ah, the ese.
I'm sure the killer wrote it down to make us believe
that it was Miss Sano.
The murder weapon is also Miss Sano's shotgun.
But something doesn't fit.
Before the crime, Sonoko knocked on the door, didn't she?
If the murderer held the victim waiting for the fires to start,
why didn't the victim call out to be saved?
At that time the murderer was perhaps still hiding next to the victim waiting for the fires to start.
waiting for the fires to start.
Have you seen this?
There is something sticky on the tip.
Look, on the tip of the canoe. It looks like saliva!
That's because while he was waiting for the fires to start,
the killer put the shotgun in his mouth so he wouldn't scream.
Then, with the first rockets, he aimed at him.
(Sano) Well, if that's so...
none of us is the murderer.
Since the fires started, we've been at the ice rink.
Right, Ran?
Ah, yes...
Really?
It's not even half a minute from the washroom to the rink.
When the first rocket was felt, they were there.

And between the first rocket and the second, not even 10 seconds passed.
And where were you at that moment?
I was smoking a cigarette
on a bench, with my back to the fireworks.
You're the only one without an alibi, aren't you?
But we still don't have any proof,
nor do we know the relationship you had with the victim.
This girl was very cold, wasn't she?
Look at this, inspector!
Although they wanted to shoot her, she had her hand in her pocket.
A cell phone? There's nothing on the screen.
She couldn't have called the police.
How about checking the last call?
Then we'll know who she wanted to call.
Here, let's try it...
K-Y-X?
Instead of the number, there are 8 pads...
She must have wanted to call someone,
but she was stunned and must have made a mistake.
(Thinking) "KIX?
"KIX?
Wait a minute!
This rings a bell."

DETECTIVE CONAN
Did he commit suicide?
What do you mean?
It wasn't an accident?
He used this excuse to get men off his back!
(Kogoro voice) KIX.
It is a message that the victim wanted to leave us before he died.
Therefore, it is absolutely clear...
...that the murderer is you!
In the next chapter...
A message just before death, part two...
The clue to the next Conan is... A 5 yen coin!
Sonoko will receive a call.
(Sonoko) When you call don't get the wrong number!
