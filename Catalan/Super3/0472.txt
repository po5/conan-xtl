Whatever happens, I will always be by your side!
Ten years ago, in the school library, Ran and I...
lived a mysterious and dangerous adventure;
what memories!
Always discover the only truth!
He looks like a child.
But he has the brain of an adult and he is... detective Conan!

- (yawn) - (time) Eh?
Xt!
Conan, be more discreet.
Try not to make so much noise.
Excuse me.
You shouldn't yawn like this while reading!
If Conan Doyle were to raise his head and feel you yawning,
he'd be in for a rude awakening!
Mm!
And what do you want me to do?
In elementary school I read all the crime novels
in this library page by page.
I know them by heart! Are you sure?
This world is full of very complicated mysteries.
"What was it, this voice?"
"It's a very old memory."
"Sure! It was that day!"
What's the matter with you?
You look frightened.
It's nothing, don't suffer.
Kojima!
What are you doing here?
Books aren't for climbing feet first!
Ah... I know, Miss.
But if I don't get in line, I can't reach the shelves anymore... Oh, oh, oh!
Miss!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Oysters, what a pain!
You see?
I already knew you'd end up drinking badly!
-What hurt you, Genta? -What book did you want to read? -Which book did you want to read?
Say.
I'll get it for you.
Let's see, let's see...
First of all, we'll put this one back in its place.
Oh... Mm?
Oh, my goodness!
There's something there that won't let the book in.
What could it be?
It must be a dead lizard, or a snake.
Lately there are lizards everywhere.
Aah!
THE ADVENTURES OF YOUNG Shin'ichi Kudō.
PART ONE.
Ouch!
My mother!
What are you scaring me like this for?
I thought it was a real snake!
It looks like a wall-holder. -Yes.
But it's not made of snakeskin, it looks more like leather.
Who would have hidden it on the shelf, and for what reason?
Why don't we open it, guys?
-Maybe we found a great fortune! -Come on!
There's only a folded piece of paper in here.
-Come down. Oh.
-Look, there's something written on it. And what does it say?
"Thank you. Ran Mouri, from first A".
And how did you know that?
-Is it true? -What?
Let's see.
It's true, that's what it says, but...
How do I not know?
It turns out that the Ran and I, uh...
I mean, Ran told me a story
that happened to her several years ago.
Really? What kind of story?
What kind of story?
It's a strange and very mysterious adventure
she lived here when she was little.
It all started 10 years ago.
Get out of your head, Shinichi!
It's not a good idea.
Have you seen what time it is?
I've already told you that you can leave, if you want to.
If your parents find out you ran away, they'll be mad at you.
I can solve this mystery on my own, I don't want to leave you alone!
What if the ghost finds you and eats you?
Don't be silly!
How can I tell you that ghosts don't exist?
Not at all!
My friend Sonoko explained to me that there is one.
It comes out of the library on full moon nights!
It's a ghost with a creepy voice who wears a very strange hat!
Look, there's a full moon tonight.
It's going to be an exciting night!
Shi... Shinichi!
You finally decided to join me? Of course I did!
You see?
We can't go in, the windows are locked.
Oh, of course we can.
Oops!
How did you open it?
I made sure to leave it open before you left.
The janitor never checks them one by one.
Come on, let's go to the library!
Hey, don't run so fast!
(At the same time) Oh!
Ran!
There's someone in the library.
The ghost? Xt.
Mm.
Mm.
(sobbing)

But it's only the janitor! He scared me!
I think he's had a bit too much to drink today.
Oh, that's perfect!
He just left the library, I'm sure he won't come back.
(Wind: whistles)
You see?
There's no ghost here!
But you feel very strange noises.
Ah!
One does... one does...
There is the ghost of the hat in the window!
Shinichi! Don't panic and take a good look, Ran.
What's wrong is that the curtain has come off and it's making a strange shape.
They say that ghosts come out when there's a full moon
so the moonlight casts different shadows.
I'm sure the noises we heard earlier
was the wind whistling through the crack in the window.
All ghost stories are based on the same tricks.
You're right.
We can leave now.
We won't find anything here.
(Man) Are you sure?
Ah!
Shinichi!
Are you trying to guess the real content of the story
just by reading the plot summary?
In this world there are mysteries...
much more complicated ones.
I-can you tell who you are?
(laughs)
Who am I?
You and I are... we are brothers.
Brothers?
Or rather I should say I'm your little brother,
even though we're several years apart.
My little brother?
Bah!
What nonsense.
Ran, go get the concierge.
Yes.
Oh, man!
It won't open! What?
It's no use.
I've blocked this door with a curse of my own.
Now you must listen to everything I'm going to tell you.
How dare you! Quiet!
I didn't come here to fight you.
I just... came to...
challenge you.
I want to see if you can discover
the treasure that's hidden in there.
The-the treasure? If you uncover it, you've won.
You get to keep the treasure.
In addition, I will reveal my true identity to you.
You are free to accept the challenge or refuse it.
If you accept it, I will undo the curse on the door and let you out.
If you do not accept it, you will be trapped forever...
in this dark room so cold, it chills the blood.
That's right.
I must confess that I like blood very much.
Red things make me go crazy.
You don't scare us at all, you know.
We don't care what you say, we will never obey the orders of an evil one!
Wow!
What a brave girl.
I accept! What?
I said I accept the challenge.
If he wants to play, we'll play!
That's the way I like it, Shinichi Kudo, dear brother.
Shinichi! What do you think you're doing?
He's gone!
He's disappeared!
Shinichi, are you sure you want to accept the challenge?
Yes.
My father says you can never refuse a challenge you've been given.
But that man was really scary, he looked like an evil demon!
I don't care if he's a demon or a ghost.
I want to know who he is and what is the solution...
of this mysterious coded message.
But what will happen if he curses you again like before?
He thinks you might die! A curse?
You already know!
He told us that the door wouldn't open because it was enchanted!
And now!
Look carefully, Ran.
See that mop leaning against the door?
It has a fishing line attached to the handle that goes through the hook at the top.
When we entered the library, he hid behind a shelf,
pulled the line taut to make the pole fall down.
and leave the door jammed.
He must also have jammed the other door so that we couldn't open it.
Since the library is dark, the tricks are hard to see.
This man has told us many things to make us afraid,
but I can assure you he's no witch or anything like that.
He is just a clumsy magician,
who has forgotten to hide the evidence of his magic tricks.
How clever you are, Shinichi!
You look like Sherlock Holmes!
Do I?
Maybe I do.
(laughs)
Tell me, tell me, Mr. Holmes,
what does the coded message on the paper say?
I still do not know what it means, however, apparently, it says:
"Make angry the amphora of Haido".
The amphora of Haido?
Are you sure it reads like that?
Yes, the ideogram of "anger" is often found in novels,
and my mother has a music record called Symphony of the Amphora,
where the same symbol appears as here.

I have heard this word many times, and therefore I am sure.
Maybe an adult could give us a hand in deciphering it.
Do you want me to ask my father? No way!
We can't explain any of it!
It's a challenge just between me and this stranger.
(laughter)
This child, ha-ha,
read "angry amphora" instead of "sunken anchor".
-How funny! -This Shinichi was a piece of ass!
I'm sure you shouldn't have read it right either,
so shut your mouth!
I don't find it so strange;
he was an elementary school kid.
Anyway, this Shinichi reminds me a bit of you, Conan.
What?
Are you serious?
-Huh? -Come on, go on!
-How does the story end, Conan? -You've left us intrigued!
You were able to get home safely?
Yes.
Ran explained to me that...
Ran, come here!
Where were you at this time of day?
I forgot something at school and I had to come back.
Don't lie!
I'm sure you're with Shinichi again.
Yes, I knew it!
Lately he seemed to have disappeared from the map, this one.
What kind of education should Yukiko give him?
(Yawns) Let her children do as they please.
King, where are you going now?
Do you have to work?
Yes.
There's been a murder at a warehouse in Haido Harbor.
Inspector Megure told me to go there.
You poor thing!
Be very careful.
The streets are so dangerous!
Keep watch, you too, and lock the doors.
There's a rather bizarre thief hanging around the neighborhood.
Don't worry!
I'm an inspector's wife.
-See you later, king! -Goodbye!
Take care of the Ran, Eri.
(Yukiko) Mmm... (Yukiko) Yeah, sure.
(Yukiko) Understood.
I'll talk to him.
It won't happen again, Eri.
(Yukiko) Good evening!
Just a moment!
You're not going to sleep until you've told me everything, Shinichi.
Why did you take a girl to school at this time of night?
What? But I've already explained it to you!
We had neglected something.
Do you think this will serve as an excuse?
It's all right, woman!
The most important thing is that you're both at home.
And what should we do, Yusaku?
Besides, this is not a police interrogation.
If you want him to explain it to you, it won't do you any good to get angry with him.
Before we get ashore, we have to get to port and weigh anchor.
Drop anchor!
Father, how do you write this?
"Sinking anchors" is written with these symbols?
Where did you get this? Eh, it's nothing.
A coded message that the teacher gave us.
What a demanding teacher!
Ideograms are difficult for first graders.
But she must be a lot of fun, if she likes this kind of riddles.
Riddles?
"Haido" must not be a person's name.
It would be too innocent.
By the way, what do you say we go to the beach one of these days?
That would be great!
The port of Haido?
Does this message mean I have to go to Haido Harbor, Shinichi?
Yes.
"Sink the anchor of Haido" means go to a place in Haido
where there are sunken anchors, that is, in Haido harbor.
Yesterday you said the ideograms read:
"Do angry the amphora of Haido".
This I told you?
He-he.
Are you sure what to do?
The author of this riddle is a mysterious man
who was waiting for you in the library.
We should call the police.
He says if I can solve the mystery,
he'll reveal his identity to me;
I hope it's not too late.
But thanks for the ride.
You had to get up early because of us, Dr. Agasa.
You don't deserve it, on the contrary!
I'm glad to see you continue to be as friendly as ever.
Before you started elementary school,
you always came to play together at my house.
Lately you never come over, and I'm worried.
I thought you two had a fight.
No, we didn't fight.
Didn't we?
N-no.
Look at this!
There's a lot of squad cars.
Something must have happened.
Last night my father said
there had been a murder at Haido Harbor.
What if the murderer was our John Doe?
No, that's impossible.
The murder took place while you were in the school library.
The news said the killer was arrested early this morning.
What makes my head dance

is that the stranger you encountered yesterday at the school
made you come here.
Maybe she wanted us to wait for her here. No.
"Red things drive me crazy."
Red things.
See anything red?
Could that be it?
Siren lights are red.
Dr. Agasa said our John Doe
has nothing to do with what happened here.
Therefore, he couldn't have known that there would be so many patrol cars here.
It must be something red... that's always red.
Ah!
The fire hydrant!
But there doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Ah!
It's a sticker!
There's a message behind it.
Another encrypted message!
Let's see.
"Prove Toriya's innocence and leave the famous old man empty".
I guess "Toriya" must be a reference in Toriya's neighborhood,
but what does it mean that we have to prove his innocence?
I guess it's another guessing game like the one before.
The only famous older gentleman I can think of is in Mitokomon.
Yes. Doctor Agasa.
An innocent person is a person who hasn't committed any crime, right?
What do you mean?
Yes. Criminals are guilty.
What? My father often says.
"It's the criminal, he's guilty."
Guilty?
Guilt and innocence, innocence, is whiteness.
Whiteness.
Whiteness.
Whiteness.
The castle is white!
Of course it is!
Let's go to the ruins of Toriya castle.
No!
We have to go to the lock in front of the castle ruins!
The lock? Didn't we have to go to the castle?
As the Ran says, the "famous elder lord" refers to Mitokomon,
and what he has inside are the viscera.
If we have to leave it empty, we must take out everything inside.
Removing the middle syllables of Mitokomon, it's like "suimon".
Now I understand!
So, "Suimon" means airlock!
The airlock is next to the ruins of Toriya's white castle.
We are already at the Toriya lock.
There is no one here either.
I don't see anything suspicious in red.
It seems to me that we should have gone
to take a look at the ruins first.
If so, we would have had enough with the first part of the message.
If the last part of the message led us to the airlock,
the next clue must be something red
located between the dam and the castle.
The level crossing!
Do you see anything? No.
There is nothing here either.
Just a moment!
The message only makes sense when the traffic light is red.
And when the light is red... lower the barrier.
Shinichi! What have you found?
(At the same time) "The old seal..."
"...of Okuho disappears."
"With hoarse voice, you taste loneliness."
It's the third riddle.
Alza!
It's all ideograms.
Just a moment!
Where have I seen this symbol?
What is it?
A message?
Of course it's a message!
Today is a holiday!
Listen.
What if it was a weather vane? What?
A weather vane, you say?
Of course it is!
The 4 cardinal points!
Of course!
I get it!
Don't miss the next episode:
