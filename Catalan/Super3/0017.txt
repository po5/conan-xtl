DETECTIVE CONAN
The case of the department store robbery
(Children) Live in Yaiba!
Yaiba, kill the monsters!
(Counter voice) It's already ours.
Quickly!
Destroy Yaiba!
Yes, sir!
Yaiba will protect the land!
-Yaiba!
-Carry these guys away!
It's the coz Yaiba!
Coz Yaibaaaaa!
(Thinks) "I should go to high school."
"Why am I swallowing that crap?"
What's wrong with you?
You don't like it, Yaiba?
What's wrong with you?
Ah, yes, yes, it's the best!
Come on, cane, Yaiba!
Cane!
Come on, smile!
(Think) "Shame on you."
(Megaphone: female voice) "Thank you for shopping at our stores."
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
Come back another day, we wait for you!
(All) - Goodbye, Miss! -Goodbye!
(All) Yaiba, Yaiba, you are our hero!
Béééééééé!
Oysters!
I don't have it!
I lost the autograph!
What did you say?
Have you lost it?
I wouldn't want to lose Yaiba's autograph for anything in the world!
Let's see, I would swear that...
when we had our picture taken with Yaiba, you were carrying the wallet...
I think I already know.
Ayumi, show me the photo for a moment.
You have it.
Genta said he was hungry and left...
(Genta) It's true...
And I bought a sandwich.
It's at the stop!
I'm going to look for it!
But what are you saying, the department store is already closed.
We'll come back tomorrow.
As it's not you!
I'm running away!
-Hey, Genta!
Where are you going? -Wait! -Hey, wait!
Hey, come on!
Come back!
(Adult voice) Wow... I shouldn't have opened my mouth.
Hurry up, please, ladies,
in 10 minutes the security system will be activated.
Genta, when they switch on the security system,
this door will be locked.
Keep in mind.
We have plenty of time, with 10 minutes!
Good evening, Miss!
-Good night, Miss!
Now!
Wait for me, Genta!
Hey!
Don't do it!
(Thinking)
(Think) "Woe betide those who..."
I've got it!
I've already found my precious treasure!
And once, thanks to Conan.
It's not exactly that either, Ayumi...
Let's try it!
The security system!
(At the same time) Noooooooo!
What, what shall we do now, Conan?
We'll go to the security office and they'll let us out.
You mean?!
(Mitsuhiko) Let's see, security is...
Look, it's in the second basement.
Look, it's in Yaiba!
(Man) The jewelry store is on the sixth floor, isn't it?
Yes.
On the seventh floor there are antiques.
-The one in the elevator! -Xxxxxxt!
We have until tomorrow morning to clear everything out.
It's a robbery!
They'll be angry if they see us!
They'll kill us.
Anem's-in hurry!
And the poor people who are tied up?
Come on, we have to call the police without getting caught, okay?
My God, there's no line!
Because they've cut it!
-This one too.
-They've cut them all!
Maybe the phone here.
Well, there's no line either!
The phones, they control them with the security system.
You mean they won't rescue us?
Well, before they kill us, I'd eat macaroni.
Come on guys, we can't give up though!
(Think) "Let's see if anyone sees it."
-Eeeeeeeeeei!
-Help-noooooo!
Look this way!
(Thinks) "It's no use."
Genta!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Don't you see that the thieves will feel it!
Gee, it won't break, this glass!
It's useless.
They install very thick glass for security reasons.
Very well, then... Now you'll see!
What are you doing?!
All right, deactivate it.
This is done.
What a thrill!
(loud knocking)
What's that?
There are noises coming from the seventh floor!
(loud knocking) Okay!

Look at the seventh floor with the surveillance camera.
Oh, man... I'm so tired.
I told you it was useless.
Oh!
Ajupiu's-e!
What about the letters?
Oh, shit!
Oh, it's impossible, you'll see!
(Man) Nothing strange.
They don't see anything strange.
But where was that noise coming from?
-Quickly, let's load the boat. Let's look for assegurà'ns-en.
There is no way out, this way.
Shut up!
Someone's coming, Conan.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Genta, look out!
It was you! Oh, no!
Sorry, I'm late.
Me and Sonoko got to talking...
I'll prepare dinner now.
What's up?
They've seen us!
Don't let them run away!
Hurry up!
Get in!
Oh, when I catch you!
Security, do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Turn on the lights!
(Radio) - What? (Radio) - "There are some kids, here!"
Damn kids!
Where have they got to?
We've got him!
(Radio) "Hey, what's up? Answer me!"
Eh... What happened?!
What happened?!
His henchmen also know that we are here.
They've turned on the lights to find us!
Come on Conan, we must run away from here!
Father, wake up!
Father, wake up!
Ouch!
Who did this to me, this?!
Where is he, Conan?
Hasn't he come back yet?
Don't wake me up, to ask me that.
I want to sleep a little longer...
He's awake!
Wow, how nice, lucky he's arrived!
We've got them.
Genta, come out!
Come out all of you!
Come on! What's up, Conan?
It's been a hair's breadth that we didn't get trapped in here.
-That's scary! -Thanks a lot, Conan.
-Thank you very much, Conan.
(thinks) "Thank me when we're out of here."
Conan's in the department store, right?
Weren't they going to see a show of some dolls from a movie?
But it's already gone fosc.
You called the department store?
But it's all the same, Ran.
What about my dinner?
You want me to starve to death?
What do you think...
(Answering machine) "Welcome to Maruti Department Store."
"Today, our store is already closed."
Afanyeu's-e.
Come on, let's go!
We must flee as fast as we can.
We've got you!
Tomorrow we will serve you from 10 o'clock in the morning to 6 o'clock in the evening."
You see?
What you have to do is to prepare dinner for me, come on...
Where are you calling, now, pretty girl?
Mrs. Kojima?
This is Ran Mouri.
You've arrived, in Genta?
-Aaaaaaaaaaai! -I've got you!
(Shouting)
These voices are...! At Genta and Mitsuhiko!
Ayumi, stay hidden here and don't move.
-Let me be! -Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Where are they, the other two?
Help!
Help!
Although I don't want to die!
(Loud speaker: loud voice) "Don't move! We are the police!"
"The department store is surrounded. You can't run away!"
"Leave the guns on the ground, and let the children go!"
-Fast, we run!
-Fugim!
Quickly!
Come this way, follow me!
Donkey, there's no police here!
It was the children!
Damn, they fooled us like fools, with these pacifiers!
Don't let them run away!
Ah!
Good evening, Mr. Yosahida?
Is this Mr. Yosahida?
I'm calling for Conan Edogawa.
What's up?
Ayumi hasn't come home either?
And that Mitsuhiko's parents also called worried?
Ran, what's he saying?
What's happened?
Come on, tell me.
Get up, Genta!
If you don't, he'll catch you!
Yes, I know that!
I know, I know.
Hey, hey, hey!
What's the matter?!
What's the matter?!
We're trapped!
Over here!
Cagum dena!
-What's the matter, Conan? -What's the matter, Conan?
-Have you neglected something?
No, it's not that, don't worry.
(He thinks) "There's something that gives me a bad feeling."
"But what is it? I don't know..."
(Kogoro) Kidnapped?!
The children?
Yes, that's the only explanation, Father.
Wait a minute, let's see, Ran, let's take it one step at a time:
Has anyone asked for a ransom for them? No, of course not...
You see?
Those scoundrels must surely be fooling around.
And they'll be back soon.
You'll see.
That's what I hope.
All right, how about dinner? Very well.
Aren't you going to cook dinner for me today, or what?
May I speak to Inspector Megure?
Oh, sir...
(Thinks) "This is always foolproof."
(Stomach snores)

How are you! Oh, Genta, always the same!
You've chosen a good time!
Sorry, guys, I can't help it, I'm hungry!
-Quiets!
Stop it! -Come here.
Good evening, excuse us for disturbing you at this hour.
Have you found out anything?
See, so far, as far as we know, they haven't had any accidents,
but it's strange that they haven't returned home yet.
Well, something has happened to them.
I'll have them looked for.
Don't worry, we'll find them, you'll see.
Thank you very much, inspector.
And now, excuse me, but I'm doing a very important investigation.
So far we've done all we can do.
The only thing we can do now is wait.
Come on, let's have dinner.
Dinner...
I've always wanted to do that!
Oh, sir, forgive us.
If we're saved, I'll pay for absolutely everything.
But maybe we won't be saved, from this...
Come, Genta, don't be so sad.
You've eaten as much as you want, here.
We must reduce those men before anà'ns-en!
We stake our reputation as detectives!
-Eh?
The, the reputation.
-Of the junior detectives.
It must be a very important case.
Often, when dealing with such important cases,
meetings go on for hours.
What's this all about now?
Aren't they important, the children?!
No, that's not what I meant.
And me without dinner because of that group.
I'll distract myself for a while by reading the news.
Eh?
"Gang of department store robbers!"
"They always come in when they're closed
and steal all the jewelry, electronics, etcetera."
Who knows if you should be investigating this case?
A department store?
What if they went there?
Come on, calm down, Ran!
We're starting our raid!
-On the attack! -On the attack!
Where are they hiding, now?
Over there!
What is it, here?!
I think I'm going to lose my temper...
-I'll lose my temper too... -Mitsuhiko, what are you doing?!
I've had enough of you!
You won't get out alive!
Geez, I'm really scared of animals.
Macos... What else do you want?
Catch him!
Ah!
Help!
-All right!
We got him! -He's ours!
(At the same time) We are the best!
Long live the junior detectives!
Yes!
(Thinking) "Wait a minute."
"Sure, now I get it."
(Footsteps)
Who is it?
Who's here?
Hello, it's me, Miss Elevatorista.
And now, creature, but what are you doing here?
Don't you know that there are some bad men running around the building?
Come, let's go out into the street.
No need to continue fingint.
Eh?
I know everything, Miss elevator lady, or should I say...
fifth member of the gang of shoplifters?
Eh?
What the hell, kiddo?
The fifth member of the gang was the one who ran the stairs.
And she controlled everything so they could find us.
She was the only person in the office, who knew the building well.
You were the one who controlled everything from the inside!
You got a job as an elevator operator
and helped them set up the robbery.
But who are you?
Conan Edogawa!
A detective!
An excellent deduction, nice, though not perfect.
I'm the gang leader.
A gun!
This is already foul play!
I'll get you!
(Thinks) "I'll make her go to the roof."
"Finally."
We've reached the last stop, handsome!
Come on out so I can see you!
"Basketballs!"
Stop it!
Cut the crap, kid!
AAAI!
Ouch!
Oh!
Help!
Help!
I made it.
Oh!
Oh, boy!
Warehouse robbers.
Emporteu's-los!
Look at them, so fresh!
Let them sleep!

DETECTIVE CONAN
"The next day, we were decorated
for being so brave and catching the thieves."
"They didn't want to charge us for the food or the things we broke."
Isn't that nice?
(Ayumi) Of course!
(Mitsuhiko) Junior detective league...
(Genta) -Solve the case!
(All) -Yes, yes, yes, yes!
