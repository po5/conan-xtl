The organization of the men in black turned me into a little boy.
So far, I've tried to keep track of it whenever I had the chance,
and that's why I've allied myself with the FBI.
There is a hidden agenda behind the surprising tactic we have adopted
to confront the criminal gang.
Rena Mizunashi has agreed to infiltrate the organization again
on the condition that the FBI gets her brother Eisuke into the witness protection program.
into the witness protection program.
After a few days, we went to eat at the buffet of a hotel...
where the president of a headhunter company
the president of a foreign headhunter company.
Surprisingly, one of the suspects is FBI agent Camel.
Wait for me, Conan.
I'll be right back.
(Akai) Jodie.
(Akai) What?
(Akai) Be careful.
I have a bad feeling today.
Ai ha tesaguri kurayami no naka de odorus.
It's gonna be a great night, yeah!
An intrigue that gives you goosebumps.
In the middle of the darkness, a red scream and a black bullet!
The men in black have recovered the Rena Mizunashi
and will entrust you with the mission to liquidate Shuichi Akai.
He always discovers the only truth!
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is the detective Conan!
Yoake no highway.
Kono Omois to be you slave.
Oh!
Tonight and every night, you'D be mine!

"The clash between red and black. Innocence."
An FBI agent?
Are you serious?
This criminal-faced man is an FBI agent?
Yes.
In fact, you don't have to look like a good person to join the FBI, do you?
And... what is he doing in Japan?
As you may know, I traveled to Japan
to... to unwind after having failed an FBI mission.
Y... yes.
Agent Camel was worried because he saw that I didn't come home.
Me?
Turns out Andre Camel is my longtime boyfriend.
What?
-Right, dear? -Hey... What the...?
Come on!
Dear my...!
Yes, yes, yes, of course!
(They laugh)
"They are good actors."
And may I know why they are still in Japan?
What?
And... how come... you haven't learned to speak Japanese well?
Before..., Miss, I noticed a slight American accent.
Well, it's just that... the Andre, who speaks Japanese very well,
has been teaching me and I've made such remarkable progress,
that now it's very difficult for us to think that we have to leave Japan.
Oi, dear?
Yes, yes, Queen, you are absolutely right.
It seems to me that they are a little short-sighted.
Yes... Even if he's an FBI agent, he's a suspect.
They'll have to stay until we find out what happened.
I hope he won't do anything to them.
On the contrary.
Thanks for the heads up, Conan.
I owe you one.
Jodie, listen to something.
I'd like to talk to all of you for a little while
before you leave the hospital.
All right.
Roger that.
Inspector!
I found this bag
in the cleaning cupboard in the top floor washroom.
What's that?
Look, inside there's a raincoat, gloves and a gun.
I imagine... that's what the killer used.
I'm sure of it.
Because I don't think we found gunpowder residue
on the clothes of the three suspects.
No, besides, if he threw away the clothes he was wearing when he committed the crime,
maybe he did dare to take the elevator.
Hm.
He didn't take it.
"When he committed the crime,
"The culprit took the stairs to the top floor,
"went into the bathroom, put the raincoat in,
"The pistol and the gloves into the bag...
"and hid it in the cleaning cupboard."
To do all this, it is evident that it took the force more than 5 minutes.
In addition, he did not want to rush so as not to attract attention.
I'm sure the murderer did not expect
that Inspector Takagi would arrive so early.
It's true, that's right.
By the way, I also checked the images...
from the elevator security camera,
and I didn't seem to see any foreigners.

-What if it was an Asian foreigner?
Would he be able to identify at a glance?
No, I don't think he could...
I doubt very much that the president would have hired an Asian foreigner.
In fact, he always said that he really liked to hear Japanese...
from a person who couldn't pass for Japanese in any way.
That's why... the suspects...
are these two gentlemen and the FBI agent.
In this case, the prime suspect is Mr. Hal..,
who was hiding in the bathroom when he was arrested.
I... I already told you that he was not hiding!
I've already explained everything!
If I had left a bag with a gun in the janitor's closet,
I wouldn't have been hiding in the sink.
I agree with you,
but you could also have hidden
when he saw that the police had arrived.
Isn't that right?
By the way, Inspector.
The trench coat is the size of a tall, thin man.
It would fit a man of Mr. Toby's build very well.
Why me?
A man like the FBI agent
could have worn a trench coat in this size perfectly.
Besides, the three of us are not the only suspects.
The secretary could have worn it too.
Could I?
Even if it was a little... long in the sleeves.
You're right.
She could have made false statements
to disguise the fact that she's the perpetrator of the murder.
Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.
She could have put on a man's trench coat
to immediately deflect any suspicion.
And now!
I am innocent!
At the moment, the only thing we can be sure of is that one of you four...
has fired several shots at President Sunouchi.
It seems to me that Mr. President was eating when she was killed.
What?
Come closer, Megure, and look at the right hand.
It looks like he was holding something between his fingers.
Now that you mention it, it does.
Still, there's no food on the table.
Maybe she wasn't eating.
She'd have something else in her hand.
Like... for example...
Oh, the pen on the table!
Oh, there's traces of blood on the pad.
There's traces of blood on the notepad and the pen!
Also, on the first page of the notepad...
there are some letters marked, as if he had been writing something!
Yes, that's right!
He must have written something before he died.
And his killer...
Have the blood samples analyzed
and the handwriting of the person who wrote this.
We understand.
We must know if this handwriting is the president's or not.
Yes!
I mean... yes, if it was our investigation, we would do it, right?
Yeah, right...
He-he-he... He-he-he-he...
Wow.
So, the blood we found on the notepad...
was President Sunouchi's.
Yes.
And the note is also written in the president's handwriting.
And what did he write, then?
Well, it was... a note written in English,
which means... how should I put it?
This writing doesn't look at all like the message of a dying man.
"Bring my tux."
Bri... Bri... what?
(thinks) "Bring my tux."
"Bring me my..."... "tuxedo"?
Yes, that's right.
I'm not ready to continue working.
It would be...
Yes, it would be too hard for me, and I would like to quit the job.
Yes, I sincerely apologize.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
(CLEC) Oh!
(CLEC)
Gin!
Kir.
Who was that?
Who were you talking to?
Distrustful!
It was the head of human resources of the chain.
I told him that, after the accident,
I don't see myself able to continue working as a presenter.
I've quit my job.
If they started looking for me, we'd have problems.
Besides, it's all the same.
By now the whole organization will know who I was talking to.
I know to keep an eye on me
and that you set up transmitters and microphones,
and that there are a couple or three men following me wherever I go.
What do you want?
As you can see,
the head still distrusts me and I can't act freely.
What should I do now?
I have just come with direct orders
from the person who distrusts you.
He wants you to take it upon yourself to liquidate someone...
so that we can trust you again.
Is that so?
And may I ask... who will be the victim?
One of the FBI agents.
In Shuichi Akai.
(Think) "On Shuichi... Akai?"
You want me to kill the FBI agent... Akai?

The head of the organization and myself suspect that he has some head
that he has some on his head.
"We were surprised that he let you come back to us....
"Without putting up any resistance."
That's why the boss sends you the order to kill in Shuichi Akai,
the mastermind of the FBI.
It will be your way to prove your loyalty to the organization.
What's wrong with you, Kir?
Do you have any reason not to kill yourself?
No, I have no reason.
But, the Akai... He's a tough nut to crack, even for you.
How do you want me to kill him?
And if I make any missteps to get close to the FBI,
I'll get caught again.
You don't have to get close at all.
You have to lure him into our territory.
It'll let him know that we've taken you back,
but that you made a grave mistake
that landed you in the hands of the FBI.
Tell him that, since you can't go anywhere,
you want to leave the organization
and you need help... to flee abroad.
He will tell you to come alone, of course.
If you tell him that you are willing to give him important information,
he will convince him easily.
I understand.
And when I have him in front of me,
you guys will show up and shoot a bullet in his brain.
-A ‰ s that, right? -Not well ©.
Killing s yourself, alone.
What?
Shuichi Akai has a surprising intuition.
If he noticed our presence,
he would know that you have set him up
and would repay us in kind.
We will keep a safe distance away from him
and observe the course of events...
through a microphone and camera... which he will carry for you.
Understood.
But... will you give me a little time so I can prepare the play?
No.
Now, call him and tell him to come right now.
Call him and tell him to come right now.
If you're unable to do it, he died instead of you.
Don't... don't run so fast, Gin!
You must think the FBI let me escape
on the condition that I port © s to you?
Ã ‰ s a possibility.
According to our informants,
the FBI agents are still in the hospital.
It is seen that one of them has been involved in a murder case,
and at the moment they are all keeping an eye on this matter.
We have an opportunity too good to let slip away.
A murder?
YES.
They've left a businessman like a sieve.
A simple murder.
Nothing more.
What?
The note says "bring me my smÃ²quing"?
That's all the president wrote before he died?
Well, yes.
Bring my tux.
"Bring" means "bring me."
"Tux" Ã © s an abbreviation for "tuxedo", smÃ²quing.
Well, I don't quite get it.
Both the notepad and the pen are stained with blood,
and the handwriting is © s su.
To me, the culprit has torn off the first page of the pad.
What does all this mean?
That before dying, the president has written this note.
Then, the murderer has realized and has torn the sheet.
Ah... As they say in English, it is the "massage" of a dying man.
(At the same time) No, no!
It's "message", not "massage"!
-Eh? -Eh?
Ã ‰ s right, I had forgotten that you were English teachers, you!
Yes, indeed, I work as an English teacher in an academy,
but I thought you two were FBI agents.
Eee... Yes, of course, but due to a series of circumstances,
I had to take English classes for a while.
-Right, my beloved? -Yes, and so much!
YES.
And by the way, Miss Irina.
Do you have any idea what the phrase "bring me my smÃ²quing" might mean?
Uh... YES...
It seems to me that it could be a message
that Mr. President wanted me to address to myself.
He was having a party tonight,
and he wanted me to leave him some smÃ²quing prepared.
What?
Did he mean... that the note is a reminder
that has nothing to do with this case?
(Irina) "Yes."
(Irina) "This noon, Mr. President had arranged to have lunch..."
with the future talent he had hired Ãºltimament.

He was supposed to leave the note for me to see when he arrived at the office.
Well, from what it says,
it was you who tore off the sheet and took it away.
No, not me!
When I found Mr. President's every see,
I called the emergency services immediately.
I did not touch anything in the office while waiting for the police to arrive!
But since I knew I needed the smÃ²quing tonight, I left a message on the answering machine,
I left a message on the answering machine.
On the answering machine?
Yes, there is a message.
(Pip, pip-piiip)
(Irina) "It's me. Mr. President, you've already left for lunch?"
"I found the files you wanted to consult,
"I'll bring them to you right away."
"Ah, when I'm done,
"I'll prepare the tuxedo you need tonight."
(Piiip)
(Female voice) "Recorded Friday
"At 1:27 minutes past noon."
Indeed.
Perhaps the killer sensed this message,
and then ran out of the office.
Or perhaps, he has left the message expressly...
after he committed the crime to make us believe he's innocent.
What?
And now!
There is another possibility.
That the note "bring my tux" has a second meaning that we don't know about,
and that she left a message
talking about the tuxedo to disguise it.
For God's sake, it wasn't me!
Or maybe...
...the killer is someone used to wearing a tuxedo.
Yes, sir.
Well, it was this guy who says he's a model!
I did?
And what makes you think I killed him?
The model's job is to parade in all kinds of suits and uniforms, not just tuxedos.
and uniforms, not just tuxedos.
He wanted to wear a tuxedo too, and he wasn't a model.
Now, if you'll excuse us, we should search the room.
Does nothing make them wait outside?
Shinichi, have you found out anything?
It could be... that the victim added some words
to a note he had written earlier and turned it into a clue.
In this case, the specialists would have seen...
that there was a word written afterwards.
In any case, even if we add a word...
or change some letter, the sentence does not take on any new meaning.
Camel, maybe this is not the right time to ask you, but...
What happened 2 years ago?
Uh...
Don't pretend.
A moment ago, you yourself explained to them...
that you had already been to Japan two years ago.
At that time,
in Shu I was still undercover in the organization of the men in black.
You may have heard that an agent made a mistake
that prevented the FBI from being able to capture the leader of the organization.
The agent who messed up the whole operation... it turns out it was me.
-What? -Yeah, me. -Yes, me.
"On that day, two years ago, we were hiding in the warehouse...
"where the Akai had met the head of the organization."
"Suddenly, a large man appeared and sat down on a chair."
"The Akai paid no attention to him,
"But I came out of my hiding place without thinking.
"And I told him that the place was very dangerous...
"And that he couldn't stay."
(Jodie) "I get it."
(Jodie) "The old man you did outside was one of the members of the organization."
(Camel) "Yes..."
"Because of me, they found out that the Akai was an FBI agent." (Jodie) "I was a member of the organization.
"Before I had the chance"
to meet the head of the gang.
Yes.
I remember!
That operation failed,
and one of the agents who returned to headquarters...
seemed particularly disappointed.
(That's why, when the Akai told me...
"That I was the right candidate to take on this mission..."
If it's about driving, I'm the person you're looking for!
I'll take a plane to Japan!
He told me that it was a really risky mission,
but since the Akai's girlfriend died as a result of my mistake,
I was also willing to die for him.
The Akai told me...that his girlfriend was ready to die.....
and that I didn't have to worry.
You say you're... FBI?
Yes.
Tomorrow this whole thing will be over.
Donkey!
If you wanted to lie to me..., you should have done much better.
So that this... I wasn't surprised at all.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Did you already know?
If you knew, why don't you get away from me?

Can't you see I've been using you?
Akai.
You know... the answer.
(Mobile)
- (James) Akai!
Akai! - (mobile)
-Aka! - (mobile)
Don't you feel your cell phone ringing?
No, sorry.
(cell phone)
-Yes? - (Rena) "It's me."
It's... Rena Mizunashi.
Can you talk?
Is there someone beside you, now?
(Rena) Who is it?
No.
Tell me, I'm alone.
"You must be surprised that I called you...
"Just a few days after I returned to the organization."
Well... yes.
Why are you calling me?
The men in black are making my life miserable,
and I'd like to leave the organization
but I need help to get out of here.
In return, I'll give you all the information you need.
Is it okay if we meet right now, alone?
Yes.
But only if you too... are alone.
I'll send you... a message
"...with the time and place."
Okay.
-Is that okay with you? -Yes. -Yes.
Today is Friday the 13th.
I don't believe in this kind of thing, but...
it's the most appropriate day for the Akai to die.
Akai.
The call was from Rena Mizunashi, right?
Yes.
She asked me to meet her alone in a while.
Keep in mind that it may be a trap.
It would be wiser if you didn't go.
Yes.
I'm aware of that.
But supposing... it is a trap,
if I don't show up, there's a good chance they'll kill the Rena.
Don't suffer for me.
I've always boasted extraordinary intuition.
Besides, she's a CIA agent.
I'm sure she'll find a way to get ahead.
Anyway, I'll tell the Jodie to take steps to...
A... Akai!
What the hell is wrong with you?
"A message. A call for help."
"What does it all mean? Is it a trap or a cry for help?"
"What's riskier? Throw him in or leave him?"
"What's behind it all...
"It's an unexpected truth and a look full of reproach."
Don't miss the next episode!
