DETECTIVE CONAN
(TV) "They have arrested the man who hired the assassin
who killed the president of the Sarak Company."
"A bus was damaged and a girl died."
"The perpetrator of the crime is a professional assassin of unknown identity
who calls himself Fox, the Fox!"
"He is currently unaccounted for."
A terrifying journey, part one
(TV) "We are at the place where the damage from the moor bus crash is still visible
damage from the kindergarten bus accident half a year ago."
Father, a customer.
A customer!
Wake up!
Shut up!
Don't scream like a fishwife! The customer is here and he's nervous.
Sorry to come unannounced.
And now!
Ha-ha-ha...
Find the murderer and stop him from executing the murder?
I'm the head of a branch of a real estate company
that is headquartered in Kansai.
Five days ago, I had the company's medical check-up,
and instead of a stomach ulcer, I thought I had cancer!
I felt it when I eavesdropped on the doctor and nurse.
You hired an assassin to end your life?
Yes.
On Fox!
(At once) On Fox?!
But I realized my mistake too late.
I had already put myself in communication thanks to contacts,
and then it was too late to turn back.
"I had sent him his fee,
and we were communicating through the internet, with different addresses."
Now I only have the possibility of contact after a month.
As long as I am her target I cannot communicate with her.
I see what you mean!
So, trust the famous Kogoro Mouri.
But is what he says true?
Where is it, the hidden camera?
-You don't trust my word?! - Ah, yes, uh, no...
Watch out!
A rifle!
On the ground!
Damn Fox.
(Think) "He's run away?!"
There seems to be no danger.
Oh... What a scare.
What a great wallet!
Well, if it isn't....
None of your business!
(Thinking) "What's wrong with it?"
Ah, how awful.
Anyway, we'll have to call the police!
No!
Even though he's trying to kill me, I hired him to do it.
This will not stand!
I'll solve it without the police!
I'll pay for the windows too!
Suit yourself, man.
I'll take the case!
You're serious?
You do?
I, the famous Kogoro Mouri,
will catch this professional killer who calls himself Fox!
Hurray!
(Think) "Are you sure, of what you say?"
How will you catch him?
Do you realize what kind of man he is?
There will be no problem!
In fact, I imposed a condition on him!
He was to kill me during a high mountain crossing, my hobby.
On a trek? You do hiking, Mr. Ushio?
(He thinks) "If the crossing was a condition,
how do you explain this rifle thing?"
As the window is dangerous, come over here and we make plans.
It's strange.
This guy gives me a bad feeling.
"The next day, we put on our mountaineer's uniforms
and you can see us pretending to be a family of hikers."
Oh, how nice!
Au, Conan!
Tira-la!
Tira-la!
At this rate the reel will be over before we reach the end.
We'll take the picture together!
Father, pull the picture!
What the hell, we're not here to play, boys.
There you go, grumpy.
Do you understand or don't I speak clearly?!
Of course you do!
We have come to show that we are normal mountaineers, right?
Then take pictures of us, otherwise it would look suspicious.
You are right.
(Thinking) "And what else?"
"After a while, we were in the office of the natural park.

completing the necessary formalities to make a crossing."
"From there they would send a fax to the refuge with our details
so that we would find the food and facilities prepared."
Look, the refuge where we will spend the night.
It is a route for experienced people, be prepared for the worst!
I'm telling you the same thing! Don't talk to me in that tone!
Hello!
You beginners?
My name is Hirai.
I'm from the university hiking club.
We go up every year, I can be useful to you.
Yes.
Nice to meet you.
(Think) "Come on, it can be on Fox."
I'm the Ran!
He's Conan, my brother!
Nice to meet you!
And that's my father!
We come from Tokyo and I call myself Mour... Sorry, Moriyama.
My name is Ushio, from Kansai.
Come and join us.
Nice to meet you.
We can all go up together!
Ha-ha-ha!
I work in real estate.
What about you?
What's the big deal?
You don't have to do anything.
It seems to me that the weather is going to change.
I'll make a quick call to the shelter.
Daughter, this guy's behind you.
Eh?
By all accounts, Fox is left-handed.
He throws knives with his left hand.
Look at that man, please.
-You see how he's left-handed? (Kogoro) - Indeed.
Yes, grandfather?
I'll spend the night there again today.
From that, you were called Moriyama, weren't you?
Have we met somewhere else?
My name is Shingo Nose.
I'm a novelist.
Did you write 'The Case of the Mysterious Amnesia of the Beautiful Lady'?
I'm surprised to find some of my few readers here.
In Conan I also read it.
Ah... yes.
(Think) "It told of a murderer who had lost his memory."
The plot was half-baked.
(Boy) -Can we still sign up? (Girl) -sign us up, please.
"In the end we're going to be a very large group."
We don't know the way.
Can we come with you, please?
Yes, with pleasure.
"We don't know what sex it is either, that Fox."
"It may be a woman."
Sorry to keep you waiting!
My name is Kawabe.
"And we started to climb the mountain."
"How will it approach us, on Fox, in the short time it has?"
"Will it wait for an opportunity to attack, hiding in the mountain?"
"Or has he blended in among the hikers?"
"There's a very, very good chance
that someone in the group, apart from us, is at Fox."
Hey, watch out, it's slipping!
All right, up!
Hold on to the rope.
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Did you do it wrong, Mr. Ushio?
Damn, now you'll see!
But... but what's wrong?
You did it, didn't you?
You're wrong!
The rope broke by itself.
It was very old and in bad condition.
You wanted to intimidate me?!
A... I should say this.
(Think) "When I think that maybe one of the group is on Fox,
I start to see any one of them as a threat."
What an odd couple!
And that one is strange too.
He's been staring at him with crazy eyes for a while now.
He clearly resents Mr. Ushio.
Besides, he was ahead of him.
How did he happen to be here?
Hey, guys!
What's he talking about?
Watch the people?
And now, we were just chatting.
"We made the last pause
before heading down the road that would take us to the shelter."
What do you want?
Nothing... Good, that you're in good shape.
Of course I am!
With karate I have strengthened my body!
Do you want to take a blow to prove it? No.
That's not necessary.
Hey, where is he, that college boy?
Like, where?
Wasn't she there resting?
Maybe she ran away because I unmasked her.
Xxxt!
Mr. Ushio...
She ran away because you unmasked her?
Shut up!
Let's go!
(Think) "That couple... I think they're hiding too much."
Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
It's... it's awful!
Somebody come here, please!
Hurry, somebody come here!
What happened?!
A-a-there...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
There... Hirai!
(Thinking) "How can it be?!"
But why?
Why, at Hirai?
Wasn't it that guy?
You killed her, you bastard!
You wanted to throw us all away!
Dei... let me go!
Don't touch me!
Leave me alone!
We should go down without wasting time, don't you think?
Yes, it's worth more.

(Kogoro) How serious.
It seems to have died on the spot.
(Kogoro) Hey!
No volts everywhere!
This is dangerous.
A knife!
Du blood stuck!
A knife?!
What if... what if she died at Fox?
But the body I do not see stab wound.
(Think) "And this cut? Sure!"
Look at this wound.
It seems to be made with the knife!
Eh ?!
So, if the knife landed there, it means...
it means that he dodged it when he threw it at the killer,
made a false step...
and fell off the cliff.
So we have a murder!
Where the fuck were you until now?!
-With everyone.
-Bullshit!
Although I had gone ahead, I came back when I heard the screams.
I've taken that pair that are suspects.
Those, you say?!
Going with that gang will only bring us trouble!
Au, we're leaving!
Wait, wait!
We'll all go together to the shelter!
And we'll wait there until the police arrive!
What right do you have to demand this of us?
To everyone who leaves the scene of the crime,
we'll consider you the murderers.
Mr. Moriyama, you have everything under control.
What is it, your profession?
Of it... I'm... A clerk in a company, right?
Yes, that's right.
Clerk, you say?
(Thinking) "Well, it doesn't look like it."
It's raining!
(Kogoro) -Afan Contact Us (Ushio) I can't stand it!
(At the same time) Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Dry everything that's wet!
Sir, are you the guard of this shelter?
That's right.
Come in or it's getting cold.
(Sighing in relief)
That's good.
Oh, Mother... I'm knackered.
Father, and the call? Yes, you're right.
Sir, I use your phone.
Eh?
This doesn't make any kind of signal.
Listen, uh...
There was a lightning strike earlier and maybe the line went dead.
It happens often.
What a drag, and on top of that, it's nighttime.
It's very dangerous, going down at night!
Let's let it go!
And for dessert, we are the top of the Tanbara.
And there is no other shelter.
I mean, we're isolated.
I can't believe we got locked in with a killer!
A murderer?!
He killed one person in the group,
and he wanted us to believe it was an accident.
Make believe that it was an accident.
It is an indecency to dirty the mountain with acts like this!
Well... This means that there is a murderer among us.
And who knows, maybe it's you, Mr. Ushio!
What?!
What did you say?!
It must be someone who at first glance doesn't arouse suspicion.
It must be someone mysterious.
It's ridiculous!
My stomach is empty!
I want dinner!
What?
This is dinner?!
You'll have to settle.
(thinks) "Wait a minute."
Is something wrong with you? What's wrong with you?
No, nothing special.
(Think) "Why do I feel this uneasiness?"
"Something not at once. What is it?!"
What's wrong with Mr. Takanashi?
He must feel guilty.
Aaaaaaaaah!
-What on earth...?! - Yes, it's him!
No, it's not!
Aah!
Don't kill me!
You ridiculous!
Any hiker carries a mountain knife!
Well also... it's true.
Aaah!
I remember!
Mr. Moriyama, you are...
Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?!
The famous detective!
De... detective!
Don't tell me that...
He's using a fake name because he's working on some case?
Does it have to do with this murder?
Casum decena, this rain!
Let's see when it's going to stop.
We heard what the weather man.
Tell me what they are, so many secrets.
Au!
(Radio) "This morning, they have found stabbed in the village of Tanbara
Mr. Yobo Tanaka, 60 years old."
"It is possible that the suspect is in Tanbara Mountain."
"Police and volunteers comb the area..."
(Snoring)
(Thinking) "Stop it, man, I can't sleep like this!"
Watch out!
What's the matter?!
Father?!
Someone has gone out!
What's that?
Mr. Takanashi is not here!
Then it was him!
Damn him!
We won't let him escape!
Be careful.
Think that Fox is watching you.
(Man) Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
Mr. Takanashi?!
Let's go.
Aaaaaaaah!
A... help me, please!
Help me, please!
A... Aa... Help me!
Help me, please!
Help me, please...
-Be careful, Conan! -On Fox!
Wait, wait!
He looks very upset!

The... the ceiling is falling down on me...
The... the wall is getting closer and closer.
I'm scared, I'm scared...
Help me, please.
What's... What's wrong with him?
What if he suffers from claustrophobia?
Claustrophobia?
And he's out of there?
Yes.
And he's crawled in here for shelter, and then...
-So, that man... -This isn't Fox.
It's just that some land speculators tried to bury me alive.
I refused to sell my land, and...
Well, since then I can't suffer closed places...
And I couldn't stand the real estate man.
This, you could have spared yourself.
(Think) "We're still the same though,
we can't let Fox go free."
"Who, of the 4 remaining, is the murderer ?!"
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
It's the voice of the Ran!
It can't be!
The Ran is in danger!"

In Fox is one of you!
He is the murderer who has perpetrated these murders!

On Fox?!
That's right.
The identity of the murderer who has committed these murders
and the murderer who calls himself Fox is in Shingo Nose!
You are convinced ?!
-Desgraciat! -What's the matter?!
