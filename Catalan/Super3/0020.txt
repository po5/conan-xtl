"My name is Conan Edogawa."
"I used to be Shinichi, a detective,
until they made me drink a potion that made me shrink."
"Today's case happens in a haunted mansion."
"You will see that the secret is in a gloomy basement."
(Tune from "Mune ga doki doki")
DETECTIVE CONAN
The murder of the haunted house
Come on, Conan, come with us, let's go ghost hunting!
To hunt ghosts?
No way, it wouldn't solve anything, this time.
But Genta, you and me alone, what are we going to do?
May I know where this mysterious ghost is?
In a house in Quatre Street.
Fourth Street?
That's right.
The man who lived there was beaten to death.
It's a sinister mansion.
(Thinking) "Ah, yes, I remember, this case."
"It wasn't solved."
(Ayumi) After this horror the woman and her son left,
but an evil spirit lives on.
They say that in the middle of the night, they hear blood chilling screams,
and if any dog enters, the next day you find his skeleton.
Last night... I saw it... there was a wildfire.
Conan, don't you find it exciting, this?
(Mitsuhiko) It's just hearsay.
We live in a world of scientific knowledge.
This ghosts should be reserved for television.
(Mitsuhiko) What did you say?
Did you call Ayumi a liar?!
No... I just wanted to say...
All right, Mitshuhiko, then come with us
and prove to us that ghosts don't exist, do you feel me?
-If you don't come, I'll make you a cara nova... You mean I have to come?
Conan, you believe it, about the ghost, don't you?
Woman... aaah...
What?! Eh?!
Yes!
Very well... Let's go!
-Let's get out of school! -Let's go! -Yay! -Yay!
(Think) "Really?"
Go on, take away whoever you've brought.
I've brought a baseball bat to beat up the ghost.
Well, I brought food.
I've brought lots for everyone,
and a compass so we don't get lost.
What about you, Conan?!
Eh?
Who, me?
Well, nothing...
-Nothing?! - What if they assassinate you?
Yes, they will assassinate you, if you don't watch out!
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
(Think) "They think the witch's castle?"
Wow, this door does not open.
Don't suffer, that's why.
Before going to school, I came here...
and I found a secret entrance.
A secret entrance, you say?
Eh... it's here!
It's hidden by the grass,
but it seems to me that it's the only open entrance!
Genta, you're very clever!
(thinks) "A secret entrance, eh?"
Come on, Conan, hurry up!
Ah... yes.
Hey, it's open.
It's so dark I can't see anything.
(Mitsuhiko) How scary.
Why don't we go home?
Look, it's starting to rain.
We can't leave, now that we're here!
(Mitsuhiko) -If you want to, go away-there's all alone. -You're bad!
-Aaaaaaaaaah!
Thunder! -Ayumi!
Check it yourself well, Ayumi, it's just the statue of a devil.
Ecs, I slipped and got all dirty.
Alas, when I get home...
If no one lives, the floor is full of dust.
I've already found the sink.
What luck!
Eh ?
Walking like that reminds me of one of those computer role-playing games.
You're right, Genta, we're explorers!
I'm the hero of the game!
-Well, I'm the pretty warrior! -And I'm the smart wizard. -And I'm the smart wizard.
Well, I'll be...
You're the farmer, Conan!
What do you say?
Farmers don't explore.
But they are important characters.
They give us information.
It's the ideal role for you.
(Think) "They take me for a donkey."
(Think) "What's wrong with him? I hide you behind the farmer?"
Come on, go on, go ahead, farmer.
Don't be afraid, Conan.
Sure, I understand.
The wind has opened this window.
Very often people confuse things like that with the supernatural.
Mitsuhiko, you sound like a real detective!
Of course I do.
I'm going to the washroom.
Waiting for me here?
Doesn't it do something to you, going alone?
Science is on my side.
Wow, what a huge house!
They had to be rich, those who lived here.
(groans)
And now, ghosts don't exist...
in this age of scientific discoveries.
This noise was just the wind filtering through a crack.
(groans) Sure!
I'll go take a look.
(groans)
What the...?
But what is it, this noise?

The basement stairs.
The noise is coming from down here.
I'll check it out.
It does take a while, at Mitsuhiko.
It's been almost 20 minutes.
Surely he must have fallen asleep.
The noise is getting louder and louder. (groans)
(groans)
It's coming from this room! (groans)
Help!
It's Mitsuhiko's voice!
Conan, Conan, wait'ns, please!
(Thinking) "There was something at last!"
(Genta) -Hey, Mitsuhiko, where are you?!
(Ayumi) -Answer!
Mitsuhiko!
(Ayumi) -Where are you?
(Ayumi) -Where are you?
-Where the hell did she go?
-I wasn't in the washroom, Genta.
(Thinking) "That scream we heard wasn't normal."
"Something's happened to him!"
You two, you two, amagueu's-e in some room.
In the meantime, I'm going to look for him.
Stay where you are.
-Hey, Conan!
-Conan, come back...
"It's strange."
"If this house is supposed to be abandoned for 5 years,
why wasn't the water shut off?"
"And the open window in that room..."
"The room wasn't wet from the rain."
"Therefore, the window had only recently been opened."
"And the secret door, hidden behind the weeds..."
"There is someone coming in and out of here! But who and why?"
She must be worried about me, the mother?
Yes, it's true, it's already dark.
What should she do, Conan?
It takes too long.
Not these, Genta!
In Mitsuhiko must be lost somewhere and starving.
And at Conan too.
These are for them!
Eh?
Ah, you guys.
I smell food!
-It's coming back here.
-Well, I'll go check it out.
No.
Conan said not to move here.
I'll be right back.
Genta, come!
(Adult voice) Strange, no one is anywhere to be seen.
Maybe no one lives here.
What?
A photo.
It's a photo of the owner of this house, the one who was murdered.
This one must be his wife and the other his son.
They didn't manage to discover the murderer
and it is seen that their family left.
(Scream)
It was the voice of Genta.
Oh, my God!
I told them to hide.
Ge-Genta, where are you?
Where are you?
What's the matter, Genta?
Oh, Genta at last... Oh, you've scared me bad.
It's not Genta's footsteps...
Who is it?
Who is it?!
Conan, it's you!
Xxxxxt!
Shut up and don't shout!
Come again!
A... a ghost!
No, take a good look, it's human.
He's carrying something.
But where the hell is he going?
Conan, wait.
It's disappeared!
No room, and this is a dead end.
Where the hell did he go?
I told you, it was a ghost!
(thinks) "There are footprints in the dust."
"Wait a minute, maybe..."
Look, it's a trap!
That person has come down here.
(Thinks) "It doesn't move with the strength of a child."
"I've got it!"
These are real stretchy elastics.
They stretch or shrink at the touch of a button.
They can be useful for picking up a criminal!
I'll try it on.
And what does it do, exactly?
Just take a good look.
Wow, it's fantastic!
The basement stairs.
Maybe Mitsuhiko and Genta are down here!
Look, a light.
A cage.
What the hell is it doing, this, here?
Look.
There's someone inside.
In the bed at the back!
Geez, what happened to him?!
(footsteps)
Someone is coming.
Poor thing, another nightmare.
Don't suffer, I'm already here.
Come on, it's been 5 years since that happened.
Don't think, my son.
Akio, you should forget.
The dead won't come back to life.
(Think) "The dead."
"What if I were to speak of the murdered owner of this house?"
"This means that these two are..."
It has, it is better than you eat.
I didn't want this to happen.
There's no way I closed you here to make you suffer.
Akio, I did it with your future in mind.
"Sure, now I understand!"
"I've solved the mystery of this mansion and the murder!"
The two mice I caught snooping around weren't supposed to be alone.
Come on, come out.
It's no use hiding.
Come out!
"It's useless to hide, eh?"
You're right, but this is also for you, madam!
I found something important in the study:

a photo of you and your husband, murdered 5 years ago!
And besides you, in the photo,
although he has been living in a cell for 5 years, there is your son.
It is the man who is closed!
The mole under the eye does not deceive.
I knew there was something smelling here.
Supposedly, after the murder,
the victim's family left
and figured the house was uninhabited.
But I was shocked that there was water coming out of the taps.
You don't pay water bills for an uninhabited building.
And there was something else, too: the secret entrance.
Compared to the rest of the wall, that door is new.
It was probably installed after the murder,
to get in and out without anyone seeing it.
But why did he have to make it look like no one lived here?
And why does she keep her poor son in a cage?
I found the answers when I heard her speak.
Who are you?
Who the hell are you?
Conan Edogawa!
A detective!
A... detective?
From these circumstances, two conclusions can be drawn.
That you killed your husband
and are keeping your son here incarcerated because he witnessed it.
Or, that the person who killed your husband, was your son!
And as a mother you wanted to protect him by hiding the truth in the basement.
But the crime was too hard a burden to bear.
The strange noises that the people felt in this house
would be his cries of anguish.
Surely he wanted to turn himself in to the police, didn't he?
But you didn't consent.
Try to understand!
Son, this is all for your own good!
You didn't want him to plead guilty in any way,
and you decided to take him away from the world.
Judging by your conversation,
I can deduce that the one who murdered your husband was...
No, don't say it... please be quiet!
Be quiet!
Mother, please don't.
The boy is right.
Yes, it was me.
I killed him, my father!
Eh... A-Akio!
It was a spring 5 years ago.
I'm going to fail the college entrance exam for the third time.
What?
You failed again?!
Akio, you're a disgrace to the family!
You're useless!
You're just useless!
"I was already very depressed...
and those harsh words made me lose control."
Akio!
"When I realized,
I had a bloody candlestick in my hand."
"And my father's body, lying there on the ground."
Don't worry, the mother will protect you from everything, my son...
The rest is just as you have described.
The mother made it look like it had been a robbery,
and shut me up.
But I no longer want to live harassed by these nightmares!
I want to pay for the crime I committed and live in peace!
Don't talk nonsense!
Wait until the statute of limitations has expired!
No one has to know if you don't confess!
You're right, the police will never know if it stays closed here.
But you'll never get rid of this guilt.
Madam, will you allow your son to carry this burden forever?
"The night of fear was over and the sun was shining on the house."
"A on Genta and Mitsuhiko, we found them sleeping outside."
"The woman, having caught them, had anesthetized them
and left them outside."
"The Aiko and her mother turned themselves in to the police."
"At the end of 5 years, an unsolved mystery was solved."
"And evidently, we,
our parents nailed us with a scary scandal."
"Gee, how I wish I had my old body back."
(Tune from "Step by Step")
DETECTIVE CONAN
What a gosh ?!
Another haunted house?
Yes, Ayumi has discovered it again.
It's the Etou house on 2nd street.
Etou?
The neighbors have told me that it's full of strange books
and that the boy who lived there was eaten by a monster!
(Think) "A mansion full of strange books,
a boy who lives alone, on street two, Etou..."
Are you sure it's the "Etou" house?
Yes.
The "E" is in katakana and the "Soft" is a Chinese character.
Wow.
All right guys, come on, I'll see you after school.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Hey, wait a minute!
It's not "Etou", it's "Kudoh".
It's my house!
-See you later! -See you later!
It's death!
Call the police!
It's the knife they used during the filming.

The killer is someone from the movie.
Yes, it must be!
Now I know, I've solved the case!
The next case is better than a TV drama.
The watchdog.
