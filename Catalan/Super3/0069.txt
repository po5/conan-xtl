DETECTIVE CONAN
"La Ran, Kogoro and I have gone to make the mystery tour
instead of Professor Agasa and some friends of his."
"It's a hotel stay and it's about solving a mystery."
"The promoter of the trip is posing as a participant
and disguises himself as a man of the night and leaves mysteries to be solved."
"Whoever discovers his identity will get paid accommodation
and will be given a diskette with a special program."
"While I am alone on the balcony,
the baron of the night throws me a discalabro and I hit the pool!"
"Is this a warning, this? Or is it part of the game?"
"Suddenly, the man of the night falls on top of a bronze statue!"
The mystery of the murder of the baron of the night, part two.
(Think) "A masked man?"
(Murmurs)
"I knew it!"
"It is the male of the night, what has fallen!"
Hey, Conan!
Hey, Conan!
Child!
Oh, I'm so sorry!
Aren't you that boy who lives with Kogoro Mouri?
It's not done, that!
I'm very sorry, sir.
Aren't you the Ran, you?
Eh?
Yes.
And you must be Inspector Yokomizo, from Saitama.
Yes. What are you doing here?
It's just that I was transferred here last month and now... Eh?
What are you doing?
Mr. Ebara?!
Do you know this man?
Do you know him?
Yes... He's one of the participants of the mystery tour.
(Inspector) The mystery tour?
(thinks) "The gloves! He's only wearing one."
"Eh?"
(Inspector) A trip to discover the identity of the promoter,
who is disguised as a man of the night.
This means the promoter was Mr. Ebara.
A suicide, an accident?
or could it be...?
By the way, where is Mr. Mouri?
Well, it's that... (woman) It's the bar on the second floor.
Mrs. Kamijo!
Take him.
I'd like to discuss this case with him.
Yes.
Conan, let's go!
Hey, wait for me!
(thinks) "Tears?!"
(snoring)
(Snoring) Again!
The father is totally drunk!
Oh, yeah, yeah...
Mr.
Ebara has killed and was dressed as a man?
Yes, exactly, Mr. Mouri!
According to witnesses, he fell at 10 o'clock.
-Let's see the mans... -Aaa... What is it, Mr. Mouri?
At 10 o'clock, he says.
-What's the matter? -What's up, it's late!
Have you already gone to look at your room?
It's 2101.
Yes, we tried to get in but we couldn't open it.
Come on, more complications.
You've got the deadbolt on.
Open the door.
All right, it's open!
-What are you doing, these clothes, here? -It's the one he was wearing tonight. -It's the one he was wearing tonight.
He dropped the room key.
By the way, Mr.
Ebara was drunk.
-The balcony is open.
-He must have gone out on the balcony.
Aaaah!
It seems to me that Mr. Ebara must have fallen from here.
-Be careful, Mr. Mouri! -What horror.
It was an accidental death.
An accident?!
I'm sure of it!
Look, a glove stuck to the railing.
What?!
Yokomizo, it must have gone like this:
I wanted to go down in the room below to give them a scare,
and then, he slipped and fell.
I don't know... Eh?
This is the 21st floor.
I don't think he would have tried to go down without a rope.
Besides, didn't he leave the key in the room?
He wouldn't have been able to get back into the room without the key.
I don't think it was an accident.
You stay out of this!
Hey, my pen, it's falling!
Inspector Yokomizo, I want to take a look at the body.
Yes, I agree.
But I doubt I'll change my mind.
Gee, that's not bad.
Yes, he fell and got nailed to this statue here.
They didn't let anybody near the body, did they?
No, sir, they haven't.
Apart from the police, only that child has touched it.
(thinks) "That little boy again."

What are you doing, Conan?
Well, I'm looking for the feather I dropped.
Is it true that Mr. Ebara has fallen and killed himself?
There is no doubt about it!
Poor Mr. Ebara has died.
He was wearing a mask.
What mask?
A mask?
Well, this means that the man and promoter of this trip was him.
I knew it.
I suspected it all along.
Shut up.
This is not the time.
I wouldn't have imagined that the immortal male of the night would die like this.
Who are you, all these people, Mr. Mouri?
We're from Izu's mysterious journey.
But how did you...?
Don't worry, it was an accident.
An accident?
He wanted to scare us and fell from the balcony.
Ha-ha-ha!
The most important thing is that the man of the night is dead.
We can go now.
Look at this!
It's strange, what's wrong with the tie?
Look at the knot in it.
The knot?
Upside down.
It's upside down.
Maybe he was in the habit of doing it that way.
I got a tie from him.
What?
Look!
Where did you get it?
A waitress gave it to me.
Mr. Ebara had neglected it.
You're right, the knot of this tie is normal.
Mirin.
Have you found something else?
The belt is also wrong.
Look at it!
The buckle is upside down.
It would be very eccentric.
There's a lot of things that don't match.
Yes... The victim is not dressed...
she was dressed by someone else.
The real man killed her.
He threw her from the terrace of the 21st floor.
The real night baron, the murderer, is someone from the group!
We will have to check what alibis they have
to justify what they were doing at 10 o'clock, when the victim fell.
We need a room for interrogations.
What do I do with the corpse and the clothes?
We'll ask them to let us put him in one of the hotel rooms.
Yes, sir.
So it was the observation deck with Ran and Conan.
Yes, it was after 10 o'clock when I left.
It's true, Father!
But, Mr. Maeda, it was you who checked the time, wasn't it?
Well, yes...
Thank you very much.
Come on, let the next one come in.
My alibi is perfect.
I was at the bar with this gentleman having an unforgettable time...
weren't I, detective me?
You're... you're right.
But he wasn't too drunk, was he?
-Well, but I... -All right, next!
We were both in the hotel restaurant at that time.
-Weren't we, Shizue? -Yes, weren't we, Shizue? -Yes, that's right, sir.
Do you have any witnesses?
I wouldn't know what to tell you, Mr. Mouri,
with so much commotion, I don't know if anyone will remember us.
It's normal to be shocked when a person dies like that.
Let the next one pass.
I have not moved from the room since 3/4 of 10.
I have read the mail messages from the computer.
You can look at the hotel records.
During this time you have not spoken to anyone?
Of course I have.
With my computer.
Oh, my goodness!
Very good.
Next, come on.
You haven't moved from your room?
No.
Until he has not returned in Satoru I've been watching TV.
You have no witnesses.
No one can confirm that.
No, but I can tell you what the film was about.
That's not enough.
This wouldn't be an alibi.
Gee, that's tough luck!
I had to guard the corpse alone!
I hope the interrogation will be over soon.
I'm so angry!
What do they think, the inspector and your father?
They think I'm guilty.
No, woman...
There are many others who are more suspicious!
(Thinking) "Sure there are."
(Knock at the door)
Are you coming to relieve me?
Who is there?
"All the participants have an inconsistent alibi."
You didn't bring anything to eat in the room?
No.
I would have told you.
"As you have done, the murderer, to get out of the room
after throwing Mr.
Ebara's misadventure?"
"There was the deadbolt on."
All I know is that the killer is still somewhere in the hotel."
Did you call the front desk?!
Yes, because they'll wake me up tomorrow.
At what time?
Around 10:00.
The hotel boards record the calls.
The Akiko's alibi... eh?
Akiko!
That's it!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

(Think) "The male of the night!"
The male of the night?
It can't be!
Stand back!
Quiet!
Ran, don't just stand there!
He's running away!
Come on, Ran!
Hurry up!
(Kogoro) What?
He's shown up?!
You're a fool!
Why didn't you catch him?
Sorry, I was caught off guard.
-Inspector Yokomizo!
-What's the matter?
We found it next to the corpse!
It seems to have been stunned!
What?!
And the corpse?!
It's there, but the male disguise is missing.
-The costume? -Mr.
Mouri...
-Inspector! -What's the matter?
The male is in the pool.
The mask, the hat, the wig and the cape.
-And where is it, the corpse? -I don't know, Mr. Mouri.
(He thinks) "He must have thrown the disguise from the balcony."
"What was he doing at the elevator door in these clothes?"
"He could have gone down the stairs, so no one would have seen him."
"And why did he have to disguise himself?"
"He risks a lot, stealing these clothes."
"He has very strange methods."
"Maybe his actions weren't planned."
Very well.
We'll repeat the interrogations.
Bring in all suspects!
They were all in his room and have no witnesses.
They don't have an alibi
for the time they attacked Akiko, Ran and Conan.
Just a moment, Inspector Yokomizo!
You told us to stay in the room.
We were only carrying out your orders.
We wouldn't dare disobey the police.
We're not that stupid.
You and Mr. Maeda share a room.
Have you checked if he was there?
You didn't have time!
When we found the boy, we came here.
Yes.
Anyway, we searched all your rooms.
We'll start with Mr. Maeda's.
It's heavy.
There doesn't seem to be anything suspicious.
What the fuck are you doing?! I want to get some air.
My God, what's he like, this kid!
(Inspector) Show me what you're carrying.
(Thinking) "I understand the layout of the rooms."
"Mr. Ebara has fallen from that balcony."
"Yes, it went like this."
"The murderer disguised her as a man and threw her off the balcony
in such a way that it looked like an accident."
"But there was the latch, on Mr. Ebara's door."
"The murderer could not get out of the door, afterwards."
"It all happened in a locked room."
"The murderer could only have fled over the balcony."
"But it's impossible to jump from there to that room."
(Inspector) Why is it, this medicine?
They're sleeping pills.
I always carry them in my pocket.
I want to see them.
(Inspector) Let's go to the next room.
You can search, but you won't find anything important, officers!
We have to make sure.
That little boy again!
(Think) "The balcony where he fell from is right above this one."
Why the hell are you following us?!
Because I like to see how a master like you works.
Do you really?
You could have told me earlier.
(thinks) "No broken glass."
(This kid's got virtues.
Hey, do you always keep that door closed, that door?
I do not know.
You see I'm blind.
Tell him, Shizue.
Evidently, I always lock it before I leave, sir.
We'll go to Mr. Konno's room.
Mr. Konno's room.
He-he-he.
Now you're talking about Mr.
Konno.
He was accused of using the computer at the bank where he worked
to steal money.
Maybe for this reason he wanted to meet the male of the night.
-What? -Well, it was just a rumor, sir.
That's what that old man said?
Yes.
What a face he has, old Genichiro!
He had every reason to hate the man.
-Why does he say so? -Because it's true. -Because it's true.
A virus killed his beloved son.
Didn't they know, this?
(Think) "The old man said..."
The male of the night is a name that brings back memories.
Of a son of mine who died.
-He died of a disease? -What's it got to do with the boy?
-I have no idea. Are you kidding?
Mr. Mouri!
Don't, please!
Let me go!
I'll give you valuable information!
"This window is the closest to that balcony,
but it's impossible to jump from there."
Mrs. Kamijo?

Yes, they had been married.
But they divorced 3 years ago.
That's right!
In Tokyo Ebara had been my husband,
but 3 years ago, I found out he was a hacker!
A hacker?
That's right!
A criminal who steals data from other computers!
People who work in the computer world hate them.
Honestly, I'm glad that in Tokyo he is dead.
Now I remember.
The Akiko's older brother ran a small software company.
She might have had a motive to kill him, too.
You see?
All of us who came here have some motive to murder him, right?
"What is this?"
"The same medicine as the Akiko. This means they're also for..."
What are they for, these pills?
Hey, don't touch my stuff!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Is it for colds? Yes.
I thought they were for sleeping.
Stop it!
What t'empatolles, you?
Children should already be to sleep, at this hour, understood?!
(Think) "I have not inspected the room!"
"It's the same, the distribution must be like that of Mr. Konno,
which is the floor below."
"If I enter the position of all the rooms ?
the only possibility is that I have jumped from the balcony of the Ebara
to Mr. Kaneshiro's and Mrs. Kaneshiro's.
Kaneshiro's and Mrs.
Hayashi's."
-What shall we do with this? -I don't know, it's a piece of doorknocker.
"The Ebara's room is on this floor."
There's something on the end.
It's adhesive tape.
(thinks) "Wait a minute! Surely this is..."

(Thinks) "He has dodged."
"He has dodged my punch."
"So quickly... and without unnecessary movements."
"There is only one person."
"He's the only person in the group who can do it!"
"I don't know what to do."
"What should I do? Help me Sinichi!"
(Knock on the door)
Come on!
Open the door, Ran!
Conan, what's wrong?
There was the safety latch, wasn't there? I hadn't put it on.
(thinks) "The experiment has been a success!"
Were you crying?
Of course not.
I made a yawn...
I'm leaving again.
At this hour? I'll be right back.
There's that boy again.
You should be in bed.
Come on, don't be a pain.
(thinks) "He could have killed anyone, with that trick."
"I'll go back to check everyone's alibis."
Did they tell you, about Misawa?
Yes, they stunned him while he was guarding the corpse.
Isn't he a good karateka, Misawa?
Yes, the best in the station.
It seems impossible that she was stunned.
(Thinking) "Hey, wait a minute!"
"The killer is..."
But what's going on here, Conan?
Who set the safety lock?
I set it, from the outside!
It worked!
The room is locked and it looks like an accidental death.
Of course it is!
I already have his alibi!
(thinks) "Wait a minute!"
"The wind would just blow..."

The case of the murder of the night baron, denouement
