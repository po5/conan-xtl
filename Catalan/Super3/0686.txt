Wait!
Candy, wait!
Candy!
(Vehicle: starts up)
Ah!
Wait, where are you going?
Candy...
"Of love and crime there are always: they repeat themselves every day."
"A delivery van is carrying a time bomb."
"The countdown begins for the Junior Detective League."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a kid, but he's got the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The van carrying a time bomb."
What time does it close, Beika's library?
Will we make it on time?
(Mao) Ayumi!
Candy is in danger!
But, Mao, what happened?
-It's Mao.
-Who is she, this girl?
If I'm not mistaken, she's a neighbor of the Ayumi.
What?
The Candy has put in the delivery van that has gone?
Yes, Ayumi, and now I don't know what I can do to find her.
Don't suffer!
We, the members of the Junior Detective League, will find her!
Don't worry, we'll save her!
Yes!
-Yes, let's go!
-Come on, Mao!
Hey, this isn't a case for the Detective League.
We've got work to do.
-Candy!
-Candy!
Look, isn't that that van?
-Yeah, it's got a fox on it!
-Is it?
It's the FOX messengers.
-Candy, are you here?
Where have you been?
-Candy!
Come on, get up!
-Candy!
-Candy, where are you?
-What's going on here?
-Guys, what are you doing?
Hi, Conan.
Agent Chiba?
He's not here.
Then it must be in another van.
-Don't worry, we'll find her soon. -Candy...
-Candy...
We, the Junior Detective League, will help you, won't we?
-Of course, Ayumi!
-Count on us!
Eh?
By the way, Agent Chiba...
Something happened, maybe?
What's up?
Well... no...
(Takagi) Hey, Chiba!
There's nothing there.
Not here either?
(Takagi) Ah.
Co... Conan!
What?
Are you working on a case?
Yeah, sort of.
Listen, uh...
This is dangerous for the kids, you'd better go home.
I've just been told they've stopped one in sector 3. Let's go.
All right, let's go.
-Goodbye.
Good morning. Good morning.
-Let's go.
(Shinichi voice) Yes.
There's something going on here...
(Conan's voice) Guys, wait for me here for a moment.
-Oh, you're leaving too?
-Wait, Conan!
What a face!
Of it... Hello.
Is that you, Ran?
"Hello?"
Yes.
What's wrong, Conan?
Hey, what's your father doing now?
I'll look at him, wait a second...
Come on... One more drink.
It can't be... What have you done, father?!
Please...
(thinks) "He-he-he. I thought so."
Don't worry, Ran, it was nothing important.
I'll see you around.
Goodbye, Ran.
Inspector Megure, say.
(Phone)
Ah, it's you...
"Inspector, it's Mouri."
Hey, I'm a little busy right now.
"With the case of a delivery van?"
What are you saying?
Who told you about it?
(Kogoro voice) I happened to see
Inspector Takagi and Chiba investigating.
What kind of case is it?
(Kogoro voice) "I get it."
Look, I can't...
"If I can help in any way, please let me know."
"Inspector?"
Listen, Mouri, the truth is this noon...
there have been two explosions in a row.
What?
Really?
"The first victim, in Kozo Tonomura,
is a district court judge."
"The second was Kazuhiko Saeki, a prosecutor."
"Both victims have suffered serious injuries,
but their lives are not in danger."
"In both cases they have received a package from a courier service."

"Thanks to the fingerprints
found on the remains of the first bomb,
"It has been possible to identify the perpetrator, a man named Masato Utsugi,
who until a month ago was serving time in prison."
"He has been arrested for violation of the explosives control law."
"He intended to take revenge on those who had accused and convicted her."
"The Utsugi has stated that he has sent a third bomb
to a policeman who had arrested him on a previous occasion."
I get it.
That's why they check the delivery vans.
Yes, but it turns out there's a problem.
Inspector Megure!
We've confirmed that former Inspector Kaneko is safe and sound.
Apparently, the bomb hasn't reached him yet.
That's good.
If we go by what Masato Utsugi said at Masato Utsugi,
the bomb is scheduled to go off at 4:00 in the afternoon.
We still have an hour and a half left.
Inspector!
We have just received a reply from FOX courier company.
According to the shipping record,
delivery is scheduled for today
between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
And do we know where the bomb is now?
The company is trying to contact the delivery van.
We have asked the bomb squad to be on alert.
When we locate it, they'll be on their way.
Roger that.
I hope we can get there in time.
(Phone)
Yes, hello?
But how is it possible?
That they have stolen the van?
What are you saying?
I'm van number 4.
Eh?
A bom...?
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Give me the key, come on!
(Takagi) Kingo Ebisawa, 28 years old.
Ginji Kaniyama, 25 years old.
Both have priors for robbery.
Today, shortly before noon,
they broke into Marukane Loans and made off with 1 million yen.
The security camera footage
and the description given by the driver match.
Mmm.
Marukane Loans... Wasn't it...?
Yeah, it's from that crooked loan shark Beika.
But why was the delivery van stolen?
Apparently, the car they were fleeing with had broken down.
They found it abandoned nearby, with the keys in the ignition.
Maybe they did it to intercept the police radio.
Curiously, the car they abandoned also had a radio.
Of course, that's why they stole the van,
to gain access to the radio.
Yeah, and they probably don't know there's a bomb inside.
Oh.
That's bad luck, that!
We're doing everything we can.
However, even though we still don't know...
where the delivery van is located.
Understood.
By the way, where has it been stolen, the van?
"Well... in zone 3 of Beika district."
All right, okay.
If I find out anything related to the case,
I'll let you know right away.
I'll see you.
"Thank you!"
Don't tell me it's that van.
(Shinichi voice) Yes, it's very likely.
Hey, Conan!
How much longer do we have to wait?
In the end, do you want us to go look for Candy or not?
Please, we have to help her.
(Conan voice) Calm down, of course we'll look for her!
Hey, Mao, where was the van when Candy got in?
(Radio: man)
(Radio: male) "Police headquarters in all units."
"Investigate the area where the thieves' car was found."
We have succeeded!
So we can fool the police and get away without any trouble.
Yes, Ginji.
It's been good for us that you're such a good mechanic.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
- (wheels: squeak)
- (candy: squeaks)
-Ha-ha-ha!
How cute!
-Count...
(Mao) Here!
This is where Candy got into the van!
Then she turned right away and you lost sight of her, didn't you?
Yes.
(Genta) Listen, what's the use of coming back here again?
Surely by now the van must be far away.
(Ay) At least we can get an idea of where it might have gone.
Yes.
(Ouch.) Huh?
Really?
On the right is an oncoming street.
The one on the left is under construction and you can't go through.
The rest of the side alleys
are too narrow for a van to pass.
Which must have gone straight down!
This means...
-All right!
Let's run, hurry!
-Exactly!
(Car: horn)
(Mitsuhiko) How nice!
The cars are stuck in a traffic jam.

Maybe we can still find the van and everything!
Gee, which way... must have turned?
(Ayumi) To the right?
To the left?
Which way should we go?
(Thinking) "If we take into account the psychological state of the fugitives,
"It's unlikely that they would decide to go through the traffic jam
to go the other way..."
It fits here.
-Hurry, hurry!
-Please don't run so fast, Ay!
"You're right, Ay. Just in case..."
Hello.
Doctor?
Damn it!
Isn't there any way out of this jam?
Come on, come on!
Hey, Kingo, could you stop at a supermarket?
The dog and I are very hungry.
What the hell is wrong with him?
Not this!
I didn't know they sent dogs by courier.
But they forgot to put the address.
Where they send you, huh?
He-he-he-he!
It was a joke.
Flights stop!
And do something about this navigator, it doesn't work!
Do you know that this thing could help the police to find us?
It might even tell them where we are right now.
You sure about that?
I think I saw it in a movie or something?
That's why when we went upstairs I switched it off.
Ah.
Oh, geez!
Good thinking.
I see them!
It's 300 meters from here!
-They won't get away from us.
-So we've got them!
Candy!
-It can't be!
-They're leaving!
-Candy!
-Now that we had almost caught them!
-What a rage!
-I don't see them!
-Candy...
-We almost had them...
- (car: horn)
-Maó, are you all right?
-Doctor Agasa!
-Sorry I'm late.
Eagerness, doctor!
You always so timely!
Right!
Which way... do I have to pull?
-Where did they go?
-They're not here.
It's possible they took another alley.
What?
If so, it will be impossible to find them!
What do we do now?
It's scheduled to go off at 4 o'clock, right?
We only have 40 minutes left.
-A bomb?
-What? -What?
Oh, wow.
They didn't know about it, did they?
You already said so.
What do you mean by that?
I guess we'll have to explain them now.
Yes.
It turns out that...
(All) A time bomb will go off at 4?!
Candy!
What will happen to Candy?!
Oysters!
And what have you been doing, the police, until now?
If they have the license plate,
why don't they chase them, or cut the streets?
What about the radio?
Why don't they try to contact them
and tell them that it's dangerous, that there's a bomb in the van?
I'm sure they are doing what they can.
The truth is that it must be very difficult to know exactly
which of the many FOX courier vans that are driving around the city
that are driving around the city is the one carrying the bomb.
Also, it looks like the fugitives were listening to the police radio.
If they set up a roadblock or contact them by radio,
they could abandon the van and it would be even worse.
-Candy... Candy...
-What should we do, then?
Sorry to keep you waiting, doggy.
-Can we take him?
-Oh!
How cute!
What, doggy?
You want to go with them?
Hey, Ginji, let's go or what?!
Come on, just a little while longer.
Wow!
"Yes! I got it!"
I'm going out for a moment, you guys wait for me here!
Doctor, be ready so we can leave right away!
-But, Conan...
-All right!
-What are you going to do?
-Hey, Conan!
Soc in Mouri!
"Inspector Megure!"
Inspector, if I remember correctly,
you said the criminals had access to the police radio.
Yes, we think that's most likely.
In this case, I ask you to do exactly what I will now tell you.
I'm listening.
Are you sure?
But... but what you're saying...
All right, people.
Get me the communications control center!
And also Takagi and Chiba!
Okay, Inspector!
Seriously FOX courier salary, you two?
How come I'm not in uniform?
The one with the fox.
Ginji, come on, let's go!
You're a mess!
If those kids call the police, you'll see.
Kingo, listen, running like that,
then don't be surprised if you get pulled over for speeding.
What?
Yeah, right... You're absolutely right.
(Radio: male) "Control center at all units."
"Set up checkpoints in the following areas:

From the intersection of Kurinishi Inner Circular Route 3...."
-Yes!
The map!
The map!
-Did you feel it, Kingo?
"Repeat, establish checkpoints..."
Ugh, this doesn't look good!
This way we'll end up at a checkpoint.
What's that?
Fuck!
"...at the Tanmondai Mae intersection."
Yeah... if you go there, you'll find another checkpoint!
(Kingo) Let me know ahead of time!
(Ginji) Switch to here.
Then left and right!
(Kingo) Next to the right.
No, to the left!
-Next one, next one to the left!
-(Kingo) Clear it up!
(Kingo) Okay!
(Ginji) Ha-ha-ha!
We finally made it!
We've avoided the checkpoints!
Hurray!
-Candy!
-It's here!
-I expected nothing less from you!
-We've got them!
How did you do it, Conan?
I've told Mr. Kogoro to ask Inspector Megure
to give false information about the controls.
Yes, that's right.
You made it look like the only way out was this side street...
and directed them here.
Just the wood!
(PA: Chiba) "FOX courier van, stop!"
(Ginji) Ha-ha-ha!
Hold on!
Watch out!
So long!
(Ginji) No... it's gone.
It's gone!
It's gone, it's gone... The bomb is still in the van!
-Candy!
-Candy! -What?
Open the trunk, doctor!
Hurry up!
Only 12 minutes left!
This one's not...
He's not here either.
Hello!
You must be Candy.
Eh?
Hey, hey!
You, uncle, what are you doing?
I got it!
"Gee, there's not much time left."
"But I can't throw it in an inhabited place."
Listen very carefully!
I must be taken immediately to an open space where there are no people.
What?
A bomb?
This is a bomb!
(Kingo) And what else, man!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-All right, Kingo!
-Go, do it outside!
It's the truth!
This van has already delivered two bombs, and there have been wounded!
There's still this one left, and it won't be long before it explodes!
Nano, hold on tight wherever you can!
Ginji, the map!
Yes, right away!
There's no open space, not even one that's close by...
Two minutes to go!
Let's see?
Yes, I know!
Where are they?
Where did they go?
They are there!
Go over there!
Shit!
Where the hell have they gone?
Only one minute left!
Time's running out!
Don't give up!
-Where are they?
-20 seconds left!
10 seconds to go!
They're there!
Three, two, one...
-It's too late.
-It can't be...
Ah!
Ah...
What luck!
Ugh!
It's been a bit short.
Stop, don't lick me...
Yes, look how pretty she is.
Candy!
Candy!
The Junior Detective League has done it again!

"Mouri, you've been fantastic, as expected!"
Yes!
As expected, I can't drink anymore!
Father!
Let's see if you'll get up at once!
Eh?
He was killed last year in an accident.
Gee, that's nice!
Thank you.
That day the father told me he was coming to see you.
I'm sick of saying I didn't see him.
It's just that tonight I saw him...
The ghost of the mayor.
