Is this the famous cactus?
(Male) It is a cactus called "mother-in-law cushion",
it can take up to 50 years to flower.
Yes.
Blow, 50 years?
I have taken care of this cactus since it was like this when I was little.
After many years it has grown to be this big
and even bloomed for the first time.
This means that you started taking care of it
when it was about the same size as the Ran!
Yes, that's right, my boy.
Sonoko, you came to see it with your father a few years ago.
Really?
Well, I don't remember.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
No wonder you don't remember, you must have been only two or three years old.
Yes?
Oh, my goodness!
By the way, where are those special flowers you were telling us about before?
-Huh?
-Look, they're over there.
Those yellow flowers surrounded by spikes.
Wow!
How beautiful!
They're on top of everything.
Mm... Yeah, I guess so.
(Thinking) "It's true."
"Summer memories are so vivid
that they stand the test of time and solve mysteries."
"In a greenhouse protected with an alarm
there are very valuable cacti and they prick a lot."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The rhapsody of the cactus."
(Sonoko) But what a lot of cactus you have, here!
I suppose there must be some very valuable ones.
Aren't you worried about thieves?
No, because I had a special alarm installed.
At night I'm the only one who can deactivate it,
using this electronic card.
It's a bit like the subway card, isn't it?
B-but... why do you keep it in your pocket?
I keep all the important things here, it's the safest place.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
- (boy) Father!
- (door, open)
What are you doing here?
The lawyer called us!
What are you doing here?
And he told us that you've changed the will!
Quiet, please!
I have guests.
You shut up!
And tell us what's going on!
Now I don't want to talk!
Get out of here.
You'll make my cactus wither!
Leave it, Yasuyuki, we'll talk later.
Yes... Later we want you to tell us, understand?
Damn it!
As I was saying, the mother-in-law's cushion has finally bloomed, but...
Mm?
Misa!
- (woman) Yes, I'm coming!
-Misa, where have you been?
Hello, Mr. Sunada.
What's wrong?
What the fuck is this?
I told you I didn't want unvarnished pots here!
-I'm very sorry.
-Take them out right now!
"What character."
Excuse me...
Perhaps we have come at a bad time.
As a young man he was known by the name of ZENZA the Ogre.
He was a very aggressive car salesman.
(Sunada) Oh, how violent.
I know I booed him, but Misa is a good housekeeper.
-Oh, really?
Really?
-Moreover, she cooks wonderfully well! -She's completely different from my two sons.
It's completely different from my two sons.
Well, I'm going home.
If you want you can stay and look at everything calmly.
Thank you! (door, open)
- (door, open)
- (Sunada) But what are you doing?
(Sunada) Oh.
Pa... father.
I just asked you what you're doing here.
What do you think?
Too bad, because what you're looking for is here.
So it's true that you don't plan to leave the inheritance to us, is it?
I've decided to give it all to the Botanical Garden, along with the cacti.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-What... what did you say?
You didn't expect it at all, did you?
You'd rather give your money to your cacti than to your children?
Of course I would.
Professional golfer, and what else!
All you do is live at my expense,
and I won't give you any more money!
What's that?
He offered us to come and see the flowers, but they are a small word.

I don't agree.
It's not that big a deal, is it?
We got to see something very rare, and we should be grateful.
Uh... So... what could it be?
Isn't it a hot water radiator?
It must be to keep the temperature constant.
Ah, yes, I know, I know!
The temperature is controlled by it.
Gee, Sonoko, you got burned?
Oh, how creamy!
What should I do to convince you to keep the original will?
Ah.
I'll revoke this one if you agree to run my business!
Are you telling me to give up golf for good?
You're a mediocre golfer, you always get knocked out.
How dare you tell me to give it all up...?
You're the one who said it!
All right, you guys.
I'll do whatever I want!
-Huh?
Well, I'll...
-Naoki, what are you doing here?
I'm sure you've come to ask your father for money, as usual.
Just like you!
You've come to hide from me, but you won't get it!
-Please stop it!
-What are you saying?
They are in front of your father's room!
-Will you shut up?!
-Who cares?
It's been a long time since I've seen you
and when you come all you know how to do is talk about money!
It's not true, I was worried about you and I came.
You're a liar!
I've already been told that the import car dealership you've opened up
you've opened is making losses!
Worried?
And what else?!
It's no use flattering her to win her favor.
All she thinks about is her ridiculous cacti.
(Flow) Hey, now it's useless to argue with him...
Let him calm down and we'll convince him tonight.
Hello!
Here we are!
Ah... After seeing those plants, I suddenly got hungry.
"Really? Between flowers and cake, we always know what you're going to choose."
Ah!
Conan!
Ah...!
What are you doing?
Did you hurt yourself?
Look at that...
I'm sorry.
We're very sorry.
Oh.
Huh?
This is yours.
Ah, thank you.
Miss Yashiro.
Hello.
Please bring me dinner in the room.
Yes, I'll do that.
Yasuyuki has changed a lot.
And now I don't like him at all.
(Sonoko) Snort, how fed up I am!
My belly is full!
Sonoko, you've eaten too much.
I kept repeating.
I couldn't help it.
When you like something you can't control yourself.
-Yes?
- (Yasuyuki) Miss Yashiro?
I'm going out.
I'm going to play golf for a while.
I'm going to take a look at the car I left in the garage.
See you later.
Miss Yashiro, thank you for dinner.
Everything was delicious.
Can you show me the recipe for the cream sauce you made for us?
Oh, my goodness!
Why don't you tell us who you want to prepare it for?
Your girlfriend, perhaps?
What are you talking about!
Stop it, Sonoko.
I'm so glad to hear you liked it.
Would you like to have a cup of coffee?
Actually, we were just about to leave...
Mr. Sunada is still at the greenhouse?
Yes, every day from 8 to 9 or so...
he spends an hour tending to the cacti.
I'm sorry about that.
Then we'll say goodbye to him.
She ordered me not to let anyone in until half past two at 9...
Can it wait a little longer?
All right, then, we'll take a little rest to digest the dinner!
Come on, Sonoko.
Do you think I'll get fat?
(Think) "It's always the same."
(Alarm)
(Misa) Yasuyuki?
-What happened?
-I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!
Oh!
What is this?
Isn't it the will?
It's... it's that...
It can't be!
Mr. Sunada?
(Ran and Sonoko) Mr. Sunada!
(Man) He has apparently died of a skull fracture
caused by several blows with a shovel.
The approximate time of death
appears to be between 8:30 and 9:30 at night.
And who found the body, then?
Guys, I find you too often at crime scenes...
Explain to me under what circumstances he found the body.
Well, you see, after dinner we were chatting in the living room...
when around 5:30 at 9:30 the alarm went off in the greenhouse.
(Sonoko) "Then we came all the way here.
"With the housekeeper, Miss Yashiro,
and we've seen Yasuyuki here."
(Sonoko) Exactly!
In Yasuyuki?
In Yasuyuki I had in my hand the will of Mr. Sunada!
The will?

It seems that Mr. Sunada had recently drafted a new will.
Right after that, Miss Yashiro entered the greenhouse.
We all followed her and found Mr. Sunada dead on the floor.
We questioned the people involved.
Understood.
As I told you, I entered the greenhouse because I heard the alarm,
and I found the father lying on the ground!
What was he doing, in the greenhouse,
if he had said he was going to play golf?
The father sent me a message telling me to come.
-What did he say?
-Look.
It's true.
He received it at 8:20. And the victim's cell phone?
That's right.
At 8:20 he sent the message to Yasuyuki.
This means that the man was still alive at that time.
Here you are.
What about the will?
What about the will?
Isn't it true that he was in front of the greenhouse
with your father's will in your hand?
It's just that I... I took it from his father's pocket when it was on the ground.
-No!
I didn't kill him!
-Yasuyuki, this means that you... -Yasuyuki, this means that you...
Please believe me!
And what can you tell me about this?
It was found next to the body.
A golf tee!
So it's... it's from Yasuyuki!
-I have... I have no idea. -I have no idea.
-Yasuyuki!
I don't know how it ended up inside the greenhouse...
Please believe me, I didn't do it!
I'm not my father's murderer!
Please believe me!
When the victim sent you the message,
"You made it look like you were going to play golf,
but you came in the greenhouse..."
"The victim let you in,
but you must have quarreled over the will."
"You lost your temper, picked up a shovel...
...and beat Mr. Sunada to death!"
"Then you took the will in order to receive the inheritance and ran away."
But the alarm detected it and went off!
Tell me, isn't that what happened?
Yes or no?
No, it is not true!
Is it?
Excuse me, Inspector Yokomizo.
Mr. Sunada must have had...
an electronic card in his pocket to deactivate the alarm.
Why didn't he take it, then?
If he had used it, the alarm wouldn't have gone off.
Wouldn't it?
That's right,
the card to deactivate the alarm was in the victim's pocket.
Bah!
He must have been nervous after his father's death...
But I'm not finished.
Am I wrong?
What more do you want now?!
So the test of this cactus
was on the ground near Mr. Sunada, you know?
Before, in the greenhouse, the test was not on the ground.
It must have fallen while the culprit hit the victim with the shovel!
Ah...!
What do you mean?!
But doesn't this seem strange to you?
If you look, the soil that came out of the test is not wet at all.
Is it possible for the soil to dry out so much in one hour?
In addition, a thorn of the cactus...
has been stuck in Mr. Sunada's chest.
Stop it!
Stop poking your nose into the research!
All right, all right, all right.
Come on, get out!
"They're withered... Maybe...?"
"These are..."
"I get it."
"And if it went like this, whoever killed him must be..."
"Now I know who did it."
(Yasuyuki) But why?
May I know why I'm being detained?
You'll talk when we get to the police station.
Now shut up and get in the car!
Please, I already told them it wasn't me!
They must believe me!
(Alarm)
Can you tell me what's going on?
Has something happened?
- (alarm)
-No, nothing... We have not done anything.
- (alarm: stops)
-But... but the alarm is ringing!
Eh?
Oh!
Aaaaaaaah...
What's wrong?
Sonoko!
Girl...
(Sonoko voice) When I felt the alarm I understood everything!
What did you say?
Someone used the alarm to secure the alibi.
So that the crime was committed before Yasuyuki entered the greenhouse.
"First, around 8 o'clock, when Mr. Sunada was on his way here,
the murderer sneaked in behind him... and killed him with the shovel."
Then, to blame Yasuyuki for the murder,
he left at the scene of the crime
"...something that could only be his."
"Then he used the finger of Mr. Sunada
and sent Yasuyuki a message to come."
But he has made it so that it was sent at 8 and 20,

a time when he would have an alibi.
He has programmed it to be sent at that time.
This can be verified by calling the phone company.
In addition, the killer has used the card to deactivate the alarm....
"...that Mr. Sunada had in his pocket...
and left the greenhouse."
"He escaped, avoiding our view from the living room..."
and entered the house from behind.
Then.
"Shortly after we returned to the scene of the crime,
he put the card in his pocket."
That's why when Yasuyuki picked up the will.
he didn't notice that the alarm card was there,
because it was not there.
The reason is that it was still in the killer's possession.
This means...
when the alarm went off, there was no one in the greenhouse.
But then, how is it possible that it went off, then?
This is the key to everything.
The trick that the culprit used
by taking advantage of the alarm's operating system.
Look above that radiator.
There are some unvarnished pots, aren't there?
The alarm system in this greenhouse
detects the smallest infrared rays emitted by the human body
and it goes off.
Unglazed pots, like ceramics, when heated, emit the same infrared rays as the human body,
emit the same infrared rays as the human body.
The killer knew this and took advantage of it.
Something like this can set off the alarm?
I did a little experiment.
I put those flower pots on top of the radiator
because Sonoko asked me to.
That's why the alarm went off again.
(Sonoko voice) It's exactly the same thing happened
as when Yasuyuki went into the greenhouse
and unfortunately he found his father dead on the floor.
There's only one person there who is capable...
of having committed this crime!
Miss Misa Yashiro.
Only you!
Miss Yashiro!
It's a very interesting story,
but as far as I can see it's just a deduction, right?
Do you have any proof?
Proof that I'm the guilty one?
When the assassin hit Mr. Sunada,
he also accidentally knocked over a cactus.
"He had to remove the cactus from the corpse at all costs
so he could get the card that deactivates the alarm."
"I'm sure she must have been stuck with
a few cactus spines in his hands."
In other words, the culprit must have thorn wounds on his hands.
Miss Yashiro, if you insist that you are not the culprit,
then show us your hands, please!
You win.
Yes, you said it...
I'm the murderer.
-But how... could you find out?
-That's...
Because the cactus revealed it to me.
I went into the greenhouse,
"The soil from the cactus that had fallen out of the test
was beginning to dry out."
"Also, I noticed that the flowers that had bloomed today...
for some reason had wilted."
Then I realized that it had to have something to do
with the temperature in the greenhouse.
"Another key to solving the riddle
was the unvarnished pots."
"When Mr. Sunada scolded you, you took them away," I said,
"But for some reason they were back at the scene of the crime
after the murder."
This convinced me that only you...
could be the culprit.
Only you, Miss Yashiro, knew where the flowerpots were!
You are right...
I hated ZENZA Sunada.
During his years of success,
he brought down one company after another
with his ruthless strategies
"... and pushed many businessmen to commit suicide!"
"One of them was my father,
who had to raise me alone from a very young age."
"When in Sunada he retired
"And placed an ad looking for a housekeeper,
I decided to avenge my father's death with my own hands!"
"Later,
"when I saw how his children went after their father's money"
and how they squandered it living the high life,
I decided to pin the blame for the murder on one of them!
Miss Yashiro...
When I heard that all of you were coming,
I hesitated whether to go ahead with my plan or not.
But it turned out that it could only be today!
It was so unusual to see the whole family together!
You'll explain all this to us at the police station.
Yes.
Miss Yashiro.
I want you to know that I partly understand
the hatred you felt for the late Mr. Sunada.

Because of him you lost your beloved father.
But this...
This does not mean that with a gesture full of vengeance
you can put an end to someone else's life!
Secret love.
Secret love.

Aaah... I don't know why, but I have a dream....
You're amazing, Sonoko!
I don't know how you managed to solve such a difficult case!
Ah... Look...
When the super detective Queen of Deduction takes on a case,
solving it is a piece of cake.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"And what else! All you've done is sleep."
" 'Cactus crosses' you, you've worked it out!"
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
" 'Cactus crosses,' cactus!"
-No.
-You're going to watch someone?
I happen to have to go somewhere to do something.
Will you do me a favor and deliver this message for him?
No way!
If he turns around or moves too much he might fall!
