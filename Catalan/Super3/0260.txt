What's in the heart is a mystery.
Stars and snow shine for both.
Today's setting is a restaurant.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

(Machines: shrill noise)
What annoying works.
Yes.
They're making a ring road.
Hm...
We have not mistaken our way, father? No, woman, we're doing fine.
(Thinking) "We've been going around like fools for half an hour."
"He-he-he-he... This is deadly, for an empty stomach."
Hey, Kogoro: I feel like it.
Ja I know.
Keep walking.
Coi.
You're not the only one.
-Hello, Mr. Hanaoka! -Mr. Mouri...
Hello.
I'm already here.
I'm not alone tonight.
Good night.
Good evening.
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to my restaurant.
Come in, come in.
Ah, good evening... welcome.
King, where are you?
Ah... I've gone to get some tobacco.
Some customers have arrived, queen.
Ah, come in, Mr. Mouri.
Excuse me, I was changing the water in the flowers and I didn't see it.
You've already changed it this morning.
The flowers stay fresh longer this way.
Mr. Mouri, follow me.
Oh... excuse me... Oh, no... I can't take it off now.
Please stand at the middle table.
-Saki? - (girl) I'm coming.
THE RESTAURANT THE SHAKES
-Good nit. -Oh.
I don't know you, you.
I'm Saki Yoshizawa, the new waitress.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Mouri.
-Oh, excuse me! -Aah!
-It's all right, don't be silly. -I'll bring you a towel right away.
Here you go.
I'll bring you a towel. Thank you.
Oh...
Let's see, bring your arm closer... Yes.
Thank you, sweetheart.
I always have to be there for you...
Sometimes, you look like a creature.
Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Mouri.
The tremors from the construction site next door are a real pain in the ass.
Yes... That's nothing, how strong they are.
We have been told that tomorrow morning it will cease to exist.
We have to wait until tomorrow and we can forget about it.
Oh... I'm so hungry.
Boy, today we have a nice and big sea bream.
But I'd rather eat shrimp in batter.
I'll be right back.
Mr. Hanaoka.
Tomorrow you'll have a party and go fishing for swordfish as usual?
Yes.
I'll prepare the fishing gear tonight and leave tomorrow.
Fishing while feeling the cool breeze on my face and the pungent smell of the sea!
Thanks to this hobby, I stay alone on holidays.
All alone?
You're not fooling me.
What do you mean by that?
What's the matter?
Stop it.
We don't argue in front of you.
Mr. Hanaoka, escort.
Yes.
In this picture here, the big fish is a swordfish?
Yes, that's right.
It was taken by a fishing buddy who is a professional photographer.
Have you been fishing for this species of fish for a long time?
Well, it must be about 25 years.
Since I used to live on the island of Hachijo...
The one in this photo is also you?
Here he is very young.
But it's funny, this picture looks different from the others.
Because it was not taken by a professional photographer.
You see ? the lens has focused on the fisherman and not on the fish.
In this type of photograph, it is important that the fish stands out.
Caram.
You know a lot about photography.
In fact, I wanted to be a professional photographer.
Bufa.
Eh?
(thinks) "What is this? A number one?"
Hello, Conan.
Ah, it's you, Saki.
You've already folded from work?
Yes. Hi, Saki, you come here too?
From time to time.
Did your father come with you?
No.
He hadn't had enough to drink and went to drink at the tavern.
He's a lousy father.
Yes, but at least you have a father.
Ah... I've already found him.
"The last superdetectiu".
I'm looking forward to seeing it.
The story of a detective who's become a Casanova.
Mr. Mouri must be having a wonderful time,
drinking surrounded by young fans.
Impossible.
Oops... So cold.

I am on duty.
The bar is closed.
So is this one.
He's alone in Hanaoka.
I'm sure he must be getting his fishing gear ready to go fishing tomorrow.
You'd better not bother him.
This was in Wada, wasn't it?
(Mobile)
Yes, this is Mouri.
Oh, hello, Ito.
What is it?
Mahjong?
Now what?
Where?
Next to Karantei?
Wow, what a coincidence!
Sure, I'll be right back!
Oh, I forgot!
What's wrong?
I have to go buy bread for breakfast.
Since it's late and it's not safe to walk alone on the street, we can go back together.
We'll wait for you here.
Yes.
You'll be safe with her.
She's a master at karate.
Come on, Conan.
All right. I'll try to hurry.
I'll try to hurry.
You told me you were going to make a drink, but not that you'd be back the next day.
Stop it.
Stop calling, please.
I've got a head like a bass drum.
"He who doesn't want dust, don't go to the threshing floor."
I'd like to have a nice hot coffee...
(Car: brakes)
(Car: brakes) - Eh?
What happened? - (woman: call)
What is this?
It's awful.
I'm sorry to tell you, but he's long dead.
- (cries) -Ran, call the police.
Yes, Father.
Mrs. Hanaoka, where does he usually keep this vase?
It's the one at the top of the stairs.
Oh.
Maybe it fell... because of the shaking from the construction work.
It's quite possible.
It fell and smashed against your husband's head..,
by an unfortunate coincidence.
By the way, who are you?
My name is Yamamoto, I'm a friend of Mr. Hanaoka.
We were supposed to go swordfish fishing on Hachijo Island today.
I waited for a long time,
and in the end, when I was told she wasn't at home either, I came here.
He was looking forward to this time of year to go.
(He thinks) "A line of blood inside the cap."
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiii!
How do I have to tell you not to touch evidence ?!
I was just wondering if this vase really hit him!
There is blood on the cap.
This proves that he has received a blow to the head.
But look at the flowers that were in the vase.
They're more wilted than the others.
Yes, heavy, I was just going to look at it!
It's true..., the flowers in the other vases... they're still fresh.
Kogoro, look at this.
-What pass...?! - (thump)
Are you all right?
There are some small things on the ground.
They look like fragments of something white.
Maybe it...
It's probably fallen out of the bra.
Eh?
If it's not salt or sugar,
it's most likely white paint from the ceiling.
We'll have to check if it has anything to do with Mr. Hanaoka's death.
There's a very fine mark on the beam.
The paint must have fallen here.
That's good.
Now, the other part.
And the window's open.
I've got it.
It's the same mark I found on the beam.
And out there are the construction sites... Hm...
It's possible this isn't an accident.
This looks like an accident, it's possible it's a murder.
But why...?
Mrs. Hanaoka!
Mr. Wada, Saki...
A vase of flowers fell... and my husband... (cries)
(weeps) What?
Let's see...
I beg your pardon?
What happened to him?
We do not know.
She's been taken to the hospital for an autopsy.
For an autopsy?
This means...
Excuse me, but who are you two?
My name is Wada.
I work here as a cook.
My name is Saki, I'm the waitress.
If a jar fell on him, it must have been an accident, right?
Mr. Hanaoka died
due to injuries from a vase that hit him on the head.
But it seems to have been thrown deliberately.
-Deliberately?
-That's right.
At first I thought it was an accident,
but as I investigated I realised a lot of things.
The autopsy revealed that he died
between 11 pm and 1 am.
Instead, the work ended yesterday at 10:11 p.m....
due to a power failure.
Therefore, the tremors of the works could not have caused the vase to fall.
I would like you to see something.
You found it in the construction site.
This line is used to catch swordfish,
and one end of it was tied to a steel beam.
The culprit tied this line to the beam,

put the vase on top of the victim's head and made him fall.
"I asked Inspector Takagi
"to examine the freezer at the back of the kitchen...
"and found flower petals inside."
This means that the culprit...
"inserted the fork with the fishing line into the vase..,
"and left the vase in the freezer."
"Later, he took it out of the freezer...
"and placed it on top of Mr. Hanaoka's head...
"when he was preparing the fishing tackle."
"And with the excuse that he was going to change the water...
"He took the thread that passed through the beam...
"And tied it to the thread of the vase."
Finally, the culprit went outside to go to the construction site...
and tied the thread to the steel beam and dropped it into the ditch.
"In this way, the steel beam would go taut the vase....
"Until it would lie on top of its target."
"And when the ice inside the vase melted..."
This is what actually happened.
(Thinks) "He's done it again. And this time he's awake!"
By the way, taking care of the flowers is your job, isn't it, Mrs. Hanaoka?
Don't... don't tell me... you suspect me?
Why should I want to murder my husband?
This was found in Mr. Hanaoka's drawer.
What's this?
A dossier from a detective agency.
It's a full report you requested from your husband
that records what the wife was doing.
This is... is a photo of Mrs. Hanaoka with Mr. Wada!
That's right, this case has an accomplice, Mr. Wada.
"You must be the one who set up the whole contraption.
"At the construction site, right?"
"Coincidentally, I saw him last night..."
coming out of the construction site.
An extramarital... relationship, and that's why he wanted to get out of it.
Am I right, ma'am?
I'm sorry, ma'am.
It all happened as Mr. Mouri said.
I did it.
Mr. Mouri.
You've been as magnificent as ever!
And now.
It was a piece of cake.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Thinks) "Take your foot off the chair."
"Eh? What's this?"
"Yesterday I didn't see it."
Hey, what's gotten into you now?
Look: the size of this mark is like that of the vase.
(Mobile)
Hello, this is Megre.
Hm... hm... hm... Okay.
It was in Chiba, because of the autopsy issue.
They found sea bream scales around the victim's neck.
"Sea bream scales?"
His hobby was fishing.
They probably got stuck to them
from a recent fishing trip.
"Eh? This must be...!"
"Was that it? That's amazing."
Anyway, come on down to the station because we're still talking.
(Kogoro voice) Wait a moment, inspector.
(Kogoro voice) What's the matter?
The two of them aren't the murderers.
Then who did it?
It's true that they staged this setup.
But when the jar fell...
Mr. Hanaoka was already long dead.
What?
What?
The real culprit knew there was this plan to kill him...
and took advantage of it.
The setup would have no effect,
unless Mr. Hanaoka was sitting right under the vase.
"And no one could be sure of that."
"That's why the culprit chose the most reliable means."
"He approached Mr. Hanaoka from behind.
"With the frozen sea bream in his hand...
"And gave him a blow on the head."
It was the simplest and safest solution... there was.
Of course, that's why he had the scales.
After killing it,
the killer rushed to put the sea bream back in the freezer
and had some trouble taking off his gloves.
So this person had to go somewhere else right away.
To the video store, where Ran and Conan were just waiting for her....
Isn't that right, Miss Saki?
Conan, please show it to the inspector.
(Conan voice) Yes!
Here, Inspector.
This is... a rubber glove.
(Kogoro voice) It was used for the murder.
I see there are traces of red lipstick.
Yes, the same color as the lipstick Saki wore yesterday.
No..., you can't accuse me of being the murderer...
because I wear the same color lipstick.
She tried to take off her glove in a hurry
because she had to go back to where the boys were waiting for her.
"But the gloves stuck to her and were hard to get off."
"So she got the idea to bite the tip of her finger."

There is a bite mark that must be from a woman.
You can have it examined and see whose it is.
What do you have to tell us, miss?
He deserved... he deserved to be killed!
About 20 years ago I was a fisherman on the island of Hachijo.
There was a girl named Aiko Morimura,
and he promised her that one day they would get married.
But Mr. Hanaoka said he wanted to study restoration
and left the island and Aiko.
She let him go without complaint.
He wouldn't even tell her that she had to have his child.
"The Aiko waited."
"She had the baby alone
"And nurse her beloved child while she waited for it."
She waited until she lost hope
and died this spring.
So you... are the Aiko's daughter.
I couldn't forgive him.
I couldn't forgive in any way!
Saki..., that picture...
on the edge of the table where Mr. Hanaoka always sat...
is... the picture your mother took, isn't it?
What is it?
It's not the fish in focus, but Mr. Hanaoka.
It looks like this photograph was taken by a person who loved her.
(laughs)
Look at this!
"Mr. Hanaoka had the photograph hanging in the restaurant,
"And he probably looked at it constantly."
"And looking at that photograph,
"I was probably thinking about the memories
"he had of Aiko and Hachijo Island."
There is something that looks like a number one in one corner of the photograph.
Surely it was the signature of the Aiko.
Aiko Morimura.
You mean he should have forgiven
just because he had the photograph and looked at it?!
My mother is already dead!
She worked hard,
had a hard life and died alone!
If he thought about her, why didn't he ever get in touch?
If he had... if he had... my mother would have....
(Cries)
Miss Saki, I also don't know the reasons...
why Mr. Hanaoka didn't get in touch..,
but despite all the things he did in the past...
you had other ways to explain to him how you felt.
There were many other ways,
before you committed this abominable crime.
(Crying)
Oh, it's impressive!
This is the legendary armor?
Kogoro, look over there. Huh?
(crying) Oh.
The armor is gone!
And the next Conan:
"The terrifying legend of the night of snowfall, (part one)"
(Music from "Aoi aoi Kono Hoshi ni")
(Heart) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
