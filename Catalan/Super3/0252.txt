Destiny is a clue to deductions.
It is a light that sheds light on mysterious cases.
In today's mystery, the league of detectives is mixed.
The truth comes out in the end!
He has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!
Something 's just not right!

You're in my heart!
You're in my heart!

-Aaaah! -Aaaah!
Genta, I expected that from you.
That's a terrible drawing.
Come on, speak for yourself, Mitsuhiko.
You're not a genius.
Say what you want.
A man's worth shouldn't be judged by his drawings.
(Genta) It's true.
He-he!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
But people who draw well are admirable and I respect them a lot.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Maybe I'll sign up for art classes, starting tomorrow.
Oh, me too, me too!
(Thinking) "Aaah. What a group..."
-What's he doing?
-What a strange man.
This smells very bad of socarrim.
Xxxxxt!
Eh ?!
-What?
What? What?
What?
-Is it money?
Besides, it's a lot of money!
(thinks) "Eh?"
"Don't tell me this is..."
-Wait, sir! -Why are you carrying so much money?
Are you a thief?
Eh?
No.
I'm no thief.
We take help us
Yes! Yes!
Wait a minute, guys!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Let go of me.
The grandson!
They'll kill the senyoooooor's grandson!
-What?
-What?
What does it say?
"I knew it!"
The DRAWING kidnapper
(Thinking) "My intuition was right on the money."
"Yes..., there has been a case of kidnapping."
"And the person they're holding hostage...
"It's Akio Tsubakuro, 5 years old.
"the eldest grandson of Kenzo Tsubakuro, the head of the Tsubakuro financial group."
"He's a child who likes to draw pictures a lot."
"Those wads of bills were the ransom."
All right, Mr. Tsubakuro, will you explain the details, please?
Go away, inspector.
Mr. Tsubakuro... Eh?
What's this?
It's a drawing Akio drew.
The kidnapper sent it to me.
Can you tell me when you received it?
Last night or so.
It was in the mailbox, along with a threatening letter.
I see what you mean.
And this is the letter in question.
"The boy's price: 10 billion yen. Clown."
How many bowls of eel rice can you eat, with that much money?
Genta, don't be a donkey.
But the amount of money we have seen was not this much.
That money was just to prove
that he had the will to pay the ransom to the kidnapper.
And at that moment, the criminal...
Isn't that right?
Yes..., that's true.
That's enough.
I thank you for informing us,
but we'll take care of it.
Aneu's-en at home.
(Children) What?
Inspector... You and your policemen should leave too.
(All) Eh? But Mr. Tsubakuro, I don't understand you.
Akio is my beloved grandson.
All the family I have,
after my son and his wife died in an accident.
If something were to happen to him, I would be unable to get over it.
I fully understand how you feel, Mr. Tsubakuro,
but the best time to stop the kidnapper
is when you make contact to pay the ransom.
10 billion yen is too heavy, so the kidnapper....
No!
I don't care whether the kidnapper is caught or not!
I don't want to endanger the Akio's life!
Besides, I don't want to take the money to the kidnapper.
But... what do you mean by this?
I found this in the mailbox this morning.
The account to transfer the money to is the Swiss bank Von Welle!
A Swiss bank?
Inspector, we should stop the payment,
or ask the bank to tell us who this account belongs to.
It won't do any good.
There is banking secrecy in Switzerland.
If only things were that easy,

the existence of Swiss banks would be meaningless.
Oh, my goodness.
I hate to say..., but this child is absolutely right.
There are no exceptions in this situation.
But if this way I can bring the Akio back safely...
Please... Go away!
Mr. Tsubakuro...
Then...
-That's... -A truly perfect crime?
Ah, inspector.
Don't tell me you're going to let the investigation go?
Yes, I do.
As long as Mr. Tsubakuro wants things this way,
we can't get involved in paying the ransom.
However, we cannot allow a crime to go uninvestigated.
This means that once the ransom is paid...
and the Akio returns safely, you plan to begin your investigation, right?
That's right.
"But even if the ransom is paid,
"We have no guarantee that the Akio will return safely."
Oh, Akio really likes to draw, can't you guys find?
"Eh? What's this?"
Conan, what's wrong?
Conan, where are you going?
- (door, open) -Huh?
Mr. Tsubakuro, could you show me the Akio's drawing?
It's also here!
Ah.
It's a custom of the Akio.
A custom?
He signs by drawing at the bottom something that caught his attention.
What has caught his eye?
Come to think of it, I think I've seen this somewhere else.
Really?
Tell me, where?
Hm... I don't know where it was supposed to be.
Ah, so much!
When I visited the Beika Sur kindergarten where the Akio,
he showed me a drawing he had made.
The Beika Sur kindergarten.
I got it!
Mr. Tsubakuro, please leave me the drawing!
I'll be right back.
Hey, kiddo!
Ooooh...
Ooooh...
Sorry!
Eh?
What do you want, boy?
I'd like to see the drawing Akio Tsubakuro did for a moment.
A drawing of the Akio?
The drawing Akio's grandfather saw is probably this one.
Eh?
This is it!
This is it!
Ah, Miss: do you know when he drew this picture, the Akio?
(Thinking) "I have no doubt."
"This signature is the same as the one Akio drew."
"And it's the same as the one he put on the drawing he made where they have it locked."
"This means... that if I find out where that place is.
"We'll be able to find out where they're keeping the Akio closed."
"But there's a problem."
(Ayumi) Conan!
(Genta) Conan, what are you doing?
Don't leave us out.
I don't want to leave you out.
Don't be clueless.
I'm sure you were planning to rescue the Akio alone.
We'll help you.
Don't-don't be ridiculous.
We're dealing with a kidnapper.
He could be very dangerous!
Let's see.
Look at this picture!
The Akio looks very happy.
(Genta) He's having a good time and laughing watching TV with the kidnapper.
(Mitsuhiko) Yes, and this is in Yaiba the Masked.
The more I look at the picture,
the less it seems to me that she has to be in danger.
If we have to rescue her, it should be now.
(Ayumi) Conan, you also think the same as us, don't you?
Look, guys...
Besides, this case was found by us.
(At the same time) Right, right.
(At the same time) That's right.
Let's go, but only as far as the place where they have it closed.
After that, we'll leave everything in the hands of the police.
(At the same time) Yessssss!
- (Mitsuhiko) Hm, your signature .- (Genta) I see it.
(Ayumi) What's that drawn?
(Genta) An alien?
(Mitsuhiko) And a chimney?
A chimney of a building.
No, I'm sure it's an alien.
What makes you think he's drawn an alien?
But we don't see any chimney, either, from here.
Well, that's true.
We don't have time to argue.
It doesn't matter if it's a chimney or a building.
We divide selected and look for something that looks like it.
(At the same time) Understood!
(At the same time) Oh!
This is it!
(Ayumi) Eh?
Very good, Ayumi.
Very good!
Look, isn't this it?
(Mitsuhiko) A water tower...
(Genta) Depending on how, it looks like it, but depending on how, it doesn't.
Well... I'm sure that's what it is.
Really, Conan?
How can you be so sure?
Let's see.
Fixeu's-okay, guys.
What's that, at the foot of this water tower?
(Mitsuhiko) A clock.
-Isn't it a park? Yes.
-And what does it mean? (Mitsuhiko) -To the drawing you can't see any park.
Fixeu's-right.
There's something like an eye, in the middle of the signature.
-Yes! -That's true.

What do they look like, the tower and the clock, if we superimpose them?
Exactly, this clock is what it looks like: an eye.
Does this mean that the Akio is in this water tower?
No, it is in a place...
from where he sees the water tower and the clock superimposed.
I've got it!
Then let's go to the water tower!
Maybe from there we can see where the Akio is.
Okay, let's go.
How, Conan? Well...
This place you can see from here is the park with the clock.
The eye of the signature is drawn
so that it's right in the middle of the water tower.
In other words, even though there are small differences,
it's very likely that they have the Akio closed around this area.
Oh.
There are a lot of houses!
Well, I can't see anything from here, really.
If we split up and look, we'll find it right away.
All right, let's give it a try, guys. (Vez) Yessssss!
(Off) "If you see any suspicious people or anything suspicious,
"Use the transmitter and report it immediately."
"Do not attempt to follow the kidnapper or rescue the Akio on your own."
How did it go?
(Genta) There were many suspicious places.
(Mitsuhiko) In these places there was nothing definite.
There are too many places to search.
Ei: where is it, the Ayumi?
Didn't you go together?
We were supposed to meet at the park at 5 o'clock.
(Transmitter: beep-beep)
Yes.
This is Ayumi.
"Ayumi. Where are you now?"
Ah, Conan!
I assumed that the Akio would be hungry
and I went to buy some things at the supermarket.
(Genta) "What an ass you are. We were supposed to meet at this time."
I'm sorry...
Wait for me here, I'll be right back.
Mm!
A clown mask!
"Eh? What did you say? I didn't feel you well."
(Mitsuhiko) "Ayumi, is everything all right?"
What happened, Ayumi?
"I found a suspicious person."
-A suspicious person?
-The kidnapper?
"I'm not sure yet,
"But the clown who drew the Akio.
"wore a red hat, green hair,
"And he was carrying a remote control in his left hand?"
Wait a second.
-Yes, it's like you say. -There's no doubt.
"So, the kidnapper is left-handed, right?"
Ayumi, don't do anything crazy!
Listen to me for a second, okay?
"Ah, wait."
Eh?
Ayumiiiiii!
I've found her.
I'm sure this man is the Akio's kidnapper.
Listen to me.
I'll follow him now.
"No. Ayumi, don't follow him!"
-Ayumi, it's too dangerous.
-Ayumi, answer me. -Ayumi, answer me.
"Nothing will happen to me."
"But I don't want him to find me out, so we'll talk later."
Ha-ha cut?
-Ayumi?
-Ayumiiiiiii!
(Thinking) "Coi. How could he?"
(Genta) Hey, Conan...
How long will we have to wait for the Ayumi to contact us?
(Mitsuhiko) If something happens to her, it'll be our fault...
I've got it!
Can't you look where the Ayumi is with your glasses, Conan?
No, I can't Genta...
Just, Dr. Agasa is fixing them for me.
Anyway, sitting here won't get us anywhere.
-We're still looking.
-Searching where?
Well...
(Transmitter: beep-beep)
-It's the Ayumi! -It's Ayumi!
Hello, Ayumi.
(Door, open) Where are you?
(Door, open)
Hey, kid, you must be hungry.
I bought you some snacks.
And some paper and pencils for drawing, too.
(door opens) Oh!
Thank you, Mr. Clown!
While you were out shopping I drew a lot of pictures, Mr. Clown.
Oh, yes, you did.
It's fantastic!
- (metal object: wheel) -Who's there?!
(metal object: wheel) -Who's there?
Eh... me.
Who are you?
Akio, take it easy.
You'll be all right now, because we've all come to save you!
Who the hell are you?
How did you get in?!
(Cracking)
Wait, wait, wait!
The game is over!
Hey, kidnapper!
We're from the Junior Detective League and we'll stop you!
-Turn yourself in voluntarily! -That's right!
Malviatge!
Come on, kid.
Mitsuhiko, he's coming to you!
You won't escape!
Conan!
(Kidnapper) Oh!
Aaaah!
(At the same time) We've feeeeeet it!
Akio!
Akio, are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
Akio.
I'm fine!
I'm glad you're all right.
-We did it, Conan. -Our strategy worked.
Yes.
(Genta) Another great victory for the Junior Detective League!
(All) Yessssss!
A mail?

(Girl: call)
He stole from us.
Somebody get him!
He's gone into the alley.
You will not escape!
(Girl: Police.
You have no escape!
What's the matter?
3 people?
And the next Conan:
