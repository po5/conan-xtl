To the sea.
Many times, when I see the current Masumi like this, with my back turned,
I have the sensation of hearing the sound of the sea.
The murmur of the waves,
as if a spell had been cast on me.
But now I've come back because I missed Japan.
"I've come back to meet again... with the magician."
"Eh? Postscript?"
(Inaudible)
"I guess so..."
A witch, you say?
Well, no, I'm not a witch.
To me you're exactly like a wizard.
Mm?
Listen, um...
Sumi, you and I have... we know each other from...?
The curtain rises and the main character appears.
He solves the mysteries by doing a beautiful dance.
The trio of high school students, including Masumi,
show off their bikinis.
The truth always comes out in the end.
He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and is Detective Conan!
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.

"The tester's blind spot, (part one)"
Tara!
What?
How does it fit?
Well...
It looks good on you, doesn't it?
Now you'll really melt Shinichi's heart, Mrs. Kudo.
"I've already got it all out."
Shinichi didn't invite me to go to the pool.
Oh, now it's your turn, Sonoko.
Tara!
Oh, my gosh!
Hey, hey, hey!
-What do you think?
-Well, it's sexy, and it looks good on you.
I don't know...
It does, doesn't it?
But if Kyogoku sees it, maybe she'll say to you:
(deep voice) "Sonoko, women shouldn't show their hips so much".
Oh!
Yes, you're right.
Or not?
Because Kyogoku is a typical Japanese man!
Okay, now it's my turn.
Fixeu's-okay, okay?
"What was that?"
Tara!
It's sporty and cute!
It looks great on you!
When I was little I often wore bikinis like this.
I had also thought about trying on a micro bikini, what do you think?
Maybe it's better than not!
You mean?
Think that if you wear a bikini like this, with the body you have....
How mean you are.
"This bikini looks very familiar."
"If she was wearing a bikini, it means she was in a pool or at the beach."
I'm scared.
It's like I'm possessed by something.
I mean, who are you?
Someone possessed by death.
You look exactly like a magician to me.
Now another one.
Come on, let's go.
Try us-on more!
What's that?
Although you want to try on more?
What about this one?
"I'm feeling a little..."
"A little out of place."
Listen!
I can't tell which one I like best.
Can I go to the toy store?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You must be really bored, right, Conan?
Yes.
Go on.
But don't talk to strangers, okay?
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
When we finish shopping
I'll pick you up and we'll go eat at a restaurant.
You must be starving, right?
"No, I'm already full."
"What I don't know is where the memory would be from
that popped into my head just now."
To me you're exactly like a magician!
"If that girl with the fang was the Masumi,
the man with the sunglasses was..."
Let's see, who are you?
"He looked very young, but... could it be the Akai?"
"Then... who are that boy and the woman?"
"It's like I know them from somewhere."
"But where would that be?"
Eh?
(Woman) Don't you remember?
-It's me, Mrs. Nitsuka!
(Woman) -Ah... Ah!
Last week I fainted in the fitting room
and they took me to the Health Center.
My name is Nitsuka!
Night-su-ka!
Ah!
Now I remember!
You have anemia and that's why you fainted.
I don't have anemia!
Soc allergic to dogs!
A woman who was full of dog hair...
used the fitting room just before I came in...
and I had an allergic reaction.
-Yeah, right.
-That's why I fainted!
That's why I'm asking if that woman is back here today.

I just have no idea which woman is talking to me.
That haughty woman, with the unpleasant look...
and very striking painted nails.
Caram.
That woman you describe as haughty,
with a nasty look and shiny nails..,
by any chance... it wasn't me, was it?
It's Mrs.... Nitsuka, isn't it?
Hey, if you can't stand dog hair,
why don't you try on clothes while holding your breath?
What do you think, Ayami?
You agree with me, don't you?
But, Mrs. Sashihara,
the symptoms of dog allergy
not only appear with breathing,
but also when you come into contact with dog hair, dander or saliva.
Ah!
Really?
Well, that means that with this allergy you will not be able to try anything on
unless you wear socks and a wetsuit.
- (Ayami) Mrs. Sashihara...
-What are you saying, ma'am?
It seems to me that you've gone a little overboard...
What are you saying?
But how dare you give your opinion without being asked?
Or have you already forgotten that I paid off your debts
and that I even gave you a job in my company?
No.
No, of course you haven't.
Just a moment.
Let's see, there are three fitting rooms.
How about if we each choose a different tester?
Yes, indeed!
That's great.
What a great idea.
Ah... Miss Nanbu.
Don't let me pass.
Are you new here?
Yes.
It's been about a month since I moved to this store.
I know the owner, I'll be sure to tell him about you.
Oh, thank you so much!
Thank you so much!
I'll tell him that in his store he has a sales clerk
who dares to tell me what to do, and to send her away immediately!
Oh.
But I just...
Go on.
And now show me a few pieces of clothing,
because next week I have a party abroad!
Come on girl, hurry up!
I'm not like you, you have all the time in the world!
"I don't know what's going on here, but I'm not getting involved."
What?
You mean that among the customers there are such unpleasant women?
Yes, they are.
These women are often the first victims,
to detective novels.
Gee, Masumi, but how can you say these things?
And how do you say, the store where you saw it?
Simusa.
It's the fourth floor.
What?
Hey, why don't we go there?
It's funny to see what that woman looks like!
No way.
We just bought a bikini and I'm in a really good mood.
"A bikini."
Hey, listen, Masumi.
That bikini, the first bikini you tried on today...?
That's right!
Didn't you bring... a similar bikini a long time ago?
Oh, did you?
Because it looked very familiar to me, you know?
"Come to think of it, if it was then..., Ran with them."
(Sonoko) Hey, look, look!
What, Sonoko?
What did you find out?
That store it said in Conan... it's near here.
I told you we'll let it go.
Let's have a look.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
No!
Wait, Conan!
(Woman) There's a dead person!
Somebody call the police!
Geez, it's the store where I've been before!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
No!
Wait, Conan!
(Woman) There's a dead person!
Somebody call the police!
"Why, it's the store where I've been before!"
-(Woman) Yes!
-Have you called the police?
Now you must see to it that no one leaves the store.
Okay, I'll try.
She has Yoshikawa marks on her neck.
It looks like she was strangled to death.
"Her left hand is under her jacket."
"Why?"
Point to the other fitting room?
Who was in the fitting room on the left?
Me, there was me.
So maybe it's you who killed him.
What are you saying?
Of course I didn't kill him!
Who was in the dressing room on the right?
I was.
What is it, is there a problem?
Let's see, could you tell us who she is, the person who found her?
That sales clerk over there.
Yes, I found the dead customer in the fitting room.
Mm?
Mm?
Take something in your right hand.
Lipstick?
Now that I look at it,
it looks like she took some of the lipstick off with her finger.
Before she was killed, she dabbed the lipstick on her finger
and hid it.
"But I would like to know .
...why."
It can't be.
This woman who was killed
is the same person you explained to us in Conan?

Yes, it was that haughty and impudent woman.
Masumi has already told us that these women are the first to die in detective novels.
are the first to die in detective novels.
"No, I think it's that nano, who attracts death."
Takagi, who is the victim?
Ah... Well look, it's Mrs. Ritsuko Sashihara.
41 years old.
Director of a cosmetics company.
She died of asphyxiation, which was caused by strangulation.
According to the coroner's report,
the killer screwed this rope
around the victim's neck from behind
and pulled it taut, carrying the woman on her back.
All right, all right.
And do we know who discovered the body?
-The body was found by me!
-The person who found it... -The person who found it...
Oh, and... you are...?
Soc sales clerk, my name is Reia Nanbu.
As Mrs. Sashihara was taking a long time to come out of the fitting room,
I called her.
But she didn't answer, so I opened the curtain and... and found it like this.
And can you tell us
who was using the side changing rooms at that time?
I was using one, the one on the left.
Yes.
I work... for Mrs. Sashihara, my name is Ayami Yamaki.
When Mrs. Sashihara goes shopping I usually accompany her.
I know.
Since I know you'll end up asking,
I think I'd better clarify at the outset.
I was in the fitting room on the right.
My name is Tomoyo Nitsuka.
I am a simple customer,
and I want to make it very clear that I have nothing to do with this woman who was just murdered.
with this woman who was just murdered.
Also, you should know...
that this fitting room on the right
has been used by someone else before me.
Someone else?
You mean you haven't seen her face?
No, the only thing I've seen are the white sandals...
that you left in front of the fitting room.
I saw the white sandals too!
Yes, I saw them too!
Could you tell me how many customers were in the store
at the time of the murder?
I don't know... There were about 4 or 5 customers.
But when they heard that someone had been killed, they all left.
They wanted nothing to do with it.
Even though that boy had recommended to me
not to let any of the people in the store leave.
But, Conan!
What are you doing here?
All of a sudden, I heard the sales clerk call me.
It was just at the escalators
near the store.
Yes!
Isn't that right?
Explain to her, Masumi.
By the way, Conan told me something:
that this woman that they have killed and the three others
have argued... in a heated way, before the murder took place.
Well, that doesn't help us at all.
Well, it doesn't help us at all,
that the customers who were in the store left.
Yeah, it would be nice to find the customer wearing the white sandals.
Are there security cameras in the store?
Yes, there are, but...
I don't think any of them focus on the fitting room area.
Understood.
So, the only clue we have are the hands.
On the left hand, his thumb and index finger are outstretched.
And it looks like he's hidden the thumb with the fingers of his right hand,
which has a lipstick mark on it.
Really, he doesn't know?
What does he mean?
This is his last message.
What's that?
A message from the victim.
Yeah, sure, it's possible.
But so could the killer.
Now take another good look at the palms of the hands.
The palms of the hands?
And see what you think.
Indeed, although he has very clear fingernail marks on his hands.
If it had been the murderer himself
who had folded her hands after killing her,
he probably wouldn't have left such heavy marks.
The victim has clenched her fist with all her might
to let everyone know that she was being murdered.
Wow.
In this case, then,
what direction was the left hand pointing when the body was found?
She had her hand under the right side of her jacket,
so the finger was pointing to the left.
The left?
The person in the left dressing room...
Hey, look, don't look at me, it wasn't me!
If I killed a person and she put her hand under her jacket, at least I'd be curious to see what she was hiding,
I'd at least be curious to see what she's hiding.
I might have some kind of proof.
Besides, there is the possibility...
that the killer may have moved the body after killing her.
Yes.

That would be a possibility.
And... couldn't it be that he was trying to indicate a number with his fingers?
A what?
A number?
This? This?
The victim was a company director
and she traveled abroad a lot, right?
And she said she had a party abroad next week.
Yeah, almost every week she traveled all over the world...
in order to expand her market.
So she must have gone to Europe often too, right?
Mm?
Yes.
Well, you have to know that in Europe, normally,
when they count on the fingers, the thumb represents one,
the index finger represents two, and the middle finger represents the number three.
In other words, this position means two.
In Japanese "ni".
That means you, Mrs. Nitsuka!
What?
You're not serious, are you?
But why should I want to kill that woman
if she and I didn't have any kind of relationship?
No..., look, it's just that I...
Hey, Conan, do they really count on their fingers like that in Europe?
I saw it on TV, they do it less in Germany and France.
But... where I studied,
when they indicated the numbers to another person
they did it the same way they do it in Japan.
First the index finger, then the middle finger, then the ring finger,
always in this order.
You studied in the United States, didn't you, Masumi?
And in America they count the same as in Japan.
Mm... That's true!
Come to think of it, the way your hand has turned out,
it reminds you of an object, doesn't it?
Mm?
Mm...
Yes.
A pistol!
The pistols used by the Japanese police are the...
New Nanbu.
Of course they are!
The culprit, then, would be you, Miss Nanbu.
What?
No way, I'm not the murderer!
So... it would seem that, apparently,
the position of the left hand
can be interpreted in many different ways.
In short, this means that the key is in the right hand,
which has the lipstick mark and the clenched fist.
I have no idea what it means.
And, of course, another mystery...
is that there's no one who's heard the victim call.
Yes.
Generally, if someone walks into a fitting room,
the person inside either reacts or makes a scream.
Anyway, if you don't mind,
I'd like to talk to the three of you separately in another room.
Will I be able to attend the conversation there, too?
But... Why?
Eh?
You said it at the beginning.
That a while ago you witnessed
an argument between the victim and these three women.
(chuckles) All right.
All right, Conan.
Ouch!
What's up, then!
So am I.
I'll come as Conan's companion.
Yorisou Futari ni kimi ga oobaarappu.
Ironaki kaze ni Omois hasete.
Furet té no nukumori ima mo...
Stop Jikan wo tomete.
You Itsu no datte

Y've been thinking about you.
Y've been thinking about you.
Itsumo kokoro kimi no soba.

The three drawings are almost identical.
The question is to know how the murderess has done it
to get into the victim's dressing room.
Yes.
The mirror would have reflected the killer's image.
"I get it!"
"That's how she did it."
But why do you plan to use it, all of it?
I'll use it... so I can create the other client!

"The Tester's Blind Spot, (part two)".
