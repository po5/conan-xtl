Whether they are guilty or actors.
Finally, we have the magic trick of the case!
We discover a surprising set-up and Conan and Heiji solve it!

"At the show of the famous magician dogo Hoshikawa....
"We were invited to go to the legendary magician Mr. Masakage's house."
"That day just happened to be the tenth anniversary...
"The day Mr. Masakage had disappeared."
"The disciples of the magician were gathered there."
"Then, one of them, Tenko Himemiya.
"was found dead in the corridor on the second floor."
It seems that she had stopped breathing more than half an hour ago.
No.
In Hoshikawa with them.
Did you two find her?
What's in this room?
What is the meaning of this?
It's a library where Master Masakage kept all the documentation
about magic that he had gathered traveling all over the world...
I found it!
This was the number of the Christmas tree.
Also, the tree was the same place where the Tenko's body was....
There's something about this that makes me think...
Oh!
Kudo, look at this picture.
It's the 3 disciples when they were younger...
That means...
Of course it does!
The shadow!
That's right.
The shadow of the vase looked different!
The shadow of the vase?
"The first time, the moonlight touched it from behind,
"And you couldn't see the vase's motifs."
"But after the blackout, when we found the body...,
"The light touched from the side and you could see the patterns!"
What do you mean?
It's impossible for the moon to move so fast!
The shadow of the vase...
THE MAGIC OF THE DEDUCTIONS OF EN CONAN AND EN Heij≈ç, (THE SOLUTION).
(Thinks) "The moonlight. The vase..."
What does this mean?
It's quite impossible!
The first time, the moon was hidden in the clouds,
it was dark and you couldn't see the drawing of the vase.
But during the blackout,
the sky must have cleared up and we could see them well.
It could be...
Now that you mention it...
And then?
When there was the blackout, you didn't hear the killer make any noise?
Maybe he made a noise, but when it got dark all of a sudden,
we started shouting that we were afraid.
In Hoshikawa told us to calm down with a very kind voice.
With a kind voice?
It said: "Nothing will happen! Calm down, I am here with you."
Yes, you felt like you could really trust.
Oh..., well... what a joy.
(thinks) "What an ass..."
Well, just in case...
we'd like you to let us see the room
where you were sleeping when there was the blackout.
Very well.
Ouch!
You two aren't coming, you're staying here.
Eh?
Why is that?
I'm getting on my nerves because I'm close.
Won't you be...
Why do you say that?
...black with jealousy?
Black, you say?
No, he's not so dark because he's been in the sun.
He is.
No, that's not what I meant...
Oooh!
Is this the room that Mr. Kanda used to live in
when he was Mr. Masakage's disciple?
Yes.
The... bed that was there at the time,
I took it out when Mr. Kanda left, that's why it's gone.
Madam, where were you and Mr. Kanda when there was the blackout?
When I opened the door he was lying on that couch,
and we spent about a minute without moving.
I told him it was best not to move
until we got used to the darkness.
Who checked the differentials?
I did.
Because at that point,
"This boy and I were close to the box."

The library room is above this one, but....
You can't get out of such a small window.
I would think a wizard's house would have more strange mechanisms.
And there's no dumbwaiter
Tenko could get up to the second floor with.
"If in Kanda and she were here, they wouldn't have been able to commit the crime."
When they found the Tenko's body, in Hoshikawa was at her side.
As the Kazuha had it taken he could not have deposited the body there.
In this case, it is someone from the outside, isn't it, Heiji?
Mm?
What's the matter?
Inspector Megre!
When we were examining that part of the vegetation,
we saw that there were some broken branches
and that they had tried to erase the footprints around them.
Those plants are under the window of Masakage's room.
Hattori, as you said before,
"The murderer had entered the library
"And had taken advantage of the blackout to leave the body in the hallway,
"He had entered the room, jumped out of the window...,"
and fled out the back.
Start asking around if they have seen a suspicious person.
Yes!
Let's go, come on!
The rest is police work.
If someone has done it from outside....
...intervene.
It seems that it is no longer necessary....
Now I get it....
So, was this it?
What... what's going on?
You know who the killer is?
That's right, we know who the murderer is.
We already know who the murderer is, who killed Tenko by beating her,
and the set-up that's been built.
The set-up?
We will show you this set-up right away.
Could we have the enchanted investigator
and the calm investigator for a moment, Inspector?
The enchanted one?
The calm one?
Ah, in Takagi and Chiba!
Yes, I can let you, but what are you going to tell them to do?
I hope it's not an experiment for a dangerous setup.
Don't worry!
We just want you to help us!
I understand that you are worried
about what might happen to your dear subordinates...
Hattori... Speak up!
Speak up!
Are you all right?
Yes, everything is fine!
Bring everyone in the corridor on the second floor in 10 minutes.
If you do, I'm sure you'll be well surprised too!
Yes, you'll see, Mr. Inspector.
This is what Heiji told me before, right?
Isn't it?
"It better be like this, Hattori."
Really?
Then, I'll ask Takagi and Chiba to come here.
Mr. Kanda, ma'am, we've already cleared up.
Can you go to another room and wait for us to call you?
Let Mr. Hoshikawa go with you.
Yes, very well.
Meeting in the living room.
Hey, Kudo...
Hey, I finally got it.
What's that?
Well, if you know, you could have gathered all...
No, I'm not talking about the truth of the case...
I'm talking about the reason I was nervous about the Kazuha...
Ah.
Well, I'm very glad to know.
Soon the 10 minutes will be up.
Inspector..., sorry to keep you waiting.
You're doing nothing to bring them up on stage... that will clarify the truth of the case?
Naturally, with the perpetrator of the murder, which is between yourselves.
The murderer, you say?
Is it one of us?
But, Hattori, you told us so yourself!
You said that the one who killed Tenko was an intruder who had come from outside!
The intruder's target would be the volume with the magic tricks...
which was in the library at the end of the corridor on the second floor.
"La Tenko, he would have caught her 'in fraganti' and had to kill her."
"Then, with the arrival of Mr. Hoshikawa, the Kazuha and Ran," he said,
"The blackout occurred....,
"The assassin would leave Tenko's lifeless body in the hallway,
"He would enter Mr. Masakage's room...
"and would go out the window."
"Even if he had tampered with the switch"
to cause a blackout...
When the blackout has occurred, in Kanda or the lady of the house were downstairs,
and in Hoshikawa it was taken by Kazuha and Ran.
If it is not the work of anyone from outside,
who of the 3 has left the body there and how did they do it?
Is this the question?
In addition, the lady of the house told us that a suspicious man...
went to visit them 5 years ago, because he wanted to see her husband,
and that he had accused the master of being an impostor.
If someone should be suspected,

The man should be suspected first, shouldn't he?
This man... did he have a particular hobby?
Eh?
A... mania?
I don't know, maybe he had one,
but that was five years ago and I can't say...
I get it...
I mean a mania, like compulsively pushing his glasses up the bridge.
Yes, it's true!
I did have it, this one...
Heiji, how did you know this?
I don't know, I saw it coming...
So that the person with the hat, glasses and beard that I was talking about...
was the man on the right of this photo.
Lla... So, this would mean that...
It was Mr. Kanda as a young man, wasn't it?
He has a habit of pushing his glasses up the bridge with his little finger.
In this case,
the suspicious man Mrs. Masakage saw was Kanda!
Bleda!
If that man had been Mr. Kanda....,
that is, the disciple of the master who had been living here,
she would have recognized him!
That's also true, of course.
But people,
when they want to present as truth something that has not happened,
or they come up with something and take as a model what is in their head.
It is then that they see that the pieces do not fit together.
And that particular model... was Mr. Kanda when he was younger!
Now I understand.
Even if the characteristics of that man
were similar to Mr. Kanda's,
it was impossible for her to mistake him,
so she would never suspect him.
But why did she lie?
(Heiji) Because she understood everything.
When he has seen the place where the body has been deposited
and the circumstances in which it was found...
Hoshikawa, she knew that you are the murderer!
So, she wanted to protect Hoshikawa...
That's a lie!
When in Hoshikawa she found the Tenko,
I had caught me strong and could not move.
That's why I tell you that now we will clarify what this set-up is all about!
Look at this corridor.
It's the same as before, isn't it?
Yes..., it had the same effect on us.
It was very dark, but we knew there was nothing at the end.
Besides, at that moment...
I grabbed Hoshikawa's arm and hugged myself tightly!
Bleda!
You're holding me too tight!
I'm doing it so you won't lift our shirts!
Now you hold on!
"Please..."
Come on, explain this setup at once.
It's true that when Hoshikawa pressed this switch...
there was a blackout.
Turn on the breakers when there is a blackout.
Eh? (Kazuha) Conan!
(Kazuha) Conan!
How did you do it, di?
When did you get here?
I've been here all the time.
Don't lie!
You left the library when the power went out, didn't you?
No, I've been in the library the whole time,
and the door hasn't opened at any time.
Wait a minute, but... we didn't see it before.
(All) What?
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Conan, now what's wrong with you?
Oh!
Have you disappeared?
No, I have not disappeared!
But, Conan...
As you can see, Heiji has only moved this one,
the door of Mr. Masakage's room.
Just like he did in Hoshikawa during the blackout.
No... it can't be!
Ah!
This is...?!
(Heiji) Isn't it identical?
Inside, this room...
is amassed in the corridor outside.
This cabinet would represent the door of the library,
and the wall on the side represents the screen on the right.
And then, the small window in the back...
was this large window hidden behind the tablet.
The default door in Mr. Masakage's room...
was this one.
So, if you put a mirror behind the door of Masakage's room, you know what happens, right?
you know what happens, right?
What the girls have seen before the blackout
was the reflection of this room
the mirror behind that door.
So..., the body was there from the beginning?
Yes, when it caused the blackout,
in Hoshikawa closed the mirror door and left it in view.
But before, when we entered the room, there was no mirror.
That's right!
We didn't see any extra door!
Conan?
This door is very well made.
When I remove the piece of mirror that is at the height of the handle

and you put it... door against door, they fit together like a door!
We noticed this assembly
because we saw that this door was thick and because of the space in the middle.
Yes, also, as the girls said, they noticed something strange!
You said, remember?
That the shadow of the vase was different before and after finding the Tenko.
I remembered all this and wanted to check it.
I thought that before and after I found the Tenko...
the direction of the light was different as they were from different places.
This house is very well organized with assemblies.
Of course, both this door and this hallway.
All of these are things that Mr. Masakage designed expressly
to be able to do this setup.
He would bring the people he had invited to this hallway....
"And when he turned off the light...
"He would close the door and show the Christmas tree he had in the corner...
"And so he would surprise everyone."
That's why Mrs. Masakage knew right away
that Mr. Hoshikawa was the murderer.
Yes, but the one who asked us to come was in Kanda.
At that time, Hoshikawa didn't want to kill her yet.
It is likely that the idea arose when Tenko said...
that she would do the "witch's rebirth" number.
No.
Actually, the witch's rebirth...
was the title the master gave to one of his numbers.
And the staging and interpretation were identical.
So we knew right away.
She had looked at the master's volume of notes and copied his idea.
But that spectacular magic number...
was vetoed by the maestro because... it was too dangerous, you know?
He'd crossed the line, for something like that.
Well, she probably didn't know anything about it.
Because... when we decided that that number would never be done...
it was before she became my husband's disciple.
Mrs. Masakage has protected me
and said that that volume was in the library, but in reality...
that was a book that the master never parted from.
One day, 10 years ago,
he said that he had forgotten that volume somewhere
"And that she was going to look for it and hasn't come back yet."
It seemed suspicious to me that she could have looked at that book,
and I asked her to go into the teacher's room.
And when I asked her....
"Exactly, I stole it from him."
"So that it contains the whole craft and will prove to be a useful tool for me."
"I thought I'd give it back to the master when I got home.
"But I didn't think it would have such a strong shock that it would vanish."
"But...for that master to tell me to become better than him...
and that he didn't realize that I was using him to my advantage....
"It turned out to be opportune as a magician."
"Didn't it?"
"Well, from now on,
"If I teach mister Masakage's unpublished magic all over the world,
"I'm sure the master will rejoice in his grave, won't he?"
So you have murdered her?
Yes, yes...
My mind went blank and when I regained consciousness,
she was on the floor, covered in blood.
"I remembered the number the teacher did with the Christmas tree."
"And I used it to make it look like it was someone from the outside."
So, the one who broke the branches of the bushes...
and erased the footprints was you?
Yes...
Surely, the murder weapon is in that vase in the room.
At the bottom of the vase, you can see some blood on it.
And probably two or three more pieces of black clothing, right?
Yes, the evidence is all in there.
I'm a failed magician.
Even if you weren't a magician you'd still be a failure!
And now you'll have to get ready.
Because unlike magic tricks,
the crime you've committed can't just be made to disappear...
You were impressive, Hattori!
Your deduction will make history!
You were as sharp and invincible as Shinichi.
No, even better than him!
Ah, you think so too, inspector?
"What?"
Oh, I forgot.
You said it before, didn't you, Heiji?
You said you already understood why you were getting nervous....
when you saw Kazuha getting along with a boy!
What did you mean by that?
Ah, you're right.
At last, I finally know why.
What's that?
What's that?

I'm sure... I'm sure it happens to me... the same as you...
Eh?
(Thinking) "No... No, Heiji... Don't say it in front of everyone!"
You're like a subordinate for me.
What did you just say?
What did you just say?
A subordinate!
Subordinate!
As your superior, I'm worried about you following the streak of strangers.
This would give a bad image.
Isn't it disgusting?
That's why I'm getting serious!
Why should I be your subordinate?!
That your father and I are subordinate to each other!
"That night I received a message from Ran."
"P.S. I'm warning you, Shinichi.........
"You'd better not think of me as your subordinate."
"Virgin..."
Quiet, where are you!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Damn thief, surrender to the authorities!
"Tamanosuke It√¥."
"This young director
"of an excellent traveling theater troupe...
"has returned to our town to give a performance."
It's been an hour and a half,
they sent him this threatening e-mail.
"Something doesn't add up."
And the next Conan:
"A kidnapping and a theater performance at the same time, (part one)."
