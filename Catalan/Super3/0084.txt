DETECTIVE CONAN
The skiing murder, part one
When you come to a snowy mountain there's nothing like skiing.
Now I would look for the man I've been waiting for all my life!
If it weren't for the fact that the 6 men there are with the girlfriend.
Yeah, there are very few skiers.
I'm looking for an available man, and all I find is Conan.
I know that.
So much so, that's it.
Let's ski.
As you have Shinichi, you are so good at it.
I've lived striving day in and day out for 17 years.
and I feel like nothing good ever happened to me.
Sonoko...
I mean, you're buying me lunch, beautiful!
Hey, kitties, how's it going?
Shall we do this downhill together, pretty girls?
Eh, yes, yes!
(Think) "kittens, he says ?!"
We are ski instructors, right?
-You are instructors? -And so much!
You are Suzuki and Mouri, right?
Long time no see!
Miss Yonehara?
Miss Yonehara?
Are they acquaintances of yours?
They were my students when I was teaching at Teitan School.
(Think) "That teacher they had."
You've turned into such girly girls!
You have hair as pretty as ever.
Oops!
Just the hair?
There's the stamina of a 30-year-old single woman.
Don't be a bore!
If you have interesting people within reach, like these nice instructors.
Instructors?
Sure, instructors, eh, guys?
You're elementary school teachers?
So you're both salaries from Haido, where Miss Yonehara went.
Yes, they are co-workers.
Professor Shimoda, tutor of the first fifth grade class,
and Professor Sakai, physical education teacher.
En... delighted.
Where have you ever seen two teachers hitting on students?
Are you two hopeless teenagers?
This kitten thing is so old-fashioned...
It's taking too long, Professor Sugiyama.
Professor Sugiyama?
Yes, he's the music teacher.
We were supposed to meet him at 2:00, but he's very late.
Maybe he's gone to the shelter
to scare us when we go.
It's a possibility.
In Sugiyama it's like this.
Do you want to come to the shelter with us?
Yes ?!
Can we come?
Ep, ep, do not seduce my students!
Don't worry, it's okay.
We'll walk you to the bus so you can come back.
Are we on the right track?
-Look, a car. -Will it belong to someone here?
Excuse me!
Is there a skiers' hut around here?
Yes.
There's one in the middle of the valley.
-Do you want to go there?
It's dangerous. Yes.
Don't go there!
There are heavy snowstorms over there.
Turn back, now that you can.
What do we do?
Shall we go back?
Professor Sugiyama must be waiting for us.
Who the hell booked that shelter for him?
Shimoda, wasn't it your doing, the reservation?
-He made it in Sakai. -Who?
Who? Me?
Was it you, Yonehara?
No.
I did what the note I found at school said,
put a sign if I wanted to go.
Since the Nakamura always organizes trips,
I thought it was her idea.
Well, it wasn't.
What's more, I found a very different note.
It was the attendance sheet and a map with the meeting place.
I found the same one!
Who was it?
Does anyone have the key to the shelter?
Surely one of you has the key to get in.
Me.
It was my desk drawer in my office.
Who rented the car?
I did.
Professor Sugiyama called me yesterday.
He asked me to rent a car.
The only one who could have come up with this plan is Professor Sugiyama, right?
Conan, what are you doing?
We're going inside.
We're going in.
Yes!
What a cane!
It's huge!
-It's freezing cold.
-We have a fireplace!
It was worth coming!
With this storm, we'll have a hard time getting back.
Excuse me...

I have called your parents.
He will spend the night here.
Good! Good!
Can we afford to rent such a luxurious shelter like this?
Since Sugiyama has planned it, we'll pass on the bill.
(Ringing)
Speaking of the king of Rome...
We welcome our sponsor.
Yes!
I open now!
(Doorbell)
We were expecting you, Professor Sugiyama.
He-he... I see you're all gathered here.
Who are you?
I'm a humble journalist that these friends helped 3 years ago.
Three years ago?
How come you're here?
An informant told me that something will happen in this shelter.
-That something... -will happen here...
...something?
While I was waiting for you in the forest, this heavy storm came up.
You'll let me stay, I guess.
Don't run so fast!
I'll write an article.
"Those elementary school teachers at Haido School
were so cruel to abandon me in the middle of a snowstorm."
Ouch, we make up...
What about Miss Yonehara and the others?
I don't know.
They've all gone quiet, all of a sudden.
That guy spoiled the fun.
Don't listen to that man, and help me put the sheets on.
Yes!
You Mouri and this nano help Nakamura prepare dinner.
Yes.
Hey, did you get any calls from that teacher?
No.
I called and it went to voicemail.
Maybe he's on his way here now.
Suzuki, you're in charge of that room?
Yes.
Wow.
Miss Nakamura isn't here.
Miss Yonehara, did anything happen to her?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
The So... Sonoko!
Miss, Miss!
Get up, Miss!
What's this?
"My"?
Sonoko!
What's the matter?
Open the door!
Are you there?
Answer the door!
Miss?!
So... Sonoko!
Sonoko open your eyes, I beg you!
(Snoring)
Eh?!
She's sleeping.
Miss Yonehara!
-Why are you making such a fuss? -Did something happen?
Someone attacked you?!
Is it true?
Yes.
I was putting the sheets on and someone came up behind me,
covered my mouth and I fainted.
And if the cause was this handkerchief?
On TV they do it often.
They put narcotics in a handkerchief to numb the victim.
And this rope?
After putting her to sleep, he strangled her with the rope.
You see?
The marks of the rope have been left in the harbor.
Did he strangle you too?
I don't know.
I resisted as long as I could.
But I do not know what happened.
You resisted?
Yes, and thanks to that he nailed me 3 blows against the wall.
See.
-What happened? (All) - Oh!
How did you do this hand thing?
What the fuck is this?!
"My"?
This is lipstick, right?
It can't be...
It's gone!
My lipstick!
I had put it in here!
About it... Sonoko's hand says "Na".
- "Mi" and "Na"? - What does it mean?
Os-ma-ta-ta-everyone.
That it will kill us all?
That's what the author of this roar is trying to tell you.
But he can be satisfied, because no one has died.
Now you cannot disguise the truth as you did 3 years ago.
Do you want to repeat the same as always?
Surely it was you!
Leave me alone, man.
When that girl called, I was in front of the fireplace resting.
Is it all right for a child to chase a murderer?
Conan!
(Thinking) "There are still footprints in sight!"
Wait, Conan!
Where are you going?
"Only if I follow them will I know if..."
"The front door?"
"The killer is still in this shelter!"
Sonoko...
The narcotic must have worn off by now.
He'll soon wake up.
By the way, were you serious about the footprints?
Yes, they went all the way to the entrance.
We can't tell if those footprints were the assailant's.
Fools.
The door to the room was locked, we had to burst it.
Co... Conan!
That door can only be locked from the inside.
I could only escape through the finestra.
Yes, you're right.
Are you trying to tell us that when the attacker entered the shelter...?
I'm sure it's all Professor Sugiyama's doing.
Yes, he must have prepared this comedy to scare us.
Enough of this!
It wasn't long before Suzuki and I ended up strangled!
It's too big to be taken as a joke!
Xxxxxxxxt.

Ah, sorry.
What the fuck is he supposed to propose, Professor Sugiyama?
I wish he'd show up.
He must be afraid to show up.
You can't be counted on.
The one I was in, while we were being attacked?
What did you want me to do?
I was taking a bath.
I was in the room listening to music with headphones.
We left the Suzuki in your hands.
If he attacks her again, it stuns us.
Yes!
(Think) "Miss Nakamura's pants are springy."
Miss Nakamura, where did you go?
Since I wasn't in the kitchen...
It's just that the gas isn't going well.
I went out to check on the gas cylinder.
-You haven't finished cooking dinner? -Now it's cooking on the stove. -It smells like curry, doesn't it?
Smells like curry, doesn't it?
I'll put the missing sheets on.
While I'm on the horns.
-I want to try the soup. I'm sure you'll want to eat it!
Thank you, it's so nice of you to prepare something for me.
Make no mistake, we had plenty of food.
But I still haven't forgotten what happened.
What do you want me to tell you?
What happened, three years ago?
You don't need to pay attention to these stories.
The girls didn't want to eat?
La Ran will have dinner with Sonoko when she's recovered.
Of course, we've only managed to scare them.
(Phone)
-Who is it?
-What if it's Sugiyama?
(Riiiing!)
You piece of asshole!
We know who you are in this shelter!
Show your face...!
Eh?
Ah, it's working... now we've got the heat on.
It was a maintenance call.
They wanted to know if the heat was working,
because they were worried about the storm.
(Thinking) "This is not normal. There's something weird going on, here."
"I have to find out a few things."
"I'll start with what happened three years ago."
Huh?
Where are you going, boy?
I'm going to the bathroom.
(Adult voice) I was convinced he'd taken her.
I've got it!
The cell phone in the form of earring!
The doctor's phone number...
(Agasa) An incident at Haido School 3 years ago?!
Investigate this and don't ask questions! How can I investigate?
In my father's study there must be a file of past incidents.
I'm sorry.
If not, someone else may turn out...
(Ringing)
Yes!
(Ringing)
Ah, it's you Sugiyama!
Here's your triumphant arrival!
Come on, don't scare us anymore.
Come on, what are you doing now?
Come on in.
What?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
-What's the matter Sugiyama? -Don't die!
Professor Sugiyama!
There's nothing we can do, he's already dead.
-Why would they have killed him? -Don't tell me he froze to death.
He didn't die like that.
This man was murdered.
In fact, she's been strangled.
See the rope mark on his neck?
It's very stiff.
This is called rigor mortis.
Since she already has rigor mortis, she has been dead for more than 9 hours.
If we found the body ringing the doorbell,
did someone put the body on top of it?
But when the doorbell rang, we were having dinner.
So, the murderer is not one of us.
Then who did it?
I think it is the same person who has attacked before.
Fixeu's right!
On the back of her hand she has a syllable written in lipstick, too.
Miss Yonehara wore a "Me", the Sonoko, "Na".
and if we continue with this sequence we have: Mi-na-ko.
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What's wrong with you, Shimoda?
Don't touch me!
I don't want to know anything about this story!
Shimoda, it's me, the Yonehara.
Please open up.
Shut up!
Leave me alone!
There's no way.
We'll have to wait for him to calm down.
-Calling the POLICE. -Yes.
They have murdered a person?!
Yes, we found Sugiyama dead at the entrance.
He was frozen. That is, the murderer...
Maybe he entered while we were in front of the main gate.
Everything will be fine, right now in Sakai should talk to the police.
I was told that it was too dangerous to go out by car!
The police won't come if the storm doesn't let up.
It can't be.
So we should stay put?
The murderer may be hiding out there!
Why did this misfortune have to happen to us?
We wanted to have a good time...
If he were with us, surely...
What do you mean?
I'm talking about Shinichi!
Don't you remember?

It was he who found the money we students had collected.
He came expressly from the class next door to break in on me.
He was that insolent one who gave himself airs of a great detective.
Now he's a high school student who wants to be a detective.
I've seen him in the newspaper.
It was called...
Shinichi Kudo.
Only 16 years old, he's already a famous detective,
no mystery has ever been indecipherable to him.
He is a phenomenon.
We wanted to dedicate a report to him, but there is no news.
They say that by now he must be dead...
Don't be insolent!
In Shinichi is...
Aaaaaa... aaaaaa...
What are you doing here?
I just came to warn you about something.
Don't take your eye off the fellow who has closed in the room.
If the journalist's nose is not wrong, he will be the next victim.
But well, the more dead there are, the more interest my article will take.
You don't know what is being said.
The windows on the second floor cannot be opened.
In Shimoda is a little too upset.
It's dangerous to leave him alone.
We must keep him company.
Me and Nakamura will go make coffee.
Sakai, go take a look at Shimoda.
Be careful, the killer could be hiding anywhere.
They'll kill me.
They will kill me.
I know someone will kill me!
(Phone)
Here you are, Mouri.
Coffee and a cup of cocoa.
Ah, thank you.
(Phone) Eh?
Where is he, that nano?
That was not with you, miss?
(Think) "That the murderer was outside. Am I to believe it?"
"When the doorbell rang we were all together."
"So, none of us has put the corpse here."
"Eh ?! This railing... there's no snow at the end."
"Has anyone been threaded?"
"And this cut, what's it doing here?"
"On the other side there's one just like it. This can change things..."
Listen!
It's not nice to hang around here.
Go back to your room.
(Shimoda) Leave me alone!
Leave me alone at once!
-What's wrong? -In Shimoda, he won't let me in.
Well, let it be.
We'll lock ourselves in our room.
Let's get some sleep.
(Mobile)
Ah, the doctor!
Hello, doctor.
Have you found anything?
Yes, I finally found the file!
3 years ago, a student was found hanged in the volleyball club.
The cause was a neurosis caused by exams.
As a result, the tutor was severely criticized.
Who was the teacher?
This is not known, but there is the name of the girl.
Minako Mochitzuki.
Minako!
Is there any more information written?
Conan, what are you doing here at this hour?
What is this?
Hello?!
Dr. Agasa!
Is this a phone?
Hey!
Shinichi!
Shi... Shinichi?
Doctor, Shinichi is with you?!
Is that you, Ran?
(Woman's scream)
On the second floor?!
Damn it!
Doushite Futari wa deatta no?
Konno ni sabishii Yuuhi wo Miru nante.
Ki no kiita kotoba sagashite mo,

DETECTIVE CONAN
What happened?
It's in Shimoda.
Oh, my God!
Hey, Uncle!
(Thinking) "It's gone! It's gone! It's gone!"
"There's only one explanation."
"That dangerous rope is still in the killer's possession!"
And this murderer... is you!
The skiing murder, part two
