(Man) Next, the crown jewel of this auction.
One of the most famous works in the world,
a treasure of humanity that was thought to be lost forever.
One of Van Gogh's "Sunflowers"!
- (man 2) What a marvel!
- (man 1) Holy cow!
Wow!
- (woman) I had not burned?
- (man 3) It's incredible.
Quiet, please, ladies and gentlemen!
We will explain all the details.
Ahem...
They say that Van Gogh painted 7 pictures of sunflowers
while he was in Arle.
What we present to you here today is the second painting he painted from this series.
he painted from this series.
It was believed to have been burned at Ashiya in Japan during the war,
1945.
But last year a painting with the same composition was discovered in Arle
a painting with the same composition was discovered in Arle last year.
Numerous experts have examined the work
and have corroborated that it is indeed an original work of Van
an original work by Van Gogh.
(Man) I can't believe it!
(Man) And now, without further ado,
we begin the auction of the legendary masterpiece...
by Vincent van Gogh, the second painting in the "Sunflowers" series!
Bidding starts at $10 million.
They start at 10 million?
And they must increase with a minimum of 100,000.
If I had that much money, I'd spend it on a space flight or so.
20 million on the phone... and 20 and a half million on the internet.
-Eh ?!
- (man) 50 million!
- (man) He's a famous collector!
- (woman) Oh, no!
God-hay-do.
- (man) That's crazy.
- (woman) Well, I'm sure he'll keep it.
- (people) Oh...!
- (man) 100 million dollars!
- (woman 2) Who is it?
It can't be!
- (woman 1) But what does it say?
Have you heard it right?
100 million dollars!
I offer 100 million dollars.
I heard "100 million dollars"?
Does anyone offer more?
Damn, who's that old man with the walrus mustache?
What do you want us to do?
-All right.
-No problem, we'll offer 200 million.
- (people) Oh...!
-200 million!
Yes, 200 million!
Aaa... if I felt it right, number 705 is offering 200 million dollars.
(thinks) "It's the famous Mr. Suzuki!"
We haven't seen all the bids on the internet yet.
Hey, man, did we draw too much attention to ourselves?
I don't like to waste my time when I go shopping!
Shopping, you say?
He-he... Eh?
We don't need to wait for the internet offers!
-Eh?!
Oh!
-300 million.
(Suzuki) I bid 300 million!
Going once, going twice, going three times!
- (chattering commotion)
-I was coming for 300 million dollars!
Conan, it's about to start.
Run, hurry up!
"Sunflowers" has sold for the highest price ever.
-What is this?
It looks like a robot.
-What has it done this time?
(TV: woman) It's the one with these sunflowers.
-It's a pleasure.
Thank you very much for coming.
How come this very important painting by Vincent van Gogh
has not appeared until now?
Everyone thought it was burned during World War II.
Burned?
What are you insinuating?
That this painting is a fake?
No, but that's what it looks like to people.
Please, look at this.
It's a diary from last year.
It tells of the discovery in Arle, France..,
of a painting attributed to Van Gogh.
(TV: woman) Now that you say it,
it was said that it had been found in the attic of an old house, right?
The second painting of "The Sunflowers", this one that we see here.
Eh?
(Agasa) Well then, let's start!
(Genta) Yes, how nice!
Finally!
I have taken the largest I found.
It is pressed here and here...
-Ha-ha-ha!
-Maybe it will come out rice with eel!
Sorry, that's impossible.
(Agasa) Maybe it will come out something better, than rice with eel.
(TV: man) Specialists are very cautious in this respect.
Before the auction a thorough analysis was made.
It was discovered that the fabric that was used
was from the same piece that Van Gogh had used for other paintings
for other pictures painted at Arle.
(Genta) Better than rice with eel?
Can I eat two plates?
(Mitsuhiko) Can't you think of anything else?
(Mitsuhiko) -Huh?
-That's it!
-It's still a watermelon.
-Oysters!
He-he-he-he!
No, you'll see now.
-What's the matter?

Has it failed again?
(All) Oh... Eh?!
Kamen Yaiba!
-Ah!
-Bufa!
How cool!
-It's in Kamen Yaiba!
(Shinichi, thinks) "What does he do?"
How could he have done that?
"Shouldn't he be doing other things?"
(TV: female) So, Ashiya's "Sunflowers" was fake?
(Male) We don't know for sure, but it's very possible.
There is a theory, which obviously remains to be confirmed,
according to which Vincent van Gogh
did not paint 7 paintings of "Sunflowers", but 8.
The painting that has been auctioned this afternoon and the Ashiya painting could be copies painted by the same artist.
could be copies painted by the same artist.
(Woman) Do artists paint copies of their paintings?
Of the 7 paintings of "Sunflowers" that exist, 3 are copies.
And, in fact, all 3 were painted by Van Gogh himself.
Van Gogh is all very well,
but you should show more interest in the doctor's inventions.
It's very well done, eh?
It's a very artistic piece.
Great!
The press conference is about to begin.
We'll now bring you the press conference
live from New York.
I would like Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki,
who has been the highest bidder for "Sunflowers,"
to say a few words.
Mm...
I'm glad to have acquired this work...
for the highest price ever paid in history.
-Eh?
Everything went just as I had planned.
You mean you had planned to spend 300 million for this painting?
(Suzuki) Exactly!
I did it to organize an exhibition
of "Sunflowers" paintings in Japan.
To organize an exhibition?
The Suzuki group, after collecting all of Van Gogh's works...
depicting sunflowers in a vase that are scattered around the world..,
we announce that we will organize an exhibition
entitled "'Sunflowers' yearn for Japan",
the Lake Rock Art Museum in Japan.
Miss Suzuki, when you say "all the sunflowers", how many paintings are you talking about?
The painting you acquired today was also part of the plan?
Yes, it was all planned to announce the organization of the exhibition today.
"Sunflowers", including the work we have acquired today,
is a total of 7 paintings.
7 paintings?
This is not impossible, even for a Japanese group of companies?
Do not suffer, for this project is already underway.
We have been contacting the owners of the other paintings
with the owners of the remaining paintings,
art museums and collectors all over the world,
and we explained to them the idea of organizing an exhibition
with the complete series of "Sunflowers".
After our acquisition at today's auction, they have agreed to collaborate in our project,
they have agreed to collaborate in our project.
And not only that!
We have the 7 best specialists who will take care of the paintings,
supervise the transport and protect them.
-Mm...
-7 specialists?
They are the 7 samurai that I have gathered today for this occasion!
- (man) Like "7 samurai"?
- (woman) It can't be...
-Correct!
-These are the samurai I was talking about?
They are the best, with training and experience acquired...
in places with Holland and France,
places with a great connection to Van Gogh.
Miss Natsumi Miyadai,
an expert appraiser in art history who will be in charge of the appraisals.
How do you do?
Mr. Koji Azuma, a specialist in painting...
who will be in charge of restoration and conservation work.
Next to him, Miss Keiko Anderson..,
in charge of planning the exhibition.
Hello, nice to meet you.
Mr. Taiz Ishimine,
who will be in charge of transporting the works of art.
I am Mr. Ishimine.
Miss Kumiko Kishi,
who will be in charge of managing and setting up the "Sunflowers" exhibition.
I will make this exhibition a success.
And last, but also very important, Inspector Charlie,
of the NYPD, who will be in charge of security.
I will be in charge of protecting "Sunflowers".
Of that, if I remember correctly, I think you talked about 7 samurai,
but I would say that there are only 6 here.
The missing samurai will be needed to reinforce security
when we return to Japan.
And this samurai is called....
Kogoro Mouri!
Eh ?!
Of all the people in the world, you had to choose Kogoro?

It will be because the nightmare of the Kaito Kid always accompanies him wherever he goes.
Good luck, seventh samurai.
Eh?
How cool!
Sonoko is on TV!
-Look-la, look-la, look-la!
-Yes, it's true!
He-he-he-he!
Yes!
Even if you don't manage to collect the 7 paintings,
will you still exhibit "The Sunflowers" that you have just acquired?
No, there will be no exhibition without the 7 works.
-Don't worry!
-But then...
I've been dreaming about this exhibition for a long time,
and there is no dream... that I can't make come true!
-Aaa...
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-It's the Kid's!
-Ah!
It can't be, this is...
- (man) Who is this?
- (woman) What's wrong?
- (man) What's he doing now?
- (woman) He has a gun!
- (people: call)
-Waxing the gun!
Didn't you hear me?
Come on, drop the gun!
(people: call)
It can't be!
- (Mitsuhiko) Something's happened!
-(Mitsuhiko) What's wrong?
I can't see anything!
(Mitsuhiko) Ah!
It's the Kaito Kid!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Kid!
Quiet!
Quiet or I'll shoot!
-Ah!
-Huh?
What's the matter? What's the matter?
-Don't move!
-Quiet!
Quiet or we shoot!
We've cornered the Kid in the east corridor of the 103rd floor.
(Police: siren)
Kid!
Drop the gun, come on!
(Police: siren) Okay.
Stay where you are, put your hands up and get down on your knees!
You didn't hear me or what?
Put your hands up where I can see them.
-All right, little by little.
Hold up the picture.
-Kaito Kid!
- (gunshots)
-Ah!
(shots) -Demon!
(shots) -Ah!
-Paris, Charlie!
(Crystals: brittle)
-He's escaped us.
-Diantre!
Kaito Kid!
There has been a lot of confusion in the building,
but no one seems to have been hurt.
-Did he steal "Sunflowers" or not?
-Oysters!
Is it over already?
I find it all very strange.
In Kaito Kid you only stole jewelry, didn't you?
(Shinichi, think) "I could only see her for a second."
"It was really in Kid?"
Oh..., oh!
-But... but what are you doing here?
-I'd say they're in trouble.
I heard that in Kaito Kid wanted to steal "The Sunflowers".
If you don't mind, I'd like to help you.
(Conan voice) "Detective Conan: The Sunflowers of Hellfire."
(Shinichi voice) "I'm teenage detective Shinichi Kudo."
"One day I went to the amusement park with Ran Mouri,
"my best friend and classmate,
"and I witnessed a suspicious exchange
"between two men dressed in black."
"I was so focused on observing those two men,
"that I didn't realize there was another one behind me."
"He made me swallow a poison...
"And, when I woke up...
(Conan voice) "...my body had shrunk!"
"If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
"They would want to kill me and the lives of those around me would be in danger."
"Dr. Agasa recommended that I hide my identity."
"When the Ran asked me what my name was," he said,
"I randomly told him I called myself Conan Edogawa."
"Since Ran's father is a detective,
"I went to live with them to try to get information
"About the Men in Black."
(Shinichi voice) "By the way, other than the doctor,
"there's another person who knows my true identity:
"The Ai Haibara."
"His real name is Shiho Miyano."
"At first he was a member of the Men in Black,
"but when he left the organization
"He took the same poison that I had been given.
"And in it, too, his body shrank."
"Other than that....,
"As for the Kaito Kid and his assistant,
"I still haven't been able to work things out with them."
"But I swear by my fame as a detective
"That this time I'll catch up with them!"
"I'm small, but I have the brains of an adult."
"A detective who solves all mysteries!"
"The truth... always comes out in the end!"
(PA: man) "In a very short time we will start the maneuvers
to land at Haneda Airport."
"Please store all your luggage....
the overhead compartments or under the seat."
This is the dummy we have recovered.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-I see him very happy.
In Kid has fooled the guy many times.
He's glad he's fooled another one.
Mm?
By the way, are you sure, that everything is all right?

On the one hand, he did not allow the cabin crew to approach him,
and on the other hand he allowed that young man to board without any problem.
Ah, he is a well-known detective in Japan, you know?
Don't worry, don't worry about him.
But what if he were the Kaito Kid in disguise?
-He worries about everything, eh?
-Physically they look very much alike.
Look closely.
-Oh...!
-What?
What do you think?
What the hell are you doing, you old geezer?!
It's that Charlie suspects you.
What's an American cop doing, on board, if I may ask?
I just had to protect you to the airport.
I think it was not necessary for him to come all the way to Japan.
It's true that the contract stipulated
that he was only supposed to protect the United States,
but now that we know that in Kid behind "The Sunflowers"
I can't leave them unattended.
Yes, I was right to choose you as one of my samurai.
Protect "The Sunflowers" at all costs.
(Charlie) Yes, trust me.
(Suzuki) In fact, we only need you to come in Kaito Kid!
Ha-ha-ha!
-Huh?
Yes, I'm a little dizzy.
-Natsumi, are you all right?
Maybe it will do you good to walk a little with me.
Come, you don't want to be sitting all the time.
-Thank you very much.
-To the washroom.
-Where are you going?
(Kogoro) It's quite possible that the Kid is keeping watch somewhere.
How come they come with such a flashy plane?
We already told him to be discreet.
But he answered...
that the plane was for transporting the painting and advertising.
Inspector Nakamori, isn't it your job to stop him from doing this?
Do you think that old man ever listens to me, or what?
What?
You can't do anything.
Are you coming back aboard this plane?
Eh?
The painting of "Sunflowers" is also traveling with them?
Wow!
Why do you have to stick to me everywhere I go?
Ouch!
We had no choice.
In Jirokichi you wanted me to come with Conan too, didn't you?
Aaa... yes.
After all, he's the nightmare of the Kaito Kid.
Gee, how silly you must feel.
Ouch!
Don't move from here.
You've come to accompany me and that's enough, okay?
Ran, don't let the kid out of your sight.
Understood.
Yes, I always try, but, of course...
Oh! (Cell phone ringing)
(Mobile)
(cell phone ringing) Huh?
Who's that?
(Cell phone rings) Excuse me.
Hello!
Sonoko?
Uh, hi Ran, we're about to land,
but before we arrive I wanted to give you some good news.
She told me not to tell you, because she wants it to be a surprise, but...
Yes, yes...
Oh!
What?!
Shinichi is coming with you?
Just because Shinichi is on the plane, it's not necessary that...
Sonoko, Shinichi is with you?!
Until a moment ago he was sitting close to me, but...
- (people: call)
- (Suzuki) But what the...?!
What's wrong, Ran?
Sonoko, is everything all right?
Sonoko!
I heard screaming and then a loud noise!
What the...?
Inspector Nakamori, something's happened on the plane.
It can't be!
In Kaito Kid...?
(Alarm)
We're having trouble, the right wing flap and slats are not responding!
Never mind, that!
Shut down engine 4 and try to put out the fire!
(alarm) Okay!
One person ?!
(Male) Control tower on flight 2501, over.
We're clearing runway A, can you make it?
(Radio: male) "This is flight 2501. We will try!"
Get as many planes away from the surrounding area as you can!
(Radio: man) OK!
Inform all aircraft.
Tell them to check fuel level and leave the area.
-Yes!
-And hurry!
We don't have time!
-Punyeta.
-All aircraft, emergency!
Even if they manage to turn and face the airport,
this runway won't be enough for them, they want to be too high.
I hope they can get out.
Attention all passengers.
Due to an engine problem we have to make a rapid descent
and prepare for an emergency landing.
Put on your seat belts and make sure they are fastened securely.
MHM!
Ah...
15,000 feet.
10,000 feet.
Come on!
Ah..., MHM!
What?!
In Kaito Kid?!
What did you say?
In Kid?!
Where is it?
Where is it?
"Where is he in Kaito Kid? Where has he gone?"
Hello?
Hello ?!
In Kaito Kid?
Has he shown up?

Inspector Nakamori!
There has been an incident on the plane.
They say they will have to make an emergency landing, on runway A. (Shinichi, thinks) "Wow!
(Shinichi, thinking) "Wow! I can't see anything from here..."
Conan!
Was it the Kaito Kid?
Sonoko, answer!
Sonoko!
-Ouch!
Ah!
-Don't get up, Uncle!
Wait, Mr. Suzuki!
It's dangerous to move.
But if it has appeared in Kid, maybe it has taken "Sunflowers"!
(PA: man) "We are about to initiate emergency landing."
"As you know, because of the explosion we can't control the plane well."
"It is very likely to be a very complicated landing."
Please, gentlemen passengers, pray that everything goes well.
Come on, let's go!
- (man 2) Gate number 8, let's go!
- (Man 1) Come on, next, hurry up!
(Man) This is not a drill!
- (alarm)
-We are not going well, the plane does not stabilize!
(Man 2) - Yes!
-Do not give up!
Get back to it!
(People: call)
(People: call) - Oh!
Ah...!
-Ran, help!
Let him through!
(Shinichi, thinks) "It's already here!"
- (all) Oh...!
-Attention, it's coming!
This doesn't look good.
Listen to me, it's coming!
-But that's how to lose control!
-Reverse, now!
-Yes!
-Just think about stopping the plane!
Reversing thrusters!
Huh?!
Oh!
But... what's going on?
(PA: female) "Passengers from the international terminal:
evacuate the area."
(Shinichi, thinks) "How awful! Star!"
Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up!
(Shinichi, think) "MHM! Please stop!"
Oh...
(Engines: stop)
(Shinichi voice) What's gone!
Shinichi, Sonoko!
(Man) Control tower in flight 2501, do you read me?
Wants 2501, come in!
He wants 2501!
(Radio: male) "This is flight 2501. I apologize."
"I did not heed your instructions and changed runway."
- "Yes, we have stopped in time."
-But let's see, are they all right?
- (radio: man) "All safe."
-Yes, they made it!
-Right away!
- "Activate rescue protocol."
(radio: man) Oh...
Mm-hm.
Marrec, are you okay?
Well, well... But it's been a hair's breadth!
Yes.
One false move and they would have caused a catastrophe!
(Shinichi voice) Oh... He's right.
(Shinichi, thinks) "I'm surprised the Kid did something like that."
What is it?!
But...
"In Kaito Kid!"
Hey, Kid, but where are you going?
I won't let you escape!
(Conan voice) In Kid has "The Sunflowers" and takes them away!
(Conan voice) -Really?
-What?
(Mobile)
(Ran, thinks) "Shinichi, Sonoko..."
(Mobile)
Sonoko!
Are you all right?
Can you tell me where you are now?
"I'm glad!"
Don't worry, Ran, I'm fine.
By the way, has Shinichi called you yet?
Oh...
"Eh? Shinichi? No, not yet."
Did something happen to him?
It's not here, with you?
"No, he's not here. I don't see him around here."
(Man) Hey, man!
This area is restricted access!
Damn, where's he gone?
Wait, nano!
Nano!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Oh, who could it be?"
(Mobile)
(Mobile: ringtone)
(Answering machine: female voice) "This phone is not available."
"Please leave message after the beep."
(Answering machine: pip)
No, Shinichi... Please pick up!
(Shinichi voice) "Excuse me, Ran, I'm chasing in Kaito Kid!"
I'll call you back later!
I'm so glad..., Shinichi!
(Shinichi, thinking) "Where is it? Where could it be?"
Mm... He-he-he-he!
You won't escape!
MHM!
He's got this!
"Fuck!"
"Wait a minute... When in Kaito Kid has jumped he wasn't wearing 'The Sunflowers'."
"He must have hidden it somewhere in that building
during the time I lost sight of it."
"It is there!"
(Man) It's all the tools we were able to find at the airport.
(Koji) It's going well.
We'll just check to make sure it doesn't have any scratches or bumps.
(Koji) -Yes.
-(Koji) Come on, let's get started.
We hope it's just dirt.
If there's even a scratch on it,
the dream of organizing the exhibition will go down the drain.
Inspector Nakamori!

Watch this.
A security camera has recorded the Kaito Kid flying over a rooftop.
It's been about an hour and 15 minutes or so.
Looks like he was still carrying the "Sunflowers" painting here.
Yes, but why did he leave the painting on that building?
This painting of "Sunflowers" is bigger than the others and it's heavy.
Maybe it was too fat
and couldn't be flown away with the glider.
Maybe it was supposed to come back later, but the little one discovered it.
Ah, but it wasn't me who saw it.
It was Shinichi,
who, while chasing him, saw how he hid it there.
Let's see..., and where is that young detective now?
It is never when he appears in the Kid.
It almost seems as if he and the Kid were the same person.
I think that what you say is not possible.
It is true.
He got a call from Shinichi on his cell phone an hour and 15 minutes ago.
At the same time when the Kid was hiding the painting.
(Shinichi, he thinks) "Great, it's like he went to the United States."
It doesn't matter, now, this.
What matters is that en Kid has come to the airport.
I believe he was worried about the state of the plane
that he blew up.
They say that killers return to the scene of the crime
pretending nothing happened.
Hey, you!
You mean?
How dare you compare the Kaito Kid to a murderer?!
Open your eyes!
He almost killed you.
I find it strange that the Kid tried to cause a plane crash.
It doesn't fit with someone like him.
(Koji) Sorry to keep you waiting.
The painting is quite dirty because of the smoke,
but it doesn't require any restoration.
Oh, how nice!
So we've all arrived together unharmed.
Very well, thank you all.
And now let's get down to work!
In fact, it was fortunate that they found it right away.
Well, yes, because if it had stayed there for a long time, with the heat,
the ultraviolet rays and the heat would have ruined it.
Eh?
Well done, little one!
I expected nothing less, from the nightmare of the Kaito Kid!
(Shinichi, thinks) "But I've already told him it wasn't me..."
(Suzuki) This is the big safe
that the economic power of the Suzuki family has built:
the Iron Washing Bear!
Here the painting will be safe.
But in Kaito Kid, hadn't the Iron Washing Bear already forced it?
Don't worry, we have made many improvements.
- (dog: borda)
-Right, Lupin?
That's it!
Check that everyone has left.
Yes.
Right, no one's in.
Mm-hm.
Iron Washing Bear... activated!
(TV: female) According to the investigations by the police
and the Ministry of Transport,
on the outer wall of the hold of the burned aircraft
traces of explosives have been detected.
Police are searching for the employee in charge of securing the cargo,
who is believed to be missing.
Now the other owners
do not want to leave their paintings for the exhibition.
But, Father, how come you are still around?
Yes, there is a very interesting race today.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Putting aside work for something like this..."
What are you going to do if you get fired?
Impossible, a great detective like me doesn't get fired.
He has.
There were these letters in the mailbox.
Mm?
What are they?
Letters, huh?
Oh...
Maybe they're from admirers!
He-he-he-he!
Mm...
Conan...
Sonoko has invited me to the meeting.
Would you like to come with me?
Sure, I'd love to,
but I'm meeting the guys to go to the museum with them.
That's all right.
Don't worry, it's all right.
What's up?
By the way...
Could you tell me... if you've heard anything from Shinichi?
Ahm... he hasn't called me.
I wish he would have told me he was in the States.
He hasn't contacted me since he said he was after the Kaito Kid.
(Genta) Conan!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Ran..."
-What?
Come on, Conan?
-I've come to get you!
Come on, hurry up!
I'm coming.
(Doctor!
Conan's coming!
-Goodbye, Ran!
-I think we can leave right away!
Goodbye, Conan.
Good-bye, I'm leaving.
Mm-hm.
Have a good time!
What's the matter?
Ran!
What's wrong?
You can contact the police now!
The Kaito Kid!
I found a letter from him in one of the envelopes I received.

"Tonight I will take the first copy,
the one to the left of 'La Berceuse'."
Damn you, Kaito Kid!
Don't you give up?!
(Suzuki) As you very well know,
the other owners of "The Sunflowers"
have expressed their reluctance to cede the paintings to us.
So, in order to regain the lost confidence,
I have decided to install an anti-Kid security system
at La Roca del Lago.
Last night, as suggested by the Natsumi,
we installed security cameras among decorative sunflowers.
If you have any other ideas, don't hesitate to let us know.
Obviously, money is no object.
We agree.
Our mission is to make the exhibition a success.
I will collect ideas and get them to you as soon as possible.
Mm-hm.
Thank you.
Charlie, you'll help us, too, won't you?
Oh, yes, of course.
Although he thinks he's a fancy thief, he's just a crook...
who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.
-What do you know, you?!
-No, he's a terrorist!
But if we don't know for sure
that it was the Kaito Kid who caused the plane crash!
Let's put it another way.
Who could have put the bomb on the plane, and for what reason?
-Eh?
- (door, open)
Mr. Jirokichi, sorry to interrupt.
-Sorry, it's Inspector Nakamori. -I'm sorry.
-What is it? -What's wrong?
He needs to speak to you urgently.
-Right away.
-Pass me the call.
-Inspector Nakamori, hello?
- (phone: dial a number)
- (all) Eh?
(all) -Okay.
Understood.
It's not possible to enter the Iron Washing Bear,
but we'll check it out right away.
-What happened?
-The meeting is adjourned.
-Related to the Kaito Kid?
-Any problems?
It seems a new message has arrived from the Kid
Detective Mouri's office.
Oh!
And what does it say, this message?
"Tonight I will take the first copy,
the one located to the left of 'La Berceuse'."
-It can't be!
-Nothing else.
It's the one on the left of the triptych.
-Mm-hm.
-The first copy means...
The rest wait here until I come back.
-Mm?
-Mr. Suzuki!
If we heed the message, he doesn't want to steal the painting you have here.
-Huh?
-Mm?
When you talk about what's "to the left of 'La Berceuse',
you're referring to the fifth sunflower painting you painted.
And, of course, the fifth painting of the series of "The Sunflowers",
as you know..., is actually here, in Japan.
(Suzuki) At the Sompo Japan Nipponkoa art museum, right?
-It's a place to see paintings.
(Suzuki) -A museum?
It will be a lot of fun.
Here, and thank you very much for visiting us.
-Yes?
Me too!
-It's my first time here.
-It's fantastic! -Oh, it's very tall!
-Oh, it's very tall!
- (Ayumi) It's true!
-Look, you can see the Bell Tree Tower!
Didn't you come here to see "Sunflowers"?
Yes, you're right.
Well, let's go see "Sunflowers"!
Hey, you guys, don't mail!
(Shinichi voice) I don't know if they're interested in watching "Sunflowers".
I'd say it's not them, who want to see "Sunflowers".
-Exactly.
-Right, doctor?
I have to study them thoroughly
before they open the exhibition "Sunflowers long for Japan."
I didn't know you were with us.
Are you interested in art?
Didn't you have to go to the meeting?
Or so I thought...
I didn't go because there were 6 samurai gathered.
Now it's more important to know what's going on in Kaito Kid.
Ah.
It's strange that after so long
I'm interested in an object... that isn't a jewel.
Is that why you came to see "Sunflowers" that he wants to steal.
Of course it is.
Isn't it?
The more I know,
the easier it will be for me to discover the motive of the Kaito Kid,
and maybe then I can get a head start on his plans.
Oh!
This is the end of the museum.
-Look, they're over there!
-But where are they, "The sunflowers"?
-Which one is it?
Which one is "Sunflowers"?
- (Ayumi) Ah!
- (Genta) Oh!
-This one here, right?
It's beautiful.
(Mitsuhiko) Yes, it's fantastic.
- (both) Eh?
-Now seriously: what's so great about it?
Hey, guys!
Speak more softly or you'll be thrown out of the museum.

-Excuse me, they are very noisy.
- (Genta) OK.
- (Agasa) Ah...
-Don't suffer.
This is the fifth picture of "Sunflowers" that you painted, right?
-It's a splendid work.
-Please, doctor!
-Oh, I beg your pardon.
-He-he-he-he-he-he!
Don't suffer.
We've already finished watching "Sunflowers"!
Have we?
Are we done?
-Yes, let's go!
-Well, let's go buy souvenirs! -Yes, I'm coming.
-Yes, I'm coming.
- (Mitsuhiko) Come on, doctor.
Gee..., I don't know why they came, then.
-Hey? -You, little girl...
-You, little girl...
You're interested in something other than "Sunflowers", right?
Eh?
I'm sorry I spoke to you like that, out of the blue.
You remind me of me when I was young, and I couldn't help it either.
Ah...
-Yes, every day.
-You come here very often, at the museum?
You must really like Van Gogh's "Sunflowers".
I suppose so.
-Mm?
-But not these.
- (Kogoro) Looks like it's intact.
- (man) It's here.
(man) Huh?
(man) Ah!
Kogoro, what's wrong?
What about you?
What are you doing here?
Great timing, little one.
Come along with us.
Mm-hm.
Don't tell me in Kid...?
-Mr. Suzuki!
-The next painting he'll try to... -The next painting he'll try to...
We shouldn't talk about this here.
Excuse me.
As you have been able to verify, for the moment everything is correct.
Any further action would cause inconvenience to the visitors.
We will discuss the rest of the details in the reception room.
All right, then.
Let's get going.
Let's not waste any time.
Hey, Ay!
I'll stay here with Kogoro and these people.
You go home with the boys.
And listen...
Yeah, I know.
You don't want me to explain any of that to them, do you?
Yes, I do, thank you.
He trusts you a lot, doesn't he?
The truth is, we don't have the kind of relationship you'd think.
No... I think you have the same look I had 70 years ago.
It reminds me of the meaning of sunflowers
in the language of flowers:
"I only have eyes for you."
But if you just look, one day you will regret it.
As happened to me.
People don't realize what's really important
until they lose it.
Like this painting of "Sunflowers".
-(Genta) Oh, we're leaving.
- (Genta) Oh, we're going home!
- (Ai) He's gone home.
-But... where is Conan?
- Hey!
-Something urgent has come up.
- (Mitsuhiko) Again?
- (Ayumi) What?
-(Ayumi) Oh!
-Thanks for the advice.
I'll try not to regret it.
Doctor, it's a pity you can't stay longer.
Then I'll be more eager to see the exhibition.
"'Sunflowers' yearn for Japan."
Kiyosuke...
Could you explain to me how you have come to the conclusion
that this note refers to "The Sunflowers" of our museum?
"La Berceuse" is the painting of the woman rocking a cradle,
it's not "Sunflowers", of course.
No, the important thing is that it says:
"The first copy, the one to the left of 'La Berceuse".
In all probability it refers to a triptych.
It refers to a triptych?
Yes!
They are drawings or paintings that are presented in groups of 3.
-Eh?
-Yes, we already know that.
But I do not understand what they have to do, our sunflowers,
with "La Berceuse".
-Oysters!
-That... How did it go?
(He makes a giggle)
Wait, isn't he one of the samurai?
Why don't we ask Mr. Koji Azuma,
who deciphered the note, to explain it to us?
Ah, yes, he's right.
-Aaa... yes.
-Azuma, can you explain it to us?
Supposing that this idea of the triptychs
that Mr. Mouri has put forward is correct,
"La Berceuse" would be placed in the center.
Mm.
Then, the paintings that would go on the sides?
-Yes.
-To be "The Sunflowers"!
In a letter he sent to Theo, his younger brother,
there was a sketch of the triptych.
So there is no room for doubt.
And if we place the paintings according to the order of the sketch....,
on the right would be the third and seventh paintings,
and on the left, the fourth, the fifth and the sixth.
Of those on the left, the first copy of "The Sunflowers"...
would therefore be the fifth painting,
which is what is exhibited in this museum.
I get it.
So it is true that the KID intends to steal "Sunflowers" from the museum.
So now we have to decide what we can do.

Gentlemen, the Kid said he would steal tonight.
We'd better get "Sunflowers" to a safe place right now.
-Wait a minute.
-Wait a minute. -Now?
We can't do that.
We'll explain the situation to the visitors and close the museum earlier.
Thank you for your cooperation.
(Helicopters)
All right, like this.
Little by little, like this...
What I don't know is if there's anything we can do now to help.
I don't know.
Mr. Ishimine from Cheetah Transport is very efficient.
In just half an hour he almost has it ready.
It's still an hour before nightfall.
-Yes.
-Looks like we'll make it in time.
All right, all right, bit by bit.
Is there anything we can do to help?
Yeah, there is.
It would be nice, while we're setting it up, to get that lid over here.
We understand.
Natsumi, we'll take the lid over here!
Yes.
-That's not necessary, we'll do it ourselves. -Oh...
-Oh... I'll help you.
It's just that Mr. Ishimine doesn't like it
anyone outside the team to intervene.
-You're welcome.
-But thank you very much for volunteering. -You're welcome.
Ready?
Let's get up at the same time, upstairs.
-All right.
-Already in place.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
We'll take care of the rest.
-Here's the lid.
Don't you think it would be wise to go and check the safe?
Yes, maybe.
Mr. Director!
Do you have a moment, please?
(Shinichi, thinks) "Charlie is right."
"If the Kid says he's going to steal the painting tonight,
it should be taken from the safe."
Ah!
(man) Excuse me.
- (man) Yes.
-(man) It's all right.
Carry on.
(man) Ah... (man) Wait!
There's something under the lid.
Oh!
Hey, kid!
We don't have time to waste, don't bother anymore!
Hey, hey, hey!
Looks like a letter from the Kaito Kid!
-All right.
-Aixequeu the lid.
(people) Oh...!
- (people) Oh!
-A letter!
It can't be...
-Yes.
-Natsumi, let me see it.
There's no doubt, it's a letter from the Kid.
"I've taken 'Sunflowers'. Kaito Kid."
"I've taken away," it says?
But the picture of "Sunflowers" is here.
It doesn't say anything else?
This is all that's written?
-Why do you say this?
-Yes.
Maybe the painting has been changed and these sunflowers...
...are fake?
I didn't expect the Kid to cheat us on the time of the robbery.
Yes.
At the Kid, he didn't do this kind of thing anymore.
(Shinichi, thinks) "It can't be, there's something wrong."
He's a common thief.
He's capable of anything to get what he wants.
Surely, he would even be able to kill.
What do you think?
If it's a fake, it's done with great precision.
It's very difficult to be sure here.
Yes, of course.
I would like to make a proposal.
Would it be possible to take it to me?
In our studio I could make a much more careful valuation.
Understood.
If it is possible that the painting has been exchanged for a forgery,
I'm sure the board won't object.
That won't be necessary, Mr. Director.
But... how cheeky!
-What do you mean?
Oh!
In-in-in... in Kaito Kid!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Of course! This is all a trap of in Kaito Kid!"
This painting of "Sunflowers" is authentic,
without a doubt, I assure you.
Ah!
Kaito Kid!
How can you make a fool of us!
- (woman: call)
- (gunshots)
-Punyeta!
-No!
Mr. Azuma, Miss Miyadai, have you done wrong?
-Please catch the Kid!
-No!
He's taken the painting!
- "Sunflowers"!
-What?
(People: cough)
Wait, Kid!
(Radio) "Here in Nakamori."
"In Kaito Kid has stolen 'The Sunflowers' and fled."
"He's likely to appear on the rooftop, be alert!"
(Man) Understood!
We've located him, on the rooftop above everything!
Oh, man, he's escaping!
If I had the gun...
The Kaito Kid has thrown a lot of smoke bombs into the air!
- (radio: Nakamori) "What? Look for him!"
-We've lost track of him.
- (man) But what is it?
- (woman) Hey, look at this!
(woman) Hey, look at this! Is that him?
(Charlie) Where has he gone?
It has deceived us!
It is already too late.
- (man) What's the real one?
-Punyeta!
That boy...
He stole it tonight, just as he said he would!
- (policeman: siren, he moves away)
- (helicopter)

Here.
It is the letter in Kaito Kid left in my pocket.
"I will deliver to you 'The Sunflowers' that I have taken with me
for the very reasonable sum of 10 billion yen.
Let's meet here for two hours
in room 1412 of the Toto Plaza Hotel.
Bring the money in used bills and place them on the bed.
If you don't do so, the deal is off.
Kaito Kid.
10 billion yen in two hours?!
So, what he wanted in Kid from the beginning was money.
Mm...
(Shinichi, thinks) "I don't understand, why has he changed so much?"
"There has to be some reason. Or maybe he's an imposter?"
Our museum doesn't have the resources to raise 10 billion.
In fact, there's only one person in all of Japan...
who could raise an amount like this.
Aaa... Okay, I'll prepare the money.
-But on one condition.
-Really?
In case I get "The Sunflowers" back,
I'd like you to lend them to us for our exhibition.
Of course I will!
If we succeed, the museum board won't have any problems.
Could you also help to convince the 5 owners of the other paintings of "The Sunflowers
of the other paintings of "Sunflowers" to let us have them?
Of course, and so much!
I'll do my best.
-Perfect!
Negotiation solved!
-(all) Yes!
- (all) Yes!
-We're on our way to the hotel right now!
Director, meet us as soon as possible.
(all) Yes, of course!
You're coming with us too, Charlie?
No, I have to go get something important.
-Yes.
-An important thing?
An object to be able to stop the Kid.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
But I want it here at the time of the deal, okay?
Don't worry, I'll be there on time.
I'd like to... ask you another favor, if you don't mind.
Mm?
Tell me, what favor?
I'd like to invite one person
to your big exhibition of "Sunflowers".
Who is it?
Since the first day we started exhibiting "The Sunflowers",
there is a woman who comes to our museum every day to see them.
Ah, she was there today too, wasn't she?
Oh, yes she was.
She must have a very strong emotional attachment to this painting.
"She doesn't bother to look at any others,
she just stares at 'Sunflowers' with a sad look on her face."
-Oh!
(Suzuki) Thank you very much.
- (Suzuki) Granted.
(Phone: ringtone)
(Suzuki) It's me.
I'll finally need that.
(Phone: man) "Are you sure?"
"In this country it's a felony to even carry it."
So much is.
It's about a terrorist who has put a bomb on an airplane.
"Mm, understood. I'll get one ready for you right away."
Thank you very much, Mark.
Take her to the parking lot
behind the Toto Plaza Hotel here for an hour.
"Okay."
(PA: man 1) "This is the entrance lobby, all right."
(PA: male 2) "Emergency stairs, nothing suspicious."
If we go on like this, we won't make it in time!
-Mm.
-Sorry for the delay.
Inspector Nakamori, everything ready?
There are officers at all entrances and exits.
If he's already inside the hotel, this won't do any good.
Be that as it may, we won't fail this time!
If he's inside, we won't let him out of the hotel!
Hurry up!
Time is running out!
- (man 2) We'll put them here.
- (man 1) Quick, take them inside!
-(man 2) Go, go, let's not waste time!
(man 2) -Afán session!
Aaa... this, could we negotiate, in this situation?
(Headset: Nakamura) "We have to follow Kid's orders."
"We have no choice but to do what he asks us to do."
"From now on, don't talk to us unless it's strictly necessary."
"If he knows we're here, everything will go down the drain."
-Come on, hurry up!
-Yes, all right.
We're running out of time!
But... why do you want all the money placed like this?
We have no choice, it's just the way he wanted it in Kid.
I do not want to feel, nano!
Ouch...!
Yes...
Aaa... yes.
Create a look at the monitor?
Wait...
Oh...
Thank you.
That's very kind of you.
There you go.
Eh?
I want you to help me.
I've noticed that you're an alert and very perceptive boy.
I understand he named you "the nightmare of the Kaito Kid".
It was a coincidence.
Besides, I'm still in elementary school.
I don't care about that.

Let me know if you see anything unusual.
Yes.
Okay? (Shinichi, think) "The most normal thing with 10 billion yen.
(Shinichi, think) "The most normal thing to do with 10 billion yen
would be to deposit it in an overseas bank account."
"But he's asked them in cash. It must be for some reason."
What?
The reporters are here?
What's that supposed to mean?
We were supposed to be the only ones who knew that the transaction was being made!
(Headphones: male) "There's a flood of journalists from all the media."
We have totally lost control of the parking lots.
Journalists have started broadcasting at the left entrance of the hotel.
We are in front of the Toto Plaza Hotel.
En Kid has stated that he is only interested
in the second and fifth frames of "Sunflowers".
What a scoundrel!
Is the KID using the press to cause a stir or what?
Inspector, if it has been in Kaito Kid who informed the press,
no matter how much of a stir they cause, the deal won't fall through.
The problem is that time is running out!
We won't get all the money out.
Two minutes.
Open the suitcases and leave them there.
Come on, everybody out!
(Headset: Nakamura) "Come on, get out of here!
Director, we'll wait in the front room.
-(Headmaster, stay here, don't move!)
-Oh, oh...
-Hurry up!
-Ah...!
Oh, it's so hot in here... Can I open the window, at least?
(Headphones: Nakamura) "Please hold on a little."
"We don't know if the Kid will come through the door or what."
(PA: man) "We have withdrawn from all points."
Okay, well done.
Have all teams stand by and ready to receive instructions.
(Megaphone: male) "Okay!"
(Shinichi, thinks) "Knowing the Kid, he's sure to have an ace up his sleeve."
"I have to find it out before it's time to close the deal."
"What's this? How strange..., there's something different from before."
(Door, open)
(Conan voice) Oh, no.
I've got it!
(Thinks) "Damn it!"
"He's got the master key!"
Come on, time's up!
Nightmare Kid!
Hurry up, hurry up.
Hurry, get in!
What's the matter?
Tell me what's wrong.
The water level in the bottle the director was drinking has risen.
"The atmospheric pressure in the room is rising."
I don't know.
So what's your point?
But if we don't get the pressure down to normal levels,
he's got us in his hands.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?!
Are you trying to sabotage the whole operation or what?!
20 seconds left to close the deal!
It won't open!
The difference in air pressure pushes the door out!
-Deixi'ls do.
-This pair do what they want!
We have less than 10 seconds left, we keep going.
Oysters!
Five seconds.
Four, three, two, one...
Zero!
Ah...!
Oh!
What the...?!
- (man 2) Is it the Kaito Kid?
- (home 1) Look up there!
MHM!
MHM!
Yes.
That's it, it's opening!
Oh!
Ah..., ah!
Kid!
Damn you, Kid!
(Home 1) Look, it's the Kaito Kid!
(Man 2) Look, it's over there!
-(Man 2) Yes...
-Are you all right?
In Kid has taken "The Sunflowers"?
Charlie, there!
I do not know...
What?
Look, on the bed!
Idiots!
How dare you sabotage the operation?
-He got away from us.
-Charlie!
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he in Kaito Kid?
And where are "The Sunflowers"?
Don't worry, "The Sunflowers" are fine.
-The sunflowers are! -The sunflowers!
-Oh...! -Yes, but the money...
-Yes, but the money... -Yes, but the money...
-Eh?
Did you get them back?
No problem, I don't care about them.
Well done, well done.
Let's call a press conference right now!
(chattering)
Mr. Suzuki, please turn to explain...
your victorious confrontation with the Kaito Kid.
There is no reason to fear the Kid.
The owners of the remaining sunflowers can rest assured!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Shinichi, thinks) "It's strange, everything went so well..."
(Tuning)
Today they only talk about how the masterpiece "The Sunflowers"
has twice been in danger of being stolen by Kaito Kid.
(Woman) Hey, look at this!
I'd love to go see this exhibition.
Would you?
Which one?
The one of "Sunflowers"?

(TV: male) Along with this piece,
the rest of the paintings in this series will be exhibited,
which will come to Japan from all over the world.
Our guests today are the people who have projected the exhibition " 'Sunflowers' yearn for Japan".
the exhibition " 'Sunflowers' yearn for Japan",
Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki of the Suzuki Group,
and his niece, Miss Sonoko Suzuki.
(Conversation flutter)
The exhibition will be held at the La Roca del Lago Museum of Art.
I had never heard of...
I had never heard of it
because it has been built especially for this exhibition.
Gee, it's very interesting.
To be able to offer the most suitable environment
to show these masterpieces
and to protect them with a perfect security system,
we had to rethink the whole design.
Ah!
We will now take a look at some pictures
and ask Ms. Suzuki to explain them to us.
This museum, La Roca del Lago,
was built using stone from a quarry owned by our company.
The structure has 8 floors, with exhibition rooms on each floor.
Each of the seven sunflowers will exhibit on a different floor,
and visitors will be able to view all the paintings one at a time.
When all visitors reach the lower floor,
the paintings will be transported there with a special elevator and displayed together.
and will be displayed together.
So, while the visitors are waiting for the elevator to take them back...
for the elevator to take them back up again,
they will be able to see the entire collection of the 7 sunflowers.
I get it!
They have thought of showing the 7 works separately first because,
once they are all together, people will be able to appreciate them better...
in combination with the rest of the series.
And there is another thing: the security system.
If any anomaly is detected, the sensors emit a signal...
and the frames are enclosed in fireproof and waterproof boxes.
There is no danger of fire or flood damage.
In addition, if someone were to steal any of "The Sunflowers",
the security system would be activated immediately
and all the doors would be locked.
Even if the Kaito Kid were to disguise himself
and managed to get into the museum,
it would be impossible for him to get out.
The security measures are foolproof.
The security system never deactivates the elevator that goes to the rooftop
and leaves the minimum amount of light necessary to see.
Gee, does this mean they have a generator?
Yes.
We have taken some pictures so you can understand it much better.
Look, water is brought in from the lake...
into tanks on the top floor..,
to generate hydroelectric power when it's needed,
by taking advantage of the difference in water level.
This allows us to bring the visitors up to the rooftop
while the paintings of "The Sunflowers",
through a special rail system,
are transferred to an emergency evacuation storage room on the ground floor.
located on the first floor.
It's amazing!
It is perfect!
It's an impregnable fortress to protect "The Sunflowers"!
Exactly, the public will be able to contemplate...
the greatest treasures of mankind,
the paintings of "The Sunflowers", together in this fantastic setting,
in the exhibition "Sunflowers yearn for Japan."
-He-he-he-he!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I understand that this exhibition will last for only one month
and that it will be limited to 100 visitors per day.
Do you know when the drawing for tickets will begin?
-Oh!
Really?
-Well, right now.
Go to our website and you can sign up now!
The draw starts simultaneously all over the world.
Don't miss out on this wonderful opportunity, eh?
(Ayumi) Ah, I lost!
I thought we were going to win, with the doctor's computer, but...
Gee, we've all lost.
Doctor, can you tell us what comes up on the screen if you win?
First they register you with the photo you submitted,
then the screen shows your name and an ID number.
Then you enter a screen to make the application,
and after a few days they send you the entry.
Mm...
You know very well how it works.
Yes, I've won one!
Oh, really?
-He-he-he-he-he-he!
-What a horrible laugh.
Please, doctor, give-me-me!
I want to go!
-So do I.
-And me!
He-he-he-he-he!
(Mitsuhiko) It's impossible.
(Mitsuhiko) Come on, how immature he is.
-He's immature.

-You are absolutely right!
-What can we do?
-Very immature!
If she passes this test she will be yours.
I'll ask you a question with several answers.
-Yes!
-You can only choose one, understand? -Yes!
-Long live the doctor!
-Very good!
Come on, let's start!
The little sunflower growing in the field likes the sun,
but what doesn't it like?
One, the spider.
Two, the snake.
Three, the scorpion.
Yes, the answer is...
You have to think of a different kanji...
- (Genta) I got it!
-Hey, xxxt!
You guys, don't answer!
- (Ayumi) Me too!
- (Mitsuhiko) I got it too!
- (both) Eh?
-The answer is number 3, right?
-(Mitsuhiko) Huh?
-No, it's not this one!
Scorpions have venom, don't they?
(Mitsuhiko) There are spiders and snakes that have it too!
(Mitsuhiko) -You've lost.
-Yes, really?
The answer is number one, the spider, "kumo".
And why is that?
In Japanese, "kumo" also means cloud.
Blow!
"Kumo" means "spider", but with another kanji it means "cloud".
The little sunflower likes the sun,
but it doesn't like clouds that block the sun.
So the poison has nothing to do with it?
I mean..., none of you are keeping my ticket.
We would like to go and see this exhibition together.
Could we?
Please! Please!
Can you do anything?
-Yes, please!
-Please! -Yes, please!
Aaa...
- (all 3) Hurray!
(all 3) -Yes, okay.
Are you serious?
But this time you'll have to help me more than ever, okay?
He-he-he-he-he!
He-he-he!
Good luck, nightmare of the Kaito Kid.
-Mm?
-Excuse me, Mr. Suzuki... -Sorry, Mr. Suzuki...
-Yes, of course.
-We should continue the meeting.
Well then, I'll see you home.
- (all) Let's go!
-Let's go!
Uncle, remember to book tickets for Ran and Shinichi, too.
Yes.
Ishimine...
(all) -Okay.
-Excuse me, come on in, I'll be right back.
Please let me know as soon as the routes have been decided.
And how do you plan to transport the works in the museum?
The security system of the Rock of the Lake is perfect,
but transporting them can be very risky.
Don't worry.
I have prepared many vehicles with a fake load.
I am the only one who knows which is the real truck.
Then there is no reason to worry, but...
if you plan to use "what you already know", don't forget something.
You should think that there is no one in this world
who has the right to steal a life.
I will keep that in mind.
But if you have too idealistic a view of the world,
one day you might have a scare.
As you are currently doing in Kaito Kid.
Eh?
(Sonoko) Conan, what are you doing?
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!
Everyone's waiting for you!
Ah, I'm coming.
-He-he-he!
-Mm...! -Mm...!
- (woman) Excuse me.
-Mm.
I don't think you like me.
A package just arrived for you with a message.
Mm, thank you.
Who's it from?
How come they're sending it here and not at the company?
-Calm down, Lupin!
Calm down!
- (dog: growls)
Be good, you're a spoiled brat.
No, it can't be!
Kid!
Let me see it.
There's no doubt, it's from the Kaito Kid!
-It looks like a gift, but of course...
-And this?
(Dog: borda)
-Mr. Suzuki, step back.
-What's the matter, Lupin?
-Quiet, Lupin, back off!
- (Dog: gunwale)
-This smell, and so flammable...?
-What the...?!
Phosphate?
It's a flammable material.
Get out of the room!
-No, I haven't done anything to myself.
- Charlie, are you hurt?
Contact Inspector Nakamori immediately.
(Suzuki) Yes, sir.
Are you sure about that?
This attack could have been fatal.
If you contact the police the exhibition will be postponed,
and in the worst-case scenario I might have to cancel and all.
Yes, that's right.
In this you say, Charlie is right.
Understood.
(Kumiko) Not a word to anyone, about all this that has happened.
- (Kumiko) Yes, very well.
-(Kumiko) Okay?
-Mm?
- (DOG SQUEALS)
Very good, Lupin!
Thanks to you I saved my life.
Charlie, just in case, let's lock the room tight.
Yes.
(Charlie: thinks) "Kaito Kid, you've finally shown yourself for what you are."
"From now on I'll show you no mercy."

Back, back!
Stop it!
Stop it!
But how many fake trucks do you intend to send?
Of all this that has happened..., what do you think?
-Why did you do it, Kid? -Why did you do it?
-What do I think?
I think that if this exhibition is finally cancelled,
the second and fifth paintings will be moved
from the Rock of the Lake Museum.
This means you will have another chance.
-Oh.
-And that's it?
If it were that, I would only have to wait for a month, until the exhibition is finished.
I wonder why the Kaito Kid is in such a hurry.
(Helicopter) Oh...!
(Helicopter)
(Sonoko) Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for visiting the "Sunflowers Miss Japan" exhibition today.
I now turn the floor over to Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki,
the man who conceived the exhibition,
to begin the opening ceremony!
Thank you.
To you, who have been captivated by "Sunflowers", I ask you, are you ready?
Are you ready?
The "Sunflowers" exhibition
the exhibition "Sunflowers long for Japan" is officially opened!
(PA system: female voice) "We are starting the admission process for visitors".
"Please prepare your tickets. We will open the gates soon."
Can you show me the entrance, please?
Hello, my name Ran Mouri.
I'm 6.
Okay, all right.
Step this way, please.
How nice!
-We're the first to enter it! -We're the first to enter it!
Come on, Ran, run, hurry up!
Yes.
Are you all going together?
Well, put the tickets into the machine, please.
All right.
Is it working properly, the admission process?
Yes, it is, sir.
Both the surveillance and the entire security system are working perfectly.
Mm, understood.
All but Goto, you may now return to your places.
(All) Yes!
Excuse me, are you sure?
Will he be able to control all that by himself?
Do not suffer, all this is automated.
Besides, it is very convenient to reduce to a minimum the people...
coming in and out of this room.
Yes, I suppose you're right.
-What happens now?
-(Suzuki) Huh?
- (Suzuki) What a scandalous man.
-Aaa... nothing.
Wow!
That young detective is here too?
Mm?
Goto!
Any suspicious person come in?
The first group has gone down with the elevator
and entered the first sunflower room.
But one person has gone directly to the second sunflower room.
I will show you the person.
Who would think of starting with the second sunflowers?
Can you come a little closer?
-Aaa... yes.
-Glass!
(Nakamori) What's he doing?
Crying?
(Kogoro) I'd really like to see the second sunflowers.
Mr. Suzuki, it's not about the Kaito Kid.
-(Kogoro) Yes, of course.
-Let's go back to the general surveillance.
-Okay.
(Ayumi) -Switch monitor.
(Ayumi) Oh, they're beautiful!
If they were real they would wilt.
But they look artificial, don't they?
I don't care if they're artificial,
but I would have liked them to smell better.
Strange, it was Natsumi's idea,
but the truth is, she didn't say anything about any smell.
It doesn't matter.
Let's take a look at the second painting of "Sunflowers".
It is owned by the Suzuki group.
- (Genta) Let's go!
- (Mitsuhiko) Good idea!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Oh. Surveillance cameras..."
"They've put them everywhere, huh?"
(Conan voice) Yes!
Conan, what are you doing?
Let's go, let's go!
-Yes, come on! -Yes, come on!
-Look, it's this one.
(Genta) Blow!
(Mitsuhiko) I really wanted to see it!
Eh? (Genta)
Ran!
(Mitsuhiko) Eh?
You're serious?
Run, I've seen Shinichi!
Shinichi!
I've lost her.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Where is she, Shinichi?
What?
Was it really him?
Well, now that you mention it, I didn't get a good look at him at all.
(Shinichi, think) "I hope so."
Maybe you're wrong.
"The museum's security system includes X-ray screening
and a check of all bags."
"This means that it was impossible for him to enter in disguise."
"Therefore, the only way left for him to gain entry
"Was to impersonate me,
since curiously enough we have a very similar physique."
"What is this note?"
"Oh! A letter from Kid !? He's been impersonating me!"
Ah...
(Ai) Everything okay?
Sorry, it would be someone else.
He's not here either.
Conan, don't shout!

Ran!
Sonoko!
Bring me to the security room!
It's a letter from the Kid!
He's entered the Lake Rock!
It's from the Kaito Kid!
(Kogoro) What does it mean, this message?
Assuming it refers to sunflowers...
Some of Van Gogh's paintings have up to 15 sunflowers.
Precisely the fourth, fifth and sixth have 15 sunflowers.
And there are paintings that have 14, then?
-No.
-No, as far as I know, no.
The references to the paintings with 14 sunflowers
are actually the paintings with 15.
In the letter he sent to his brother Theo,
Van Gogh told him about a painting of 14 sunflowers,
but it's actually 15.
(Suzuki) Let's say, then, that this is the number of sunflowers.
What would you mean by this number?
For paintings considered to be 14 sunflowers,
the experts know a theory that says
that they represent the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ, plus Theo and Gauguin.
-What does it mean?
-Yes, that must be it!
Look at the letter again.
11 people plus one are the 12 apostles of Christ.
And the two represents Theo and Gauguin.
If you add them up, they make 14.
And in the pictures there are 15 sunflowers,
the fifteenth would represent him, Van Gogh.
Even if we accept this interpretation,
the question is: what does this equation mean?
How is it that in the KID he has left a note of warning so difficult to decipher?
Also, do you want to say that this letter from Kaito Kid is a warning note?
(Suzuki) I don't care!
As for this kid's letter and all that it represents,
I hope we can ask it directly when we catch him.
We'll leave it closed on Kid inside The Lake Rock.
-Aaa... okay.
-Help-stop him.
Goto, send out all visitors and museum employees.
Yes!
But... it's only been an hour since they opened the doors.
If he does something like this, he'll cause a riot.
Don't worry!
You never know what might happen on the first day.
I've only invited people related to the company and friends of Sonoko.
Mr. Suzuki, we will deploy security measures.
Mm.
Yes, I'm counting on you, my 7 samurai.
I understand, we have an emergency protocol.
As arranged, we will contact the others...
if we must finally abandon our site.
Understood.
(Man) "Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the inconvenience."
We seem to have a bit of a problem at the "Sunflowers" exhibit.
I'm sure it has appeared in the KID.
The Junior Detective League must take action.
No way!
This time it's too dangerous.
- (all) OK.
-Do not separate from me!
As, for the moment, the evacuation of visitors?
Quite well, sir.
The problem will be to the various inspections at the exit.
The X-ray check is unnecessary.
Let's let them go out after the bags are returned.
But if we do that, in Kid will escape us!
Relax.
This thief has proven that he never runs away
when he has the prey he is looking for right in front of him.
Most likely, then, is that he will not leave the building.
Well, we lock the entrances and exits...
and leave it locked inside.
If La Roca del Lago is inside right now..,
he's certainly not in disguise and he's not carrying his magic tools.
And if so, I am convinced that we will catch it!
Besides, I have 12 totally trustworthy people...
who are still inside this building.
(Shinichi, think) "12 trustworthy people..."
"I get it."
"If you have written '11 +1 'instead of' 12 'it will be because..."
"Sure!"
Mm?
(Conan voice) Mr. Jirokichi!
The 12 trustworthy people match the 12 apostles
that go out to the letter you've left in Kid, don't they?
And I thought...
"How come in Kid he hasn't simply written 12 people?"
He may have wanted to leave a part?
It could be... that he was referring to Judas?
-Mm?
-Ah!
You mean Judas the traitor?
The Kid wanted to warn us that there is a traitor among us!
Someone else, besides the Kid, is after "The Sunflowers".
Mr. Suzuki, if you don't mind,
I would like to go back through the records of the 7 samurai.
Maybe someone has set out to destroy the trust between us
and weaken security.
But we'd better not tell them we're investigating them.
Mm.
There is nothing wrong, to recheck their records.

-All right.
-Do it.
The visitors and employees have already left the building.
-Yes.
Closing the exits.
-All right.
Close immediately.
(Man) Please continue walking.
Do not stop.
(Woman) Both visitors and employees of the La Roca del Lago
of the La Roca del Lago Museum of Art are leaving the building.
What happened inside?
None of the visitors have received any information.
(Thinking) "The places with the fewest surveillance cameras
are the server room and the counter room."
"But, in fact, no one, apart from us, knows where they are."
It's best to check.
Here at Charlie's, I've checked all the spots with minimal security,
and I haven't found any trace of the KID.
(Headset: male) "Okay."
"There's no one left in the building."
"Please, everyone back in place."
It's almost time.
- (door, open)
- (pip flashing)
(door, open) Huh?
(door opens) Oh!
(door, open)
- (pip flashing)
-Quiet, Kid!
-But...
-Punyeta!
-It's all right.
-The light!
-Yes!
-Activate the auxiliary generator.
Priority to "Sunflower" monitors.
Roger that.
Turning on monitors!
All is well, "Sunflowers" are all set.
-Engegui other monitors.
-All right!
-All right.
-I have information from Megure.
-Glass, can you explain to me what's going on?
-That's it!
Trouble in the electrical controls room.
The lights, the main elevator and the surveillance cameras...
have stopped working.
I'm sending agents to protect the second and fifth "Sunflowers".
In Kaito Kid.
So it must be inside the building.
No, it's possible it wasn't the Kaito Kid.
What? What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by this?
While going through the 7 samurai's records.
a possible suspect has emerged.
You mean...?
Meaning what?
In Arle, France, where Van Gogh is said to have painted the 7 paintings...,
6 months ago, this person's twin brother died.
(Headphones) "As he had a shot in the chest and gunpowder in the right hand,
the local police concluded that it was a case of suicide. "
Go ahead, as they said?
-Azuma, you say?
-Koichi Azuma, he said.
Yes, Koji's brother, in charge of restoring the paintings.
- (all) Eh?
- (Koji) "It wasn't a suicide."
There, on the monitor of "Sunflowers"!
"I killed Koichi."
(Koji) Eh?
On the second monitor!
Azuma!
Why kill your brother?
"After finding Ashiya's 'The Sunflowers,
"that we had searched for so long,
my brother changed his mind."
(Shinichi, think) "They found Ashiya's 'Sunflowers'?"
Can you tell what he's talking about?
The painting was destroyed during the war!
-Huh?
- "No, this is not true."
"During the bombing of Ashiya...,
the whole city burned, it was hell on earth."
"My grandfather worked as a carpenter for a very rich businessman...
"Who had bought 'Sunflowers' from Ashiya
and had it embedded in the wall to prevent it from being stolen."
"To rescue the painting,
my grandfather ran into the flames."
Oh!
Iah!
MHM... Iah!
Iah..., iaaah!
Mr. Azuma!
Madam!
Mr. Azuma, what are you doing?
-Don't come closer!
-Ah!
No!
Madam, please take "Sunflowers"!
-Madam, watch out!
-No, Mr. Azuma!
Madam, we have to get out of here right now!
No!
Mr. Azuma!
Even if we lose the war...
we can't let them take "Sunflowers" away.
Mr. Azuma..., Mr. Azuma!
Madam, please, zeal!
We must hope that someday there will be a museum
like the one Professor Mushanokoji explained.
To exhibit "Sunflowers"... so that the world can see them.
(Koji) "Our father often told us this story."
After his death,
we continued to search for Ashiya's "Sunflowers."
But the only clue we had were the words of that employee.
The words of an employee?
"It seems that in order to prevent the Allies from confiscating it," he said.
he passed it off as a fake to smuggle it to Europe."
W-wait!
Are you saying that "The Sunflowers" that I bought at the auction
are Ashiya's "Sunflowers"?

No.
In other words, they didn't burn...
My brother and I finally found them.
"Since then, Ashiya's 'Sunflowers' have been hidden...
in the attic of an old house in Arle."
But... after so many years searching for "The Sunflowers."
when we finally found them, my brother changed his mind.
"He said that 'The sunflowers' had to leave Arle,
the place Van Gogh held so dear."
"If not, he said he would destroy them there and then."
"I could not forgive him for saying that,
it was a betrayal of my grandfather's and my father's wishes."
"We argued, and while we struggled,
the pistol that we carried for protection went off by accident."
(Shot)
(Groans)
-Go away.
-Koichi!
Y-you're...
- (groans)
-Koichi!
-But...
-Get out of here.
Run away!
Later, when I heard about the exhibition,
I decided to join the team as a curator.
(Headphones) "Thanks to this I was able to witness
the return of 'Sunflowers' in Japan.
"The last wish of my grandfather and father had been fulfilled."
So, when the exhibition was over,
I was planning to turn myself in to the police.
It's a little early, but...
Understood.
The Metropolitan Police inspector is already on his way here.
- "Yes, of course."
-Will you turn yourself in voluntarily?
"But I'm not the suspect you're looking for."
- "Oh...!"
-What do you mean by that?
-Come on, come on, man!
- "'Sunflowers' are burning!"
"Seriously, they're burning!"
- "Hurry, we must put it out!"
- "There's a fire!"
But... can you tell what's going on?
Goto, what do the thermal sensors indicate?
They show abnormal values!
Of course they are!
The fire is real.
-Not from here.
-Can you put it out?
-We have no choice.
-The fire system doesn't work.
We must evacuate the building!
Goto, open the doors leading to the roof.
-Let's go!
Everyone follow me.
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
Yes.
Conan, let's go!
The fire's already here!
You'd better hurry, sir!
Eh?
I know, I know.
Just a moment.
Eh?
Come on, let's go, man.
Hurry up!
Run over here!
Yes!
Hurry up, we're out of here!
Come on, Conan, hurry up!
- (Keiko) No, we're all fine.
- (Suzuki) Is anyone hurt?
Conan, are you all right?
Yes, but... what will happen to them, to "Sunflowers"?
Quiet, the protocol was working smoothly.
But frames two and five were...
You don't have to worry about anything.
(Shinichi, think) "No, I know very well what I saw."
"The two paintings were still there."
"I have to do something, and hurry,
or 'Sunflowers' two and five will end up consumed by flames!"
What's going on here?
All right.
Bring the helicopter down.
Inspector Nakamori reported
that they'll take the Azuma out the back door.
Here, all right!
-Hurry up!
- (all coughing)
Inspector Charlie has already handed over the Azuma to me.
A fire has broken out.
May I know what's going on here?
Could you supervise the evacuation from the air?
We'll help too.
We understand.
We got it?
In Conan... It can't be...
- (crystals: brittle)
-Punyeta!
This is a disaster, I've got to hurry...
or I'll burn along with "Sunflowers"!
Eh?
Hey, why did you come back?
(Shinichi voice) Kid!
Never mind, that!
Where's the other one?
Are the fifth sunflowers okay?
Yes, the stick that was blocking it came out easily,
but this one is stuck with something and won't come out.
We have to get it out right away or the paint will melt.
Get out of the way, Kid!
Hey, don't fool around!
It's a painting of "Sunflowers", a treasure of humanity!
Iaaaah...!
Ah!
Oh!
Did it work?
Now is not the time to argue!
You pointed at me, didn't you?
Blow!
It didn't come out.
This old man has made a very solid building.
(Both) Eh?
Conan!
(Both) Oh... Shinichi!
It's true that you've come!
(Both) Hey!
Listen, we have to get out of here right away!
It's dangerous!
(At the same time) Ran, you have to help us.
(Conan voice) The painting is stuck.
What... what do you mean?

The only way to save it is to destroy the wall!
This is impossible.
Ah!
Mm.
I'll give it a try.
I'm sure you can do it.
Back off, Shinichi.
You too.
Ran!
All of them!
Iaaaah...!
Iaaaah...!
I made it!
All right, let's run, we're out of here!
Let's run, we're out of here!
Hey, Ran, wait!
Ah...
- (metallic clatter)
- (crystals: brittle)
The road is blocked!
(crystals: breaking) All right.
Don't suffer, calm down!
Terai, can you hear me?
(Man) Please walk calmly!
-All right, understood.
- (Kogoro) It's all under control!
(Kogoro) Nothing has to happen.
- (people) Oh!
-(people) Huh?
Ran!
Hold on tight!
Don't let go, Ran!
It can't be!
Aaaah!
(Crystals: brittle)
-But how can it be?
-Huh?
What happened?
It seems that the water from the tank has spilled!
And you think that this way you can put out the fire?
-Isn't it here?
-Hey!
Where is it in Conan?
-The Ran is not here either.
Where is it?
-Wasn't she with you?
Gee, as if I didn't have enough work to do!
Where did they go?
But they were behind us a moment ago!
He's not answering his cell phone.
Listen, maybe they came down before us.
-Yes, please.
-I'm going to see if I can find them!
- (both) Yes!
-Come on, let's help her.
(Oh, he thinks) "Conan, don't tell me that..."
(both) Ah!
Ah...
Worry about the Ran, not me!
Are you all right, detective?
Ran, hold on!
She's alive!
She swallowed some water and fainted.
Hey, look!
The force of the water is dropping!
Well, this must mean that the reservoir is empty.
Oh, I'm worried about the sunflowers.
(Shinichi voice) Let's go!
(Shinichi voice) You know... the saboteur's plan?
Yes, if with the decorative sunflowers I could start the fire,
I could use the corridor as an aqueduct to put it out.
In other words, the saboteur...
is the one who suggested planting sunflowers in the hallway.
Yes.
I see you've figured out who it is.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are you going to get out of here?
For now we'll go up the hallway to the top floor,
where the exit is.
Maybe we can get out through the elevator shaft.
Mm?
And what was your original plan?
I mean to escape.
I find it very hard to believe you didn't have that in mind.
If I wanted to fly out the exit at the bottom of the cave,
I could get out in a jiffy.
But I can't fly by guiding the user to you and this lady...
Kid...
By the way, if you knew the plan of the saboteur,
why didn't you act before?
I knew perfectly well the plan for me to steal it from the computer.
But he could have had an accomplice.
I wanted to avoid the electrical blackout,
but Inspector Charlie kept chasing me all the time.
I thought if I sent a warning note to you-know-who,
I could sort it all out a lot quicker.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Just hold on a second.
I'll prepare the exit.
I want to see if we can escape down the elevator shaft up ahead.
In the meantime, have them stop what's causing all this.
Okay.
It'd be fucked if he still had a hidden ace up his sleeve.
Yes.
Mm!
Aw, I leave it up to you!
Hang in there, Ran.
Shinichi...
Eh?
We're not doing well.
Since the fire took longer than expected to go out,
the air pressure inside the cave has dropped more than I thought.
We'd better get out of here right away, before everything collapses.
- (female voice) "Opening door."
- (flashing pip)
"Don't come any closer, please."
(female voice) "Opening door. Don't come closer, please."
(Suzuki) Good, the paintings have been saved!
One, two, three, four, five, six...
(Suzuki) -What what?
Strange, there are only 6!
-How is it possible?
-It's true, yes, one is missing!
What?
How can it be?
The second picture isn't...
-Oh!
- Ashiya's "sunflowers" are missing!
(Suzuki, thinks) "Why? Why only "Ashiya's" sunflowers?"
(Headphones: Shinichi voice) "Don't suffer."
"Yes."
This voice... Is it you, Shinichi Kudo?
"A while ago, Ashiya's 'Sunflowers'...
have been packed fireproof and waterproof."
You again?

(Headphones) "You should always get into everything!"
Now, please listen carefully.
I have finally managed to protect the fifth "The Sunflowers"
and also "The Sunflowers" of Ashiya
from this traitor Judas among you.
Eh?
So it is true that there is a traitor!
"Yes. But you don't have to worry about anything, because I have found out who he is."
Aaa... En Koji Azuma has already been arrested.
"No, Mr. Azuma is not the traitor."
That's right, in Koji Azuma had no motive....
for wanting to burn and destroy the two "Sunflowers" paintings.
Besides, when the flowers started to burn,
he was talking to you.
This is true, but...
but there can't be any traitors among us!
Yes, he is right.
All together we have protected "Sunflowers".
It's true, it was the Kaito Kid who hinted...
that there might be a traitor.
It's absurd, to believe the words of a criminal like him.
I agree.
I think we should be glad that all the paintings were saved.
"Really..., Miss Natsumi Miyadai?"
(Headphones) "But what are you saying now?"
After the fire job?
"Acknowledge that your intention was to burn
both the fifth painting and Ashiya's 'Sunflowers'."
Mm?
"Yes, your intention was, from the beginning,
to destroy these two Van Gogh paintings, wasn't it?"
Stop talking nonsense!
Why should I do something like that?
"Let's see..."
We'll go through all the facts step by step.
"As in Kaito Kid caused that confusion at the auction,
"Security measures were tightened
and you couldn't get near 'sunflowers'."
"So you had to give up your attempt to destroy 'Sunflowers.
to destroy 'Sunflowers' in the United States."
"Then, while they were being transported to Japan,
he bribed a worker to place a bomb in the hold."
"But in the Kid he also discovered it and saved the painting."
"Then you changed the target from the fifth painting to the second."
"On Kid, who figured it out right away," he said,
"He sent a note of warning to Kogoro Mouri,
so that the security could be reinforced again."
"En Kid had squashed his plans twice,
"So, in order to get ahead of him,
"He put a fake letter from the Kid on the lid of the wooden box
"Which was used to protect one of the paintings,
and proposed to bring the paintings to him in his studio."
You mean the Kid actually wanted to protect the paintings?
That's a lie!
All this is the fruit of his imagination!
Of course it is!
He is right.
The Natsumi appreciates Van Gogh more than anyone else.
Why should she want to do something like that?
Yes, and furthermore, why should she want to destroy only two?
That's right, she's absolutely right.
I still don't know why he wanted to destroy only those two paintings.
(Keiko) "A fine Galdosan deduction, she has made!"
Perhaps she will explain her motives herself to us in a little while.
(Keiko) Oh!
(Keiko) "Let's get to work."
"Natsumi, if I understand correctly,
you personally wanted to decorate the hallway with sunflowers."
Aaa... yes.
"Is this true?"
"Taking advantage of your position as an appraiser, you have taken turpentine.
"which is often used to restore paintings,
"and poured it into the planters of the sunflowers,
which has turned them into a wick."
At no point did you ever come to think
that the thief might have taken advantage of my suggestion?
I don't think you can treat me like a criminal
just for circumstantial evidence!
"All right. The truth is that I wanted you to confess yourself."
"But if you want more concrete evidence I'll show you that too."
"On your computer...
is all the information about your plan to destroy the two paintings."
Well, I guess there's no escape for me now....
Should we really consider this way?
Did you join my team to destroy the fifth painting of "The Sunflowers"
and Ashiya's "Sunflowers"?
Correct.
But since the Kaito Kid has kept on tripping me up,
I couldn't achieve my purpose.
And that's why you decided to set fire to the Lake Rock Museum,
to burn "The Sunflowers",
because in Kaito Kid it would be difficult for you to access?
Yes..., but at the beginning it was not foreseen to be this way.

"First of all, I wanted to take advantage of the blackout....
to destroy the two paintings."
"Once done, it would have been all over."
"But not only in KID, security has also complicated me."
(Nakamori) I send agents to protect the second and fifth "The Sunflowers"!
How did he plan to destroy "The Sunflowers"?
Just touching them would have activated the security mechanism.
- (all) Eh?
-Well, it was very easy.
All you had to do was throw phosphate on them.
Phosphate?
A substance that ignites spontaneously at room temperature.
So, it was you who tried to kill me, right?
Of course it was!
With the death of the sponsor, the inauguration would be postponed.
Or maybe even the exhibition would be cancelled.
But why?
But, the fire, the explosion of the plane...
One little mistake and you could die too, Natsumi!
Yes, that's right!
This shows how much I love Van Gogh's "Sunflowers"!
I'd rather die than let those two fake copies
be exhibited next to the real "Sunflowers"!
"This you have said is a lie, and you know it very well."
The Art Institute of Chicago and the Van Gogh Museum have already proved that the fifth painting of "The Sunflowers" is a fake.
that the fifth painting of "The Sunflowers" is authentic.
"Van Gogh and Gauguin shared a canvas to paint two paintings."
"There can be no clearer proof."
"Since you are an appraiser, you must have known that, too."
"Besides..."
B-but...
You said you'd rather die,
but you set off the bomb on the plane just before landing.
And this fire has also set it off after making sure
that you would have enough time and an escape route.
"A-this..."
If she was willing to die, why hasn't she stayed at La Roca del Lago....
and prevented the Kaito Kid from putting out the fire?
"Deep down you're a selfish person who only thinks of yourself,
and a delinquent."
"She's not an art curator."
It was you from the beginning, huh?
Hands, please.
(Shinichi, think) "Instead of believing in expert appraisal,
"The woman who loved Van Gogh's paintings so much...
has ended up becoming a delinquent."
"Oh..."
Yes.
Well, then, case closed.
If I go alone, yes.
What about you?
Is there a way out?
No, I'd better not.
What do we do, then?
Do we ask for help?
Asking for help will only make things worse.
Wow!
Yes!
Is he all right?
It's a miracle he's still hanging on.
How much longer will this hold?
Just a little hole opens up,
air will come in from outside and then the whole thing will collapse.
Kid!
Will you be able to fly if you only carry Ran?
Could you fly, yes or no?!
Eh?
Nonsense!
Tell me this, come on!
Probably yes.
But dodging flying falling rocks
with such low atmospheric pressure...
won't be easy.
Raaan!
Kiiid!
Save the Ran!
Damn, now he's playing the hero!
Ah!
Ah...
Thanks to this child's body, maybe there's still a way out.
Oh, my God!
If we go on like this, we're going to fall!
Where is the exit?
It's over there!
Come on, let's go!
(Shinichi, thinking) "Maybe I'll be able to get into the picture elevator!"
Ah!
Ah...!
Ah...!
Ah...
Ah... Ashiya's "Sunflowers"!
-We have to find Conan and Ran!
-Oh, mother!
The water tank...
-Huh?
Look!
-That doesn't look good.
(Oh, she thinks) "It can't be... they're still in there."
It's been a little while!
Mm..., mm...
I've come out very well by the skin of my teeth.
Eh?
Shinichi..., you came to save me.
Yes, Ran.
And it went really well.
-The Kid and Ran are flying!
-Oh, where are you going?
-Really?
We have to go see him!
-What?
Sonoko!
Run, come!
-The Ran and the Kid, flying?
-The Ran and the Kid are flying!
-Did you say Kid?
-Where are they?
No, you can't go this way either.
There are no more exits.
At this rate I'll end up dying with Ashiya's "Sunflowers".
Aaaah...!
(Explosions)
My goodness!
I hope you were able to get out..., detective.
-Ran!
-Ran!
-Ran!
Where are you?!
-Where are you, Ran?
(All) Ran!

Oh!
Ran, are you all right?
Ouch...
Aaa... father.
Ran!
You're not hurt, are you?
(Both) Are you okay?
(Both) Eh?
Yes, Shinichi my salvation.
You're sure?
No, it was in Kaito Kid.
You don't remember?
-With his glider, like this!
What?
Sure, it's true.
It wasn't Shinichi, but the Kaito Kid.
(Kogoro) And where's the boy?
Do you know where he is?
No, the Kid has only taken you.
(Kogoro) Eh?
In Conan is not here?
It can not be!
In Conan is still there!
-Is it?
-Yeah? -Huh?
Is he really?
Ah..., MHM...
Aaaah...!
(Shinichi, thinks) "If I go on like this, I won't make it,
in less than a minute I'll be drowned."
"I can move this with a ball, but then it'll all collapse....
and he'll end up submerged under water."
"I've got it! Submerge me!"
"All this falling water...
means I'm below the water level of the lake."
"That is, if I use the ball....
"And I manage to destabilize the rock and change the pressure..,
I'll shoot to the surface!"
"Come on, let's go! MHM!"
"Five, four, three, two, two, one..., zero!"
Iaaaah...!
- (both) Conan!
-Conan!
- (Mitsuhiko) Please come out from where you are!
- (Genta) Conan, what are you doing?
- (branch: crack)
-Nano, but what the hell are you doing?
-Mm?
- (Genta) Conan!
Calm down, Conan will come out.
It will come out.
Please, Conan... Please come out..., Conan.
(Shinichi, thinks) "A little more, a little more..."
Ah...
Hey, something's coming out!
-Oh!
They've been saved!
- "The sunflowers!"
In Conan and I have saved together these sunflowers in their box.
In Conan must be very close.
What?
Please look at Conan!
Conan, where are you?
(All) Conan!
(Conan!
Conan?
Conaaaan!
Mm... Ran...
Yes, on the other side of the painting!
-Hey, there's something else!
- (Genta) Yes!
- (Ayumi) But where?
- (Suzuki) All right!
- (all) Yes!
-That's it, Conan!
Hold on!
-Very good, Conan!
Yes!
Kogoro, have you done badly?
I'm so glad...
Well done, little one!
That's the way I like it, nightmare of the Kaito Kid!
Oh! (Suzuki: laughter)
(Suzuki: guffaws)
No.
Hey, kid, are you hurt?
Well done, you protected "Sunflowers".
(Suzuki: laughs) Very good!
- (bullet: enters the chamber)
-He always gets all the glory.
There's something I still don't understand.
Could you explain it to me?
-How did you know who the traitor was?
-Huh?
Because they left a message on my answering machine offering me a job:
to steal the second and fifth paintings of "Sunflowers".
I get it.
You're quite an expert at disguising tea,
and you can easily recognize other people's voices, too, right?
But why did you have to put obstacles in his way?
-What was in it for me?
-What was in it for you?
I wanted to show Ashiya's "Sunflowers" to someone.
Show it to him?
That day, amidst the hellfire of the Ashiya bombing...,
"...a carpenter entrusted 'The Sunflowers'...
to a woman who secretly loved it."
"The woman saw him die before her eyes."
How do you know this, if it happened so long ago?
I was told by a man who witnessed it happen.
"A man who as a young man had been a servant in that house."
"The man, who saved his first love from that fire,
asked me for help."
"He told me he wanted to show her Ashiya's 'Sunflowers'."
I get it.
That explains everything.
One question: you're not going to stop me?
- (laughs)
-I'll let you go this time.
But we both know you won't be able to catch me.
I'll turn a blind eye out of respect for the man who asked you for help
and to his... tragic love story.
Let's leave it at that.
I see I was wrong about you, Inspector Charlie.
I think the same about you.

Where has she gone?
I've been looking for her for hours and I can't find her, someone must have stolen her!
Who did it?!
Who did it?!
Who stole my ticket?
Aren't you going to tell him that they finally cancelled the exhibition?
No, she'll see it on the news.
How come you're so cold to me?
I can see that looking at you will make me regret it someday.
What's the meaning of this?
What is the meaning of this?
It's a piece of advice a certain person gave me.
Sale, ticket!
I want my ticket!
I want my ticket!
