Stars have a certain appeal.
Whether they are culprits or actors.
The Junior Detective League has a great adventure.
There's the set-up of an eccentric mansion!
Let's go get the treasure!
He looks like a kid but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

The mountains are the men.
Au!
Genta, stop being lazy.
Eh?
Help us gather firewood, come on!
What?
I'm not being lazy!
Yes I am!
See?
You see?
Yes, man!
With this firewood is not enough to do anything!
Ah, really?
He-he-he-he-he-he-he!
How come Conan isn't here, eh?
Not again, Genta, we've told you before!
Aaa... aaaatxum!
Mmmm?
Have you caught a cold?
Atxum!
(Shinichi voice) It's not that!
Mm?
Shinichi...
Tell me, what did you want to talk to me about?
(Thinking) "I shouldn't have asked you."
Ah, it was the song!
The one about the "Seven Little Crows."
You know it, don't you?
Yes.
Crow, little crow, why are you cawing?
Yes, this one.
It was this one, wasn't it?
I always sang it when I came home from school.
So what?
Is this your music homework?
No, it's not homework.
It's the 0858 phone prefix I told him.
When I dial it on my cell phone and press the keypad rhythmically, it sounds like this, right?
0858... # Raven... # Mmmm... Let me-let me try it.
(Pip, pip, pip, pip, pip)
Mmmmm?
It's true, but...
I finally remembered.
When Vermut sent the message to her head,
I felt nostalgia and sadness.
But it wasn't because of the expression on her face,
but by the sound... of the keys she was pressing!
So, you're saying...
that when you dial her boss's number
it sounds like the "Seven Peti Crows" song?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's impossible!
Why would he use a children's song?
Eh?
What if I told you that they remember the number by... the melody?
Yes.
Oh!
For the melody?
That way they don't need to save the phone number
to the memory of the mobile head and it is more secure.
It is true that 0858 may sound like "Crow, little crow", but....
(Pip, pip, pip, pip)
sounds like "why are you squawking" is not so easy.
Well, it's true that it doesn't sound as good,
but if we take into account the small difference in sound...
(Pip, pip, pip, pip)
and we put it all together...

It goes like this:
this... is the phone number of the head of the men in black!
What?
I beg your pardon?!
I'm sure this is it.
Hey, don't tell me you've sent a message to this number, eh?
No, man!
How stupid do you want me to be to tell you where we are?
He-he-he.
I figured as much.
You had me scared.
He-he-he-he!
I will indeed send a message,
but after I've informed the investigator Takagi.
(Ouch) He will be eliminated.
Investigator Takagi.
He will be eliminated once they know...
that he is trying to find out who the boss is.
After that, their target will be the one who gave him the phone number.
So, not only investigator Takagi should know about it,
but the police should also be informed,
above all, to be able to deal with the organization...
Impossible.
Right after that incident maybe... something could be done,
but now, the case has been closed as a kidnapping.
And, except for investigator Takagi,
it's unthinkable that anyone else would believe this story.
Yes, to get the police moving,
we would need that number when the time came.
But you can be introduced to a person you wouldn't have even imagined.

That I would not have imagined?
No..., don't tell me?
Do you know who it is?
Don't tell me you know what the number is or who is... the head?!
Who knows, this?
But it's a pity.
Although we might have the phone number of his boss,
we can't do anything...
Well, you'd better forget..., about all this.
You shouldn't open the phone when that number rings anymore.
It would be like opening Pandora's box...
THE GREAT ADVENTURE AT THE ECCENTRIC MANSION.
THE RAID
(Genta) Eh?
What did you say?
What's this about the "panda box"?
Tell us, Conan.
What is a treasure?
Conan, don't tell me there's a panda inside?
No, Ayumi, it's Greek mythology.
A god filled a box with all the evils...
and disasters that were in the world.
Then he gave it to Pandora and told her never to open it, you know?
If you tell a person not to do something, the more he wants to do it.
What an ass you are, Genta!
Exactly.
Pandora disobeyed the words of God, opened the box,
and this led to evil and disasters in the world...
Yes...
The story said so.
And what was that about the panda box?
(At the same time) Yes, that!
No... It's nothing.
Speaking of which,
while you were collecting firewood, we found a strange stone urn.
A stone urn?
What are you talking about?
Yes, it's a stone that looks like an ancient urn with a round hole in it.
When we looked inside through the hole, we saw that it was full of letters...
It says something about the rock god and I don't know what else.
There were words written in kanji characters.
We couldn't read it all.
Can you take me to the place where you found the stone urn?
Yes!
-Come on, let's go!
-Come on, let's go!
Yes!
-This way!
-It's this way!
It's this way!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
No need to mail.
Yes, it's true...
That's nothing.
You've gone to the boondocks for firewood, guys.
-That's right!
-Look, it's over there!
I didn't know there was such a big mansion in a place like this!
(Mitsuhiko) When you look at it again...
(Genta) It falls to pieces...
Oh..., holy virgin, this mansion is in a pitiful state.
- (Mitsuhiko) You can say that.
- (Genta) It looks sinister...
It looks like it's been... abandoned for many years, doesn't it?
(Thinking) "This place is..."
(Ayumi) Conan!
Yes.
This is it!
(Ayumi) Come!
(Ayumi) This is the stone urn you wanted to see, Conan!
We were looking inside this pond...
and we found this sunken urn.
There was a carp swimming inside!
We tried to climb up the urn to get the carp,
and that's when... we saw the letters.
But the carp got away from us.
Isn't this a stone from a garden light?
-What does it say?
A garden lamppost?
- (at the same time) What?
Yes.
You see many of this kind in Japanese gardens.
They are a lanterns made... of stone!
(Agasa) "This part, surely,
(Agasa) "It's the center section where the candle is placed."
Now that you say it, it seems that's what you say,
but if it were a lamppost,
the cover and the foot should be on the ground or somewhere else.
Right, right.
It's just that they are.
Inside the raft and there's not just one or two.
-Yeah, that's right!
-Eh?
We were so focused on the tent that we didn't notice.
Surely, they threw all the lanterns they had put in the garden...
into this raft.
They wanted to make it look... that this place had never had...
...garden lampposts.
They didn't want anyone but them..,
to decipher... the code that they had found,
so they could keep the treasure for themselves!
(At the same time) A... A treasure?!
Is that what you said?
Are you serious?
Yes... It's very likely.
No, that's not all...
It seems that hiding the code
wasn't the only motive for sinking the lampposts.
-What do you mean?
- (at the same time) What?
It seems that they also wanted to hide a crime!
(At the same time) What?
(thinks) "It's terrible!"
The temperature of this raft is about 20 degrees Celsius.
However, if the gases from the decomposition...

have not yet accumulated in the body means...
that the victim has not been dead long.
And from the marks on her neck,
it's likely that he was strangled to death,
and then thrown into the raft.
The lampposts must have been put on top of him so that he wouldn't float.
I don't know...
And who has been able to do this?
It must have something to do with the treasure...
"Teruhisa Tamai... 42 years old..."
What do you have?
Did you find out anything?
No, it's just a driver's license.
That's all... Eh?
There's something inside...
Is it... Is it the treasure?
No, this is...
It's a magatama, a sacred stone seed.
It has the word "flame" engraved on it...
Don't tell me that's the treasure?
Yes, it's just a stone with a strange shape...
Hey, there's a dead person here.
There's a dead person here.
How can he be talking about a treasure?
Doctor, please call the police immediately!
Yes, understood.
(Tut-tut)
I could see it coming, that.
The cell phone has no reception.
I'll go back to where we have the store and call from there!
(Tut-tut) Doctor!
Doctor, thank you very much!
Guys, as it's getting dark, we should also go to the store.
What?
We're leaving as if nothing happened?
That's right!
But we've got the treasure right under our noses, man!
-Yes!
-That's right!
You fools!
The person who has died this man could still be hiding here!
What do you want?
To be attacked for gossiping?
What do you want to say?
Listen to me.
About this person, we only know the name.
But we know absolutely nothing else about him!
(Ai) He looks like a treasure hunter...
Look, Conan, this notebook is full of information...
and maps of treasures scattered all over Japan.
Really?
And the search for this latest treasure is also noted in detail.
"I've been able to ally myself with a partner who's pretty good."
"So I'll be able to get rid of
"That thief who boasts of being a genius."
(He thinks) "A thief who boasts of being a genius?"
"That magician has fooled me... once... and again..."
"The tocom where the Gods reside is to be seen in the sun,
"In the place of noise and traffic,
"Where the elders of wisdom gather in adunança."
"There it is where the stone of the gods remains..."
"Those who are not frightened by the wrath of the gods...
"With hands revessegades of stones,
"They will teach proverbs of times past."
"Samizu Kichiemon."
(Mitsuhiko) Eh?
Samizu?
Samizu Kichiemon?
The one from the last Tokugawa shogunate?
Yes, he is the creator of the mechanical puppets...
that financially helped the samurai...
who supported the Shogun!
Oh, that's great!
Mechanical puppets?
Yes, like the one...
...who brought you tea, remember?
And that wasn't all.
When he finished taking your tea,
he'd put the cup back where he'd taken it from!
I bet he used a remote control!
No.
It wasn't necessary.
I'm telling you it moved by itself, Genta.
Eh?
Ayumi, then how did it work, di?
Mmmm... I don't know very well, but...
They say that, inside, all they have are springs and gears.
There are also different types,
and many of us can tell what they look like from descriptions that have been made.
Wow, you're really smart.
-The other day I saw a program on TV that talked about.
The puppets he made at Kichiemon
were very much appreciated by the feudal lords and merchants,
because they seemed to have a life of their own.
He made a great fortune in a single generation.
Does this mean that the puppet of the god of strength that he made in Kichiemon
Is somewhere in this mysterious house?
(Thinks) "The puppet of the god of strength?"
No..., no, even if it was here, it's already been 140 years....
If he was hiding in this godforsaken mansion,
it would be in pieces by now.
"Now it's useless junk?"
The treasure is... the Rock of God!
Do you know?
"The tocom where the Gods reside is to see the sun,
"In the place of noise and traffic,
"Where the elders of wisdom gather in adunança."
"There it is where the stone of the gods remains."
This, he says.

Yes, and what does this mean?
What is the meaning of the letters that are engraved on that stone?
Hm.
They are very difficult and it's hard to understand what they say?
To put it more simply.
The stone of the gods, we will find it in a place close to the sun...
where the Gods sleep;
that is to say: a very frequented place where the elders gather.
-It's not just any stone, is it?
-What is this stone of the gods?
No, it isn't.
The god of strength has... a very, very hard stone.
(At the same time) A very hard stone?
Let's see, in other words...
The king of precious stones, a diamond!
-Say... - (once) Diamond?
Yes, they say that diamonds came to Japan...
towards the end of the shogunate government...
So, chronologically, it would make sense.
Blow!
Now that you mention it, on that TV show,
they said that a strange map was found in the warehouse at Kichiemon.
The man surely saw the map on some TV show,
and with the data he found this mansion and these lampposts.
And the fellow in whom he had trusted
and who he thought would be useful to him ended up killing him.
Yeah, this is probably what happened.
Wait, guys, there's something else written in here, look!
Yes, what comes next is the problem.
"Those who are not terrified by the wrath of the gods..."
"Those who are not frightened by the wrath of the gods."
(He thinks) "So it is, here?"
And then... "with his hands full of stones."
(He thinks) "Eh? 'With hands full of stones'?"
Hey, Conan, what's up?
Tell us what comes next!
(He thinks) "His hands...
"Filled... with great joy!"
"No doubt about it!"
(Flow) Hey, let's leave it at Conan and go find the treasure.
More like yes...
(Au, let's go look for the treasure...
-What?
But without Conan we won't be able to crack the code.
Do not worry.
I think the key that starts the engine is already in place.
(thinks) "This is interesting."
"A mansion full of montages, that's great."
Aaaaaaaah!
Skulls!
Stop it!
It's a trap!
(All) Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
And the next Conan:
"The great adventure in the eccentric mansion. The montages"
