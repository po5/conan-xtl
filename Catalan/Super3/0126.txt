The murder of the traveling theater troupe, part 1
(Sonoko) runs a traveling theater troupe?
"Tamanosuke Ito Company. Second generation."
"Performance of the continuators of" The Successor's Proclamation ".
Do you also play female roles?
Yes.
Before the main performance,
I'll dance 3 pieces with transformism included.
I will go!
I won't miss it for anything!
(Thinking) "Oh mother, I'll lose my mind!
How wonderful!"
You can travel all over Japan, it will be fantastic.
Yes, we tour places and travel once a year.
So you had already come here, in Beika's theater?
Yes, two years ago.
But the director was my father and I was not as well known as I am now.
Your father... died?
A year ago now... of an illness.
Then the company was reduced by half.
I'm ashamed to talk about it, but it was hard.
Surely...
It's all right!
We'll split up all this paperwork!
Leave that stuff for us and concentrate on rehearsals.
Thank you!
I'll work hard!
Well, here's the situation.
In a month he's changing schools again,
why don't you take him aside?
He has lifted your shirt and now he wants me to hand out the flyers.
Handing out the flyers was my idea,
to let me see what it's like behind the scenes!
You can keep an eye on things while you're at it!
-Sorry, we anem.-Watch out, girls!
Nothing will happen, you'll see.
In Tamanosuke looks weak, very handsome and not bad.
Let's go.
If I found myself in a difucultat, I wind him a pineapple, right?
Don't talk about me like I'm your bodyguard.
Excuse me, excuse me, we hurried Contact Us.
Hey, Ran.
A new you?!
I can come too, right?
-And us too?
-We want to come!
If we go so many we'll be in their way.
We'll take you when they start the show.
Now be good boys.
We'll be back before dinner.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
He told me to go in through the artists' entrance.
But we could go in through the front door.
Shall we go in this way?
I don't know.
Maybe we'll catch them rehearsing.
Wait Sonoko.
It's all right, don't worry.
Rehearse, rehearse.
(Apludiments)
How cool!
-Hello!
Welcome! -Hello.
(At the same time) -We come to see you! -We are here to see you!
But...?!
Hi, guys.
You are also welcome.
I told you you couldn't come!
I don't mind.
It's okay, let there be people.
Oh, really?
You're very kind, Tamanosuke.
I'll introduce you all.
Our star, capable of anything.
His name is Ryuichi Muraki.
Hello.
Yuri Shirai plays the daughter.
Hello!
We help hand out the flyers, we are Sonoko and Ran.
The action scenes are awesome!
If you don't offer special things, the audience doesn't respond.
When I was going to school I was in the rhythmic gymnastics club,
and because of that I was admitted.
That's not the only reason.
Cheer up and work hard.
Let's go to the dressing room.
-Come on, come upstairs with me. (All) Yes!
We urgently need to rehearse the script, tell the teacher to hurry.
Understood.
I'm sorry, can you wait a bit, please?
Casum!
It's a good thing that tomorrow the theater is having a party, otherwise...
Hey, we're going to take the brochures and leave.
Excuse me...
Don't worry, don't worry.
If we rehearse the new play later, everything will be all right.
But, the day after tomorrow we'll have the premiere, right?

Since our theater lease is running out, we don't have much time to spare.
Boy, you sure are busy.
Why don't we perform "The Proclamation of the Successor"
and decided on a new play?
I'm... Megumi.
Ah, it's my little sister.
Hello, pretty one.
Being a klutz, I do things properly.
My name is Megumi.
Apa, girl.
Little brother, you make us head over heels, with your whims!
You don't have time to waste dazzling girls.
Snap out of it!
Come on, enough, Megumi.
In fact, we just showed up unannounced.
I'll be accompanying this group for the time being,
director, you must concentrate exclusively on the play.
-Hey... Yes... Take the sleep out of your ears!
Take them for a tour of the dressing rooms.
Come in!
(Thinking) "Oh, mother!
It seems that with the death of the father this has become a pot of crickets."
You're the Edogawa, aren't you!
You finally came!
How do you know what it's called, in Conan?!
Because today I started at the Teitan school and they told me.
-You're not in our class, are you? -No.
I'm from C!
But as in Conan my little brother was taught when he was little,
I asked and they told me.
We become friends very soon!
Well, first let's see the director's dressing room and mine.
I'll show you a picture of my brother when he was little.
-You too, come! -What does he think he's doing?
What a cutie!
What a hit he is, with the kids!
Wait a second, wait a second.
We don't have all the luggage unpacked yet.
(Thinking) Come on!
I've got it!
I-I got it.
Don't you?
You identical!
Ah!
How cute!
"And what else! What the hell do I look like?
-Come on, if it is a transvestite! -It's a play.
Let's see...
Wow!
Tamanosuke is super cute!
It's true, he looks like Conan!
If you put on makeup, you'd look really cute!
Very well, let's go to the other dressing room.
Come, come, come, come, follow me.
Always so naive.
Children are unique!
-Hello. -I'll show you embargo, Itoe.
It's Itoe Ogihara.
She keeps the company's accounts and is an actress.
In Conan Edogawa and his friends.
They like the show very much.
Pleased to meet you!
Come in.
As I had already prepared the costumes, you can do it quietly.
Is he your boyfriend, Megumi?
That's not true!
Ah, sorry.
That must be you, right?
"This isn't true either.
I'm a princess! -You're laughing!
Come on, Conan, you too!
Ran, let's go home, please!
Ran, please!
It'll be a good experience!
Try it, come on!
No!
No!
No!
Noooooo!
(thump)
What's wrong?!
Leave me alone!
What happened?!
Tamanosuke!
Damn you!
What the fuck is he doing?
Change!
Let him know that we have differing opinions.
Little brother!
Little brother, are you okay?!
I'm fine.
It's bad!
What happened to the play, Mr. Chikaishi!
I've finished it.
I'm printing it right now.
He wanted me to rewrite the ending and I bullied him.
If you don't understand how the world works, you won't be any good the next day.
Oi, Mr. Tajima?
As long as I understand how everything works, we'll live happily ever after.
Well, I'm out of cigarettes.
Tajima, buy me one like this.
Tajima, I'll buy it myself!
That's not necessary.
Tajima...
This is unforgivable, Master Chikaishi!
Megu, it doesn't matter.
Why did you change what we agreed at the beginning?
Reality is reality and theater is theater.
Well, we'll do the reading right away.
Then we'll talk about the ending.
See you later.
Thank you very much.
When I've finished printing, make copies.
Until then I'll be in the dressing room resting.
Tamanosuke....
(Thinking) "What's going on here?
For him to be a young director should not treat him violently."
What a blast!
He prints them and they're coming out all the time!
It's finished!
Sir, thank you for finishing it.
"Chronicle of the Capture of ITAR, the Edo Saltaterrats."
Eh?
Saltaterrats of Edo?
Yes!
It's that Saltaterrats of Edo everyone's talking about today.
I've taken it as a model.
You don't mind giving it to me, do you?
Master, you've done an excellent job.
I'll take it to make copies.

Yes!
What a break!
I've finally finished it, period.
Maybe I'll take a snooze.
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
This is all documentation on the Saltaterrats?
Who is this guy?
Half a year ago he started his activity in Tokyo.
He's a thief who operates over a wide area.
He flees across rooftops and disappears by doing acrobatic stunts.
The police called him Edo Saltaterrats for internal use,
but it was leaked to the media
and it stuck as a nickname.
In this company they have acrobats,
is that why you have taken the Saltaterrats as a model?
Yes, and because we also tour Japan.
Suspicions had been raised and the police questioned us.
I don't know what the director was thinking,
but making the new play about the Saltaterrats of Edo is fine.
That's why he wanted to consult such precise information.
When I enter it into the computer, certain things come to light.
Conan, come here for a moment.
Oh, my goodness, a very pretty girl has come for you.
If you don't want to get spanked, go away!
Sorry for the inconvenience.
What were you doing, with what the dreadful thing has done to Tamanosuke?
How is he?
He's resting.
He's had a bad shock.
We're going back to the street.
We'll distribute the publicity.
Come with us.
You don't want to go back yet!
No, I don't want to go back yet!
We've been in your way, so we'll help you.
Yes, I know that.
But the gentleman from before has gone out that way.
There's no exit near us.
But the dressing room exit leaves us near the station!
Will they invite us for a drink?
No, that's not it.
We'll hand out the publicity.
(Sonoko) We'll buy you a drink.
Hurry up.
(Ayumi) Hurray! (Genta) We'll get fed up!
(Sonoko) Go to the theater!
Here, sir!
Here, sir.
(Thinking) Those people are hiding something!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
You know it's impossible to run away from us!
Let's go, guys!
What have you done with the propaganda?
A lady from the city council took all of it!
We cheat as much as you do.
Let's go see them!
You wanted to go back to the theater, didn't you?
I can tell you're from the Junior Detective League.
I'm so glad!
I thought you'd already left!
Look at me!
Does it fit?
Now we do the dress rehearsal.
Cheer me up.
Ah... yes.
But the director is well?
Yes, I feel fine.
I'm sorry about before.
Tamanosuke, you look great! So you play ITAR!
Yes.
It's a short play.
You can stay and watch it.
Yes!
Thank you so much! (All) Ooooh!
(All) Ooooh!
Ooooh!
Fixeu's in it!
It's like samurai movies!
(All) Hey!
Watch out!
Don't move!
What's this?
There's... Is there a hole?
Excuse me.
We call this a moat.
Be careful!
This pit is very deep!
If someone falls in, we'll be in trouble!
-Excuse me... -Excuse me, please.
Ah!
What a pimp!
He's a thief!
It's unbelievable!
One minute and 40 seconds.
Wow.
That's nothing, that's how long it takes.
Then he's backstage,
down the stairs while he's changing and up with the platform.
It looks like magic!
But since we have no assistants, it takes too long.
Stop it.
Stop explaining our shortcomings to them.
Take them to the spectators' seats.
Here you'll be in the middle!
That's where you can see everything better!
And you, Megumi, don't you have to do the dress rehearsal?
Ouch!
Where's my head?
Well, you'll look at it all, won't you?
Yes.
Don't kick.
Fins now.
(Think) "In what way has it changed at the end of the play, in Chikaishi?"
"After doing the reading,
the company got into the situation."
"The story talks about how ITAR, a young man in the Edo era,
with his assistant and sister Megu,
discovers the identity of the Saltaterrats of Edo,
a thief who plunders all over Japan,
and this leads him to follow a person from a company of artists."
"When he tries to capture him,
the Saltaterrats turns out to be the artist's twin brother."
"And so, the troupe sets out on a new journey."
"Despite the title," The Chronicle of ITAR's Capture ",
I find it strange that ITAR is wrong about who the killer is."
Conan, what?

What did you think?
-It was fantastic!
-It was great!
That's great, Megumi.
Little brother, can I give some refreshments to my friends?
-Yes!
Give them! -Guys, wait a moment.
Megumi, we must finish the last details.
Ask Master Chikaishi to come.
Very well, then.
OK, OK, OK.
Master!
Master!
He must be sleeping, though.
I'm coming in!
Master, wake up.
(The Megumi called)
Megumi!
Megumi!
What's happened?
Little brother, Master Chikaishi is dead.
She was killed by a blow from behind.
The murder weapon is this vase.
Someone call the police!
Quickly!
(Think) "Mmm? What is it, this exaggerated shaking?"
"Does it make you fearful or rather...?"
"The floppy disk is gone!"
What's wrong with you?
Are you ok?
Yes... There's nothing wrong with me.
Nothing's missing?
It looks like the camera's been disturbed.
No, nothing is missing.
Why don't you say you miss the diskette?"
The victim is the playwright attached to this company,
Tetsuo Chikaishi, 35 years old.
Am I very wrong?
No, you're not wrong, Inspector.
Conan!
I've started to get anxious and I find you here, you cheek!
Excuse me...
Coi!
You always do that to me!
Hello, Mr. inspector.
Hello, Mouri, how's everything?
The death took place an hour ago.
The killer could be someone from inside.
Yes.
Where were you, all of you, about an hour ago?
Uh... this...
We were on stage doing the dress rehearsal!
(thinks) "That's right."
"We were in the seats in the stalls and we saw it."
"The ones who didn't come out also stayed backstage."
"We only lost sight of them when they changed clothes."
When you went up with the platform, did you go alone?
Yes.
Besides, today we also have that technician from the theater.
Eh, yes, it's true...
(Thinking) "Mr. Chikaishi was murdered,
stole the floppy disk, hid it and came back?"
"I've got it!"
Mr. Inspector, Mr. Inspector, look for the diskette!
What the victim left on the table is gone.
Isn't it?
(He thinks) "Why should he hide it?"
"If he were the murderer,
the floppy disk would have been stolen by someone else."
"Or is he covering up for someone else?"
"Either way, there's a murderer here!"

Conan! I'm fine...

That note, according to the graphologist's results,
was written in Tamanosuke.
Tamanosuke is in danger!
The murderer is someone else!
