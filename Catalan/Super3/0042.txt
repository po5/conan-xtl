DETECTIVE CONAN
The Karaoke Murder
Christmas is coming and I have only you, to keep me company.
(Think) "The feeling is mutual..."
By the way, what about Shinichi?
Sometimes he calls me, but not very often.
What a face he has!
It's only Christmas once a year.
He doesn't have any kind of detail, that obsessed detective!
You're right, Sonoko.
He's so sure of himself.
It's a bad thing...
but other than that, it has to be said... it has its good things.
(Thinking) "Ran..."
But let's not talk about him anymore, Sonoko.
Do you like someone?
Of course I do!
He calls himself Tatsuya Kimura.
Eh, Tatsuya?
Yes, woman, I mean Tatsuya Kimura,
the singer of that famous rock band, the Lex.
(Thinking) "A random singer."
His band throws a party
and I'm going, thanks to my father's contacts.
I'll meet Tatsuya!
Do you want to come?
You want to come?
Will we get to see them in person?
(thinks) "He sure has good connections, the Suzuki company!"
When is it, the big day? Sunday.
Well, I'll come!
Looking at my eyes you will see that I love you very much!
(Audience) Very good!
Bravo!
Very good!
Of course, girls, sing much better than a group I know.
Tatsuya, you've been drinking too much for a while.
We have to go for an interview.
Shut up at once!
Leave me alone!
And now!
(Think) "He's really drunk."
Tatsuya, didn't you answer him badly, now?
Mari plays the role of manager.
What are you saying?
And you play the role of the drummer?
You'll never change, huh?
Mieko!
Maca!
This also goes for you.
You've excelled yourself today!
I'm sick of feeling you playing the guitar so badly.
-Sorry to keep you waiting. It's about time, Go!
I told the manager to reserve a table at your restaurant.
Thank you, Tatsuya, I really appreciate it.
You'll forgive me.
But it's sad, seeing the former lead singer of the group working here.
(Think) "He said the former singer."
(Christmas music)
This song is not...? # "Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer".
(Tatsuya) I requested it.
Dedicated to our manager.
It's for you. #
(Tatsuya) You believe in Santa Claus...
until you go to high school, right? #
It does a lot for you, this song, doesn't it? #
Always so important, our beautiful manager. #
(thinks) "What a scoundrel." #
I get it.
You want me to sing, don't you? #
-See you later, Tatsuya.
-Come on, bye, bye, bye. #
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you...
Wow, what a nice voice she has. #
(Think) "You bastard. What's wrong with him, this guy?"
And you're my sunshine...
"Gee, why is he so sad?" #
(Thinking) Very well.
Will you sing too, handsome?
Ah, no, not me. #
It's been a while, you're not here anymore...
Hey, Tatsuya, look at your friend.
Why does she cry, when she sings? #
Because I left her.
Eh?
I'm leaving Mieko, I'm leaving the group... #
Eh? Won't you sing with Lex, Tatsuya? #
That's right. #
When we're done with this tour, I'll fold. #

The other members already know. #

I won't have to put up with another bad drummer, #
or a childish guitarist or a stuck-up manager. #
It's over, fuck it! #
But, how strong!
(Rock)
Wow... Hey, it's my song!
Who asked for it? #

Tatsuya!
It's getting late.
We have to go do the interview. #
Come on, shut up!
Now I feel like singing, you guys! #
Look how stubborn you are. #

I'll call and say we'll be late. #

Hello, everyone!
Bloody Venus!
Look at me, my love, I'm back...
"In Tatsuya sang with a lot of feeling."

"It was her big hit, 'Bloody Venus.'"
"But no one knew it would be the last time we'd feel her voice."
"No one... taken from her killer!"
All right!
Very good! Very good, Tatsuya!
What girls, did you like it?
-You did very well! -Katsumi!
Pass me a rice ball, please.
Take it!
Here you go!
Thank you. Thank you.
Tatsuya, is it true that you're leaving the group?
Yes, but don't suffer.
I'll make my solo debut later.
Solo?
I even have the new song ready.
A new song... And you already have it ready.
What's the title?
It's titled... It's titled...
What's wrong with you, Tatsuya?
Tatsuya!
Get an ambulance!
An ambulance, quick!
(Thinking) "It's no use, he's already dead."
"Eh? This smells like...
...potassium cyanide."
"Someone has poisoned her."
"How come I didn't notice?"
"The first suspect was in Go sume, who brought food."
"He had been a member of the old group."
"But they only promoted on Tatsuya, who became famous."
"At first it seemed that the motive was jealousy."
"But everyone had eaten the same one, and in Go has ceased to be suspicious."
"According to the coroner, they found poison on the clothes he was wearing and the microphone."
"Therefore, he had the poison in his hand before he ate the rice."
Very well, gentlemen.
The murderer put poison on the microphone,
and when the victim picked it up, it stayed in his hand.
The only one who could do it is the person who sang before.
Yes, Mieko Shibasaki, you.
By the way, Miss, you cried, didn't you?
As if you were singing a farewell song.
Was there something between you two, Miss Mieko?
Tatsuya gave me pumpkin!
I brought it all on myself!
Mieko...
When I told him I was in love...
I'm sorry, Mieko, I'm in love with another woman.
Unfortunately, she's not here now... but I'll wait for her to come back.
Even if it takes a long time... I'll wait for her.
You told me that's why you couldn't love me.
And you got angry and...
It wasn't me!
It wasn't me!
(He thinks) "I was in love with someone else."
The song that Mieko sang, she had asked for it in Tatsuya.
She didn't know that she would sing in Tatsuya.
Therefore, she can't have put the poison into the microphone.
She is right, but...
And that song, "Bloody Venus", who had requested it?
Did he always throw his jacket like that when he sang?
He did it when he started to sing "Bloody Venus."
(thinks) "Maybe..."
Where on her clothes did she have it, the poison, on Tatsuya?
If I remember correctly, I think it was on his left elbow.
And in the group's jacket?
Well, we didn't find anything on Tatsuya's jacket.
(Thinking) "Yes! Of course!"
"I know how he has done it, the murderer,
because Tatsuya came in contact with the poison."
"The only person who could have done it
is one of the 3 wearing the same jacket."
Excuse me, Miss guitarist... Di.
Her manager and Tatsuya had just had a fight.
Did they fight very often?
Yes, all the time.
They fought over every little thing.
And it was always Tatsuya who started the fight.
But she's not as bad as Tatsuya made her out to be.
She's smart and nice, and she's also very discreet.
Everyone speaks well of her.
Inspector Megure!
Eh?
Hello.
We found these photos in Tatsuya Kimura's closet.
Let's see...
Well, I don't think this will give us any clues.
A photo?
A group photo?
They bring back a lot of memories.
This photo is from the old group,
before Tatsuya became famous and rich.
How things change.
The only ones who make a living from music are him and her.
I thought it was Tatsuya, the only one who left the group.
Look at this one, it's this one here.
(Go) In Tatsuya said that he didn't pray if she didn't go with him.
But she's not in this picture.
(Go) Here.
This is this one.
But she's changed a lot since then!
(Think) "It can't be..."
Look at this!
It looks very much like someone else.
(Thinks) "There's something written on the back."
Can I see her again?
(Think) "I get it!
"But if it's true...
it's a tragedy..."
"A terrible tragedy."
What a ?!
What are you saying now?
Do you know who the murderer is?

Hmm... Yeah, I get it.
Notify the investigators.
Let's get back to the crime scene! Yes, sir!
What happened, sir?
It's him, Ran.
He's back.
He?
The detective you know so well, woman!
Shinichi Kudo!
What?! What?!
"Shinichi is back! After so long, he's back!"
Shinichi!
("The red-nosed reindeer")
(Loudspeaker: adult voice) "Welcome! I thank you very much for being here. #
Shinichi!
I'm sure he's spying on us through this camera.
What's it like! #
Sonoko, let me see.
Come on! #
Where are you, Shinichi? #
Come on, let's go!
Let's get to work, we have to solve this crime. #
Shinichi! Hey, what song was that, this one?
(It's "Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer", Inspector. #
"When Christmas comes, you feel it everywhere."
"Besides, it's the song that has aroused the murderer's hatred."
Therefore, the murderer is the person to whom in Tatsuya has dedicated.
"Exactly, Tatsuya's killer is a woman,
the manager, Mari Terahara!"
"It's you!"
-The manager is the assassina -It's impossible.
It's a joke.
I was talking on the phone.
It wasn't here.
But I could have put the poison on him before,
I just had to get him to sing this song that you'll feel now.
(Rock)
It's Tatsuya's famous hit.
It's "Bloody Venus"! #

(Speaker) "Would you mind singing us a song?" ##
"You can use the mike I've left ready." #
"Evidently, it's not poisoned." #

Okay, I'll sing, if you're in the mood to feel me sing. #

"Eh? One moment, please."
"Why don't you take off your jacket?"
"Tatsuya always took it off, when he sang this song, didn't he?"
"Isn't that right, guys?"
Yes, indeed.
Come on, from the beginning.

Yes, like that, very good. #
(Loud speaker) "Don't forget the dance steps." #

And now more than ever I am free
and my life I want to live.
Go on your way...
She's very good.
(Go) She always has been!
When we used to sing together, she was one of the girls of the heart. #
...you better forget about the past
and don't think about what was.
The manager was a singer! #
Forget me!
What, are you happy now?
(Speaker: adult voice) "Yes."
"Now eat some food from this one I've prepared."
You mean this one?
"Come on, Miss, make like Tatsuya."
"Eat whatever you want."
"If you can eat it, of course."
No thanks... it's better to be safe.
When Tatsuya fainted, I touched him,
and they found poison on his hands and on his clothes.
Maybe it rubbed off on me a little!
Inspector, please look at the jacket you just took off.
The jacket, you say?
No need to look at it!
I put it on after I touched him!
It won't prove anything at all, if they find poison.
(Loud speaker) "No! It's not poison I'm looking for!"
A lighter?
(Loud speaker) "Exactly!"
Inspector, this is Tatsuya's lighter.
It wasn't at the crime scene.
Therefore, this jacket is not hers.
She changed it to hide the evidence.
This jacket is en Tatsuya's!
Before he came out to the scene,
she put the poison inside the sleeve of the jacket,
and when she put it on,
the poison stuck to his shirt sleeve.
It was only necessary for her to make him sing "Bloody Venus".
On Tatsuya, he has taken off his jacket as usual.
"The right hand has come in contact with the left elbow
and the poison passed into his hand, which he used to eat."
"That's how he ingested the poison."
But... why did he kill her?
"The motive for the murder can be deduced by looking at the photo."
"It's a photo of Tatsuya, when he played with Mr. Sume's band."
What does it have to do with the murder?
There is only the band, no one else.
(Loudspeaker) "Of course, inspector! She is there."
"She's the one in the middle, the one on Tatsuya's side."
This is her?!
(Loud speaker) "Of course!"
"The woman in the photo is the one who murdered him."
So, it was done...?
That's right!
I had plastic surgery.
For Tatsuya!
I was...
in love with him since we were singing together.

And then, he was promoted and became famous.
Mari!
You can be my manager.
Come with me!
"I was so happy."
"I thought maybe he felt the same way I did."
I had surgery because I was the kind of girl he liked.
But when I had the operation, his attitude changed.
He started laughing at me.
He saw that he made me sing.
I don't think he did it with bad intentions.
He just wanted to laugh at me,
and that's why he wanted me to be his manager.
I couldn't forgive him... because I loved him!
I couldn't forgive him!
(Speaker) "You're wrong, Miss Terahara."
"In Tatsuya Kimura I had always loved her."
No!
That's a lie!
You don't know anything!
Mari!
You're wrong.
It's true, what he says.
Inspector, the photo, please.
It's the song he wrote for you, the person he always loved.
That's a lie!
It's not a lie.
It's the lyrics of the song he was about to promote.
Tatsuya was always talking about you.
Why the hell did he have to change his face for me, Mari?
In Tatsuya he always laughed at me...
He never expressed his true feelings.
It seems to me that he wanted you to go back to the way you used to be, Mari.
No... I didn't realize it.
Now I understand.
She's not here now, but I'll wait for her to come back.
Now you know.
I'm sorry, Mieko.
I'm in love with another woman.
(Think) "The woman I was in love with was the manager."
Tatsuya...
Tatsuya... Tatsuyaaaaaaaa!
"A young man who couldn't express his feelings
and a woman who hid her true face."
"That misunderstanding caused this great tragedy."
"In the midst of her sadness and tears...
only a few photo smiles."

(Agasa) This happened because you took out Shinichi Kudo.
She's been waiting here for 3 hours, thinking you'll come home.
I'd like to help you, but my hands are tied, Conan.
Ran...
Eh?
Shinichi!
Are you there?
Shinichi...
Shinichi?
Come on, where have you been?
Answer me, if you feel me.
What?
Is the power out?
Shinichi!
Shinichi!
Shinichi?
(Adult voice) Yes, it's me.
I finally made it back.
Shinichi...
You donkey.
Why are you crying?
Did you miss me so much?
Me, finding you missing?
I'm glad to see you.
And I'd like to...
Shinichi...
...I could see the chard face you make!
What do you mean?!
Oh, I have to go.
Eeeh?
I still have to finish solving that case.
Bye, Ran!
Shinichi, wait!
Oh!
Shinichi!
Eh?
"Merry Christmas. I hope you like it! Shinichi."
(Thinks) "You don't need to suffer for me anymore....
Ran..."
It's here!
It's here, Conan!
It's your mother!
(Think) "No! Conan Edogawa can't have any mother!"
Professor Agasa!
(Think) "What?! Who is he, this masked man?"
No!
In the next episode...
The kidnapping of Conan Edogawa
