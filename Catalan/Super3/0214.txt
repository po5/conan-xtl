THE CASE OF THE RETRO ROOM
Father!
It has, the ticket.
Thank you.
I still don't know why you don't come to Dofiland with us.
At my age, people don't go to see dolphins!
A man wants to...
Go to the horse races!
I feel it's a lucky day!
And tonight I'm buying you dinner!
I know you, and I'd be satisfied if you don't gamble the house!
What a thing to say...
(Girl) I know, that!
Yes, woman, yes, so far!
-What does it say, Naomi? -Well... that we should hurry up.
Aaah!
Pair of lovelies in sight!
Oooh!
Excuse me, but aren't you Kogoro Mouri?
Eh?
Mouri, the famous detective?
That's me!
Oh!
I can't believe it.
I'm a fan of yours!
Kaori, woman, don't be cheeky!
No way, it's my pleasure!
We're staying at the Dofiland Hotel.
And you, where are you?
Look what a coincidence, we were also going...
At the racetrack, you were going there.
Listen, we could go together, if you don't mind.
That's a great idea!
Ah... Come on, come on, ladies.
But, it's just that we're expecting a friend...
(Girl) Kunikooo!
Kaoriii!
Have I kept you waiting long?
Ooooh!
Another beauty!
-You've arrived on time. -But you haven't.
Oh... Weren't we getting on the 1:20 train?
Ten minutes to go, still.
Come on, aren't you in...?
Indeed, detective Kogoro Mouri.
Look what a coincidence!
Wow!
We're from the same graduating class at the university.
Well...
Last week we had an alumni reunion,
and a friend of mine, who works abroad, couldn't come.
But she even said that just today she was coming back from vacation,
so we decided to have a reunion ourselves.
So we don't pay 3, but 4!
And she is the queen, the one who manages all the men behind him!
The queen!
And where did you say she is?
Where is she?
Well, she also stays at the Dofiland Hotel.
She works as a children's clothing designer for a European firm.
A director, 2 designers...
What a combination of beauty and talent, wonderful salaries!
Oh, don't say such things...
And of course you are right.
Especially Kuniko!
-Eh?
-So right, woman.
You're going to set up your own studio soon, aren't you?
Yes, but...
What great news!
Ha-ha!
I'm the exception, I'm a housewife...
What do you mean, by that, silly?
You think it has no merit?
Of course, you make cheeks of happiness, mind you!
Oh, no... I've put on weight...
(Loudspeaker: man) "Next movement on track 1,
"Train bound for Dofiland."
This is our train.
Wait for me, I'm coming, fourth beauty of the day!
Sometimes it pays off, the train!
Imagine that!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
This building is the Dofiland Hotel.
It opened last month, after renovations.
Oh!
From that, I call it a classic decoration.
(Kuniko) This floor is called the "retro floor".
The retro apartment?
They decorated it in the style of the old Dolphin Hotel that used to be there.
They did it as a tribute.
Come on, Naomi's room is this way.
At your service!
Hey, Kuniko.
Which room was it, Naomi?
I'd say 503.
503... Ah, it's here!
We're stuck together, now it's two o'clock!
Look.
He calls us to tell us to hurry up and then he goes to bed?
Man...
It's a mess.
Naomi!
Naomi?
Look how nice...
Come on, if she hasn't locked the door...
Never mind, we're going in!
-Naomi. -We went in, eh?
No, father!
You don't even know her!

No, yes...
- (Kuniko) What is all this? - (girls: call out)
What happened?
Na... Naomi!
Nooo!
Oh, no!
Just take it easy!
Nobody touch anything in the room!
I said, don't touch anything, damn it!
I didn't touch anything, it turned itself off.
It's one of those old coin ones.
-What?
- (wringing his neck)
Ran, call the police, come on! Ah, yes.
(Man) What happened?
They say they've killed someone!
Let's see, so the first ones to find the body...
were you 3 and the heavy... that bad weather calls, right, Mouri?
Well... yes...
We'll have to ask you ladies some questions.
Don't you mind waiting a moment?
Aaah... I'll act as your bodyguard, okay?
That won't be necessary.
Hey, Chiba!
I'm coming!
Take care of them.
Yes, sir!
I will!
This way, ladies.
Snap out of it, Mouri!
Yes, I'm coming!
What do you have to tell us, Takagi? Ah..., Inspector.
The victim's name was Naomi Fujimura, 27 years old.
She lived abroad.
She worked as a children's clothing designer.
Sir, this was in her skirt pocket...
It's a self-defense spray.
A self-defense spray?
Miss Fujimura was currently living abroad.
I guess she must not have felt very safe.
(Thinking) "It's very strange..."
Have you noticed that this room looks like a vintage room?
It's a retro room, Inspector.
They wanted to reproduce the atmosphere of the hotel that was there before.
That's why there's a coin-operated television.
This device needs a 100 yen coin to run for an hour.
Isn't it true that you said the TV turned off as soon as it was in the system?
Yes, it would be two o'clock in the afternoon.
According to the explanation here about...
you can only put in one coin at a time.
So, someone started it up around one o'clock...
Estimated time of death?
Between 12:00 and 1:00 p.m., sir.
You mean the attack occurred just after the...
Hey, have you seen the candy?
That's funny!
Eeeh? Eeeh?
I've never seen one of these before.
Here we go, nano?! Ha-ha!
From our time!
Coca-colas, string candies, Sidral...
Wow, what a lot of memories!
These candies 20 and 30 years ago are part of the ambience.
They will have fallen
when the criminal attacked the victim, Inspector.
And that, have you seen it?
There's an ice cream, too.
It must be undone.
An ice cream?
She must have been eating an ice cream in front of the TV
when the killer came in to kill her.
Ah...
Someone check the fridge for more ice cream!
Yes!
Look, sir, there are a few!
Caram, and they're from our time!
Kogoro was right, aleshores.
Doncs yes!
(He thinks) "No, this ice cream is not old."
"Either the victim bought it... or else..."
"Oh."
"Look, this is spring!"
Kogoro, look: here's some water.
Water?
It must have fallen... from the flower vase.
Shortly before one o'clock he has taken the blouse
that the victim had left in the laundry.
Yes... But since there was a "Do not disturb" sign on the door...
I didn't dare to enter.
And... did you notice if the door was locked, perhaps?
Don't you know how to be quiet?
Don't get angry.
What can you tell us?
Well... I wouldn't know, I didn't even touch the lock.
Inspector, we found the victim's cell phone...
under the bedside table!
Aaah!
Wow, now we can check the call log.
Okay.
Oooh!
But if you... Look at this, inspector!
Mm?
November 19 at 13:08.
Kuniko Yamamoto.
It's the name of one of the 3 girls.
The call was made at 8 minutes past 1:00.
Shortly before the time of death.
I met Kuniko at that moment, when she hung up the phone.
What a coincidence.
Yes, Naomi called to tell us that we were affanyéssim.
At one o'clock and 8 o'clock noon.
It's a match.
Where were you ladies?
At the Ichibancho monorail station.
From one o'clock we were together all the time.

Kanami arrived 10 minutes late.
It hasn't been long,
"We got on the 1:20 train."
"And we arrived at the hotel with 10 minutes to two o'clock."
At two o'clock we were at the door of Naomi's room.
This means the girls have a good alibi, right, Inspector?
In closing, I'd like us to go back to the scene of the crime...
and explain to me what the room was like when the body was found.
Of course...
(thinks) "No, it was a premeditated murder."
"If my deductions are correct, the murderer is her..."
"But I have no proof. Eh?"
(Plastic: squeezes)
"What was it, this plastic noise?"
"Sure! You didn't get rid of the incriminating evidence!"
"Now I'm sure of it. It was her!"
Ladies, you may go now, please.
Done, then, Inspector!
I'll take care of...
Oh!
Here we go again, seeeeeeer...
Father!
(Kogoro voice) I wish I could see you ladies off,
but it's too soon, yet!
Inspector, we're looking at a very well-prepared murder!
What the... What are you saying, now!?
Well, the designer's murderer
is one of the 3 young ladies friends of yours!
-What?
-How can you...!?
What are you saying?
The murderer, one of us!?
Please explain yourself, Mouri.
First of all, we have the victim's defense spray.
"If she had it in her pocket and didn't take it out to defend herself,
"It means she was attacked by a familiar face."
Second, the key.
It's on the table, right?
If we were talking about a burglar,
he would have locked the door before he fled.
to delay the discovery of the body by a few minutes.
It's... It's true!
The fact is that they have an alibi between one and two o'clock.
In fact, the crime was not committed at one o'clock, but much earlier.
It was committed around 12:20 minutes past 12:00.
And what about the television?
If it was turned off at both times,
someone must have put in a coin after one o'clock.
You don't have to be in the room to put a coin in the TV.
That's why the goodies are all on the ground!
The goodies? And what can you do with it, let's see?
This is what I'm going to tell you next.
Conan!
I am here!
We have an ice cream, and a string candy.
And what do you mean by that?
People of little faith!
First, we take the string,
and place it in the coin slot, like this.
The ice cream we put it between the channel button and the shelf,
as if it were a bridge.
We take the string again, and we make it hold with the ice cream.
Ran, do you have a coin? Do you have a coin?
Yes.
Fica-a tea inside the device.
Very good.
Ah... He's holding the string, so there's no way he'll fall in.
Mh... This is what the assassin did before leaving.
After a while, however, the ice cream melts.
And if the ice cream melts, the string loosens and falls to the ground.
Behold.
Hm.
That makes sense...
So, the candy that was on the floor...
they were just for cover.
It seems so.
(Kogoro voice) The proof that the ice cream had been where he explained it to him
is that the shelf was still spring-loaded.
What's more, the ice cream we found is currently being sold in the market;
it can't be part of the retro ambience of the room, as we thought.
What if Naomi bought it to eat it?
That's also why the murderer...
has not closed the door of the room.
And then, why?
Because if she had closed it,
even if the friends had arrived on time,
they wouldn't have been able to see the moment when the TV was turned off,
which is what I intended to do.
Of course!
The whole setup falls apart if no one sees the TV turn off!
So how do you explain the sign on the door?
It was the murderer, of course.
An hour and a half is not a long time,
but it was important to leave the body here with the room open.
If someone came in before that, the plan would go to hell!
Then how could Naomi call me at one o'clock and 8 minutes!?
That's right!
If she was dead before, she couldn't have called, could she?
He's right, Kogoro.
The call logs of the two phones match!

It was the murderer who called.
With the dead woman's phone!
The dead woman's?
But Kuniko says she talked to Naomi.
(All) eeeeh ?!
Oh, no!
That's right.
He couldn't have talked to her... because he had died...
you, Kuniko Yamamoto!
Kuniko!
You can't be!
Once he has committed the murder,
"You took Naomi's cell phone
"and went to Ichibancho station,
"where he had arranged to meet Kaori."
"At around one o'clock, she put her hand in her pocket...
"and called herself on the victim's cell phone.
"She made it look like she was talking to her.
After that, all she had to do was leave the cell phone...
somewhere at the scene of the crime when she arrived.
What can you prove, this?
The proof is on you, miss.
Huh?
It's a plastic bag you carry in your pocket.
And what if... I'm carrying a bag?
You used it to put the victim's cell phone in, didn't you?
It's true, isn't it?
Takagi!
Uh... Yes!
Let me check your pockets.
Just a... Just a moment!
Here it is!
Look through the light, please.
Yes!
There are footprints.
Oh.
And there are many that are concentrated in one area.
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but you have a rather curious phone number, miss.
And this has already caught my attention from the beginning.
02 05 82 52 805.
If you look carefully at the keys you dial...
you'll immediately notice that he only uses the middle ones.
That's why the traces are all at one point:
they are proof that you have dialed the number through this bag!
What does it say?
Chiba!
Bring me the victim's cell phone!
Right away!
Isn't it normal, that there are my fingerprints on the bag,
if I was carrying it in my pocket!?
Here's the cell phone, sir!
Oooh!
It's an exact match!
I can't... ever be able to forgive her!
Kuniko!
But why, Kuniko!?
When we graduated,
the student with the best grades was to be recommended
to a foreign children's clothing brand.
Naomi got the recommendation
and succeeded as a designer.
But that letter, that letter was for me!
Naomi messed up the teacher!
One night, we went out for a few drinks,
and she took advantage of the fact that he had been drinking
to make him promise to recommend her.
You are doing well!
Soon you will have your own studio!
A lie as a lie as a house.
In fact, I've been screwed out on the street!
For a nothing mistake I made once!
In the street...?!?
I was envious!
Why should I have such a bad time, me?
Naomi was to blame for all my misfortunes!
She stole my happiness, she stole my happiness forever!
And that's why... And that's why I...
(Cries)
Look.
There's something wrong with the boat!
What's wrong?
Hey, hey, hey!
It's about to capsize!
There's no doubt it's Mr. Tachibana.
Inspector, wasn't Mr. Tachibana wearing a life jacket?
When he went out in the morning he was wearing it.
Really?
Why could he have taken it off!?
the next Conan: "The Bay of Vengeance, (part one)."
