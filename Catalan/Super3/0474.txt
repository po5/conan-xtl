No matter what happens, I will always be by your side.
This has never happened before!
Her mother has thrown away the wedding ring
and the Ran is tripping.
He always finds out the only truth!
He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult, and he's Detective Conan!

Kuriyama, please!
Can you open up?

(Ding-dong)
(Ding-dong)
Kuriyama!
Kuri...
"Of course, I didn't remember. He's out running errands."
(Ding-dong)
I'm coming!
Who is it, at this time of the morning?
(Ding-dong) What?
Hello, mother!
(Ding-dong) Congratulations!
Ran!
You've come... with Conan!
You mean... what are we celebrating today?
Don't tell me you've forgotten!
Today is a very important birthday.
A birthday?
But my birthday isn't today.
I know it isn't!
It's much more important than that!
It's several years ago today
since you and the father went out together for the first time.
It's the birthday of your first date!
And you... how do you know?
Last night I was sorting through the shelves of books
and I found a very old photo album.
At the bottom of each photo was a comment written in your handwriting,
such as... "day of the first home-cooked dinner."
or "the first marital quarrel",
or "day of Kogoro's first great feat".
Right, Conan?
Uh... Ah, yes.
"Sometimes, young people act without thinking."
Since I'm your daughter,
I thought that on a birthday like this, I had to celebrate properly.
Sorry, Ran.
I'm not in the mood today
to talk about stories that happened many years ago
and that now have neither head nor tail.
"Lawyer Eri Kisaki's lover."
Ma-Mother...
Also, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't give me flowers again.
The cat eats them,
and you can see that depending on what kind of flowers can hurt it.
Ah.
I'm sorry.
Maybe... you could use this bouquet to decorate the washbasin.
What do you have... a vase?
Let's see... a vase...
Conan, can you bring me that vase over there?
Which one?
Yes.
Up you go!
This can't be it.
If you don't mind, take what's on the shelf.
Yes...
Mother... What are you... angry?
I am?
And now!
Why should I be?
I say this because you've been looking a little nervous for a while now.
(Phone: ring)
(Ring)
Yes, tell me?
Attorney Kisaki's office.
(Ring) What?
Right now?
Yes...
No problem at all.
Thank you very much!
Okay, so far.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Excuse me, Ran.
I have to go out on an errand now.
Could you look after the Goro, please?
He'll have to relieve himself soon.
My secretary, Miss Kuriyama, won't be long.
Oh... Yes.
Who is it?
Who called you?
I don't know.
Maybe it's that lawyer who had been a professor of yours.
(Clonc)
Goro, don't touch that!
What are you doing here, bitch?
It's coming out!
He's carrying a photo!
Why was there a photo inside your mother's vase?
Mm?
Who is this man standing next to my mother?
It seems to me that it is the same man who called you a moment ago.
What?
How do you know?
There's a phone number written on the back of the photo, isn't there?
Oh...
It's the same number that's here.
It's been recorded in the phone's call log.
But... this bearded man...
he doesn't look like a lawyer and he doesn't look like a teacher's mother.
Yes, I agree.
Maybe... the mother didn't let me take the vase...

because I didn't want him to find this picture!
Don't start imagining weird things!
There is only garbage in here!
If I had asked him why he couldn't take this vase,
he would have told me that he was using it as a wastebasket.
Oh!
The wedding ring!
Uh... Come to think of it, your mother didn't wear a wedding ring, did she?
Then... it can't be!
"She has a lover?!"
Let's follow her, Conan!
We can catch her, though!
I'm already here.
Go on!
Mrs. Kisaki?
Mrs. Kisaki!
The vase is lying down... and the papers are scattered around.
Also..., there's a mysterious bouquet of flowers.
I have a bad feeling.
Mèèèèèèèèèu!
Didn't I look good?
"Let's go!"
Conan!
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I'm coming!
It's over there!
I'm sure.
"It's him! It's the man in the picture!"
(Hey, Ran.
(Ran) Welcome.
Would you like a table for two?
Uh... Yes.
"I don't get it! I didn't expect this from my mother!"
I don't want to think about it anymore!
I'd better ask her directly.
Why don't you wait a while longer?
Maybe this man has done nothing wrong, Ran.
What?
Yes, you're right...
Oh!
Hello, Meg!
My goodness, what a cute little thing!
Thank you so much!
"What a cute little thing?"
"It's like I'm talking to a little kid."
It really doesn't look like
this man is having an affair with your mother.
I don't think she likes him, men like him.
Yeah, but... when the drunk father says: "Ran, little girl!
"Can you do me a favor and get me another little bottle, queen?"
He says it often.
Besides, everyone knows that my father likes women very much.
Maybe mother is also very successful with men.
Look, look at this, Conan!
Look at his arms!
They are full of wounds!
I think there's something fishy going on here!
"Mother!"
"Is he... shaking?"
I couldn't!
I couldn't stop... shaking!
"She's crying! Oh my God!"
"But the mother never cries in front of anyone!"
"What did this scoundrel who talks like a little child do to her?"
"What did he say to make her cry?!"
"Just a moment!"
"A photo hidden inside a vase.
"Several crumpled papers and the wedding ring,
"A man who talks like a small child without realizing it,
"The arm full of wounds...
"And a few words spoken in tears."
"I couldn't stop shaking."
Is everything all right?
What can I do?
It's all right.
I'm sure it was just... a dream.
A dream, a dream and nothing more.
What?!
"First he seduces her, then he makes her cry...
"And finally, he tells her that it was all a dream...
"And then he dumps her?!"
"This is unforgivable! This man... he deserves to be punished!"
"Sure. I've got it all figured out!"
"If my deductions are correct,
"I have discovered this man's identity."
"He uses the words of a small child... and his arms are full of wounds."
"It is logical that they should have met here."
"I know why Ran's mother started to cry.
"And she said she couldn't stop shaking."
"Then her companion said, "It's all right."
"I'm sure it was just a dream. A dream, a dream and nothing more."
"These words... they have an explanation."
"And I also know why the wedding ring was hidden inside the vase.
"among all those crumpled papers."
Uh..., Ran.
I think you're mistaken.
I think this man is not your mother's lover.
Ran!
It's unforgivable.
He deserves... punishment!
Iaaaaaaaaaah!
Oysters!
-Oh! -Oh!
It's not what it looks like!
Ran!
What are you doing?
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
This man...
is just a veterinarian!
What?
A veterinarian?
And he uses little boy words and flirts with women?!
I'd say he's not as shallow as you think.
But we've seen her hitting on a girl before!
"Hi, Meg! My goodness, what a cute little thing!"
Right?
It's just that he wasn't talking to her, Ran,
he was talking to the little dog the girl was holding.

"There are many veterinarians who, when they have an animal to their practice,
"They talk to it as if it were a small child."
That's why it came out unintentionally.
Am I right, sir? Yes.
I'm guessing these wounds you have on your arm
are scratches from animals in the office.
There are some patients who get nervous
when a veterinarian tries to examine them.
And I also know... you've turned a dog's ears before.
Ears?
Yes.
He's turned the dog's ears to look at them and smell them.
That's the way to check the dog for diseases.
That's how I found out.
It's just that only vets do that.
Ah... I-I saw it on TV, in a documentary about veterinarians.
But... I saw that the mother was crying!
She said she couldn't stop shaking...
I saw her tears coming down.
Then, you told her that it was all a dream.
(Eri) Don't be silly!
The doctor wasn't talking about me, but about the Goro.
The... Goro?
Last night, while I was sleeping, at home,
the Goro had strange convulsions...
and he couldn't stop shaking.
The cat I had before had never done that before,
so I thought he was sick.
I was really worried,
and I needed the advice of a professional like Dr. Tobe.
Since I had a lot of work to do
I didn't have time to stop by his office,
I called him on the phone
to ask him if we could meet somewhere else.
Today he called me back
and told me that he came to this coffee shop every morning,
and that he didn't mind if we talked for a while.
That's the call he got while we were in his office, right?
Yes.
I wanted to take the Goro with me so I could take a look at it,
but only dogs are allowed in this cafeteria.
And what do you mean it was all a dream?
It was the source of the cat's convulsions.
It can happen, sometimes.
Some cats dream that they are playing
and their muscles move involuntarily,
as if they were having convulsions.
Do you see it?
It's the same thing that happens to Mr. Kogoro when he talks in his sleep.
I've seen it, Ran.
Hurray!
All prisoners!
Wow!
I didn't know cats did the same thing.
Yes.
In this sense, cats are a lot like people.
They also talk in their sleep.
Don't suffer, Mrs. Mouri, your cat doesn't have any disease.
No?
That's good news.
What a rest!
There's something I don't understand, mother.
Why did you throw your wedding ring in the wastebasket?
In the wastebasket?
I mean the fat vase,
which you prevented me from taking when I wanted to put the bouquet of flowers.
When you had already left,
we found your wedding ring hidden among crumpled papers.
Wow!
I had lost it and didn't know where it was.
Was it inside the fat vase?
But..., then, aren't you going to throw it away?
In that vase there are Goro's toys.
He loves to play with the paper balls.
He pushes them around like balls.
He's a very tidy cat.
When he's done playing, he puts all his toys in the vase.
One day he was supposed to find my ring on the table,
he used it to play with and put it away with the rest of the things.
The picture I have with you, Dr. Tobe, was also inside the vase.
Wow..., I thought you had hidden the wedding ring expressly!
I see what you mean.
You found the wedding ring in the wastebasket
and you saw me with a man... unknown.
You thought... he was my lover.
Uh... Yes.
Of course, it's just that you were so nervous before you left,
and when you were talking on the phone you seemed so happy...!
I was!
I was very worried about Goro,
but I didn't want to talk to you so that you wouldn't get nervous too.
Now that I've explained everything, you can leave.
This afternoon you're going on a summer camp
with your karate club mates, aren't you?
Uh... Yes.
"How scary!"
Eh... Uh... I apologize, Dr. Tobe.
Conan, come on!
Aaah! We're leaving.
(Girl) Thank you very much, see you again.
What a case!
Anyway, it's a pity.
Deep down, Eri,
I had secretly hoped that... I could be your... lover.
What?
What Rumies? The mother has left me worried.
I found her... different,
like she had something out of place.

She already told you, she was worried about her beloved kitten.
No, it's not that.
It just didn't look like her.
Well, maybe it's because of the low-cut shirt she's wearing.
I've never seen her dressed like that before.
The truth is that I've come to think...
that this cat thing was just an excuse to come see me.
You know... I've been separated for the past year and I'm a total wreck.
Am I wrong?
Uh... Well..., I didn't... want to...
Of course you did!
It's the clothes she's wearing!
Mother doesn't usually dress so provocatively!
Yes.
Deep down, the mother... wanted to dazzle the vet!
Ran, wait!
Come... I have to go back to the cafeteria.
Ran!
Ran.
Think a little!
What's that?
What do you mean..., Conan?
Yes, woman!
You don't remember why we went to your mother's office this morning?
Of course I do!
I'm going to sort out the bookshelves...
and I found an old photo album...
where there was a photo
from the day the father and mother went out together for the first time.
Ah!
That photo!
The anniversary of the first date?
Have you worn the same clothes?
Yes, but they don't fit me like before.
The truth is that today,
if I hadn't had to fold earlier because of the cat business,
I would have gone to look for... my husband and invited him out to lunch.
If he had seen me dressed like that,
he would have started laughing and maybe we would have made up.
Listen... Why don't you go find him and make up right now?
It's not as easy as it looks, doctor.
Besides, my daughter found out that today was our anniversary,
and I had to get her off my back the hard way.
And, of course, now I'll have to redo the plan from scratch.
How envious, Mrs. Eri!
I can tell you have a... very lucky husband.
Thank you.
But that was so many years ago, that I imagine that, by now, by now,
my dear husband must not remember anything anymore.
(Man, drunk) Hey, Kogoro!
There's nothing to do!
This man sleeps like a log.
How strange!
Until a moment ago, he kept complaining...
and staring at his cell phone screen.
Besides, why is he dressed like that?
He looks like he's getting dressed up for an important date!
Poor man, he has a strange way of sleeping!
He sure does.
I don't know who he reminds me of.
(Eri) It's true.
I don't know who he reminds me of.
"Why did he have to go to the colonies today?"
(Shock)
We need an ambulance!
(Eri) "This guy looks familiar."
What was the target of the driver of the vehicle?
Mr. Tatematsu or Mr. Okonogi?
"This case is not as simple as it seems."
"Then, there must be someone who saw the suspect!"
Don't miss the next episode!
