"Miss Wakasa, the new 1st B. support teacher,
has arrived at the school when the school year had already started."
"We have gone to the old abandoned shed to look for plaster.
"Because Miss Wakasa, who is very fearful,
asked us to go with her."
Eh?
Oh!
Oh.
Hey, Ayumi.
When we went to the deck you found an old schedule on the floor, right?
Mm-hm.
I picked it up.
I got it right here.
Look at it.
Mm?
What's the matter, Conan?
You found out something?
"Sure. Now I get it."
Now that I look at it, there's something wrong with this schedule, isn't there?
Nobody does seven hours of school in elementary school.
Not even the upperclassmen do that many.
Well, if it's not a schedule... What does this grill mean?
As we found it in the shed,
the same place where we found the skeleton
with the tape with the coded text, it must surely be...
Surely it must be...?
"A new day begins with a splendid sun."
"It is the hour of love and mysteries."
"A basement, a skeleton and a tape with a coded message."
"Let's look at Miss Wakasa."
"She looks like a child, but she has the brain of an adult and she's Detective Conan!"

"The case of the skeleton and the new teacher (part two)."
Surely it must be what?
What do you think it could be, Conan?
Surely it must be the key to decipher the message.
-To decipher the message?
-How, the key?
What do you mean, the key?
I don't understand.
What is it?
A clue to help us read the message.
Mm?
Look at the characters in the message.
The ones on the right are the days of the week:
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
That's right.
There are all the days of the week.
But wait a minute!
Wednesday is missing a character.
Yes it is.
It is missing.
This is the radical that means "water".
Many characters like "river", "lake", "swim",
which represent words related to water,
include the radical meaning "water".
Oh yeah?
And then, the characters on the left, what do they represent, then?
They are parts of the subjects studied in school.
Language is "ware".
Mathematics is "nobun".
Social Studies is "kai".
Science is "sato".
Art is "koh".
Physical Education is "hon".
Oooh!
Study is "shita".
With this in mind,
we can fill the 49 spaces in the 7-by-7 grid
with Chinese characters.
And if we write the Japanese alphabet starting from the top left....
We get this table.
Oh!
I'm sure we'll be able to read them now,
when we wrap it around a marker pen.
That's nice!
Yes.
I read the character of the message
and I go to the one that corresponds to the grid.
Now we can start.
The first character is the radical "earth" and "nobun".
(Ayumi) The radical "earth" and "nobun"...
It is "su".
The next one is the radical "water" and "ko".
I got it: it's "ma".
Next is the radical "fire" and "ko".
"Ho".
Oh!
It's "Sumaho"!
Well, that must be the key to decipher the message.
It seems so.
Moving on, what else?
Next is the radical "tree" and "ko".
The next is "water" and "ware".
"Me".
"U".
- (Ayumi) "Sumahomeu".
- "Soneareta".
- "Ebuemua."
-Can you tell me what it means?
Magic words to cast a spell?
What a rage!

I was sure it would work.
I don't understand what's wrong.
(Acoustic signal)
Thanks for your patience, guys.
We're finally out of the meeting, but for today the classes are over.
We'll play the graveyard game next P.E. class.
Yay!
How nice!
You can pack up your things and go home.
(Exclamations of joy)
No way.
Even though we applied the Japanese alphabet vertically
instead of horizontally, as we did the first time,
the result is still words that don't make any sense.
So neither.
Maybe instead of the Japanese alphabet
we should try the English alphabet.
The English alphabet has only 26 characters.
Almost half of the boxes would be empty.
This is also true.
There is another thing that I don't understand and it has me very intrigued.
There are these crosses in some of the boxes.
I don't know what they mean.
What a pity!
Yes, what a pity.
We have not been able to decipher the message.
Anyway, it doesn't matter, nothing happens.
I don't think it would have done any good to decipher a message
that we found in the hand of a thief who died in an accident 10 years ago.
(Mitsuhiko) How fast!
Who knows, why not?
(Mitsuhiko) I can't believe it.
They've already posted a news item about the skeleton we found.
And they've even included a picture of the tape with the coded message.
-Really, it's all there.
-What are you talking about?
Let's see...
He's talking about a tape with a "mysterious coded message".
-Ah, hello, Miss Wakasa. -Hello, excuse me, guys.
-Hi, excuse me, guys... -Hi, excuse me...
A teacher asked me if I could do you a favor.
She asked me if I could go and get some plaster for her
to have it ready for tomorrow morning's science class.
Ah, very well.
It's just that just before I saw
that there were 3 wheelbarrows of plaster in the basement of the shed,
next to the skeleton.
And I thought, of course, there must be plaster in these wheelbarrows.
Yes, of course, so what?
Well, I wanted to ask you if... if you don't mind...
We understand.
He wants us to go with him to the shed because he's scared, right?
Yes, he is.
A little bit.
I'm sorry you guys have to go with me again.
We've already seen that you're a little scared, it's okay.
Man, until recently there was a skeleton in the shed.
Anyway, we go in to get the plaster...
and we leave in a hurry before it gets dark.
Mm?
"It's all messed up in here."
It was tidier before, wasn't it?
Maybe the forensics team left it that way after their investigation.
No, this doesn't look like it was done by someone investigating.
More like they must have been looking for something.
So maybe after the police left, someone came in.
What? But why?
But why?
Hey, Mitsuhiko.
This news you saw on the Internet,
what time did they hang up on you?
Mm?
I look at it... It was posted two hours ago.
You're saying it was posted two hours ago?
Well, whoever it was had plenty of time to get here...
after they saw the picture of the coded message.
Yes.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You don't mean...
I'm sure that the person who wrote the coded message
may have died 10 years ago,
but the purpose of the message is still alive.
So, we have to find the key to decipher the message any way we can.
XXT.
First of all, we'd better check the basement.
It could be that it's hiding what the cover has come to record.
What?
Miss, can you come open the trap door, please?
What what?
But... What if there's someone?
Maybe when I open it, he'll jump on me.
Don't worry, nothing will happen.
I'll be ready to knock him out with an anesthetic dart.
Here's an anesthetic dart?
Anytime.
You ready?
Let's go. Come on, let's go.
Doesn't look like they've touched anything.
So we know that in the basement they haven't come down yet...
Maybe they didn't have time to let us know they heard we were coming down here.
And they had to run away before they finished.
If we had discovered them down here, they wouldn't have been able to escape.
They would have been trapped with no way out.
Maybe they plan to come back if it gets dark
and there's no one left in the school.
Then they can continue searching at their leisure.
Searching?

And how can we know what they have come for?
To find out, we will have to decipher the message in code.
"I'm sure if I can figure out what the 3 crosses mean,
I can figure out the key."
"In principle it could be the characters 'IUE'
which are repeated in 'waiueo'."
"But, if so,
"The crosses should be in the third,
fourth and fifth boxes in the bottom row."
"What do they represent? What do these crosses mean?"
Conan, what are you doing?
Don't dawdle, take the plaster and go upstairs, we have to leave.
What?
Oh, yes.
I've had a hell of a day today.
I just want to get home,
have a drink and go to sleep right away.
But, who drinks alcohol, you, Miss Wakasa?
Of course, in spades.
My favorite liquor is whiskey.
One little glass of whiskey
and I fall asleep with a smile on my face like the god Ebisu.
"Oh! Whiskey... Ebisu..."
"Got it!"
"The key doesn't work with modern alphabetical order."
"Therefore, the 3 sentences of the message are...
"It was true:
the message is related to the case 10 years ago."
Come on, Conan, man.
What are you doing?
You can't find the plaster or what?
I'm very hungry.
Who's there?
Did you see anything, Ai?
I saw someone watching us through the gap in the half-open door.
Maybe I just thought so, that's why.
Or you really saw it.
If I'm not mistaken, when the police left,
after the skeleton was taken away,
someone else came
and they searched the cover because they were looking for something.
They are the ones who already committed a crime 10 years ago.
They are the same thieves
that entered to steal in a very rich man's house
and murdered him,
and took 200 million yen worth of gold bullion.
The same criminals are back.
What?
How do you know?
That you managed to decipher the message?
Yes, because of something Miss Wakasa said earlier.
What is it?
Because of something I said?
What did I say?
She said the words "Ebisu" and "whiskey".
It turns out that, in the old days, these two words were spelled like this.
Look how they were spelled.
What strange characters!
It's true, they look like mixed characters.
They are no longer used today,
but they are archaic characters that appear in the Iroha poem.
There are two of them: the katakana "a" with a line under it makes the character "we".
And the character that looks like the "y" of "ido" makes the character "wi".
Therefore, if in the equivalence grid I have made....
we apply these characters instead of the modern alphabet,
the result would be that.
-Oooh!
-Of course, now I get it.
The obsolete characters "we" and "wi"
correspond to the spaces marked with a cross.
And the last cross is a leftover space.
That's right.
And if we decipher the message using this grid,
we can read: "Everyone's parts are already prepared.
Come at once.
Don't tell me that what we have found...
Exactly, the skeleton we found was that of the chief of the thieves...
that had to be found here, and had to be found again.
He exchanged the gold bullion for cash
and made parts to distribute them.
And today, 10 years later, upon seeing the news,
the others have realized
that their boss had prepared the shares for each one of them
before he accidentally died.
They thought that maybe the money was still hidden in the shed and came looking for it.
and have come looking for them.
And I know where they are.
When I opened the wheelbarrows of plaster in the basement, instead of plaster, I found plaster,
instead of plaster, I found bundles of bills.
Really?
But couldn't you just send them an e-mail and that was it?
If they had been arrested,
with the e-mail the police would have found the money.
Of course, it's true.
Now that we know all this, we have to explain it to the police.
For the moment it is better not to tell the police about the money.
Why not?
Because, if we explain it to them, they'll come here right away...
and then the thieves won't come back anymore.
It's better if we lend them a trap to catch them when they come.
We will do what Sherlock Holmes does
the story called "The Dancers".
You can't go wrong.
-Oops, it's about to get dark.
-That's right.

And in the end there was no way to find any plaster anywhere.
We only found this message in code
written on a piece of plastic tape.
And, moreover, it looks like it was written recently.
It doesn't look old.
Yeah, it's exactly as if they finished writing it recently.
Yes, but whatever.
Since we can't read it anyway, you can throw it away.
-Oh, I'm so hungry!
-You're right.
(Mitsuhiko) I'm looking forward to watching today's episode of "Kamen Yaiba".
(Mitsuhiko) -Yes, that's right.
(Mitsuhiko) -I can't stand it anymore.
And, besides, Lady Yaiba has to be in today's episode.
-Yes.
-I'm sure it'll be a blast.
What are you doing here?
Why did you come?
Yes, I know, but I just...
I asked you not to come.
It's just not fair for you to come alone.
Conan, we're all part of the Junior Detective League.
But it's just that the men who are coming are people who...
Don't worry.
I'm sure it'll be a fun adventure.
-It's like a test of courage.
-Yeah, sure.
"Even Miss Wakasa has come..."
Good evening, everyone.
If there's ever a need, I'll protect you.
Oh... Thank you very much.
I'm surprised that the police have sent someone to investigate
information that's so hard to verify.
Ah... Yes, well... Actually...
I think they're convinced by your track record.
With all the cases you've solved, you have a very good reputation.
-Ha-ha-ha... -Ha-ha-ha... -Ah, yeah?
"Actually, I only came here...
because I thought there would be Miss Kobayashi."
What?
Come on, tell us, Conan.
What did you write, in the afternoon, in the code message on the tape?
Ah.
"Tonight at midnight I'll wait for you in the basement.
It's been 10 years since we've seen each other.
We must meet again".
I'm sure that when you read this
you'll think your head is still alive, won't you?
XXT.
-How could you do this to us?
-Where are you?
Have you gone into hiding?
We haven't heard from you for 10 years.
We thought you ran off with our money.
Did you?
Come to think of it, the message said you'd wait for us in the basement.
Hey, we're here.
What are you down here?
-What's he doing, a flashlight, here? -Huh?
-What's it doing, a flashlight, here?
It's a flashlight?
-Where are you?
-Hey, what are you down here?
Don't hide.
Get out, go.
(Shiratori) Freeze, don't move.
I'm from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police.
Inspector Ninzaburo Shiratori.
You are hereby arrested on suspicion of a murder
and a robbery that were committed 10 years ago.
But, then, the message we found...
-Exactly, it was a trap.
-It was a trap?
The message was a fake.
He wrote it in Conan.
And you fell on all fours.
Wait a minute, it can't be.
Ten years ago there were four thieves and one is dead.
So there are still three left.
And in the basement there are only two.
This means that the third...
Aaah!
Aaah!
Inspector Shiratori!
You brats... How smart are you?
-Yes.
-Did you find the money or not?
They're inside the wheelbarrows to mark lines with chalk.
Let me see, let me see.
-What do you think of this?
-My goodness, what a lot of money!
Too bad the head died.
I feel sorry for him.
Yes, this means that now there are less of us to share out and we get more.
We have to thank him, though.
And now what are we going to do, with you?
You know what?
Why don't we go down to the basement?
Come on, let's go.
One at a time.
First, the smallest ones.
Come on, let's go.
Hurry up.
What's the matter with you?
Why don't you knock them out with an anesthetic dart...
or with a ball from the belt, like always?
(Shinichi voice) Since it's so dark, I'm afraid that,
if I throw an anesthetic dart at them, it won't hit.
It would be a waste.
I think it's better if I keep to myself and don't use the belt.
We can do very well if you leave us closed here.
Is Inspector Shiratori all right?
Does he have a pulse?
(Conan voice) Yes.
He's just unconscious from the blows he took falling down the stairs.
(Man) Come on.
You're the only one missing, Miss.
(Man) Okay.

Have a great time doing the last class in the basement.
Ah!
Miss Wakasa!
-Oh!
-Hey, what are you doing?
It won't open.
Miss Wakasa.
What's happened?
Hey, you.
What are you doing?
Get up from the ground.
She won't wake up, she's unconscious.
Hey, hey, hey...
Are you ready...
to take a trip to the other world and never come back?
To take a trip to the other world and never come back?

I don't feel anything at all.
Do you feel anything?
I don't feel anything at all.
I don't feel anything either.
Come on, let's open, come on.
Upstairs...
-No!
Stop it!
-Huh?
Miss Wakasa.
Let me be!
Stand back!
Miss Wakasa.
Stop it!
-Huh?
-Are you all right, Miss?
-Where are the robbers?
What happened?
-Yes, yes...
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.
-They've been knocked unconscious.
-Very good, Miss Wakasa!
You knocked out all three of them by yourself?
I was just hitting them with the rake to defend myself.
It was luck.
It's all been explained to me.
It's unbelievable.
They told me that you took a group of children with you
to capture some thieves in the middle of the night.
No, no, you're wrong.
We were not alone.
There was also a police inspector to protect us.
-What did he say what?
-I thought nothing would happen.
So... Why didn't you tell me?
I would have liked to be there too.
In case you didn't know, I'm the advisor to the Junior Detective League.
-Huh?
-Huh?
Is that what this is about?
Oh, is it?
I didn't know, no.
And the policeman who came was Inspector Shiratori.
He could have warned me.
If he had told me, I would have come.
Now don't think I'm saying it so that it was Inspector Shiratori, eh?
No, no.
If it had been anyone else, too:
Inspector Takagi or Inspector Chiba or Inspector Sato...
Any... Now don't think that's all I'm saying.
I'm saying it because I'm the advisor to the Junior Detective League.
"I'll be waiting for you at 3:00 p.m. in front of the fox statue..,
"at Yuda-Onsen Station.
Komakichi Kurataya."
Oh, yes, of course!
It's the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
Oysters.
It's an honor to have met me on the street, Mr. Mouri.
-And me, Sergeant Tsurumi.
-Inspector Washiyama, at your service.
What?
Can someone explain to me why the hell I'm being detained?
