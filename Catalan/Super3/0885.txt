(laughs) How wonderful!
It's beautiful.
(Kazuha) "Isn't it? Right now Heiji and I are going to see it."
Eh?
(Kazuha) "Eh?
There's go now?
But listen,
isn't this enlightenment on Kinza Island Four, Tokyo?
"Yes! That's why we thought maybe we'd like to go along."
Eh?
We're already here.
Mm-hm.
Eh?
Wha... gee, you guys came!
Yeah, on New Year's Eve we have work...
and these were the only days we had free to come.
Besides, you told me you didn't have anything to do this weekend.
Yeah, no... No, I don't have anything to do, but...
I just got back from shopping and I haven't made dinner.
Father said he'd be back around 7,
so I'd better hurry
if I don't want him to be angry when I get home.
Come on, then.
If you want I can help you.
We'll make him a quick dinner and go.
We can eat something while we're there.
Yes?
Come on, then!
Come on, woman!
Uh... Yes.
Don't worry, you won't have to pay anything.
We've brought some vouchers for a cafe in Kinza.
Heiji, why don't I wait for you at Café Poirot while we cook?
I'll be fine.
Eh?
Hey, Kudo.
If it ever crossed your mind to ask me why I've come...
I won't ask you.
Because I already figured it out.
Okay, then.
Okay, well...
(traffic snarls)
"The curtain rises and the protagonist appears."
"He solves the mysteries by doing a beautiful dance."
"I'd like to give my support to Heiji,
but a strange customer shows up at Café Poirot."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"Solving mysteries at Café Poirot. Part One."
To tell you the truth, I can't tell you how surprised I am,
that Heiji thought it was nice to go to such a romantic place.
I was surprised too.
I thought he would say something like, "Don't talk nonsense."
Oh, how beautiful!
It says here that it's Kinza's island four lighting.
I'm sure it's a blast live.
-What?
-What do you say we go see it?
My mother won in a raffle
some vouchers for a Kinza coffee shop.
She said she didn't know what to do with it, so she gave it to me.
Ooh...
I have a feeling there's love in the air here.
Eh?
Here we go again, you and your usual feelings.
Oh, boy...
But this stew... it has no taste at all.
What?
Of course it doesn't!
We neglected the soy sauce.
Wow!
What do we do now?
It's almost ready.
Even if we added it now,
the potatoes would fall apart before they had absorbed the taste.
Yes.
That's a good idea.
What if we turn it into a curry?
Look at making it all the way to Tokyo for it.
Flights shut up, stupid?
Look who's talking, what he went all the way to London to propose.
Ah... But-but in my case...
Eh?
I feel stupid.
Don't you understand?
Don't you say you're a detective, you?
Well, if you are, prove it and make an effort to figure out what I feel!
You idiot!
Hey, wait, where are you going?
Ran!
Ran!
Ran!
No!
Let me be!
Seriously, Ran, there's no one who understands you.
What?!
That for me you're the most complicated case of all.
You're always a tangle of emotions.
Even if I were the real Sherlock Holmes I couldn't decipher you.
When you like a girl,
it's impossible to read the heart accurately.
"Really, it was a coincidence that we were in London."
Oh!
Oh, was it?
Are you serious?
I wish I could say a sentence like that.
Are you sure, today is the best day?
I mean the date.
Is that so?
Oh, that's right!
-That's right, Friday the 13th.
-Today is...
Eh?

Is that why you say that, maybe?
I get your point.
Today is considered unlucky for many reasons,
but the most common of all is because,
when Jesus Christ made the last supper, there were a total of 13 people.
Or because 13 is not a round number,
because it does not fit into the duodecimal system.
Or because Jesus Christ was crucified on a Friday.
Also,
I think President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on a Friday.
But we are in Japan.
No need to worry, that's why.
It just happens to be that the 13th of this month falls on a Friday.
Statistically it happens a couple of times a year.
I believe that you can confess your feelings
to the person you love without worrying.
Besides,
you have to think that neither Jesus Christ nor Kennedy died on the 13th.
(Male) However, Friday the 13th?
Maybe you have to remember that on Friday the 13th of October 1307,
King Philip IV had all the Knights Templar of France arrested,
who were unjustly tortured and burned at the stake.
Years later, on Friday, June 13, 1483, the famous King Richard III had one of the Knights Templar executed on Friday, June 13, 1483,
the famous King Richard III had one of his advisors executed,
accusing him of treason.
It should also be kept in mind that, in more ancient times, Julius Caesar was betrayed,
Julius Caesar was betrayed and murdered by Brutus on Friday the 13th.
And today is the most fateful day because Buddha died.
In Japan it would have to be avoided.
Ah, excuse me,
I felt your conversation and I couldn't help it.
"I didn't even realize that there is outside."
(Think) "Who is this?"
Hey, does this customer come here often?
No, I think this is the first time I've seen him.
It seems to me that he has entered the cafe right after you.
(Girl) Welcome.
Hello.
Looks like you haven't arrived yet, right?
But how can that be?
You're from Beika University's drama club,
you've reserved a table, right?
No, no one has arrived yet.
Wow.
We're having Yui's birthday party today.
When they arrive, can you tell them to go ahead and start without me, please?
I'll do that.
It's just that my stomach's been upset all afternoon.
-No, it's nothing.
-Are you... Are you feeling sick?
(Door: bell)
It can't be, I can't believe it.
Are we the first ones again?
No.
You are not the first.
The Ozumi has arrived.
He said he was going to the toilet for a moment.
-That's right.
-He-he.
Come to think of it, I already had a stomachache this afternoon.
I mean, while your boyfriend's away, I have you all to myself.
Hey, will you stop, please?
Hey, I have, I'm telling you just in case,
don't make any comments about it, okay?
He-he!
I'll try.
But if I get drunk maybe I'll miss something.
-Huh?
Oh no?
-Luckily, they don't serve alcohol here.
Well!
I see that Nagatsuka hasn't arrived yet.
No.
I think he's pretty busy with a recording.
And it's the recording of your birthday video.
He's obviously in love with you.
You mean, in Nagatsuka?
Oops, what else?
Yes, seriously.
Every time I joke with you
he keeps giving me threatening looks.
What happens is that he doesn't like it when you make a fool of yourself
with his best friend's girlfriend.
Ozumi and Nagatsuka have known each other for many, many years,
they went to the same high school.
Look, Tengo, you and I are just childhood friends...
who like to joke around.
Just friends, of course.
Look, it's not easy to keep secrets, you know?
What do you mean by that?
No nothing, dear Yui, just a childhood friend of mine.
But... What do you mean, you weren't just childhood friends?
-How... how come it took you so long?
-Hey! -Hey!
Hello, Nagatsuka.
Well look, I just got lost.
You got lost?
But we've been here a lot of times.
-Are you sure?
-I can't believe it.
But last year we staged a play
using this cafe as a model, and we all came to see it together.
The previous president of the club proposed
that we create a set just like this place.
We even had to measure the tables and the height of the chairs.
Didn't we, waiter?
You remember, don't you?
I... I...
I don't.
It's just that I wasn't working here then.
-Yes. -Yes.
-Maybe you remember, Azusa. -Maybe you remember, Azusa.

They asked me questions about how we treat the customers
and also how we serve dishes.
Come on.
Come on, Su.
Let's watch Yui's birthday video together.
Hey... You've already finished your part, right?
Yes, and I sent it to the computer a while ago.
-But the Ozumi hasn't arrived yet.
-Oh, is he?
Yes, he is, but he's gone to the toilet.
Ah.
Maybe we'll make a little noise, we hope we won't disturb.
Eh?
It won't start.
I don't get it.
Is the battery dead?
Uh, excuse me, could you plug it in somewhere?
Yeah, sure, sure.
-Thank you very much.
-I've got it.
Oh!
(Small explosion)
-The light!
It's gone.
-Oh!
I thought I... saw some sparks.
Yeah, me too.
They came out of the socket.
-Eh? -Yeah.
Yes.
-Azusa, check the leads.
Huh? (Chuckles)
Ah!
Aaaaah!
-But what...?
- (body: falls to the ground)
(body: falls to the ground) -Yes!
-Azusa, hurry up!
(body: falls to the ground) Oh!
(body: falls to the ground) Oh!
But what's all the fuss?
Aaaaah!
Oh!
(Small explosion)
-The light!
It's gone.
-Oh!
I thought I... saw some sparks.
Yeah, me too.
They came out of the socket.
-Eh? -Yeah.
Yes.
-Azusa, check the leads.
Huh? (Chuckles)
Ah!
Aaaaah!
-But what...?
- (body: falls to the ground)
(body: falls to the ground) -Yes!
-Azusa, hurry up!
(body: falls to the ground) Oh!
(body: falls to the ground) Oh!
But what's all this fuss?
Aaaaaaaah!
Got it?
I have, please, hold on!
Don't touch it!
Hold still!
-That's murder.
-Huh?
You can't touch anything, you'll contaminate the crime scene.
Eh?
Aah...
-There's no question.
-Aah...
This was an assassination attempt.
Azusa!
Call an ambulance and contact the police.
Right away!
Since he was stabbed with such a long sashimi knife,
I thought he died on the spot.
But I don't think the police should be called.
When she was stabbed, as you can see,
her blood got on my cheek.
Yes, and it stained my glasses.
So, according to this, we can be absolutely sure...
that the assailant's hands or sleeves are stained with blood.
Wow, I can't believe it!
But how can it be that no one has blood stains?
Listen, you, the silent man who wants to leave...
Could you show us your hands, please?
Ah, yes.
And let me tell you, he had no intention of leaving.
Oh, boy.
He doesn't have any blood spatter either.
"Again..."
Oh, my goodness.
Why do these things always happen to me?
"Seriously, Heiji, you mean you're not cursed?"
Eh?
That I don't go down to the Poirot?
Why not?
We've just finished making dinner for Ran's father
and we were just about to come down and get you.
It turns out... it turns out you've been... about to kill...
I'm sure it must be impressive when you see it live.
They're filming!
They're filming a movie!
"Really? I want to see it too."
Silly!
Don't even think about coming!
"It's a really scary horror movie."
What?
We'll be right back when we're done.
- "Eh... Okay."
Go on through, I'll meet you there.
He says they'll be here later.
We're going to see him without them?
Oh! (Thinking) "An ambulance?
(thinks) "An ambulance? It's a movie about a hospital?"
Come on, let's go!
I can't wait to see the lighting.
(Laughs) All right.
Right.
As you can see,
around the victim's computer socket,
at Tengo Anzai, someone had tied a very thin wire,
so that as soon as he plugged it in, it shorted out.
and blew out the coffee's wiring.
Then, someone who was already inside the establishment stabbed the victim,
stabbed the victim in the dark.
Of course he did.
Probably.
But... we must keep in mind that no traces of blood were found
on the hands or sleeves of the victim's three friends,
nor those of the other client.
Nor, evidently, neither on Conan's nor on Hattori's hands,
nor to the hands of Amuro and Azusa, who were in the establishment.
And this, despite the fact that both Conan and Hattori had blood on their faces,
and that the table where they were sitting was also splattered with blood.
Look.
Yes.
Does the victim usually have his computer with him?
Yes, he usually carries it in that backpack on the floor.

But many times he leaves it in the drama club room.
Anyone could have opened it for him.
Yes, besides, in Tengo he has many enemies.
Enemies?
He often flirts with other men's girlfriends
and that gets him into trouble.
He even often flirts with my girlfriend, Yui.
That's because we've been friends since we were little.
I've told you a thousand times that he's just joking.
No!
Tengo's father is a member of Parliament.
Everyone has heard
that he's pulled his son's chestnuts out of the fire many times.
Eh?
By the way, the victim was sitting in this chair...
before the power went out, right?
Can you tell me where you were sitting, the rest of you?
I was...
sitting across from him, on this bench here.
I was sitting next to the Anzai, on that chair over there.
-And you, Ozumi, where were you?
- (at the same time) Very well.
We understand each other.
Actually, I was the first to arrive, but...
I had to leave my bag and go straight to the bathroom.
I've had a stomachache all afternoon.
Ah!
You're the toilet.
So, of all of us, you're the only one who could have cleaned up...
the possible blood splashes.
But what does he say?
If you suspect me, examine me!
Even if I had washed myself with water,
with a reaction of I don't know what you can still detect it.
Hm?
(Amide) Luminol.
It is used to detect nitrogen-containing compounds.
If a mixture of luminol and hydrogen peroxide is prepared,
if it is sprayed over traces of blood it reflects a pale light.
But, even if you check it,
I don't think the luminol will make any reaction to the Ozumi's arms.
Before the police arrived
I took a close look at the security camera footage.
He was the first to enter Poirot and went to the toilet.
After a moment, Anzai and Yui arrived,
and shortly after also arrived in Nagatsuka.
The light went out when they were about to watch a video.
The one of the anniversary of the Yui.
Until the watching of the video has been interrupted,
the washroom door was closed all the time.
I doubt the Ozumi could have known where everyone was sitting.
But, let's see, on the toilet door there is a peephole, right?
Ah, you mean this?
This glass is frosted,
even if you look you can't see what's going on in the room.
See?
Yes, it's true.
Hey, Kudo, do you know who he is, this guy?
Because he's not just a waiter, is he?
Ah, this guy is...
Eh?
He's going.
Say!
He's what?
Go ahead.
Ah, well... he's a detective.
He told Kogoro... he said he wanted to be his apprentice.
He did?
He's the pumpkin head's apprentice?
Poor good-for-nothing.
(Kogoro) Atxum!
(Breathes in) My goodness.
But what is this?
I come home exhausted after a tiring day,
there are police cars in front of the Poirot, and on top of that the Ran is not here.
Since when do they put konjac curry noodles?
Wow.
Well... it's pretty good, actually.
Hm?
Inspector!
I have carefully examined the students' belongings.
The list is as follows:
the Ozumi has keys, a pack of cigarettes, a lighter, a wallet, a cell phone and a gift wrapped by the Yui, containing a necklace,
cell phone and a gift wrapped by Yui, containing a necklace.
The Yui carries a cloth handkerchief, tissues, make-up,
keys and a purse.
Nagatsuka carries some eye drops, the wallet,
cell phone and a gift for Yui, which is a pair of gloves.
I also checked the contents of the Ozumi's backpack,
but there is nothing that could have been used to commit the assault.
Understood.
Excuse me, but it seems that... they only suspect the three of us.
Couldn't it have been someone outside?
Maybe there was someone outside, and when the power went out,
he came in with night vision goggles and stabbed her.
Hm?
-I doubt this was possible.
Hm?
Why are you so sure, you?
Immediately after the man was stabbed and called,
I positioned myself right in front of the door of the premises
to make sure no one could get out,
and I'd say I succeeded.
Ah, so that's why...
that when the power came back on I was standing by the front door.
Yes.
You must have good night vision, you.
No.
I was using the cell phone to tru...
to listen to some music.

I took advantage of the light from the cell phone.
Tru... music?
By the way, excuse me.
You haven't told us your name yet, sir.
My name?
My name is Shinichi Wada, and I work in the medical field.
Ah... ah, yes?
That's why I'm curious to know...
how it is that of all the people in the Poirot, no one has blood stains.
"Shinichi... Wada?"

Y've been thinking about you.
Y've been thinking about you.
Itsumo kokoro kimi no soba.

No one got any blood splatter.
I couldn't tell where everyone was sitting.
But I've come up with a trick to keep the blood from splattering.
"The autumn wind gracefully pushes the clouds away."
"A hundred poets, a hundred poems"?
What's the point, now this?
"I know how it all went."
"Now I understand."
