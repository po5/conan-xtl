- (Mitsuhiko) Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
- (Genta) Oh, look!
- (Genta) How much snow!
- (Ayumi) How beautiful!
Oh, yeah!
-(Ayumi) Hey, guys!
Be careful, please!
- (Genta) It's all white!
(All) Welcome everyone to the Ice Rink Hostel.
Thank you, we are very excited.
Hello, girls, good morning.
Hey, guys, say hello, right, at least?
(All) Hello, good morning!
-(All) Yes!
-Why don't we make a snowman? -Why don't we make a snowman?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(All) - It's okay!
-Sorry kids.
We used to love playing in the snow too.
-And so much!
We spent the whole day outside.
The children come here to expend energy, which is very healthy.
Yes, there are those who have mass, of energy.
Mm?
And there are those who have too little.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
They're so much fun, the snow battles!
Oh! (Genta) Ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Genta) Ha-ha-ha-ha!
What an aim!
Ouch!
Now you've gone too far, huh?
You'll see, Genta!
-He's still a kid, too... -You're still a kid, too...
- (Ayumi) Run, run!
(Conan voice) "The lines of the hand are wicks,

(Conan voice) Oh!
Got it, bird!
No, I'll pass.
You don't play, Ai?
You don't want to play?
Oh, don't you?
I don't like to play with the snow.
Sorry, that's not playing.
What else are you doing here?
I'd rather say it's art.
Ha-ha-ha!
Art, you say?
You're a bit conceited.
I've touched it, touched it, touched it!
Ouch!
Wow!
What an aim, Ayumi!
Hey, where is it in Genta?
I haven't seen it for a while.
Ah, I know why.
Aaaah!
Genta!
Entoma-la, this one!
He's gone to dry his face.
-But I think it's taking a while, don't you think?
How mean you are!
I hope you didn't hurt him.
All right, all right, I'll get him!
Genta!
Eh? (Woman) But what are you saying?
(Woman) What are you saying?
Juri, it's over.
Don't put up with him anymore!
-Please don't ask me to do that.
-Workshop with him at once, all right?
You're no one to tell Juri what to do, Aya.
- (Masahiko) Shut up, will you!
- (Aya) Why not?
Bah!
Eh...
-Screw it!
-Wait, Masahiko!
Juri..., aren't you feeling well?
It's just that you're... what's not there!
Oh...
Boy, I'm sorry you saw this.
He-he... Who's that guy?
It's Masahiko Fujita, Juri's boyfriend.
He's from an important family here in town.
Ryoko and I think it would be better if he was left alone.
But Juri doesn't see it.
Ah... Co-Conan!
Hey, Genta!
And now!
Where did you come from?
But you still have snow on your face.
Oh, yes, it's true.
Besides, as far as I've seen, the toilet is here.
Ah, yes, yes, you're right.
Yes, yes, you're right.
I don't know what happened to him, now, in this...
Ah, no, it's that... No, nothing.
What are you doing here?
Children should not enter, in the kitchen.
It's dangerous, there are knives and things that burn.
I agree.
(Ayumu) Wow!
You really know, Ay!
Yes, they're really beautiful.
They are very realistic, they are very artistic.
Yes, I'm quite happy.
(Shinichi, thinking) "Then she'll say she's not having a good time."
-Why don't we go back?
I'm hungry already.
- (guts: rac-rac)
-Hello, Aya!
How are you?

-Hello!
-Yes, very much!
-Did you enjoy playing in the snow?
It was fantastic!
Why didn't you come to play with us?
It's just that we older kids have other commitments.
(Aya) Thank you for waiting for us, you can start now.
(All) Bon appetit!
What a joy that makes!
Did you do all this?
Ryoko, who is a super cook, made it.
Yes, because the other sisters are a disaster.
-Calm down, calm down...
-What are you saying, you?
Yes, let's start, bon appetit.
Come on, let's start, guys.
Bon appetit!
-Bon appetit, everybody!
-Bon appetit, bon appetit!
How come you don't eat, Ayumi?
It smells like garlic and I don't want to have bad breath,
just today when we all have to spend the night here.
Yes, it smells like garlic.
(Shinichi, thinks) "But it's strange."
"It seems to me that none of these dishes are made with garlic."
-Yes!
And it was all very good!
-Ugh!
I'm stuffed to the brim!
-Thank you very much.
-Yes, everything was great!
Oh, by the way!
Juri, isn't it your turn to take a pill?
Or have you already taken it?
Ah, no!
That's right.
Thanks, Aya, I didn't remember.
What an absent-minded girl.
Juri is very pretty, but sometimes she's still like a child.
-What's wrong?
-They're not here!
What am I going to do now?
I can't find the pills.
They're not here!
-What?
-You've already had a good look, Juri?
Ah... yes.
But do you need them a lot, or what, the pills?
Well, I'd say if he misses a dose once it's okay,
but so far she hasn't missed any.
We don't know if it can affect her.
Well, come on!
I'll go to the hospital to get some for you.
I'm sure they'll have some there, I'm sure.
I can't... ask you to do that.
It would be great if you could go, please.
Ryoko, what do you say?
Woman, for a chance that I have to look good...!
Do you really mean it?
All right, then, go on it.
Let's go!
Au, bye.
I'll be right back.
-Yes, I'll be right back.
-Go carefully! -Yeah...
Yes...
It's snowing a lot now.
- (both) Mm?
- (phone)
Hello?
Yes, this is the Ice Rink lodge.
Exactly, that's right.
Masahiko hasn't arrived yet?
It can't be, it's been out for a long time!
It hasn't arrived?
It should have been a long time ago!
Now I'm trying to call him.
Okay, thank you.
-There's no way, he doesn't answer.
-What then?
To see if something has happened to him.
Going out to look for him will be difficult, with so much snow.
Masahiko's car is here.
He may have gone on foot.
Since it must have snowed a lot, maybe he thought it was dangerous to take it.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Maybe."
-Masahiko!
-Masahiko!
It can't be him!
It's him!
Understood.
Okay, thank you.
The police won't be able to come up for a while,
because it's snowing too much.
Of course they will.
They say we don't touch anything, especially.
He must have slipped on the ice and fallen.
I think so, you can see the trail here.
It probably fell from up there.
(Agasa) Oh...
A really terrible accident, my goodness.
Yes, but the place from where it fell...
What do you find strange?
I don't like that there's so much snow accumulated on the side of the road.
There's a lot of it touching the mountain and a lot less near the cliff.
-But it's quite normal, that's all.
-Yes, it's true.
The snow always tends to accumulate more
in places where the sun and the wind don't touch it so much.
Yes, but still, it's rare...
No!
Hey, watch out, don't run!
I had warned you.
Oh!
Ah...
No, it's nothing.
Did you hurt yourself?
What did you find, Conan?
(Shinichi, thinks) "What's this?"
And what I also have trouble understanding...,
what I also have a hard time understanding is why Masahiko has risked
to go through this straight and dangerous way.
Man, the answer is easy: because it is the shortest way.
Yes.
Really?
Cars can't get through, of course,
but it's much faster to go down to the village.
Now, we don't go very often, because it is a dangerous road.
And that's what Aya has taken, when he came down before?
Hello!
Ah... Ah, yes, yes.
I had to run some errands.
(Girl: sobs)
It's my fault!

If I hadn't lost the pills, Masahiko would still be alive!
Calm down, it's nobody's fault.
Come on, woman, please, it was an accident.
He was just unlucky and that's all.
Yes, he shouldn't have taken the shortcut, poor thing.
Mm?
(Door: Ã±aca)
Who's here?
(Shinichi, thinking) "But it's..."
(Breathes shakily)
(Coughs)
Yes...
Are you all right?
Yes, thank you very much.
It's just a little hard to breathe.
Do you want me to tell your sisters?
No, please, I'm better now, it won't be necessary.
I don't want them to worry about me anymore.
They always have to take care of me as if I were their little daughter.
And you think they're willing to do anything for you?
Nothing, it's all the same, let it go.
Eh?
Where are you taking her, this fridge?
(Genta) Wow!
It's heavy as a dead man.
(Mitsuhiko) Shut up and be careful.
I've already told them it wasn't necessary, but they insisted...
-We want to take them with us.
-Waita...
(Mitsuhiko) And that's because they won't melt.
(Shinichi, thinks) "But they should keep them inside the freezer."
"He-he! Poor things, they haven't fallen out."
(Shinichi voice) Sure, I got it!
They've done it like this!
Hey, what do you got, Conan?
You tell us.
What do you want to talk to us about?
Ahem...
(Agasa voice) In fact, I've made you all come here...
because I've already solved the murder case.
Murder?
But it wasn't an accident?
(Agasa voice) Well no, Masahiko didn't fall by accident.
Someone has set a trap for him by the side of the road
so that he fell and killed himself.
I can say with certainty that it was murder.
- (all three) What?!
- (all) What?!
W-wait a minute.
There was no trap, on the way!
No one knew, that Masahiko would walk to the village.
And when he has marched we were all in the hostel.
Nobody has moved, and if someone had gone to take her out we would have seen it.
-Huh?
-There was no trap to be sprung anywhere.
In fact, ladies, I would add one more fact.
If my deductions are correct, and I'm not mistaken....,
(Agasa voice)... it's more than likely that the trap is still set.
What happens is that the killer has used snow and ice, only.
First, he has put a lot of snow along the path that touches the mountain,
because it forced Masahiko
to pass by the side facing the cliff.
Then, he put an ice slab there....
that he had previously in the freezer.
Ah, of course!
The ice in the snow is not visible and, moreover, it kind of melts away,
it is not necessary to remove it to avoid suspicion.
Wait a minute, but then, then...
Exactly, there is no trace of any evidence left.
Now then, the murderer has made a mistake.
(Conan voice) I found this next to where it fell on Masahiko.
It's little pieces... of it.
(Conan voice) What's this?
Ah, a pack of garlic ice cream that was on sale at the supermarket.
Yes.
I saw it yesterday, me!
And there was still a piece left before,
but I'd say he took it from Genta sneaking out of the freezer.
Oops!
How-how did you know?
I've matched heads with what I've seen before.
I know you pretty well.
Now, where'd you come from?
Ah!
Co-Conan?
But you still have snow on your face.
How come you don't eat, Ayumi?
It smells like garlic and I don't want to have bad breath.
But there was no garlic on the dinner plates.
The smell came from the ice cream she had eaten earlier at Genta.
I'm sorry, I was really hungry.
(Agasa voice) When in Genta has taken the ice cream on the sly,
the murderer had just left the tray
to freeze the water by the trap inside the freezer.
Then, when in Genta has bitten the ice cream,
the little pieces of garlic fell into the water on the plate
and got caught.
The killer didn't notice and picked up the ice cream plate....
with the pieces of garlic from the ice cream.
Otherwise, it would have been impossible to find at the crime scene.
Therefore, the murderer in question must necessarily be...
someone who lives here, in the hostel.
I already know who it is!
Aya is the murderer!
You are right that this afternoon, when we were returning to the hostel,
we saw that Aya was coming from the road alone.
Hello!
But she wasn't wearing anything except her coat,

And when he saw us, he greeted us.
To set the trap, it was necessary to go with the ice plate and a shovel,
at least, to move the snow that was there.
It is impossible to do it with just your hands.
And if it had been her, she would not have called us to say hello.
No, the murderer is not the Aya.
But she is a witness to the murder.
It is quite possible that the Aya crossed paths with the murderess
on her way back down the road, on her way to the lodge.
But even if he had suspected something
and went to look at the road, surely he would not have seen the trap.
And if he had seen it, I don't think he would have stopped the killer either.
-Calm down, don't justify yourself.
-It's not true!
I didn't see anyone!
I confess, the murderer is me.
For me the Juri has always been like a daughter...
and I wanted to get rid of that boy, because he was a bad person.
Ryoko, what are you saying?
Juri, you have to understand... that I did it for your own good.
(Agasa voice) The trap could only be stopped by
someone who had access to the kitchen in order to make the ice plate.
I also had to be able to take the plate out of the kitchen when it was ready,
without anyone seeing it.
The Ryoko was making dinner, at the time.
Logic would point out that the murderer must be her.
But I think that's what she wants us all to think,
and that in reality you, Ryoko, are not the murderer either.
Why not?
You esteem Juri as if she were your own daughter,
but you wouldn't kill anyone she esteemed,
because you know it would hurt her, too.
You only confessed because you want to protect her.
But, in reality, the Juri is the killer.
What ?!
Stop it, I'm telling you it was me!
Yes!
I myself have made the ice plate, which has killed him, in our freezer!
-No!
Aya, tell the truth!
-You're saying that to protect the Juri, aren't you?
Isn't it true that you have seen me near the road, in the afternoon?
Didn't you?
Didn't you?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop protecting me, both of you!
It's me, the murderer!
He's right, I killed him!
(Agasa voice) It's your pills, isn't it?
This proves that he had not lost them step.
So, it was a lie?
But if in Masahiko has volunteered
to fetch the pills from the hospital!
Besides, there is another thing: how could he know that I would take the shortcut?
This is very easy to explain.
You're a pain in the ass, Juri!
Are you sure that if I do what you say, you'll break up with me?
Yes, I really will.
Even if it's just for once,
I want you to make it look like you're doing something good for me.
Then I'll let you go without asking you for anything else.
(Agasa voice) And that must have been when you told him to take that shortcut, right?
to take that shortcut, right?
Yes, I told him it was the shortest way.
And what he said before, then?
Give me a chance to look good once in a while, will you!
It was just a sign of confirmation
that everything was over forever between us.
It's his fault!
We have to break up, Juri.
You have to understand.
I've started dating another girl.
-Oh!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
You depress me, you're slow thinking and you're boring.
It must be the way you've been brought up.
I couldn't... I'm sorry... I couldn't forgive him for that.
I'm so sorry!
