Stars have a certain appeal.
Whether they are culprits or performers.
We're going to see a magic show with the Osaka duo.
Magic that triggers a mysterious case.
He looks like a kid but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

Yes.
We'll go with the two of them to see it.
Ah, I'm so envious!
If you are looking for the Budokan palace,
you should go straight down this street, and turn left.
(Thinking) "But why?"
"Oh! I don't understand why I'm so nervous..."
(Imitates woman) Who am I?
It's me, king!
(Imitates woman) Stop it!
(Imitates woman) Stop it!
What the fuck are you doing?
Kudo!
Oh, what a pain!
As I was saying, Ran...
(Think) "Hey, Hattori!"
Ah!
Cu... Monkey's balls, right?
I told you to stop messing around!
Oh... Heiji!
Holy cow!
"Hey, Hattori."
THE MAGIC OF THE DEDUCTIONS OF IN CONAN AND IN Heij≈ç, (THE TRICKS).
That's all right.
Sorry for making you come so fast.
(Shinichi voice) Hey, Hattori.
Why are we here?
And why are we going back to dogo Hoshikawa's magic show?
He-he-he-he-he.
Because "I'd love to feel haunted by the mystery."
The stuff of a sunny chard that out of stupid selfishness...
-Don't call me "sunny chard"!
-She's so chardy and so stupid...
Eh?
Kazuha, they're over there...
(Heiji) Au, let's hurry Contact us...
Co... Conan...
Ah, it's these!
Hurry up, Ran!
(Heiji) Come on!
Hey, don't you think there's a lot of young people?
Are you sure about that?
Eh?
This kid's in doge Hoshikawa?
Check it out, Ran.
Isn't he cute in Dogo Hoshikawa?
And not just because of the way he looks.
He's also a really good magician.
(Bell: ring)
(Audience: applauds)
Of course he is!
My goodness!
What beautiful girls!
Ooh!
Ooh!
That's what I thought.
Eh?
Isn't it tied with a string?
(People) Oooooh!
(Audience: standing ovation)
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
How cool!
Ya...
Are you sure?
It's gone!
Unbelievable!
He's like a real witch!
It's so cool!
How cool!
(Heiji) Burres...
There are no witches in this world.
I think so, too.
That cage is made in such a way that one comes out from behind,
and he left when they covered the cage with the sheet.
But we didn't see him leave.
He has mingled among the 8 girls who help him.
Surely, that magician was dressed like them...
inside the cage to blend in and go unnoticed.
Since no one is bothering to count how many assistants he has,
it doesn't matter if there are 8 or 9 people.
Thus, he can disappear from the stage by making a pinafore with them...
and drop into the bleachers while the sheet burns!
But the number where we saw her flying was impressive!
Yes, it looked like she was really flying.
We didn't see any wires.
She was holding her body with a cane
and moved it from behind the curtain with that.
The curtain has vertical and horizontal openings,
and as the spectators think there is a cable, they look up.
Shut up!
Why don't you please close the nozzle!
(Think) "What the fuck..."
"He had told me that if I found out what the trick was, I would explain it to him."
And now, the jewel that will make the end of the show shine.
A slightly more dangerous number: the water tank leak!
As you can see, he has his hands and feet handcuffed,
and the water tank is also locked,
but if he manages to escape... it will be an incredible event!
Hasn't it been too long?
(Audience: whispers)
It's been... 10 minutes since he got in, right?
-Come on, somebody get the axe!
-Abaixeu the heel!

(Presenter) There has been a slight mishap.
Please hold on a moment.
This was the stuff that Houdini, that legendary magician, did, wasn't it?
Yes, it was one of the regular acts of that escapologist magician.
Yes!
Come on, Ran!
Uh... Yes.
Hattori, they're gone.
Ah, wait!
You can't go through!
- (Kazuha) Get out of the way!
-But... excuse me...
Ran, break the water tank with a blow from you!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...!
Uh!
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Oh!
Looks like... I've done it.
A round of applause... to the great luck that I have
and to these girls who have given... more excitement to the show.
Hey, Hattori...
What do you want?
Yes...
You wanted to see him today, didn't you?
(Ran and Kazuha) Seriously, we're really sorry!
We thought he was in danger... Oi, Ran?
Eh... Excuse me, please!
It's okay, it's okay.
Besides, if I was saved, it was thanks to you.
I felt you...
just when I was about to lose consciousness, in the water chamber.
I heard your voice full of love.
Yes, really?
Really?
What a liar.
He probably took off his handcuffs
with some thin object he had in his mouth
and he had been out for a while.
He made it look like the camera was open in front of the spectators
so that they would believe that there would be no way to open it.
But what he did was to go out through a part that was not closed.
Afterwards, we had to wait behind the curtain...
until the audience started to get nervous and the spring appeared.
In this way, I could stage an exciting escape...
(Door, open)
(Door, open) Wow!
That was an impressive performance, Hoshikawa!
Do you want to do a joint show next time?
If you like... how I work, perfect.
Great, you'll help me a lot!
It's just that you're a very popular person...
Well, maybe you could add me too.
Then I can prove it to you.
We'll see which of the 3 of us is a worthy successor to our master...,
the wonderful Mr. Masakage.
Mister Masakage?
He was a magician who lived surrounded by mysteries.
But 10 years ago, he suddenly disappeared.
We don't even know where he was from.
It is said that he lives somewhere.
(Think) "Mister Masakage."
I never thought that these were disciples of Mr. Masakage...
Ah, that's right!
In Kazumi Sanada equals in fame to in Hoshikawa,
we could ask him to be added and put on the show:
"The four kings of magic on a dream stage."
-I don't know if he will accept it.
-I don't mind, but....
Mmmm.
Although he's also a magician like us, I don't know him...
Now that you mention it, Ran, didn't you know Kazumi Sanada?
Yes...
I met him when the Sonoko's family was celebrating the sixtieth anniversary party
Suzuki Financial Group's sixtieth anniversary party on a boat.
"In Kaito Kid sent one of his cards."
"The Sonoko's mother had hired in Sanada,
"and he showed up dressed as the Kaito Kid to add to the excitement."
"On another occasion, the wife of Motoyasu Tsukumo, a magician,
"Asked my father to find out the cause of her man's death."
Gee, you know in Sanada?
Then, we'll let you get in touch...
to ask him for this favor,
and we'll discuss the matter at Master Masakage's house.
Would you like to come?
After lunch we'll put on a magic show for you.
Can we come?
You mean it?
You're serious?
-Hey, hey, you've forgotten?
-Why at the master's house? -Why at the master's house?
Today is the tenth anniversary of the teacher's disappearance.
Who knows if he'll come home from nowhere, don't you think?
(Doorbell: ding-dong)
(Woman) Welcome!
Oh!
Tenko, Hoshikawa, those of you back there, is that you?
-Long time no see.
-Nice to meet you.
Yes, it's been a long time.
It must have been 10 years.
Eh?
Who are these guys?
They're tonight's special guests.
(At the same time) Sorry for the inconvenience.
Then I'll have to go buy some things to make dinner.
There won't be... We had already thought about it and, look...
Wow!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Mr. Kanda, do you come here every year around this time?
I'm hoping that the master will come back someday.
But, unfortunately, we haven't heard from him in the last 10 years.

This house brings back a lot of memories...
You understand, because some time ago,
all 3 of us lived here and received special training from the master.
Oops!
You came to see us very often before you became a disciple.
So, in Hoshikawa you are the best disciple of the master, right?
-That has nothing to do with who came first,
but who has enough skill with magic to surpass the master.
-Tenko, please, please....
If it's true that we'll do a show all together,
the number I will choose to do will be "The Rebirth of the Witch".
I will hold up a cross in the middle of the audience and make the audience wait until I am hung from the cross.
until they have hung me from the cross.
There they will set fire and my body will disappear in the flames.
And I will rise again from the ashes.
You'll see, it's an unbeatable number indeed.
What do you think of it?
It's interesting and very exciting.
Uh... Yes...
Oh, I have to get dinner ready.
We'll be glad to help you, won't we?
It's been a long time since I've been here and I'll do a lap.
Yes, good idea.
I'll be resting in the room until dinner time...
I'm up very early today.
Okay, we'll let you know as soon as we've prepared dinner.
Hattori, the mood has suddenly changed, hasn't it?
Yes.
"Hello! Today I, Yoko Okino..."
What!
Put me in touch with the magician Kasumi Sanada?
I can't do that!
I don't know the phone number!
It already seemed impossible to me.
We only had to see him twice.
Changing the subject, let's see if you'll come home!
I'm starving!
Sorry, but I'll be back late today.
You must have dinner at Poirot's.
Ran, come help me!
- (communication cut off)
-Hey?
Hey!
Can you feel me?
-Hey!
- (tut-tut)
Come, it's too much work for me alone.
(tut-tut) Eh?
Where's the lady?
She had run out of an ingredient and went to buy it,
but she hasn't come back.
I thought that pair could help us, but...
There's no way...
These things don't cut as well as my deductions.
Could it be that the deductions are better if they are linked?
Ah!
That was a tough one.
In the end I did most of the work.
Excuse me, please.
I'm sure you will.
Right?
How's it going?
Oh!
Everything looks so good!
Eh?
And your companions?
They are now in the kitchen nursing some wounds.
They've cut themselves with the kitchen knives.
Well... I'll go wake up Mr. Kanda.
It must be in the back room on the second floor, as usual.
Hoshikawa, could you go get the Tenko?
Yes, in her case, it's probably that room.
That room?
Yes, in Master Masakage's room.
There are photographs there, objects from long ago,
tricks and things that bring back a lot of memories.
Eh?
Magic tricks?
Do you also want to go?
Of course I do!
Yes!
This house was built by Master Masakage himself.
The master's room is the second floor.
It is dark and a bit sinister, I find.
Blow, what a narrow hallway.
This room with the door on the right is the master's room.
- (CLEC, CLEC)
-Eh?
It looks like the light's gone out.
A blackout?
What happened?
Where are the leads?
They don't seem to be in this kitchen.
Ah!
Madam, where are the differentials?
Next to it.
In the sink.
Ah, I've already found them!
(Knock)
Yes!
Hattori!
What happened?
What was that?
What's in this room?
What is the meaning of this?
It's a library where the master kept all the documentation
on magic that he had collected traveling around the world...
This was the number of the Christmas tree...
A little boy calls me a little boy?!
How can you talk to me like that, you piece of trunk?
The 3 disciples when they were younger.
(Heiji) This picture...
This means...
And the next Conan:
"The magic of Conan's deductions and in Heiji, (the house)."
