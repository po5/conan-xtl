(Door: squeaks) Oh!
Oh!

"The secret of the missing young wife."
Hm.
Ayumi is right, it's very suspicious.
Yes, I'm sure it was the husband, what did her in.
-Well, I'm not so sure.
-I thought the same thing.
Eh?
Think of it as a residential area.
You'd have to be a donkey to move a corpse in broad daylight.
-Yes, actually. -Maybe so.
-Maybe so. -Maybe so.
(thump)
Oh!
Hey, Conan.
You're going home already?
Sorry, I've got things to do.
Bye-bye!
Oh! (Laughs)
Come to think of it,
the latest Detective Samonji novel came out today.
What a jerk!
So he cares more about the book than us.
-What?!
-I'm leaving you guys too.
You're leaving too?
W-wow.
(Ayumi) Oh...
(Ayumi) This is the house I was telling you about.
-Go in and take a look.
-It's a little scary.
They must have gone out.
The car isn't here either.
From what you've told us, only that musician lives here,
Mr. Makabe, and his wife, right?
Yes.
Mr. Makabe is half-Japanese, half-foreigner.
Being a musician, he has to travel a lot for work...
and he can't seem to spend much time at home.
Hey, look.
No way.
- (man) Hey, guys.
-They look like... bloodstains.
What are you doing here?
Haven't you been taught that you can't enter someone else's house without permission?
Ah!
It's just that the ball accidentally slipped into your garden.
Didn't it?
Didn't you?
Hm?
You're that girl, the Ayumi.
Ah... Y-yes, yes.
Where's your car?
What's she done?
Eh?
Uh, uh...
I just dropped it off at the shop.
I brought it up the mountain the other day and I scratched it.
Huh?
That's my wife's blood.
But your wife is alive?
Of course she's alive.
We had a scare a few days ago, but she's fine now.
She's resting now.
Don't worry about her, honey.
-(Mr. Makabe) Huh?
- (Mr. Makabe) Is something wrong?
No, no, nothing.
A scare, of course.
Let's not bother him anymore, then.
Hehehe!
What a waste of time!
In the end we came here for nothing.
Well, I thought it was very good that...
-What?
-That man has deceived us.
Yes.
I saw it very clearly.
Didn't you notice in the hall?
I did, and there was no pair of women's shoes.
S-so, this means the woman isn't at home.
Yes.
But that's not enough.
Hey, look, the delivery guy.
That's the house we just went to, right?
Uh-huh.
Is that right?
Did you hear a scream?
Yes.
And, if I'm not mistaken, it was yesterday afternoon,
but it was a little earlier than it is now.
(Woman) Aaaaah !!!!
But I didn't feel anything else,
so I didn't think anything of it.
And when you left the milk you didn't see Mrs. Makabe?
Well, no.
In fact, now that you say it,
I haven't seen her for a few days, it's a bit strange.
-And now!
She's in her prime.
-Do you know if something happened to her?
Now it's clear to me: Mr. Makabe killed his wife.
That's what that scream must have been for.
Yes.
Let's not talk anymore.
We'll catch him ourselves.
You're sure?
He's a killer.
He can be dangerous.
Maybe we'd better call for help.
Aai...
Hey.
Is that the house you were saying?
-Haibara!
-Conan!
-I was just passing by by chance.
-I knew you were coming. -I knew it.
So did I.
In fact, I'm halfway to the bookstore.
I thought the bookstore was the other way.
Aix.

Never mind, we have a big problem!
-What?
What do you think?
-And that's what happened.
Hm...
Now you've got it right, haven't you?
Eh?
No, I'm not clear at all.
But there are blood stains on the floor!
What else do you need?
Yes, but we can't jump to conclusions.
Like the scream.
Maybe she's just wounded.
A scream is not enough for us
to say that Mr. Makabe's wife is dead.
And the shoes must have gone to the cobbler, that's why he didn't see them.
-Oh...
-Do you understand?
Au, let's go, it will be dark soon.
Shall we go?
Hm?
Eh?
(Wheels: squeaking)
What a beast!
What a way to drive!
Look, it looks like he's entering the Makabe's house.
Hey, guys!
Hey, man!
Hey.
Do you want to stop...?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Sorry I'm so late.
Oh!
-Take it easy, it's the top of the hill. -Where's the Yuri?
-Where's the Yuri? -Where's the Yuri?
-It's his wife.
-Who's Yuri?
(Woman) What's wrong?
(Mr. Makabe) Haven't you seen a group of children in the street?
- (Mr. Makabe) OK.
Let's go then.
- (woman) A few children?
No.
(Woman) Come on, hurry up, I'm so hungry I'm dying.
What do you say, Conan?
Yes.
It seems that we will have to approach the case from another point of view.
Calm down.
You mean...?
We don't know there's been a homicide.
We should find the body
or some evidence to prove that a murder has been committed.
So what do we do, just stand here?
We do some digging.
It's time for Junior Detectives to take action.
All right, but how will you find the evidence?
-Of course.
-Huh? -Ayumi!
Ayumi!
Oh!
It's from the back door.
With this key we can get into the house.
And how did you know that...?
Never mind, let's go in before the husband comes back.
Let's try.
What?
What's the matter, Conan?
Don't be hasty.
I've already told you.
We don't know for sure yet if it was a homicide.
If we enter the house without permission, we commit a crime.
-The husband is dead, it's quite clear.
-That doesn't matter now. -That's all the more reason.
All the more reason.
It's dangerous.
I have to admit I agree with him.
I don't feel like dying in this house.
- (Genta) What do we do, Mitsuhiko?
- (Mitsuhiko) But...
(Mitsuhiko) Well, I don't know.
-Marx, if you wish.
-Ayumi, stop.
What are you doing?
(Mitsuhiko) -Huh?
-I'm going in to get her by myself.
Ayumi.
Why are you so insistent?
Yuri, the woman who lives here, and I... we had become close friends.
Yuri had a special affection for me
and treated me as if I were her daughter.
We spent many hours together at her house.
(Mitsuhiko) She was the one who showed you where they kept the copy of the key, right?
Yes.
But one fine day, about 6 months ago,
Yuri suddenly started dodging me.
I'm sure he had a good reason for not wanting to see me,
but, still, she didn't give me any explanation.
That's why...
Conan!
(Sighs) Understood.
As you wish.
But, if it goes wrong, it wasn't my idea.
No news.
So far, so good.
"Everything under control, Haibara?"
I'll let you know right away, I know.
"If you see anything..."
"Yes, thank you."
This looks like the master bedroom.
See?
The wife's not here.
Yiih!
Oh!
What's the matter with her?
What's wrong with her?
Ah!
No big deal, it's just a doll.
-A doll?
-You're serious?
As far as I know, you don't have children, do you?
Why do they have a doll in the bedroom?
It's very strange.
I'd say it wasn't there before.
Mm?
What do you want, Genta?
Hey, Conan.
I think this is a bloodstain.
Ah!
(Ouch) "He's coming back. Hurry up."
Come on, turn off the lights.
It's not the time, Genta.
"He's already parked."
(Mobile)
It's all the same.
Leave it, Ayumi.
It's Yuri's cell phone.
Shit, it's already at the entrance.
It's already at the entrance.
"Hurry up."
Come, Ayumi.
(Up the stairs: creaking)
Alert.
He's coming this way.
"Genta, you'll feel me."
Is anyone here?
(Mobile)

-They're still inside.
-What about Conan and Ayumi?
What?
Don't suffer, I've thought of something.
(Door: knock)
Yes?

Who is there?
-Come on, let's go.
-Who is it?
-Hurry up.
-Guys.
-Ah.
-Hm.
Is anyone out there?
(Think) "The pin transmitter."
"And the Ayumi?"
It's here.
(Ayumi) Oh!
(Ayumi) Aaaah!
"It's in danger!"
"Too late."
(Wheels: squeaking)
He's taken the Ayumi.
Where did you come from?
What's happened?
I'll catch up.
Stay here.
What is it?
-It looks like blood.
-You see?
-Don't talk nonsense, Mitsuhiko.
-You mean it's Ayumi's? -You mean it's Ayumi's?
-Don't worry.
-But didn't you see that... -You didn't see that...?
This blood is already dried out.
It sure isn't Ayumi's.
It must also be the woman's.
Maybe that's why she has kidnapped the Ayumi,
because he had seen the blood under the bed.
So, then...
Yes.
This means that the Ayumi is in danger.
Yes.
(Ai) "Conan, can you hear me?"
Tell the police to come at once.
In the meantime I'll rescue the Ayumi, stay calm.
(Horn)
Eh?
(Meowing)
(rumbling)
(Meowing) Eh?
Where am I?
What have you...?
(meowing)
(Miaowing) Shit.
Aah...
Eh?
(Ayumi) Aaaaah!
Ayumi.
Ayumi!
Don't come near me!
Conan!
Help me, Conan, please!
Ajupe't, Ayumi!
Ay, ay...
Conan!
Yes, but it could be worse.
You're hurt?
Sorry, it was my fault.
But what do you say, now?
If it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't have been able to catch the murderer.
-(man) Huh?
- (man) Are you all right, Mr. Makabe?
Is it you?
Are you the girl who fainted at Mr. Makabe's house?
(man) What?
This man, Mr. Makabe, called me a moment ago.
He asked me if I could take a look at a little girl
who had fainted in his house.
How ?!
"Over the hill" was...?
(Woman) Jun.
(Woman) Are you okay?
Yes, I am.
-Yu... Yuri.
-Ayumi.
What? -Yu...
Wow...
E-e-eh...
About it...
We're really sorry.
It's all right.
But g-g-goddamnit, man.
What a powerful shot you got!
Way to mess it up.
I'm sorry, I really am.
Yuri was admitted to deliver her son.
-Ah...
-You thought he was dead?
And, to top it all off,
it turns out that I was taken for this man's lover.
Let's see, tell me how we can be lovers if he's my brother.
Come on...
It's just that earlier we saw them kissing and hugging each other.
Eh?
Ah.
We were just saying hello.
Is this what you saw?
Oh!
It's just that in Japan it's not customary to give kisses and hugs.
-Anyway...
-That's what caused the misunderstanding.
Let them be.
I'm the one who should apologize
for putting you through this ordeal.
But I don't understand, how come they kept the whole pregnancy a secret?
Well, it turns out that some time ago I had a miscarriage
and I lost the child we were expecting.
That loss was very painful for both of us
and we made those around us suffer.
And that is why this time we decided that we would not say anything to anybody
until the baby was born.
-Ah.
-We both agreed.
That's why your husband cheated on us
and you stopped playing with the Ayumi, right?
He did it to hide the pregnancy until the child was born.
Yes.
Poor Ayumi, you must have been worried about me.
-Mm-hm.
-You can't imagine how bad I feel.
Just yesterday, the day I was due,
I suddenly started bleeding.
Now I understand why there was that puddle of dried blood under the bed.
Yes.
Since you couldn't see it and I was very upset about what was going on,
I neglected to clean it up.
Then, the scream that the milk delivery man felt in the afternoon....
Yes, that would be then too.
And what I saw was your husband
stretching you out on the back seat of the car
when you had already lost consciousness.
And instead... I know very badly.
(Cries)
Ayumi.
It has.
Do you want to take the child?
I'll leave it to you.
How cute!
You can come play at home whenever you want.
Are you sure?
I just wouldn't want to...
Of course you wouldn't.
You'll always be this creature's big sister.
Hm.

It had slipped my mind.
This watch that the man is wearing on his wrist is stopped at 11:50.
I think this morning when I saw her she was wearing leather shoes.
(Woman) I didn't know I had saved this very old photo.
I would say that someone has cornered Mr. Kanbayashi against the window
and then pushed her, yes.
"And above all, what was he doing,
Mr. Kanbayashi right on top of this window?"
"Don't miss the next episode:
