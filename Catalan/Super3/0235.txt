Destiny is a test for deductions.
It is a light that sheds light on the most mysterious cases.
Today's scenario is a wine cellar.
A great reserve is the key to the crime.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is Detective Conan!
Something 's just not right!

THE CELLAR CLOSED
(Kogoro) My goodness!
It's a wonderful collection!
Yes sir, it tastes excellent!
Oh..., you understand a lot, Mr. Mouri!
Oh, nothing...
I didn't imagine you knew this collection, you're a great detective!
Come on, come on, it's no big deal.
In fact, this one here is the great collection of wine labels...
that was put together by a family of European aristocrats.
Uh... yeah...
Looks like Mr. Mouri has screwed up.
I guess we'll be out of wine for a while.
Eh?
What won't they have?
Your father complimented his collection.
When someone does that, it gets really heavy.
(Fingers flicking)
He brags about the collection as if they've flipped a switch.
Mr. Mouri will be stuck here for quite a while.
(He thinks) "In other words, he's a wine fanatic."
He repeats the same things over and over again.
Things like:
"This is the jewel of the collection, not easy to come by at all."
This one here is Mosel wine,
a marvel that is not easy to get.
(All: laugh)
Many people are fed up with this and don't come to these parties anymore.
Your father got this scarf, didn't he?
Yes.
His wife gave him a scarf with his initials on it.
She sure did.
All the people Kusaka likes get one.
I got one too, you see?
But now comes the complications,
because this means he's going to invite him very often.
Well, I recommend that your father doesn't ask Kusaka for any loans.
Because if he does, he won't be able to refuse his invitations.
Does this mean that you have asked Mr. Kusaka for money?
Uh, yes... What a thing to ask!
Ha-ha-ha!
You put your finger on the sore spot.
Yes, indeed, all 3 of us have borrowed money from Kusaka.
At Nonaka, he asked him for gambling,
and Takano, to be able to manage the art gallery he runs.
And me, to train as a sommelier.
Oh, a lively conversation.
You seem to be having a lot of fun.
We were just saying that the parties in Kusaka are very entertaining
because you can always drink the best quality wine.
Oh, my husband will be glad to know.
By the way, madam.
When do you think we can start the tasting?
He got so excited about Mr. Mouri that he forgot about us.
Understood.
I'll let you know in a moment.
Please do.
Of course I will!
I'd like to show you the cellar I had the basement built.
Eh ?!
No, that's not necessary...
The wines I'm most proud of are stored there.
Wait, King.
The guests are waiting for you to start the wine tasting.
Oh, no!
I had completely forgotten!
(Think) "Whew! I'm saved."
Forgive me.
Thanks for waiting.
I thought the party would end the way it started.
Excuse me, please.
Oh yeah, I got it!
What do you say we change our plans?
Shall we see
if Mr. Tonomura, the sommelier, gets the right wine?
I find it interesting, but...
It's not funny.
If he's a sommelier, he'll get them all right.
Look at that.
If he suggested it at Kusaka, he must have some really secret wine.
It's natural for a sommelier to guess what the wines are,
but if he fails he loses all credibility.
I don't find any merit in it.
Very good.
Let's do the next one.
If Mr. Tonomura gets all the wines right,
then I'll take what you know.
I get it.
So I can't refuse the proposal.

Very well, let everyone enjoy it.
Come on in.
Cheers, everyone!
(Wringing his neck)
Let's see...
A good wine.
From the region of Tuscany, in Italy.
A Solaia.
Excellent!
Oh!
Tonomura, you know a lot!
We still have a while to go.
This is just the warm-up.
Oh..., this is a very rare wine!
It's a Chateau Latour, isn't it?
And it's probably from 1965.
Oh, it's just fantastic!
You're a real sommelier!
It's as if you know all the wines they put in your hands.
This is the first step in sommelier knowledge.
What a thing.
I'm sorry I only offered you wines for beginners.
Now it's serious.
Let me offer you the best of my collection.
(Door: closes)
Oh, my goodness.
This will take us straight to the cellar of his vanities?
I feel sorry for him.
He'll get a taste of his own medicine.
Why don't we all take a break?
I'm a little tired.
I'm going to get some air
and get this little bender out of my system.
Well, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Something's making me nervous.
Hm...
I don't notice any difference.
-Hey, Mr. Mouri.
-Yes? -Yes?
Don't you think Mr. Kusaka is taking too long?
It's been 40 minutes since he left.
Has it been that long?
It's been that long?
Were you talking about my husband?
It's just that Mr. Kusaka went to the wine cellar 40 minutes ago
and he still hasn't come back.
Oh, what the hell should he do?
Leave the guests unattended.
I'll call him now.
Ah, please, madam, let me escort you.
Perhaps something has happened to her.
Thank you very much, then please accompany me.
Ah, wait Conan!
Be careful, this scale is very straight.
Oh!
Beloved!
What's happened?
Ah!
Mr. Kusaka, Mr. Kusaka!
Mr. Kusaka, are you all right?
Mr. Kusaka!
Madam, the key to the cellar!
What is it?
Yes, the key is here.
Oh, Mr. Mouri, my husband...
Madam, call the police.
It looks like... it looks like your husband has been murdered!
Madam! Madam!
Madam, you have to be strong.
Madam!
(Thinking) "Why? Why have you been left in this unnatural position?"
"Why?"
(Man) The victim is Shohei Kusaka, 52, owner of this house...
and director of a financial institution in the city of Beika.
The circumstances of death are as follows:
asphyxiation caused by strangulation
caused by a rope found around the victim's neck.
Hm, can you explain how the body was found?
Yes, sir.
As Mr. Kusaka did not return from the cellar,
I went with Mrs. Kusaka to see what he was doing.
And we found her here on the floor, with her body facing upwards.
And the cellar door?
-The door was locked. -Inspector!
The lady told me that these are the keys that her husband had.
There is the key to the cellar and the key to the house.
The cellar door locks automatically,
and only Mr. and Mrs. Kusaka had the key.
According to her, there is no other key.
Automatically...
Here, what did you find in this window?
I haven't seen anything.
There's a lot of dust accumulated on the shelves,
and there's no sign of anyone coming in.
As you can see,
the handle of this window is on the inside,
and it can't be opened or closed from the outside.
And even more, notice this:
There is an alarm system connected to the windows,
and if they had tried to force the window,
the alarm buzzer would have sounded.
(Takagi) The alarm system switch is this.
When you press the remote control on the key....
the alarm system is turned off and the window can be opened.
And when the window is closed again..,
the alarm is automatically activated again.
I can see that..,
it's impossible for the killer to get in and out of the window.
In this case, we can focus on who the killer is, can't we, inspector?
Hmm.
This means that the killer knew Kusaka-san very well.
He probably got Kusaka, who was inside, to open the door for him,
entered the cellar...
and then committed the murder.
The wine bottles fell around Mr. Kusaka.
Probably because he fought with the murderer.
That's very likely.
It's very strange here.
Hmm?

Take a good look.
Only the bottles on top of this shelf here have fallen,
while nothing has happened to the bottles on this side.
If there was a fight here, there should be a bigger commotion.
That's right.
That's true.
Eh?
Oh, what a pain!
You're here, by any chance!
By any chance?!
(thinks) "Eh? What are they, these dirt marks?"
"They look like they were made by something you scratched hard."
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaai!
Let's search the back of the house, inspector.
If we don't find evidence that the murderer entered from behind....
(thinks) "Wait a second. What if it was...?"
(Take) There's no sign that the back door was forced open.
Possibly they've made a copy of the key on the sly.
This would be hard to believe, really.
(What do you mean?)
The keys to this house are a special kind: they're electronic.
Making a copy is not easy.
You can't duplicate them in just any key store.
You have to talk directly to the manufacturer.
(Kogoro) Although it's clearer that the murderer is someone here.
Hm.
Where are they, the people in the house and the guests?
Ah, they are in the living room, waiting.
Molt well, let's interrogate.
Eh?
Eeeeh!
Eh!
Conan!
What are you doing here?!
Ah, no, what was I doing?
Well... I was practicing the vertical bar.
-What? - (man) Inspector!
What is it, Chiba?
We have a report from the forensic police
that says they just found two sets of footprints in the warehouse,
in addition to Mr. Kusaka's!
One set belongs to Yukari Takano, a guest,
and the other, Takeyoshi Tonomura's.
All right, let's go to the living room! (At the same time) Yes, sir!
-Take care of Conan, please! Yes, sir!
What? (At the same time)
Uh, sir...
Hey, Inspector Chiba.
What do you want, Conan?
Look, it's just that...
Well, no, they haven't told me anything like that has been found.
-You don't know anything, Tome? -No, I don't know anything about it. -No, I don't know anything about it.
(thinks) "I've found it! I have found a definitive proof!"
"I'm sure that the murderer has not yet been disposed of!"
What?
How does it say ?!
You say that the murderer is here, among us?
Give us an explanation, Inspector!
Judging by the circumstances of the crime scene,
it is possible that the murderer is someone who is in this house.
Here's to you two in particular: Mr. Tonomura and Mrs. Takano!
Your fingerprints were found on the cellar door.
Hey, wait a moment, please!
It's true that I went to the wine cellar!
I went there to ask you for another loan.
But the fact is that I didn't go in! And you, Mrs. Takano?
I also went
to ask if I could extend the deadline to repay the loan.
But I didn't go in!
What about you, Mr. Nonaka?
What about you, Mr. Nonaka?
When Mr. Kusaka left, I went for a walk in the garden.
So I didn't go to the celler.
Yes, I understand.
And what do you have to say, ma'am?
I've been in the kitchen all the time.
To go to the cellar, I had to go through the living room,
where the guests were.
I have been in the living room all the time,
and Mrs. Kusaka didn't come out at any time.
Hey, Kogoro.
(Flow) I found something rather strange in the cellar.
A strange thing?
Hey, Conan, where'd you go?
Where is it, that strange thing?
I want to call my lawyer!
That's right!
We won't say a word until then!
Easy, easy, don't get nervous.
(Mobile) Eh?
Excuse me a moment.
Hello, it's me at Megre.
What?!
You know who the killer is?!
(All) Oooooh!
(Kogoro voice) Well, let me tell you all....
how this ruthless murder has been committed and who the murderer is!
From what we have learned so far,
the murderer is one of these 3 people, but in fact...
Yes, there is no doubt about it!
What a ?
For starters, none of the two people who left footprints on the door,
Mr. Tonomura and Mrs. Takano,
is not the perpetrator of this horrible murder.
Hey, so, you're saying that the murderer is not here?
No, no.
Yes, he is.
But if he is here, he can only...
Just!

The murderer is you....,
Mr. Nonaka!
Uh...
W-wait a minute.
I was in the garden at the time.
I didn't go near the cellar at all!
So, you want us to reconstruct the facts?
Mr. Nonaka has gone into the back garden
and knocked on the cellar window.
- (knock-knock) - (all) Ooh!
Ah, sorry I forgot to warn you,
Inspector Chiba will play the role of the murderer.
So, Mr. Kusaka has disconnected the alarm system...
and opened the window.
Inspector Takagi!
Yes!
You will play the victim.
Uh... Yes, sir.
In Nonaka had Mr. Kusaka go to the back garden.
He must have told him something,
such as what trick Mr. Tonomura had used in the tasting.
Mr. Nonaka, you have murdered her in the back garden....
You locked the back door with the key you stole from her...
and put it back in your pocket.
Wait a minute, Mouri.
How did you get Mr. Kusaka's body into the cellar?
Even if he threw it out the window,
it would be impossible for him to leave it in the middle of the cellar.
He used a clothesline.
A spreader bar?
Yes, Inspector.
You placed the bars parallel to each other and put the body on top of them.
You put the spreader bars through Mr. Kusaka's belt
so that they wouldn't separate in transit.
Then he pushed them through the window...
and then he pushed the body out of the window and made it fall into the hold.
-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Now I understand!
The bottles were broken
so that Mr. Kusaka's legs got caught!
And then he pulled out the bars by stretching it tightly.
Yes, it was the same as when we found the body.
But what did he do with the window?
He hooked a thin wire or something else and pulled it tight.
It closed!
That way, he could place the victim's body between the shelves...
without the need to enter the cellar.
This is nonsense!
Who has any proof, eh?
You have proof?
You do nothing, show us your handkerchief?
That handkerchief that you gave him in Kusaka
where your initials are embroidered.
When you lowered the body, some bottles of wine were broken.
And naturally, this wine splashed on the spreader bars.
But when they examined them, they did not find any wine stains.
That is to say, you cleaned them...
so that your set-up would not be discovered!
As you did not expect the wine bottles to break,
you wiped the bars with the handkerchief you were carrying.
I'm sure he has it on him.
If he threw it away, and someone picked it up, it would be known who the murderer was.
Damn it!
It's only his fault!
It's all his fault!
He was leaving money and asking for exorbitantly high interest rates!
And if there was any setback,
he asked for the money back the next day!
That's why I assassinaaaaaaaat him!
You bastard!
He gives me, whatever motives he may have!
A murder is a murder, bad beast!
It doesn't change the fact that a person died!
Come on, Ran, take a picture of us together, please!
Heavy.
Ready?
What?!
Just a moment!
Madoka, it's Mouri!
Where are you?!
What state is she in?!
And the next Conan:
