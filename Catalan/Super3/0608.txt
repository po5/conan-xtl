(Dog: borda)
Eh?
What kind of chocolate is this?
Are you asking me?
That you don't know the new chocolates that your company brings out?
Ah.
Is it the one they're bringing out in March for White Day: the Spy-white-chocolate-white?
Yes.
It is a very acidic chocolate.
I'm sure it will be more successful than the Spy-choco-black.
I can see you coming.
I'm sure you'll want me to try it and tell you what I think, won't you?
But you know I don't like things that are too sour.
I don't know how to put it: I'm in charge of the sweet products.
and you, as vice-president, the acidic ones.
You do it yourself, but a little taste won't do you any harm.
Who knows, maybe you'll find you like it and all.
What do you say?
No way!
Don't you remember how it turned me on, the lemon cake you made me?
I spent I don't know how many days in bed.
Sorry, I was just trying to remedy
your aversion to sour things.
You won't succeed.
Ah, did you come up with something for the speech I have to make for White Day?
Oh, the March 14th speech?
I need a fun idea
to get the attention of the party guests,
see if we can get a little publicity while we're at it.
I've come up with an idea that I think might work.
I'm sure everyone will be very surprised.
Oh!
Something that will blow everyone's mind?
Yes, and I'm sure you'll be the first.
You'll be scared to death.
"Teary eyes go to the heart."
"Tears signal the beginning of a tragedy."
"In exchange for the chocolates, I'll give you a murder for White Day."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The betrayal of White Day (part one)."
-Oh! -No!
Out of the 24 hours I had, I have less than a minute left.
If I don't manage to find the spy among these people
with the time I have left, everything will blow up.
(Mobile)
What is he doing?
Hasn't he searched all four blocks of the building yet?
Eagerness!
Hey, Yoko, are you sure the information is accurate?
Yes.
The spy is black.
Don't make me repeat everything.
If the spy is black
how come this chocolate is completely white?
It's acidic!
The Spy-choco-white is an even more acidic chocolate.
You will find it in every store!
Don't forget the Spy-choco-black, that's why.
Hey, look!
Gee, Ran, your father does it very well, doesn't he?
And besides,
he got to act in the commercial with his dearest Yoko.
I bet he must be the happiest man in the world.
What, he keeps complaining that no one will recognize him?
with the hat and the sunglasses.
Yeah, but thanks to having made the announcement,
the chocolate factory has invited us to the White Day party.
When is it, the party?
This afternoon? Yes.
Haido City Hotel, starting at 6 o'clock.
It looks like the company was founded 8 years ago on March 14, White Day.
Mmmm.
Now that we're talking about White Day, didn't you get anything as a gift?
Eh?
Yes, you didn't get anything, Shinichi?
He didn't?
You gave him chocolates, didn't you?
With a message, on Valentine's Day.
I didn't have time to give them to him,
he ate them before I could give them to him.
Oh... I would like to know if Makoto will give anything to me.
I did give him chocolates.
I don't know, I guess boys are not as romantic as girls.

Many do not even remember that on March 14 they have to return the gift...
they were given for Valentine's Day.
"This is true." Eh?
If you give them chocolates on Valentine's Day,
they have to give you a gift on White Day?
Look at that.
How interesting!
Inspector Sato!
Did you feel it, Takagi?
Mm?
Yeah, but you didn't give me any chocolates or chocolate,
on Valentine's Day.
(Thinking) "And I spent the whole day waiting..."
But I did give you a chocolate bar.
On February 14, when we were on duty.
-Do you want one? -Huh?
That chocolate bar?!
But you had already eaten half of it.
Excuse me, Takagi, but gifts, like crimes, are made or not made,
there are no half measures;
don't look for excuses.
-Come on, come on, Sato... -(horn)
Hello, partner.
Have you finished interrogating everyone today?
Hello, Shiratori!
What are all these boxes?
What are they, all these boxes?
Ah!
They're the gifts I'm giving Miss Kobayashi on White Day.
I couldn't decide between cookies, candies, chocolate or marshmallows, and...
I finally decided to buy them all for her.
Anyway, see you later.
Have you seen Shiratori?
He is in love.
But for you, Takagi, it's like he doesn't even exist.
Eh... Excuse me, I'm sorry.
I'm very absent-minded.
Ha, ha.
(Traffic rumbling)
What are you doing, Conan?
Where are you going?
I forgot to do something.
Wait for me in the cab, please.
By the way, Ran, how's your cold?
You were a little hoarse.
I was a little hoarse.
I'm better now.
What?!
Yoko Okino can't come?!
-Do you mean it? -Yes.
She called us recently.
It seems that the shooting has dragged on and she can't come.
Well, well, well!
And I had bought him a gift for White Day.
What a bad luck.
What is this?
How dare you?
You haven't given me or my mother a gift yet!
Eh, in your famous detective!
Mm?
Welcome to the 8th anniversary party of Urai Chocolates!
Ah... ah... And-and who are you?
The president of Urai Chocolates, Taruto Urai.
I think this is the first time we've met, isn't it?
T-the president?!
May I introduce... my wife and vice president, the Hoshie.
How do you do?
I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to meeting you, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro.
Ah, mm... I'm very flattered.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh! (Laughs)
Wow!
This party is awesome!
Yeah, it sure is!
Conan, have you seen how many people there are?
Yes.
This way, come on.
Take whatever you want.
Please, no compliments.
You can eat and drink as much as you want.
How nice!
Hurray!
Ah!
Run, come, Ran!
There's everything and you can take whatever you want.
Hurry up to fill your plate.
Mail, it's free!
Please, Father, behave yourself. "In Kogoro it's never measured."
How nice!
Mm...!
Delicious!
You couldn't expect anything less from Haido City,
they serve top-notch food!
What surprise will he have prepared for us? What do you mean?
Yes, man, Mr. Urai!
Sonoko told me earlier.
I can tell he does something fun at every birthday party.
"As soon as he can do a magic trick
"As he showed up dressed up as one of the characters in his commercials,
or play an actor and act out a sketch from a play."
I'm sure everyone here is waiting to see what he does, this year.
Mm... hm.... How interesting!
Mm...
By the way.
I congratulate you on your performance in the ad.
Oh, so much so.
It's true that you were the perfect man to do this year's ad!
Thank you. (Laughs)
Yes.
Ha-ha!
In fact, it was Yoko who was very insistent...
for us to give the role of the agent to you.
She said, "I want you to give the role to Mr. Mouri."
Really?
That's because she must be in love with me.
Ah.
It's not true, that. "You dream."
(Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you one of the stars of this year's announcement.
Mr. Kogoro Mouri.
Eh?
Ahem!
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Hey, Ran.
Can I ask a question? Sure, you can.
I'm a palm reader.
Do you want me to read it for you?
Y-You can read palms?
Oh!
This is new, I didn't know you, this ability.
Eh? No?

Well, every day, in the morning, before waking up, I read you.
YES?
Yes, and you have a very short life line.
Be careful not to leave this world before your time.
-Take it easy, don't pateixis. -Hello.
Since today is White Day, I'll give you a few stories from my experience as a great detective.
of my experience as a great detective.
Oops, I should announce red chocolate, I'm getting red.
(laughs)
I don't know if you know this, but you're a very lucky girl.
You have a lucky line
that stretches from Neptune to your little finger.
Maybe that's why I always get prizes.
What can you tell me...
if I'll be lucky in love?
Hmm.
Let's take a look at it.
Your heart line is shifted laterally in the shape of a Greek y.
You haven't been able to establish a more intense relationship with the guy you love
because of a series of obstacles, and that drives you to despair.
He-he!
What?
Is it working?
Oh, yeah.
I guess it does.
-No.
I was telling him.
Is it-- Huh?
I don't know.
We'll see about that.
We'll see.
Finally, after what we might consider a dramatic episode,
you'll get to be together.
So, try not to argue with the guy you're dating.
Okay.
Aaah...!
Aaah...!
Aaah...!
Aaaah...!
Aah!
(murmurs)
I'm sorry.
And now what's wrong with you, my love?
Was this your mysterious surprise?
(murmurs)
Detective Mouri, can you come here, please?
It seems to me that there is work for you here.
Ah!
I'm coming!
"Grrr. This is not done. I could have been warned earlier, at the very least."
I have to hand it to him, he does it very well.
He really looks like he's dead.
AAAI...
Well, let's see, I estimate the time of death to have been around 19:54.
If my intuition as a detective with years of experience is correct,
the killer must necessarily be... someone in this room!
Well, now, tell me what am I supposed to do?
Mr. Urai, please.
But don't sit down?
Hey!
No need to worry, you can't feel it anymore.
Eh? He can't because he's not breathing.
What? What?
What?!
Is he-dead?
Dead, dead?
No.
It's a joke.
Isn't it a joke?
Taruto!
My love!
My love!
"His mouth smells like almonds."
"The smell of a cyanide derivative."
"He died of poisoning."
(Takagi) The victim was Taruto Urai, 53 years old.
He was the president of Urai Chocolates and the host of this party.
Oh!
Forensics told me that it seems she was poisoned.
Yes.
The cause of death is "poisoning by a cyanide derivative".
Let's see, when the president fell to the ground,
next to him were Conan, Ran and the wife of the deceased,
Mrs. Urai, who if I understood correctly,
is also the vice president of Urai Chocolates, right?
Yes, you understood perfectly.
It was just at the moment
Mouri was making a speech to those present at the party.
Yes.
Suddenly, my husband screamed and fell backwards to the ground.
After that, he didn't move.
According to what I was told, you were the person who was closest to him,
right next to him, weren't you?
Yes.
At that moment I was reading Ran's hand.
You were reading his hand? Is it true, that, Ran?
Y-yes.
When he fell down,
Mrs. Urai was holding my hand with both hands to read it.
If Mrs. Urai had her hands full,
it's hard for her to have given him the poison personally.
Hm.
Ran, do you remember if Mrs. Urai told her husband to eat or drink anything?
to eat or drink something?
I don't know, a canapé, or something like that.
No, not that I remember.
But yes...
Mrs.
Urai said something to her husband, while she was reading your palm.
She said, "What? Does it work?"
Uh... "Does it work?"
At first I thought he was asking me,
but it turns out she wasn't, that she was asking Mr.
Urai, her husband.
I told him because Mr. Mouri was making a speech,
and it seemed to me that he was listening to her.
Hmm...
Yes, but Mr. Urai's answer was a bit strange.
Urai's answer was a bit strange.
Can't you find, Ran? Eh?
Strange?
Yes, Mr. Urai's answer didn't seem to refer to the speech.
Mr. Urai replied, "I don't know. We'll see."
Wow.

Yes, that is a strange answer,
if the question was about whether my speech was working or not.
He must have been so distracted that he didn't understand the question,
and answered the first thing that came to his mind.
But it is normal that he was distracted.
After his speech we had to announce something important.
Something important?
Yes.
That we divorciàvem and that we divided the company in two equal parts.
- (people) What?! - You wanted to get divorced?
Is it true?!
Yes.
Chocolates Urai had become too big, and my husband and I...
we had different business visions and we kept arguing with each other.
I admit that he didn't want to,
and he asked and implored me not to ask for a divorce.
"We'll split the company, if you want,
but please don't divorce me," he said.
Without you, life has no meaning, because of me".
What does he mean?
That it is possible that...?
That he was so depressed that he had decided to commit suicide?
If this is true, it would be very sad indeed.
I am a professional expert in acid products,
and my husband was an eminence in sweet products.
I thought I had convinced her that it was every man for himself.
Come to think of it, I remember a friend of mine telling me....
that they had both won 1st prize in a baking contest.
Not me, just my husband.
I only came second, it was my husband who won.
Eh?
I... I thought...
Anyway, I guess you must want to register me, right?
Well, make it quick, sisplau.
Huh? (Laughs)
Huh? (chuckles)
If someone has administered a poison to my husband,
I must be the prime suspect, as I was standing next to him.
If it was me, it's likely that I still have on me...
some of the poison that would implicate me in the murder, right?
Ah... I suppose.
Anyway, I'd appreciate it if the search could be done...
in the room behind that door,
out of sight of curious onlookers.
I'm sure that at the front door
the media have gathered there
eager to get information about this incident.
If they see me walk out of here with a policeman, they'll think I'm a murder suspect,
they'll think I'm a murder suspect
and that I'm being taken to the police station under arrest.
Ah... Yes, I'm not saying no.
Sato, please can you take care of it?
Yes, sir.
Will you come with me?
Excuse me, please.
Move aside, please.
Eh?
Ah!
Oh, my gosh!
What went wrong?
Oh... This is what I get for wearing high heels.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Give me your hand, I'll help you up.
Thank you, it's nothing serious.
I just twisted my ankle.
Let's get this over with.
Hm.
(Man) Inspector Megure!
We've finished analyzing the samples from this table here.
We have found no traces of cyanide or any other poisons
neither in the food nor in the drinks.
Now we will analyze the other taules.
D'acord.
Anyway, it is difficult...
that Mr. Urai drank the tea with lemon that his wife drank.
Eh?
No?
Everyone knew Mr. Urai couldn't stand sour things.
Yes, of course he did.
Mm.
Inspector.
What's the matter?
Are you hungry?
Eh?
Yes, I am, a little.
I haven't eaten anything since this morning, at breakfast time,
and they made me come here, to investigate the murder, when I was going to have dinner.
But... don't you always carry a lunch box with food
that his wife prepares for him?
Yes, but, today, before leaving the house this morning,
the Midori got angry with me.
Where are you going so fast?
What's the matter?
Don't you have to give me anything today? Give you anything?
What do you mean?
Anyway, I really still don't understand why you got angry.
Ah.
Ah, wow.
These are the gifts we were supposed to give to the guests for White Day.
If you want, you can take one, too.
No, thank you.
White Day?
What's this?
It's the day when you find out if the guy you're dating really loves you
and whether your love has any future or not.
First, you give him chocolates on Valentine's Day.
After a month, on March 14, if he gives you a gift, the bells of love will ring,
the bells of love will ring all the way to the other side of the universe.
If not, the threat of broken love will hang over you.
What?
The threat of broken love?!
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

I'm very absent-minded.
Mm...
-What? -Huh?
-Are you done, looking at the shoe? -Uh, yeah.
You don't mind leaving me the other one, now?
"Don't think about that, now. Concentrate on the job."
What?!
That when he fell he wasn't dead?
No.
As you are sorry, inspector, he wasn't.
I understand that every year the president, Mr. Urai,
would prepare a surprise for those attending his party.
This surprise could be a magic act
or a theatrical performance.
That is to say, when Mr. Urai called and fell,
this was part of his performance.
Maybe he wanted a great detective like me to participate without knowing it
in this mysterious parody that he had prepared,
not imagining that, once on the ground, someone would actually murder her.
Now.
And who was the first person to give it, then?
Mrs. Urai.
Eh?
Yes, when she knelt down next to Mr. Urai and said to him: "Yes, when she fell, she knelt down next to Mr.
Urai and said:
"And now what's wrong with you, my love?
Was that your mysterious surprise?"
You mean he poisoned her when she was on the ground?
That he put the poison directly into her mouth?
Of course.
Only the only person who knew how he intended to surprise the guests
could murder him: his wife.
Come on, shut up.
How can it be that a famous detective like you would say this nonsense?
You were making your speech on the stage
and it's very likely you couldn't have seen it,
but after he fell to the floor, my husband didn't move,
or made any gestures, or uttered any words.
Please think for a moment.
If I had poisoned her when he was lying on the floor,
he would have writhed in pain and started to call out, don't you think?
Hey, Ran, how did you see it?
You're next to him, aren't you?
Ah... Mm.
That's what she says.
He didn't move, and it looked to me like Mr. Urai was dead.
In short, you once again make a wild deduction,
before you decide to get your act together
and start talking about the case seriously, isn't it?
A wild deduction?
"I don't remember being wrong about any deduction."
Ah!
Ah!
Ah! (Laughs)
Mm...
Uh!
Uh!
Father, what have you made of cigar?
Where did you throw it?
Did you find anything in Mrs. Urai's register?
No, sir.
I didn't find any trace of poison, nor did it appear that she tampered with it.
Evidently, Inspector.
In this case, the cause of death...
Inspector!
We've just found a bottle of poison
and a bottle of these pills that dissolve in the mouth
in the glove compartment of the president's car.
Mm?
Poison and some pills that dissolve in the mouth?
You've already discussed it with forensics, this?
Yes.
They found a half-dissolved pill in Mr. Urai's mouth.
Urai's mouth.
It was stuck in one of his molars.
Right, I get it.
He must have hidden the wet pill with the poison in his pocket,
and put it in his mouth when he found the time.
Therefore we can say that it was a suicide.
"I am sure that the murderer is Mrs. Urai."
"But how did she do it?"

And what did you make him for dinner today? Eh?
I guess she must have already bought things to make dinner.
I say that because there's no way he could have known what was going to happen tonight.
Hey, father!
Look, your cigar fell on the table!
(Kogoro) Oh, no!
It burns the napkin!
"(Kogoro voice) That's why he wanted to pass in front of the table."
(Kogoro voice) It's possible.
I just needed to use a miraculous trick.
