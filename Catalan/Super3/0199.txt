The water that flows has no form.
The wind that blows is unseen.
In Kogoro it always causes all kinds of tangles,
but this time he has a very big mess.
The truth comes out in the end.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

(Radio: pop music)
(Girls: laugh)
(Kogoro) Peaches, melons, fresh pears...
Oh, I love them, the fruits of summer!
They are so ripe!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! # (Volume: turn it up)
(Loud music and shouting)
Raaaaaaaaan!
(Grunting)
What have you done?!
What a face you have!
"Since we're going to Karuizawa,
"We can spend the night at a hotel there"!
Why are you the only one wearing a bathing suit?
(Think) "I wanted to come and see the girls in the pool."
Wait..., I was listening to her.
Well, no.
I'm not leaving this thing to a dirty old man... like you!
Besides, the mother bought the minidisc for me!
EEEEE!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What do you want me to do?
I haven't stopped solving cases lately and I'm super stressed!
"I've left you sleeping on all the cases, don't you remember?"
Can't you see you're being unfair to the mother?
Who knows what she's doing, right now!
Surely, right now she must be in full pursuit of a young boy.
Oh!
What a ?!
Ma-mother!
But... what are you doing here?
I just explained it to you.
I came with some lawyer colleagues to have some fun.
And what about the tie you were buying?
Ah, a friend asked me to buy one for you.
and I asked Saku to help me choose it, right?
Yes?
Really?
Gee, I didn't know.
I thought you wanted to buy it for me.
Don't make such jokes!
Come on, come on!
You still don't know how to choose things by yourself?
You don't have to do anything, you!
(Woman) Very interesting.
Hello, Ritsuko.
Why do you say so?
When it comes to her husband,
even "The Queen" becomes like the rest of us mortals.
Did you say "The Queen"? Hm.
Didn't you know?
The Eri is the one who reigns supreme in the courts, no one dares to come near her!
She is such an eloquent speaker that she impresses the judges.
They call her "The Queen of the Legal Guild".
Will you stop talking like that?
You're the only ones who tell me that!
Well, I've felt otherwise.
Some prosecutors say that when they have to come face to face with her,
they felt like traitors defying their Queen!
Wow...
"I know what it's like to feel that way."
But after getting the appeal
and a second trial for that case
and taking it to the supreme court, now you'll be the number one lawyer.
Oh, come on.
Anybody else would have beaten him, that case.
Excuse me.
I was the lawyer at the first trial,
and I guess I wasn't good enough, because I lost.
I... I didn't... I didn't mean that...
I meant that even winning a case like that,
you don't get to the Queen's level!
Stop it!
You two may be separated, but I still envy you.
A famous undefeated lawyer
and a private detective who always solves his cases!
It's no big deal.
I'm just a despicable man
who will always be proud to be married to a great lady.
You're right.
Then this must mean that I'm a stupid woman
who has chosen to share her life with a detective
who chases women and who leads a degenerate life...
(sarcastic laughter)
Apa here, how can you talk like that?
If every time you solve a case,
you cut the article out of the newspaper and put it in your personal album!
But what are you saying?
Well, the father does it too!
Late at night, he reads on the sly...
the articles of the cases the mother is working on!

Oi, father? But don't tell him, you idiot!
Enough with this, now we're all here!
Let's make a truce for tonight and go drink in good company!
Alright, if it's alright with Eri, it's alright with me too.
Eh... I'm in.
I'm fine with it.
(Thinking) "Eh? What's this? Could it be? They're in love, though?"
"I hallucinate."
(Kogoro and woman: laugh outrageously)
(Drunk) I'd like to hear Ritsuko's sweet voice....
defending a case of mine in court.
Mr. Mouri, are you drunk?
(Kogoro and Ritsuko: laughing outrageously)
Tell me you like me.
Father!
Oh, Ritsuko, your hands are so small.
They're so pretty!
You're my type.
I like all of you.
I really do!
(laughing outrageously) Mother, wait!
You're so booona! (thinks) "My God, what a drunk."
Wait a minute!
Mother, you know how father always gets like that when he gets drunk.
Today you were alone with that man
and you looked... so happy, choosing that tie.
You're right. I shouldn't have bought this thing.
I shouldn't have bought this thing.
I let my guard down for a second
and now I'm so angry I'd explode.
Huh? (Laughs)
I don't believe this.
You mean this tie...?
Yeah, that's right.
Tomorrow is our wedding anniversary.
I felt bad for you
and I thought maybe it was time for me to forgive him.
and I figured I'd give him a gift.
I'm glad I didn't.
Give it to me!
Hey, wait.
I'll give it to the father for you.
No!
Get back here right now!
Eh?
I think I'll give it to him myself.
Oh.
Mother!
Eh? (Laughs)
Has everyone left?
Father too?
Mh.
He said he was going to the room to get some sleep.
Mother, Father must be in his room!
Good luck!
Yes, understood!
(Doorbell: ding-dong)
(Woman) Yes!
Kisaki, what are you doing here?
I know it's quite late, excuse me, but my husband is here?
(Woman) -Huh?
No, he's not, why? -It's just that...
What's wrong?
We can't find the father.
He's not in our room or the other roommates'.
It is possible that he is walking outside the hotel.
He likes to be out in the fresh air in the evenings.
Sorry we disturbed you.
We'll look for him outside.
Good evening.
Let's go look.
Yes!
(laughs)
(Thinking) "Forgive me, Lawyer Kisaki, but I've already beaten you."
"I've discovered that no matter how hard I try, I'll never surpass you."
"The only way to stay above you...
"Is to make you fall well below."
(Snoring)
"If you think there's been something between your husband and me,
"your ability to think clearly will be impaired
"And it will hurt your work."
"And you'll have to pass the title of Queen to me!"
(Ringing)
Oops.
Is it them again?
What a pain in the ass they are.
Hello.
What can I do for you?
What can I do for you?
Mr. Mouri hasn't come back yet?
-You're not absolutely sure? -Yes.
We've looked for him everywhere.
For the hotel premises, for the roof, for the stairs...
It's already two o'clock in the morning.
Which is strange, he's gone with Miss Usui...
because he said they were both staying on the same floor.
Yes..., so that leaves...
Ritsuko's room is the only one that we haven't checked.
This sign here wasn't here before.
Before?
We've been here before, but you told us it wasn't there.
Of course it wasn't.
I doubt those two... are... here.
(Mother!
What are you doing?
Xxxxt.
Shut up.
(Mobile)
I can not believe it!
(Ring)
Surely, this ringing is your cell phone!
It can't be!
Can you go to reception, and ask them to open us with a master key?
-Endavant. -Thank you.
Look, the chain is on.
Ah!
What's the problem?
Eh?
Hey, isn't that... isn't that Ritsuko?!
Hey, take some pliers for the chain!
Eh?
Oh.
Stand back!
Come on, we can't waste time!
Ritsuko.
Ritsuko!
Ritsuko, what's wrong with you?
Wake up!
Wait up!
She doesn't seem to have a pulse anymore.
That's impossible.
What-what happened?
(Kogoro) Grr.
What a mug!
What is it, all this commotion...?
What... what's wrong?
F-father!
Ko... Kogoro!
Eh?

(Thinks) "Why are you here?"
"The chain was on."
"Ritsuko's body was on the floor.
"And the only person in this locked room was him."
Hey!
What the heck is going on here?
Don't step on that!
This telephone wire is surely the murder weapon!
The murder weapon?! Yeah, look at this!
See this fine mark around his neck?
I get it.
She's been murdered by strangling her with the telephone cord.
Hey, hey, hey!
How is it that Miss Usui is... a...
Eh ?!
Did you say "strangled"?
Eh?
What?
Who did that?
You're the only one who could have done it!
Why did you kill her?
No mail!
Surely there has been a mistake!
My father would not be able to kill anyone.
Wouldn't he, mother?
Article 499 of the penal code.
The penalty for the crime of murder
ranges from 3 years to life imprisonment.
Or the penalty... death penalty!
What a ?
But..., mother!
Ran!
What are you doing here doing nothing?
Call the police!
(thinks) "You can't be serious."
Mm.
So it's happened next.
Your husband has disappeared
and you thought maybe it was in this room,
and you called your cell phone.
And as you suspected, you felt it ringing inside this room.
You used the master key to open the door
and you noticed that the chain was on
and you could see the victim on the floor.
When they forced the door open and entered the room, he discovered that the victim was already dead,
she discovered that the victim was already dead
and that her husband was sleeping in her bed, right?
Yes.
I'm sorry to have told you, but your husband is the murderer.
No, he isn't!
Father, don't stand by and do nothing, say something!
Eh?
I know him!
Aren't you Kogoro Mouri?
Yes I am.
I'm in luck!
With a detective as famous as you at the scene of the crime,
the case is practically solved!
What do you think of this murder?
Yes, King.
Why don't you tell him everything that happened in this room...
while he was snoring like a desperate man?
Speak up, Mr. Famous Detective.
Eh?
Is that your husband?!
You're married to Mouri?!
But... then, that means...
Y-you're the murderer?
And I won't be able to watch the Sleeping Kogoro's mystery-solving show?!
What do you want me to do?
Inspector Yamamura.
Can we take Mr. Mouri as a suspect for questioning?
I suppose so, if Mr. Mouri doesn't mind.
Father...
What a pity.
And I wanted to see how he solved the case.
You'll be the lawyer accompanying him to the interrogation, I suppose?
Eh?
The lawyer who will accompany him?
At the interrogation there may be a lawyer
to see that the police treat the detainee correctly.
I'm sorry, but I won't go.
I never take cases where the suspect is clearly guilty!
I will not spoil my impeccable résumé!
I would never have asked you anyway.
And I don't want you to set foot in the police station either or you'll regret it!
(They laugh sarcastically)
Father!
Mother!
All right, then.
I'll be your lawyer.
Besides, I don't think Mr. Mouri did it.
We can leave now.
Thank you very much!
How could you?
Mikasa, in Shiozawa and you can leave the room?
I must say something very personal to the inspector.
Yes, don't worry.
What do you want to say?
What do you want to tell him?
-Excuse me, inspector.
-Yes? -Yes?
Would you mind leaving me your gloves for a moment?
Eh?
The gloves, you say?
Mother, what do you plan to do?
There are 3 things that don't fit me.
The first is the wire used to strangle the victim.
If he'd killed her without premeditation while he was drunk,
he would have ripped it out of the connector.
But the phone is in place
and it doesn't look like it was forcibly removed.
The second is his cell phone.
"It looks to me like it's been left near the door expressly.
"Because we could feel it from the outside."
And the third is the father's hands.
It's only been 40 minutes from the time we talked to Ritsuko
until we found the body.
"If he had strangled her with the wire," he said,
"She should have some sign on her hands."

"Unless he put on some leather gloves or something like that."
But we haven't found anything like that.
Now that you say it, yes it is quite strange.
Now I understand.
You didn't go to the father because you wanted to examine these things.
Of course I did, silly.
I assure you I know him much better than you do.
Yes, at first I was very angry,
but I know that in Kogoro he is totally incapable of murdering anyone.
When the father told you that he didn't want to see you at the police station,
he said he wanted you to find the evidence
to prove his innocence.
I don't know.
Maybe he spoke to me like that because he really didn't want to see me.
What's this?
What's this?
A notepad... and a page has been torn out.
Could this be it?
Could it be this page?
Look at it, it's a little crumpled, but there's something written on it.
Hm... Yes, it's Ritsuko's handwriting.
(Yamamura) "Hayashi".
And this is a number 2?
Surely it's from in... Hayashi,
a lawyer he had to work with on his next case.
He's been wanting to get in touch about this case for some time.
What case is this?
Everyone is talking about a company that pollutes the water.
They came to see us first,
but neither Shiozawa nor I wanted to handle it.
Saku is a criminal lawyer,
and in the end Ritsuko and Mikasa took over.
They lost the first trial,
but they were able to file an appeal for the second one.
She asked me to introduce another lawyer
to replace Mikasa.
And I thought of Mr. Hayashi.
But I hadn't told Ritsuko anything yet.
How strange.
Hay in Hayashi I didn't give him the name of this hotel.
He said Mr. Shiozawa told him.
What?
I passed on the call from Mr. Hayashi this room.
Who told him that he could come in?!
It's just that there's something bothering me
and I thought I should explain it to you.
What is troubling you?
In fact, Mr. Hayashi called twice.
The first call we passed it on to him,
"But the second time he called, they didn't answer,
"And the call went back to reception."
I went up to check the room.
-Twice. -Twice... twice?!
Yes, the first time I called and they didn't answer,
so I told Mr. Hayashi that Miss Usui was resting.
But he said that she was maybe taking a bath
and asked me to check again.
Then, I found a "do not disturb" sign on the door and a note.
A note?
Yes, it said, "Sorry, tell her I'll pay anyway."
The handwriting was kind of distorted.
Huh?
And did you give the message to Mr. Hayashi?
Did he?!
Yes, but he seemed confused.
He told me he was just calling to change the meeting time
they had tomorrow from 2 to 4 o'clock.
I don't understand that.
The note we found in the wastebasket would be a notation of the appointment.
(Thinking) "Exactly, but the note on the door?
"It was something completely different."
"If he was murdered before the second phone call he received....
it means that the murderer was
"Who put the 'do not disturb' and the note on the door!"
"Why would the murderer want to do something so stupid?"
"With this we would only come to the conclusion.
"That in Kogoro he has not committed the crime!"
Madam, I'm sorry to have told you,
but I am absolutely sure that your husband is the murderer!
What?! Eh?!
(Thinking) "I'm absolutely sure."
"Yes, I'm sure."
"I get it, he left that note for exactly this reason."
Unless you're the murderer,
it wouldn't make sense for you to enter this room!
And the next Conan: "In Kogoro Mouri is the suspect, (part 2)"
