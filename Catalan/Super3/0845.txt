Hello.
I wanted to wish you a happy new year.
Thanks to you, all the viewers,
"Detective Conan" is entering its 22nd year on the air.
Come here.
No right, Conan.
We also want to say hello to the viewers.
Yes, because last year I'm going to say hello to you and Mr. ebiz,
you two, period.
-We want to greet them too. -Yeah.
-That's right.
You know what I think?
I think it's better if we all do it together this time.
Mm... Yeah, all right.
Hello.
We're back.
We sincerely wish you a happy new year.
We hope you will continue to see the adventures of Detective Conan.
And the Junior Detective League, too.
Thank you very much for your loyalty.

(Heart: beating)
"What happened, what am I doing here?"
"In Conan, trapped in the darkness (part one)."
I see.
It's obvious that they broke into the safe to open it.
And you didn't notice until this morning?
That's right.
I stayed late at work last night...
and when I left everything was fine.
So it must have been broken into the time I went home.
I went to sleep for a couple of hours and when I came back, I found it like this.
Understood.
And what was inside the safe?
If I'm not mistaken, it must not have been money, right?
Because, if not, I would have called the police without thinking about it.
But he didn't, he decided to call me.
I'm impressed, Mr. Mouri.
You're right, there was no money, in the safe.
There was a will.
-And I think I know who did it.
-Ah.
-But that's...
-What?
I wouldn't want to mix up the police.
"That's it. My eyes have gotten used to the dark."
"Could it...
be inside a box?"
"But what am I doing in here?"
"The cell phone! Eh?"
"The cell phone."
"It's here, I've got it next to my feet."
"A little more..."
(Pin: acoustic signal)
-It's strange, because he doesn't pick it up either.
-Conan doesn't answer.
Maybe he's had a hunger attack
and has decided to get something to eat.
-Like me, come on.
- (guts: they snore)
En Conan is not like you, Genta.
But, look how many people there are.
Wow...
(Pip-pip-pip)
"Don't hang up... Don't hang up!"
(Pip-pip-pip)
"Oysters!"
I'm sorry, but you'll have to explain it to me.
How come you suspect someone but don't want to say anything to the police?
-Because...
-You don't understand.
Because I'd like to avoid a scandal, if possible.
-The late president, you say?
-For the late president.
You mean the president of the Karahashi group of companies,
who is a client of your law firm?
(Kogoro) "Mr. Gotar Karahashi, right?"
"If I'm not mistaken..."
...he died of illness 3 days ago.
That's right, this afternoon there will be the burial,
and right after the ceremony it was scheduled
the reading of the will, to make the contents of the will public.
And it turns out that it has been stolen.
Could it be that someone did not agree
with the contents of the will and therefore decided to steal it?
Mm-hm.
Just 10 days before she died, the president asked me...
to see her urgently at the hospital
and she told me that she wanted to make some changes in the will.
Oh...

I already have the new game!
How come it hasn't arrived in Conan yet?
I would be very sorry if you couldn't buy the game.
Don't suffer, that's why.
There are still many left, in the store.
They won't run out.
-Ah!
I can't wait any longer!
- (guts: they snore)
I have to go buy something to eat!
"Of course. That was them."
"I was meeting them this morning and we ran into each other."
"I have to remember everything from the beginning."
Good morning, guys.
Hello.
Good morning, Conan.
"This morning we all met this morning to go together
to buy a new game that was going on sale today."
"And on our way to the store..."
Could you tell me what the will said
before Mr. Karahashi decided to make the changes?
As Mr. Karahashi's wife passed away 10 years ago,
"...according to the will, their eldest son, in Kozo,
was to inherit 50% of her estate."
"The other 50% was to be divided between the eldest daughter, the Mitsuyo,
and his other son, the Eisuke."
And what did he want to change?
Well, it turns out that the president had a secretary
who had been working for him for 50 years.
And he wanted her to keep all his fortune.
Ah, you understand.
And do you know if the president and this lady...?
Of course, the president and this lady had an intimate relationship,
so to speak.
That means... they were lovers, then.
Yes.
But...
"She became ill
and is now in a hospital in her hometown."
Mmm, I get it.
"And then, when we were on our way to the store..."
-No need to push me, Mitsuhiko.
-Go, hurry, I don't want to be late.
"What's this?"
What's the matter, Conan?
You're not coming?
(Mitsuhiko) Come on, if we don't hurry, we'll be late.
Let's go.
(Genta) Yes, let's hurry selected, so we can go to eat earlier.
(Mitsuhiko) Eh?
Start coming in.
I'm coming.
-What are you doing?
-Where are you going, Conan?
What's biting you?
"I knew it."
He's not here?
He's not here yet, Conan?
-Not yet.
-No.
I've told you before.
I'm sure he must have decided to go to lunch alone.
What are you saying, Genta, if it's still two hours before lunchtime!?
I don't know, what happened to him, that he took so long to come.
I am worried.
I'll ask Ay to help us look for him.
Can't you find Conan?
Just a moment.
He'll locate the GPS signal on his cell phone.
No signal?
Then...
Too bad.
The tracking glasses are with the professor for maintenance.
(Phone)
Mouri Detective Agency, good morning.
Hello, Ay, how are you?
Eh?
What if there's Conan?
No, he's not back yet.
I thought it was with you.
No, it's just that I'm not interested in modern games these days.
"Hey, Ran, if you talk, can you tell him to call me, please?"
Eh?
Why did you say that?
Wait, Ay, don't hang up.
"Yes... That's it. I remember."
(metallic knocks)
(Metal knocks: louder)
(Metal door, open)
(Metal knocks)
"He wants to open the safe."
"What the...? They're taking me somewhere."
"But where...?"
"Eh? What's that smell?"
"It looks like... it looks like incense."
"Ge... dry ice?"
"I'm in... inside... of... coffin?"
"It can't be. I've been buried?"
Hello, Ay!
How nice of you to come!
As in Conan has his cell phone disconnected,
I had no choice.
Anyway, I think maybe we should also call the police.
We waited a bit.
All the members of the Junior Detective League are here.
Why don't we try looking for him ourselves, before we call them?
Besides, maybe in the end it will turn out...
he's decided to go out to lunch by himself and that's that.
Oh, this Conan...
First of all, show me where you've split up.
It's here.
"It's draughty, this?"
"This means I'm not buried."
"So..."
"Is there anyone? Is there anyone out there?"
"It's no use. What can I do?"
"And that?"
"A little more."
"A little more."

It was here.
This is where we have separated.
That's right.
This is where Conan said to start passing us.
(Genta) And there was no food stop and no restaurant.
In case you thought about it.
Maybe he saw something weird.
That must have been it.
-That's what we'll have to investigate.
-Like what now?
We'd better split up.
Two will go this way and two will go that way.
And we have to take a good look everywhere.
The Junior Detective League is always ready to act!
Yes!
-Oh, I'm hungry again.
- (GUTS: Snoring)
(Mitsuhiko) Come on, let's go, Genta.
We can't love it.
It's just that my guts are snoring.
Ko-Kogoro Mouri?
Isn't he that famous detective?
The situation is extremely serious.
And since we don't have much time left, I've asked Mr. Mouri...
to do us the honor of accepting this case.
Good afternoon, everyone.
If you will allow me, I will introduce myself.
I am Detective Kogoro Mouri, at your service.
Pleased to meet you.
A detective?
I don't know what he's doing here.
I really don't understand why you had him come here.
You seem to be insinuating that one of us stole the will.
Come on, let's go.
We don't need to play innocent.
You can't deny the obvious.
The will was stolen by one of us.
Now we still need to know who the guilty party is.
But you already know, don't you, Mr. Detective?
Man.
In fact, we could say that...
May I know why you're looking at me like that, Eisuke?
He-he-he-he!
I don't know what you mean.
-I don't like it at all, your attitude.
-Do you want to fight?
-What's on your mind?
Stop it right now!
That's it, that's enough.
It's not the place or the time to fight.
-Eh?
-You're such an ass!
We were all very surprised,
that the father decided to change the will all of a sudden.
But you're the one who got the most angry, Kozo.
Look who's talking.
What about you?
You were already angry
about what the will said before the father changed it.
Because you felt it wasn't fair that he left you so little.
That's true.
And Eisuke felt the same way.
Eh?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I've never taken it as badly as you two.
-That's what you say now.
-What do you mean, you didn't?
Of course you haven't.
-Huh?
Please, Mr. Mouri.
- (speaking at the same time)
-Please calm down.
-You are both hypocrites.
The burial of your father is due to begin shortly.
Afterwards, I will ask you to answer a few questions
so we can move forward with the investigation.
But there is something that can't wait and that I need to know now.
I need to know where the three of you were this morning
and if you have any way of proving that what you say is true.
Ah... Ya want to check if we have a good alibi.
That's very interesting.
I don't know why you find it so funny.
You still seem to like it, being treated like a criminal.
And I don't know why you're surprised.
It's always been the same.
And who will you question first, Mr. Detective?
We'll start with the older brother.
Kozo, if I'm not mistaken.
Let's see, could you please tell me where it was this morning,
specifically first thing today?
I was at home first thing today, I didn't go out until later.
Ah, yes!
Very early this morning he phoned me and woke me up.
Can you prove that he called you?
If you're such a good detective,
you can get the phone company to confirm it.
And I'm telling the truth:
first thing in the morning he called me at home.
At home, you say?
You didn't call him on his cell phone?
No.
At home.
I was at home, but I don't know where he was when he called me.
I was also at home and I called him from there.
Right after I was woken up by a call from my sister.
Ah.
So you also used the landline?
Of course I did.
I was at home, what I don't know is where she was calling from.
She kept complaining about how the funeral was organized.
I called my brother because I couldn't take it anymore.
I'm sure she continued to grumble while I put her on hold.
Just because you're the biggest doesn't mean you have to control everything.
With the funeral you've arranged, I doubt the father will rest in peace.
But how can you tell?

And, by the way, before you ask me,
I'll tell you that I also called from the landline.
-Of course.
-You also call with the landline?
I only use my cell phone when I'm away from home.
Why don't you check, Mr. Detective?
Understood.
"I know."
"If there were any keys or anything
sticking out to try to cut the cord..."
"Gee, I don't see anything."
"Oh. The cell phone."
"Ah... I've got you..."
"Come over here."
(Asada) Look, they're all three very quiet.
What do you think, all of it, Mr. Mouri?
Yes.
I'll have to check if everything they've said is true.
But if you want me to tell you...
(Eisuke) I'd say you believed them, our alibis?
You never know.
You can't trust anyone.
Yes, because it could be that one of us...
had hired someone to do it.
Then I'm off the hook,
because I don't have that kind of money to hire anyone.
-So what?
That doesn't mean anything.
-But you do.
You could pay him after you inherit the money, couldn't you?
-Yes, yes... You too, sis.
-The same as you.
Don't look at me, you can both be as guilty as me.
-Same as you.
-That's right, you can be too.
Eh?
"I've got it."
"It doesn't work, of course..."
"But maybe...?"
"Eh?"
What do you mean?
Have you seen anything?
It looks good...
He's not here either.
Gee, where did he go?
Maybe we should call the police.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
"What's this?"
(Car opening system: pip-pip)
"A car? Yes it is."
(Car, opening a door)
"And from the way it resonated, it sounds like it's inside a building."
"Or maybe... in a parking lot."
(Car: starts up)
"Wait."
"Wait."
(Car: drives away)
Wai... wait!
Wait a minute!
Don't go!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Oysters.
Noooooo!
Are you saying that because they're fixing the lock?
A neighbor of the building told you this morning.
It looks like it had been forced to enter.
You mean Conan might have seen it being broken into?
Maybe you can't see it, but there's a great restaurant in the building.
Aaaah... I don't think so.
Well, I think it was a burglar.
I don't think they have explained to him what happened,
but it is the most probable thing, that a thief has forced it.
- (pin: acoustic signal)
-We should call the police.
(Pip-pip-pip)
(phone)
Is that you, Ay?
Ah, it's you, Father...
What?
A funeral, you say?
This afternoon?
-Conan, where are you?
-Conan!
Conan!
Don't call, please.
"Conan, say where are you?"
I haven't the faintest idea where I am.
I wish I did.
"But at least I don't seem to be buried."
-What do you mean by that?
-What do you mean by that?
From the dimensions of the space,
it's probably inside a coffin.
It looks like they put a wooden board
resting on two stacks of folded cardboard boxes,
as if to create a double bottom, and I'm in the space below.
And... therefore, this must mean...
that above me there must be someone's body.
What?
What is it, Conan?
"Huh? What's this?"
Geez, I can't reach.
Guys, your location, you?
We've been tracking you.
Now we're outside the door of a building.
They're fixing the lock.
Yes.
It was here.
This morning there was a robbery, in this building.
(Car: a door closes)
- (car: engine)
- (we stir)
What-what's going on, is it moving?
This means that I must also be inside a car.
A car carrying... a coffin?
So it must be... a hearse!

(Flow) I am in inside a coffin in a double bottom.
Therefore, this means that on top of me is someone's body.
What?
We already know where it is, we have found it.
Where is it in Conan?
And where is it?
At the moment we only know that he's in a hearse.
What's that?
But what do you say, now!?
A hearse?
How can it be that Conan is inside the coffin?
And, moreover, you say that inside is also the will?
