DETECTIVE CONAN
A very hidden treasure
Eh?
Ah, I've finally found it!
(Ayumi) Doctor, is this map for real?
Yes!
(Ayumi) Of course!
Then, there will be a treasure, right, Doctor?
We'll find this when we get there.
I'm sure I'll find the mysterious treasure this time!
-And I'll help you!
-Me too!
By the way, Doctor Agasa, where did you get this old map from?
What's that?
You really want to know?
It's the same.
He'd probably explain some lie to me.
Don't worry, Conan, you'll find out if you get to the end.
At the end, of course...
(thinks) "Going treasure hunting in this day and age..."
We are here.
In the burnt tree.
First you must go to London Bridge.
Come on, let's go!
(At the same time) Come on!
I'll stay here and fish.
You guys scout the route.
(At the same time) Yessssss!
(Thinking) "I'm not a kid. But I am now. What's up!"
Conan, what do you think it must be, treasure?
There is nothing to indicate that it is a treasure.
I'll bet you anything it is!
Isn't it, Mitsuhiko?
Yes, with diamonds and jewels.
It could be the hidden treasure of the Tokugawa clan!
Oysters!
Can you imagine?
Mitsuhiko?
Wow, that's strong!
This is impossible.
(Wood creaks)
Wow, guys!
I thought it was called the London Bridge so it would open.
Yes.
These bridges always fall down, in the movies, don't they?
-You've got to be kidding... That would be in very bad taste.
(Think) "Dr. Agasa..."
"Look who's bringing us to such a dangerous place..."
"How will we get back?"
(Man) Look, compasses don't work in this area.
Who would think of hiding a treasure in the mountains?
I was a fan of mystery novels.
But it happened!
Now what?
There are 5, on the map, and instead here there are only 4!
What bad luck.
We were about to go to look for the treasure, he has an accident and dies.
This treasure thing is no joke.
Do you know where you are going?
(Ayumi) Sir, this is very dangerous!
You must put out the cigarette well.
It would be terrible, if you start a forest fire.
(Ayumi) What's wrong?
Who are you, you guys?
The Junior Detective Squad!
(Think) "These maps look a lot alike."
Hey!
What are you looking at, kid?!
Aaa... Nothing sir, nothing...
-Come on, come on, let's go!
-Eh?
Let's go?
But where are we going?
It doesn't matter.
You follow me!
Come on, let's go!
(Think) "This pair, they don't look like hikers."
"They're carrying a shovel, but they're molted and wearing leather shoes."
"And that map..."
Hey, guys, we're here now, right?
Yeah, probably, we're at this place here,
but the compass isn't working right at all.
Conan, there are only 4 trees.
Are we where we think we are?
Yes!
Of course we are.
Wait a minute, let me through.
Look, the fifth tree is this one.
No one has noticed what it's been cut for.
This side has the growth rings farther apart,
because it's been in the sun more, and it's grown more.
Therefore, the south is this way! Exactly, Ayumi!
Which way should we go now? Let me have the map.
"The devil's hand, enter through the narrow gate."
"The devil's hand" means the left hand.
It must be one of the two on the left.
"The narrow gate" means the narrow path on the left.
Conan, you are very clever!
"The devil's hand" means the left hand...
-How would you say, the right?
-The angel's hand.
Boy, how simple.
Why the hell do they have the map, these damned kids?
Well, look at them, they're clever kids.
Come on, don't let them pass us by!
-(Ayumi) That pair were suspicious.
(Ayumi) Yes!
I'm sure they're looking for the same treasure as us.
It's true, they were also talking about a treasure.

Yes, they are looking for the treasure.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(All) Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
I'm drowning!
Help me!
I can't swim!
Help!
I'm drowning!
Help me!
Help me!
-Help me!
I'm drowning!
-Hey, hey, Mitsuhiko!
Come on, boy, try to get up.
Wow!
How scary!
I thought I was going to die.
These campaign matches won't light up if they're springs, will they?
Too bad!
We eixugaríem, with a good fire.
Now we will take a galipàndria.
We will light it.
Eh?
First, you remove the top of the lot,
then you take out the reflector, take a match...
and stick it in the reflector.
Then you face the sun and heat it up.
Even if they are campaign matches, they are well springs.
You mean they won't light up?
-Light it! -All right, Conan!
That's it!
It looks like one of those inventions that only grandparents know how to make.
(He thinks) "It would be more like a survival technique."
Damn!
Where do we have to go, now!
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
Oh, shit!
To the east, maybe?
There's something written, but I don't quite understand it.
Let's see, wise man, which way would it be, to the east?
I don't get it.
Eh?
Oh!
Maybe I shouldn't have let them go alone, those children.
The fire is out!
And we're safe!
Listen, you mean we'll get to the end?
Where is it, the slope we've climbed?
I don't want to go back.
Calm down, don't worry.
We are here now,
if we go over the top, we'll get to the next point too.
-Ah!
-Come on, then!
We're on our way.
(Rock) Yes! Yes!
(Rock)

Ah! Ah!
I've made it.
"They've recently broken it,
and they've broken it spicy with something sharp."
"But it's not a knife or an axe."
"It could be a shovel..."
"A shovel?"
"Sure, that pair have been through here!"
(Genta) What do they say, these letters?
It looks like some kind of secret code, but I don't understand it.
(Genta) Sure!
You put a bit of paper on top of it, and then you starch it, and the letters come out.
(Genta) -Yes!
-You're right!
But it turns out we didn't bring any paper or pencil.
Oh...
Look, I'm carrying a pencil, by any chance.
We can use this! You mean this?
We'll do something similar to what Ayumi said.
Let me do that. What exactly do you want to do?
You'll see.
Fixeu's on it!
First, we'll soak the arrow in water.
And then we'll scrub the piece of the words with soil.
When you remove the dirt...
The dirt has gotten into the cuts and the code is quite clear.
"In time, the needles of the sun will lead you eastward. Follow!"
-How?
Where is it, east, guys?
-No idea.
Can't see any tree stumps.
(Think) "The needles of the sun? Go east... Wait a minute!"
Conan, what are you looking for now?
To find the direction,
first you set the clock to solar time.
You face the hour hand towards the sun,
the bisector of the angle formed by the hour hand and the 12 o'clock,
points south.
East is 90 degrees further to the left.
East is that way. Conan, you are a genius!
Did Grandpa teach you too?
(Think) "Mira-te-la, ella!"
-Come on!
Come on, let's go!
(All) -Come on!
"The big spoon and the rock that lead you
to a point from which you advance 5 steps."
(Ayumi) - "The big spoon"? (Genta) -A hole?
(Mitsuhiko) Wouldn't it be too simple?
(Think) "5 stone pillars. If the stones are these..."
Let me climb on your shoulders!
(Mitsuhiko) Hey!
(Mitsuhiko) What are you doing?
What are you doing, Conan!
"Ah! The pillars form a "double V"!
"It comes double... That's it. This indicates the west!"
"But what do you mean, "big spoon"?"
What, Conan, have you discovered something?
Maybe it's 5 steps west of the 5 stone pillars.
(At the same time) Conan, there is nothing, here!
"West... If it wasn't a double come, it could be an eme....
or maybe also a well.
And "the big spoon"...
Aiiiiiiii!
-What's the matter, Mitsuhiko? -Mitsuhiko, where are you?
Where are you?
I'm here!
I'm here!
Mitsuhiko!
I tripped.
And I hit my head on this stone.

Log and stone?
(Thinks) "It's been here a long time, that."
"What is this?"
"What if this shape were..."
"Logs and stones are shaped like the Big Dipper!"
"I get it!"
"The Big Dipper and the Little Dipper are shaped like spoons,
that's why it says 'the big spoon'."
The stone pillars are Cassiopeia!
The big spoon and the pillars lead you to the North Star!
This is located at the distance
between the stars at the tip of the Big Dipper multiplied by 5.
If you draw a line
starting from the two lower stars of the double V,
the pole star is 5 times the distance
between the imaginary point and the center."
Eh?
How he complicates our lives, Dr. Agasa.
I found a stone with some letters engraved on it!
We've got it!
It is the polar star.
That's why there is the letter pe.
It's here, yes, I'm sure of it!
Is that right?
It's 5 steps!
(At the same time) One, two, three, four, five!
Aparteu's-e, come quick!
Come on, come on!
Down we go!
(At the same time) Yes!
(Ayumi) Conan, what's this?
(Mitsuhiko) -It must be the treasure! (Genta) -Come on, open it!
(Think) And if these jewels were...
Mitsuhiko, found!
I'll be able to eat as many omelets as I want!
Well, I'll... I'll make...
I'm sorry to spoil your-and your party, but...
Will you give me that right now?
(Genta) It's the man from before!
(Thinks) "I'd stick my neck out! They're jewel thieves!"
Come on, guys!
Give it all to me right now!
What do I tell you?!
Don't waste any more of my time!
The guy downstairs told me to give this to you.
He's got it!
(Ayumi) Hey, Conan, but what happened here?
At least I didn't hit my head with a rock.
(Genta) -As in Mitsuhiko?
-Don't make me laugh, that!
I hurt myself!
It is this one.
This is the treasure we were looking for.
You mean that's it, the treasure?
Are you sure?
-The treasure is just this paper? -What does it say?
Go on, read.
"The real treasure is everything you've experienced
coming all the way here to solve this mystery."
"You may need to fallen in rivers and lakes."
"Sometimes, you will need to work together to overcome difficulties."
"All these experiences are real treasures."
"It is true that perhaps you will not understand now,
but one day,
all this will become a treasure that will be priceless.
and which will have an eternal value for you."
"I would like you to pass on the experiences of this adventure to future generations.
to future generations."
The truth is that I don't quite get it, but....
Anyway... we'll just have to make do.
Gee... what a remedy.
"Yusaku Kudo..."
Don't worry, Conan, you'll find out if you get to the end!
(He thinks) "This was written by my father!"
"This letter with this characteristic K..."
"It's very difficult to copy!"
"I should have realized it before."
"The peak of the mountain that was above the campsite
was our destination!"
"From the top of that tree,
I saw Dr. Agasa's tent."
"Although it wasn't far,
the way back was quite complicated."
"When we had explained everything to him,
Dr. Agasa called the police
and they arrested the jewel thieves."
"The next day we should be asked questions."
"At first I thought treasure hunting was silly,
but as big as you are,
these kinds of adventures are always fun,
even at 17."
"I'd had a great time."
"In the end, those jewels weren't the treasure, but..."
"Father!"
"It's here."
"It's here!"
"The real treasure is..."

DETECTIVE CONAN
(Agasa) Hey, Shinichi, when you were just born,
your father had the draft of a novel he wanted to publish stolen.
It was stolen?
The police deduced that it was one of your father's fans,

but neither the thief nor the eraser was found.
It was the one who died in an accident,
the other thief, the one who drew the map?
(Agasa) Yes, it turns out that they couldn't publish that it had been stolen,
and they kept it an absolute secret.
But I never imagined it would end up like this.
"To my son, Shinichi."
Oops!
Ran's gone!
Ran, watch out!
Ran!
Wake up!
You have to wake up!
(Think) "Why is he after Ran?"
