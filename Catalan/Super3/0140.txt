Ayumi's distress message
(Genta) Let's see... Hurray!
I got it right!
Let's see this one?
I'm here!
Wow!
It's Mitsuhiko and me again!
You'll be last, Mitsuhiko.
I don't think so!
Let's see...
I'll take...
-This one! -Aaah!
Hurray!
I'm here!
Wow!
Why do I always have to lose?
Looking at your face, a 3 year old would beat you!
When you look at the joker or the other cards you make different faces.
No good, say it, Conan!
Oh, is that why?
Then start all over again!
Now always make this face.
Haibara, do you want to play a game?
No, thanks.
I'd rather read.
How unfriendly!
She's always so cold.
By the way, Conan, something.
Did you hear about yesterday's robbery and murder in Haidocho?
Ah, yes, they killed the owner of a famous restaurant, "The escargot".
What a strange name, this restaurant.
Not so much, Genta.
In French, "escargot" means screw,
which is used in French cuisine.
What?
Oysters!
You eat them, the screws?
How will be a bowl of rice with screws on top?
Ecs!
(Think) What should you imagine?
Do you know any more details of the murder?
Last night, in Mouri I was talking to inspector Megure.
It was about noon and the victim was still asleep.
The thief came in, and they met.
The burglar entered thinking that no one was there?
It seems so.
He tied the victim's hands and feet and stabbed him.
He must have asked her where the money was
and, once he had them all, he killed her without mercy.
Maybe he killed her because she had seen his face?
Maybe he did...
Oh, my goodness!
How scary!
In the Junior Detective League we'll never get a case like that, will we?
(Agasa) Sure!
We kids shouldn't even talk about murder cases.
He's talking about things his age.
Do you have a throat candy?
Eh?
Do you have a sore throat?
Actually, you make a strange voice.
-Let's see.
Open your mouth.
Aaaaah... - Aaaaah...
Your tonsils are strongly swollen.
-And a little fever. -It must be a cold.
There's nothing better than a good snack.
I wouldn't do the same to you.
Ayumi, you'd better go home.
We folded, too.
-That's right.
Go home and rest. -Yes, woman.
I'll get the car right away and give you a ride, little girl.
(Miss) All right!
(Pupils) Good morning, Miss!
-Hello, boys.
Good morning to you!
Sit down!
I have to tell you that the Ayumi Yoshida's mother just called
to say that the Ayumi is cold and won't be coming today.
-Wow.
Vaja: Oh, she wasn't supposed to have a snack, poor thing.
Yesterday she wasn't feeling well, she must have gotten worse.
Eh?
You're worried?
Of course I am.
Oh, how sweet!
Leave me alone!
(Woman) Ayumi, I have to go out.
I'll go as fast as I can and I'll be here by noon.
-You be good and go to sleep. (Coughs) -It hurts...
Don't suffer.
When the swelling goes down, you'll be able to talk again.
(Phone rings)
(Answering machine: Ayumi's mother) "You've reached the Yoshida's house.
"We are not here right now."
"Leave the name and message after hearing the signal."
(Intercom: woman) Yes?
Mrs. Yamamoto?
I'm bringing you a package.
(Intercom) Come in.
(Ringing)
The mother!
(Thinking) "No, it's not! She wouldn't have rung the doorbell!"
"Oh! A burglar!"

"I have to call the police! I have to call the police!"
A child's room?
Don't be mean and come out.
I won't do anything to you.
(Thinking) "What do I do? Surely it's the thief they were talking about yesterday."
"If he finds me, he'll do to me what he did to the owner of "The escargot"."
Hey, when classes are over we could go see the Ayumi!
What do you say? -I'm in!
She'll be happy!
Well, I don't know.
We girls don't like to be seen when we don't feel well.
Especially when the boy we like sees us...
I thought you didn't care about little girls.
-What's wrong with her, this one? -But she's the same age.
(Music from the transmitter)
I'm sure it's the Ayumi who plays the electronic organ!
Are you Ayumi?
(Robot: male voice) "It's 10.30 a.m. on the 5th."
(Robot: male voice) "It's 10:30 a.m. on the 5th.
(Voice) "It's 10:30 in the morning on the 5th."
It's the clock on Yaiba!
The clock of Yaiba the Masked!
Doctor Agasa gave it to us!
If you press its head, it tells you the day and time.
But why doesn't Ayumi answer?
It's strange.
Maybe she's lost her voice, poor thing.
Can you feel me, Ayumi?
Ayumi, you've lost your voice?
If yes, it stings once;
if not, it stings twice.
Once.
Yes, it does.
Wow, she's lost her voice.
I'm sure he was bored and wanted to hear our voice.
Come on, let's go!
Let's cheer her up, then!
Wait a minute!
There's something wrong.
I understand why you used the voice of the clock to answer,
but I was 5 minutes late.
Besides, today is not the 5th.
Wow...
He must want to tell us something, I'm sure, guys.
Ayumi, what's wrong?
Answer me!
If yes, it itches once;
if not, it itches twice.
(Two taps)
She says no.
See?
She was bored and wanted to feel.
Next break we'll talk to her again.
(Bell)
Oh, no!
We have to go to the music room!
Miss Kobayashi will be furious.
For such a little girl, you have some pretty sophisticated stuff, don't you?
As you know, we're having a music party next month.
In class B, we're going to do an organ concert.
Today we will decide which song we will play.
Does anyone want to make a proposal?
(Students) Me!
Me!
Me!
I'm worried about Ayumi.
I really mean it.
The first song she played sounds familiar.
You don't know what it was, Shinichi?
He-he-he... It's just that I don't know about music...
Let's see, it was mi-mi-re-do-re...
(Think) "The most important thing is why the date and time were not correct."
(Voice) It's 10:30 a.m. on the 5th.
"10:30 on the 5th..."
Now that we have decided on the song we will play, we all sing together.
(Students) All right!

It's raining, it's raining!
Run, run, hide, screw!
(Students) Of course!
The song!
The Ayumi wanted us to say "screw"! #
Oysters! #
Miss!
Call the police!
The Ayumi's life is in danger!
Edogawa!
Come here!
(Think) "Shit! Why didn't I notice it before?"
"With that screw song I wanted to say "The escargot"."
"And the date and time were those of the robbery."
"They must have broken into Ayumi's house."
Ayumi, what's wrong?
Say.
If yes, it stings once;
if not, it stings twice.
"Please don't let anything happen to you!"
Yes, I understand now, Haibara.
I'm going to call the police.
Stay rehearsing and do me a kindness.
-What, Genta!
-Come on, come on, Mitsuhiko!
(thinks) "Gee, no. I don't have time."
"Wait a minute!"
"The thief didn't kill the restaurant's owner
until before he left, when he had the money."
Only 75,000 yen?
That's a pittance, for living in a luxurious apartment.
Well, then, I'll start to pass.
(Phone rings)
(Answering machine) "You've reached the Yoshida's house."
"We're not here right now."
"Leave your name and message after you hear the beep."
(Biiiiiiip)
(Agasa voice) "It's me."
(Think) Dr. Agasa!
"As I have come to the neighborhood,
I'll return the 5 million you left me."
"I just took it out of the bank."
5 million yen?

I have collected the patent money for the last invention. (Agasa voice)
I'm going to buy and I'll be right back.
Until now!
(Think) Surely Conan has warned the doctor!
This one who is called was your grandfather?
5 million yen... I can't let them escape.
(Agasa voice) It's me.
(Agasa voice) Open up!
(Thinks) Come on!
(Thinks) "My God! He'll hold Dr. Agasa too!"
"What can I do?"
(Doorbell)
Ah, yes I have them.
(Doorbell) Who are you?
Where is he, your grandfather?
I've come alone.
And you must be a thief, right?
You know that with a ball in the face you're stunned?
Especially if you're whistling with...
these supervambes!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Hey, Ayumi!
Hey, are you okay, Ayumi?
Just hold on.
I'll untie you right away.
How can you stand up to me, kid?
(Thinking) His helmet's off!
I'll get you for this!
(Genta) Stop!
Who are you, you?
-My name is Genta Kojima! -And I, Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya!
(At the same time) We're from the Junior Detective League!
Run away! Do you want to entangle me or what?!
Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
We've... we've narrowed it down!
We've done it!
(At the same time) Long live the Junior Detective League!
Well...
Viscaaaaaaa!

DETECTIVE CONAN
(Male) A few days later...
I'm glad you're over your cold, Ayumi.
Yes, and I've got my voice back.
I stood still: that thief was not what the woman had died of.
The one with the screw was caught in Yokohama.
According to Inspector Megure,
the thief who broke into Ayumi's house didn't want to hurt her, only money.
He knew that Ayumi's testimony was worthless because he is a minor.
Fortunately, when he attacked in Conan, we were able to cut him down.
What do you say!
This time it worked out well for you luckily,
but what you need to do is wait for the police before you act, eh?
Right!
We'll do it like this, sir!
Aah... Let's see if it's true.
-Shall we go play on the swings? -Yes, let's go! -Yes, let's go!
Come on, let's go!
Aaa... I don't know if they understood.
Shinichi, what you have to do...
Yes, I know: that they don't put themselves in danger.
No.
Eh?
Since you have the head and body of a child, you should...
go and play.
(Ayumi) Doctor!
(Ayumi) Thank you!
If it hadn't been for your call, the thief would have run away.
Eh?
Ah... Ah, yes!
I don't mind you using my voice, but being the grandfather...
Sorry, sorry.
Now, with grandchildren like these, anyone can say no.
Come on, grandfather will push him.
Come on, come on!
He's like a fish in water.
Yes, but before having grandchildren he should have a wife, right?
Watch that window!
(Thinking) Blood!
In the next chapter...
The murder case on the eve of the wedding, part 1
The clue to the next Conan is... A pendant!
Vacations are coming soon!
Congratulations to those who passed and those who didn't, too!
