DETECTIVE CONAN
The cactus murder case
My name is Noriko Okay.
I'd like to know if I could find out the address of a boy
whose name is Tsuyoshi Kitagawa.
I don't want to pry,
but what's his relationship to this Kitagawa end?
We became friends
when we met on a trip to Shinshu in early June.
At that time, it seemed to me that I didn't feel anything special for him...
but lately, I'm really looking forward to seeing him again.
Oh my goodness!
So you've fallen in love with this Kitagawa guy, haven't you, Miss Okay?
Well... I guess...
Don't be so indiscreet, Father.
(Thinking) "If you're just looking for a person's address, I'm not interested. Mm?
I've made you some tea.
Ah, thank you very much.
Why are you so nervous?"
Don't you have any information that might help us?
Yes, the license plate number of your car,
and a drawing I've made.
Ah, it looks like it has a rather special physiognomy.
Very well, I'll take care to find it.
(Thinking) This drawing...
Thank you very much, Mr. Mouri.
This job will be a piece of cake.
We will go to the traffic department with this license plate number
and we'll have the address!
Mr. Mouri, who knows if it's true, what do you want it for?
What do you mean by that?
The concept you have of a person is reflected in a portrait.
And here it doesn't seem that she is wanted.
Don't be so shameless!
Stop making ridiculous deductions and go do your homework!
I'm leaving!
See you later!
Listen, Conan, I don't think you should...
Here's her address and license plate number...
...poke your nose into her feina.
Yes.
(I already got what I need.
A handkerchief from Miss Okay...
I'm going out for a while, Ran!
Conan, come back!
Wow!
(Thinking) "Let's see... 3, 9, 8... Sumire-sound, Sumire-sound.
It's here!"
You didn't have to come all this way, just to return my handkerchief.
Hot chocolate flights? Yes.
I'll take it to you now.
What a nice room.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Hey, where did you work, you, Miss Okay?
I used to work for a transportation company,
but I don't do anything right now, you know?
And how's that?
I've been sick and I have to rest.
Caram.
(Thinking) "Kerosene?
"How strange, I don't seem to have any kerosene stove.
"A self-defense spray!
"Eh?
"This photo...
"It's dated May 19.
Hey, look what it looks like, peeping Tom.
So much, are you interested in this room?
What a shame you put me through.
I had gone out with him...
but he stood me up a few days ago.
That's why I'm looking for another boyfriend.
But from the picture he drew, he doesn't look like the guy in the photo.
Eh?
Because I thought it was better to look for a different one.
We don't talk about me anymore.
Come on, tell me about yourself, Conan.
You must have a girlfriend too, right?
Yes.
(He thinks) "In the end, he didn't want to explain anything to me.
"What are we going to do...
"I'll have to wait for Kogoro to come back.
I don't know if you'll find him so easily."
I haven't been to the aquarium for a long time.
I haven't been to the aquarium in a long time.
I'm looking forward to touching the dolphins!
Too bad it's not too nice a day, but gee, I don't think it's going to rain.
(Thinking) "In Kogoro it's back to work, today.
Kitagawa must have changed his address at the end of this year,
and hasn't notified the traffic department of the new one.
Maybe it won't be as easy as I thought, to track him down.
"It was already strange, that she would ask a detective to look for him
if she already had the license plate number.
"I'll still be right.
It's the Noriko.
She looks very sad."
Sorry, I have to do something urgent!
-Hey, wait, Conan!
-Conan!

(Adult voice) In mourning and with flowers.... He must be going to the cemetery.
(Thinking) Whose grave must it be?
It looks fresh.
(Adult voice) Eh?
-Oh... Hello, Noriko.
-Saeki.
How time flies.
It's been half a year since we buried him.
And how are you, Noriko?
I'm fine, thanks to you, Saeki.
I'm very grateful to you.
The credit goes to you.
I'm just going to help you do the rehabilitation.
It's still early, let's have a coffee?
Ah, well, I'm sorry, but I have to go.
I'll walk you to the car.
Ah... No, thank you.
Excuse me, Saeki, I'll see you soon.
Noriko...
Hello.
Ah, hello, good morning, kid.
Whose grave is this?
It's the grave of a friend of mine.
I thought it was the boyfriend of the girl who just left.
That's right.
He was my best friend and the fiancé of that girl.
The fiancé?
And when did he die?
Half a year ago, at the beginning of June.
(Think) June.
It's the man in the photo, for sure.
(Noriko) What a shame...
I had gone out with him, but he stood me up a few days ago.
"That's how he lied, when he said he stood her up...
If her fiancé was dead... why...?"
Hey, how did he die, this guy?
Car accident.
They crashed, one day he was driving with Noriko.
On a winding road, to Shinshu.
I don't want to be nosy,
but what's your relationship with this Kitagawa end?
We became friends
when we met in Shinshu in early June.
(Think) "What's wrong?
He met when her fiancé had the accident?"
Do you know a boy, Tsuyoshi Kitagawa?
Eh?
He's driving a red sports car.
A red sports car?
What's wrong?
Ah... no, nothing.
Please explain.
It's related to your friend.
The Noriko?
Who are you, may I ask?
I'm Conan Edogawa... a detective.
A detective?
Well, well!
How curious, that the famous Kogoro Mouri should have such a young assistant.
(Think) Otherwise, you wouldn't give me the information, would you?
What are you investigating, Conan?
I can't explain the details to you, Mr. Saeki,
but it would help us if you would give us the name of the Noriko's expromès.
Hm.
Noriko's fiancé's name was Tatsuo Yamaguchi.
They worked at the same company.
Why did you react that way,
when I told you about the red sports car?
Because I felt what Noriko explained
when she was questioned after the accident.
-A red sports car, you say?
-Yes, and there was a couple inside.
They kept following us,
we wanted to throw them off and we crashed.
Yes, there were marks from two different types of tires.
What happened?
They didn't leave us alone.
They stuck behind us and kept honking their horns,
and we let them pass.
Then they started to sprint right in front of us.
Tatsuo died... because of them!
Noriko...
Okay, we understand.
We'll finish investigating, Miss,
but even if we found him, we couldn't do much.
Why not?!
If their car had touched them, even a little, it would be different.
All we know is that they had an accident, because of Mr. Yamaguchi,
who we assume was driving too fast.
Do you remember the model and license plate number of the other car?
Miss Okay...?
That day, Noriko answered clearly... that she didn't remember.
That she didn't remember?
This, she said?
Yes, but she said it as if she was tormented by something inside.
Nor did she remember what the couple looked like,
the police closed the investigation after a month.
(Think) "Where did she get the information?
The license plate number of her car.
And a drawing I made.
She seems to have a rather special physiognomy.
(Thinking) "Noriko remembered perfectly well
the license plate number of the car and the face of the driver!
"But she didn't explain it.
What if he wanted to execute revenge personally?"
Mr. Saeki, which rehabilitation were you talking about, with Noriko?
As I am a physiotherapist,
I took care of her rehabilitation.
How was she after the accident?
Well, she made a superhuman effort.
Patients like her take about 6 months to recover,
but she was discharged after 3 months.
"It's obvious.

The desire for revenge cheered her up and she recovered quickly."
Let's go to Noriko's house right now!
Eh?
Come on, come on!
Come on!
Let's go!
(Thinking) "I've got to change Noriko's mind
before Kogoro locates that boy.
But how?"
Oops!
I'm sorry.
It's the thorn of a cactus called Shakoba.
I brought a friend and the thorn would stay here.
A Shakoba cactus...
Like the ones Mr.
Yamaguchi had?
He was young, but he was very fond of cactus.
I took all the ones he had, to keep as a souvenir,
but a friend asked me for one.
In fact, he wanted to give half of the cacti at the Noriko,
but I thought they would bring him souvenirs and I'm leaving in abundance.
I didn't even tell him, I have them myself.
"The Shakoba cactus is also called Christmas cactus!
I got it!"
Is it far, home?
No, it's not.
It's near Noriko's house.
Let's spend a moment, then.
It seems to me that Noriko has not arrived.
(Think) "I thought it would be at home,
waiting for Kogoro to tell her something.
Wow!
What if I had already found out where I live!"
(Phone)
Yes, private detective Mouri, say?
Hey, Kogoro, are you home already?
(Quietly) Did you find out the address of that Kitagawa guy?
Of course I did!
But it wasn't easy.
I spent 3 millimeters alone.
It's in Conan?
And I've already talked to Miss Noriko.
(Think) Gee, no!
That man was already living with another woman.
He must get it out of his head.
Give me his address! Why?
Because if I don't get there soon, he'll kill them though!
What are you saying?!

Tatsuooooo!
(Think) "The Noriko was supposed to go to the traffic department
to look for the address in Kitagawa,
but since she had moved, they couldn't tell her the new one.
"And she asked Kogoro for help.
"If she made so many efforts to recover faster,
it may be very difficult to prevent him from taking revenge.
But how should one want to take revenge, the Noriko?"
Did he die instantly, Mr. Yamaguchi?
No, it is seen that he was still alive after the accident.
In fact, in Tatsuo he was burned to death.
Burned ?!
The car's gasoline ignited before he was rescued.
(Think) "I get it! That wasn't kerosene.
Surely... it was gasoline!"
(Opens the door)
The girl who was in the car!
Well, that's how you remember me.
Why do you want to now?
The accident was not our fault.
Don't look for excuses, because you will die anyway.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What are you doing, you crazy woman!
You are wretches!
Now you will hear the same pain he suffered before he died!
This will never happen.
It can't be.
You feel me!
You're blown!
Hey, Conan! (screams)
On the roof!
(Adult voice) The only way to calm her down so she'll think is to...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Hey, what are you doing?!
(Kogoro) Quiet!
Noriko, Noriko!
Don't do it, please!
Don't come closer!
Freeze!
(Kogoro) This thing you want to do won't turn you into Tatsuo!
(Kogoro) I know that.
But it's the only way to punish them.
(Kogoro) Don't do it!
If you light the gasoline, you won't be saved either!
The future without in Tatsuo makes no sense to me.
I don't want to live anymore.
Now, I want to avenge his death.
(gasps)
A little more...
Ouch... I can't take it anymore!
(gasps) Eh?
(gasps) Eh?
Conan!
How beautiful they are, these Shakoba cacti.
It is typical to give them as Christmas gifts in many different places around the world.
That's why they call them Christmas cactus.
Shakoba...
Are they the ones in Tatsuo?
Yes...
When Tatsuo died,
I kept the flowers as a souvenir.
Noriko... even though in Tatsuo it's death...
it's something alive, in each... of these flowers.
Tatsuo...

DETECTIVE CONAN
You should have come, Conan.
We had a great time.
Of course we did!
We fed the dolphins!
But in Genta slipped and fell into the water.
In we have a souvenir.

The aquarium photographer hit it when it slipped.
Yeah, you guys had a great time.
(Think) Lucky I didn't go.
Oh, shit!
The Abe took Mr. Negishi's insurance money!
Negishi's insurance money!
He took the 500 million yen!
Wow!
And he used me to confirm his alibi.
Hell, no!
What are you saying now?
Get ready!
Now I'll make you... a new face!
