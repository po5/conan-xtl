"The 7 people in the waiting room."
Boy, I really didn't expect that!
An unexpected typhoon just on the day we have to go back to Tokyo.
I didn't expect it either,
this coincidentally coinciding with the famous Sleeping Detective Kogoro!
Sorry for the wait, gentlemen.
God-hay-do what weather, isn't it?
The forecast didn't get it right at all.
Could you pass out the towels, please?
A-ah, yes.
It's all... exactly like my life.
A long succession of unforeseen events and failures.
I have what you need right now.
I'll give you a discount, of course.
I guarantee it never fails.
How many people have you swindled, with this comedy?
I-and now, I don't intend to scam anyone!
I'm just a simple salesman offering loans at a good price.
I fell for this story and lost the factory!
In fact, the bank took it from me and kept it!
Let me go!
I told you I don't work for the bank!
(English accent) Oh!
May I give you a hand?
Oops!
Thank you, but you needn't bother.
What "amabilisme"!
It's as typical of Japan as the hot springs.
I am in love with this country!
How well the Japanese speak!
Although this "amabilisme" sounds a bit strange.
When I go on a trip to a country, I like to learn the local language.
You could say it's my specialty!
Please, gentlemen.
Could you please speak more quietly?
That's why I can't stand villages.
(Clears throat) Excuse me.
What time will the next train pass?
It's going to Tokyo, isn't it?
I'm sorry, miss.
I've been informed that the train service is suspended today.
-Oh, yes.
-Isn't it?
-What do you mean?
-Are you serious?
You must be joking.
What if I don't make it to tomorrow's meeting on time?
Who will take responsibility?
The councilman is about to arrive at a nearby station.
The councilman?
-Hm?
-I think you must mean him.
Shonosuke Yuhara, municipal councilman.
Then you must be...
The secretary, right?
Councilman Yuhara's.
I wanted to get there before him to prepare for tomorrow's rally...
Come to think of it: who made it, this poster?
-Did you do it?
-Ah, me.
Yes, madam.
The councilman's name is too small.
Fix it, you feel?
And leave me the station's phone number.
I-I...
I'm sorry, but you can't use the station phone.
-Oh, yes.
-We're cut off.
Aren't we?
What does that mean?
That we'll all have to spend the night locked in here?
-I don't think it's funny.
-That could be a lot of fun!
How, Conan?
Are you all right?
Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do.
Yes, I'm fine, but...
It's not ready yet, dinner?
Dinner.
He's right, dinner!
You're hungry, aren't you?
-No, I'm sorry.
-There's no restaurant here?
But in the souvenir store we have bags of ganyips and sandwiches, right?
Put water on to boil and prepare blankets for the women and children, please.
Ah..., yes.
Wait a minute, I'm coming too.
Excuse me, she's a little lost.
She hasn't been working here long and I can't leave her alone yet.
Please make yourselves comfortable until the train service is restored.
Can we go to the thermal baths while we wait?
-Finally some good news!

- (station manager) Of course.
Come on, who's up for it?
Would you like to join me?
I doubt it will pass, the bus from the thermal baths.
I think you mean the baths at the station, father.
Hm?
(Morris: humming) Mmmm... mmm... mmm...
Aaah...
What a nice thing to do, bathing in the hot springs...
while it's pouring rain outside!
Now I'd like a small pitcher of sake.
Yes, that would be great, wouldn't it?
Conan!
Will you come over to the other side?
Then I can rub my back.
N-no need, Ran, thanks!
I'd better stay here!
I've had enough.
Yes, I'm going out too.
There are no lockers in the locker room.
Better keep an eye on the poor tourists.
Hm, bad taste jokes must also be a specialty of Japan.
It's decided!
When I'm done, I'll go buy a flask of local schnapps.
I didn't doubt it.
Hm?
What's this?
Hm?
Ah!
Let me see it?
Let's see...
"Mr. Mouri: today, someone will be killed by..."
Xxxt!
Oh, my goodness!
If this is true, the murderer better not know that we know about it.
But you mean it's not more of a kind of joke?
The note isn't complete, it's half written.
It looks as if he didn't have time to write the name of the murderer,
the person who did it.
Who would have left me this note?
Who did it?
The job of a famous detective like you is to find out.
Were you listening to us?
I'm a great admirer of Dr. Watson.
If you need someone to help you investigate, I'm here for you.
He might as well have written it.
He was the first one out of the tub.
What are you doing here?
Did something happen?
Hm.
He could have done it too.
No, nothing happened.
It's my business.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you tell me what you were doing and where you were, while we were bathing?
What was that?
Ouch!
Marrec!
Don't ask impertinent questions to people we don't know!
Excuse me, it's just that he loves to imitate me.
He spends all day playing detective.
I haven't moved from here the whole time.
In fact, I have nothing to do and nowhere to go.
That's just the way my life is.
And could someone...?
(Kurusu) I can confirm that he's telling the truth.
He's been here the whole time mumbling depressing things,
like the one who told you just now.
So, you haven't moved from here either?
That's right.
But we could be lying to cover up for each other.
Hey, hey, hey!
What are you insinuating?
Just kidding, man.
I play detective too.
What do you mean?
What do you mean, the e-mail hasn't been sent?
Since we're playing detective, I can tell you something else, though.
Although, if you're as smart as everyone says you are,
I'm sure you've already figured it out.
This man.
He's a con man.
-Huh?
-And he's a pickpocket.
W-what does he say now?
-Do you have any proof?
-What nonsense!
He's loaded with brochures from different companies.
The basic tool of any swindler.
And the pickpockets approach their victims
to help them pick something up.
You're absolutely right, but...
Or they invite them to the thermal baths.
-What are you saying, Grandma?
-Isn't dinner ready yet?
Don't you remember, we just had dinner?
She's even eaten my instant noodles.
Who are you?
I don't know you.
Really, Grandma?
He's already forgotten about me?
I'm giving you my noodles...
Don't suffer.
When the phone works, we'll tell your family to come and get you.
Gee, Masako!
I can see you're getting on very well at work.
I was just pretending that she had forgotten.
What a crafty old lady!
Grandma died last year, poor thing.
Hmm?
Well, bird, go make dinner at once!
I've got a young lady who's a real left-handed zero.
- "Dang it! They all look suspicious."
-Yeah, right.
I'll be right there.
Where to, miss?
I can't stay here wasting my time all night.
Mr. Yuhara is waiting for me.
I'll take a cab near here.
There are no cabs now.
Please stay here until the storm subsides.
What do you think you're doing?

Who are you to tell me what to do?
Get out of my way!
Ah!
Ouch!
-Hey!
-What's the matter?
-Oh!
-Tank the door!
(gasps) Huh?
It's gone.
He can't be!
Hey, father.
Wake up!
Come on, Father, please!
Eh?
W-what do you want?
W-what happened?
The alderman's secretary decided she was going alone and left.
What do you say, now!
Hm?
But it's...!
Mr. Mouri, where is the note?
Eh?
Wow!
I must have dropped it.
(He thinks) "Maybe he picked it up and read it. What if...?"
Wait for me, I want to come too!
Where are you going, Conan?
-What are we going to do?
Let's go, then.
-I'll come with you too!
-Aaah!
-Aaah!
I'd be very surprised if it had gone very far,
in the rain and the wind...
She must have taken shelter somewhere nearby.
I'm going to see if I can find it!
Hey, stop!
We'd better not get separated!
Fuck!
Come on, let's go!
It's a shot!
(gunshot)
(gunshot) What?
Hey, wait for me!
It was coming from over there!
What happened, Conan?
Look, Mr. Mouri!
Eh?
Oysters!
A homicide has been committed.
I'm sorry for Miss Noriko,
but I had to cover it up with a blanket
and leave it where it was to preserve the crime scene.
She's been... she's been murdered?
B-but how the hell did he...?
She was probably shot with a gun.
Hm?
Hm?
But why has this woman killed him, now, this woman?
And who did it?
Do not suffer for nothing.
I, the famous detective Kogoro Mouri,
will find the culprit among all these suspects.
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Mouri!
Why the hell do you consider me as a suspect?
Sherlock Holmes would never suspect Dr. Watson.
(Kogoro) They both have a motive.
Maybe they wanted to kill her because she had discovered his identity.
-It's a lie!
-It's not true!
You haven't made dinner yet, pretty girl?
About that...
-Hmm?
-Hmm?
I don't know who you are, you people.
One of you wrote me this note and put it in my pocket.
And the note that was sent to you was about this murder?
Although he was warned in time, he couldn't prevent the crime.
Well, what a detective, isn't he?
More than a warning, it was a way of asking Mr. Mouri for help.
But he couldn't prevent it.
It's the same thing.
Assuming he was referring to this murder.
Ahem!
For starters, I'd need to confirm his alibis...
and go through their belongings.
You'll have to tell me where you were and what you were doing
when Conan and I went out and were left alone in the rain.
-You'll ask about the gun, won't you?
-And also...
By now, I'm guessing the killer has either made it disappear...
or hidden it somewhere.
Okay.
You're not on Holmes, and I'm not on Watson.
I went to the back of the station.
Since I was alone, I have no alibi.
Go ahead, you can check my luggage.
Yes, I was also alone on the platform.
Therefore, I have no alibi.
And from that... everyone has seen the contents, but you can check it.
-W-well, it was... the washroom.
-And you?
No, I went to the kiosk.
I was thirsty and wanted to buy a drink.
-Yes.
-Were you alone?
No, there was also this lady.
She was trying to pick up some food.
It's going to be very difficult to confirm.
Ah.
Anyway, I don't want you to remove my bag.
A mere detective has no right.
-Maybe so, but I'm not a detective. -Yeah, sure, that's true.
-Yes, of course, that's true. -Yes, of course, that's true.
May I ask what you're doing?
Stop it!
What do you mean?
N-no.
What's the matter?
Missing something?
I don't miss anything, and now.
He just wanted to keep us intrigued.
Yeah, well... Then we have no choice but to make an experiment.
Hm?
How strong!
What beautiful handwriting!
Do you want to compare everyone's handwriting?
Go ahead, write.
I don't think we'll get anything out of this experiment.
Everyone is capable of making a fake handwriting.
No, it might work.
Handwriting can be faked,
but we all have a style that we can't disguise.
"How come I didn't notice it? I know who wrote the note!"
The power's gone out!
-Hm?
- (thump and bang)
Eh?
Masako!
Oh, no!
Oh, my God!

Who has been able to do that to him?
He's still breathing.
Ran, take a towel and a first aid kit.
Nobody move, please!
Right away.
This is...
Could it be... the note was written by her?
She did?
Yes.
Look at that.
The alderman's sign.
Hmm?
It's the same handwriting!
This was the killer's doing.
This one's torn too.
It just reads "he's an imposter".
There would have been his name written on it, that's why he tore it.
I'm sure it was the grandmother.
She pretends she has no memory, but that's a lie.
She gave herself away!
By the way, do you know where she is now?
I don't see her anywhere.
She can't have run away, can she?
What happened, Ran?
Aah!
(Hokari) Oh!
(Hokari) Th-that's Grandma!
That's right, it was her.
D-don't shoot.
Turn the gun on me!
Eh? (Hokari)
Today is the day of the organic collection.
This can't be thrown away.
I have a young woman who is a zero to the left!
Oh, mother.
This is too heavy!
Hey, hey, hey!
Watch out!
Ah!
-He deserves the reputation he has.
-Good stop!
Is it yours, the gun?
It smells of gunpowder.
Is it you, who fired it?
I-I fired several test shots.
In the middle of the forest, before I came here.
What do you mean, you were doing target practice?
You're wrong!
When the factory went bankrupt,
I let myself be tempted by some unscrupulous loan sharks
and I started smuggling remodeled weapons,
but it didn't work.
The only thing left was death, that's why I came here.
In the end, I have not been able to.
But I have no reason to kill anyone.
I didn't kill the lady!
It is the truth!
"It does look like a remodeled gun."
"But we can't compare bullets here."
"Besides, he's not the impostor."
"If the victim knew he wouldn't find any cabs, get out,
I don't understand why he risked going out."
"Wait a minute!"
"If I remember correctly..."
"I have to find out what he was trying to see."
"You can't see anything."
"Eh? Sure! I know why it came out!"
How strange.
"There's a picture missing."
"Maybe he was killed because he saw something."
"And then the killer took the picture down."
"That means... Of course!"
"This would explain
why he reacted that way, with the grandmother."
"And there's something else."
"When she looked at the sign, something occurred to Masako."
"And then they attacked her when the light went out. I'm sure of it."
"She knew it! She had discovered the killer's target!"
At last the service has been restored!
Where is she, my secretary?
Hm?
Who the hell are you?
Oh!
-Aah!
-What's the matter?
I can see that!
The impostor was you!
The stationmaster!
Yes.
"If you make a single false step, someone may take it wrong."
Despite the threat,
Masako looked for a way to warn Mouri with a note.
And when he noticed it, she attacked him.
What a bad guy!
He is really bad!
My son died because of Yuhara!
They falsely accused him of having accepted bribes
and pushed him to commit suicide!
Is that why he killed his secretary?
Because he had discovered her?
That woman didn't lift a finger to defend my son either, then!
She worked with him and knew perfectly well that he was innocent,
but she kept quiet to protect herself.
She deserves what she got!
She must have been surprised,
when she thought that the grandmother had discovered her, right?
Yes.
But Grandma didn't make me suffer anything.
I did what I had to do to avenge my son.
What happened to your son
doesn't give you the right to kill another person!
Nor to hurt Masako!
Surely your son wouldn't have wanted me to do this to avenge him.
Surely it wouldn't have made him happy.
I'm sure it wouldn't!
(Cries)

"At the Masako, the station employee,
she was taken to the hospital and recovered."
He must be the real station master.
It's good to see him.
And, in the end, it turned out that in this pair they were also wanted.
Come on, make breakfast at once!
Come on, I've got a son-in-law who's a left-hand man.
What?
E-e-ei, wait, wait a minute!
Where are you taking me?
Stop it!
Hey, father, what are you doing?
Where are you going?
I'm not your son-in-law!
What a remedy!
We'll have to leave here.
(Takagi) Yes, exactly.
It's the man who stole 30 million yen here in Beika.
You demand that they stop the reconstruction of the temple?
They buried the body on the grounds of Dongaraji Temple.
We have returned because we believe that you have killed your father...
...so that you could continue to collect your pension illegally!
Eh ?!
