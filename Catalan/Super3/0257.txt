Destiny is a clue to deductions.
It is a light that sheds light on mysterious cases.
Even if you make an offering to the temple,
it won't grant you bad wishes.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is Detective Conan!

(Off) "Media."
"In a room at 3 o'clock in the morning, when everyone was asleep...
"There was an earthquake."
(rumbling)
(Yawns) Yesterday's earthquake gave me quite a scare.
(Yawns) Huh?
What-what the hell?
Hey, listen, are you all right?
(gasps) Huh?
The bells!
The earthquake must have dropped the bells on his head.
Huh? (groans)
Someone tried to steal the offering box...
This means that this man...
A STRANGE PUNISHMENT FROM HEAVEN
(Children at the same time) Have they tried to steal the offerings?
Yes, this morning, in the Temple of Teitan.
Gee, I'm sure God will punish him for what he has done.
Very good!
The Junior Detective League will catch the thief!
No, no, wait!
They've already caught him, the thief!
What do you mean, the thief?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
What a pity.
The police have arrested him, just like that?
You see?
Genta, you should hear the whole story.
Sometimes there are such coincidences.
"When he was trying to steal the money, there was the earthquake,
"The Klang-Klang fell on his head..."
"And he was knocked unconscious."
Eh?
The Klang-Klang?
That's the name of the temple bells, don't you know?
You didn't even know this?
(Think) "Sure, and I believe it."
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Surely heaven punished him.
That's why you shouldn't do bad things.
He really had bad luck, this thief.
-Yeah, look how he was glued...! - Hey, Conan...
Conan...
Guys, why do you think the thief chose this humble temple?
What... what do you mean?
Look at this place.
What am I going to do now?
I don't have the money to make the repairs.
Even if I had opened the offertory box,
it doesn't look like there should be much in there, does it?
I see what you mean.
If I had gone to Beika's temple I would have understood,
a lot of people go there to pray.
Maybe I didn't know it, the Beika temple.
That's true.
Surely he must have come from far away.
Let's not forget, guys.
Maybe we have more cases to solve, because of the earthquake.
There will be people who need us.
Let's get the Detective League going.
Let's get the Detective League going!
-Let's go! -Let's go!
(Woman: call)
What did you feel?
A scream!
(Woman) Takeo, what happened to you?
Takeo, tell me something!
Takeo!
Takeo, don't die on me!
(Moans in pain)
Takeo!
Genta, call for an ambulance.
Yes.
(Woman) Takeo, are you all right?
Takeo.
Hold on!
So, you two will get married next month.
Won't you?
Yes.
We were supposed to meet today...
because we had to celebrate the pre-wedding ceremony.
And I called him several times but he didn't answer.
That's why...
You came here because you were worried.
Yes.
When I arrived, he was on the floor and I was so scared.
His head doesn't hurt so much anymore?
It's a small contusion, and the X-rays didn't detect any trauma.
I can see that... Very well, Mr. Takeo.
I'd like you to give me the details of the facts.
How you were attacked?
Yes.
I went to a party last night and came back late.
It was half past five o'clock 3... It was after the earthquake.
What a mess!
Everything is upside down.
Did the earthquake do this?
What bad luck.
(Object: falls)
Hey, who are you?
Stop it!
You won't escape!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
No, please don't.
It can't be true, he's dead!
I can't believe it!
Come back... Come back...
You say that man ran away...

because he was thought to have murdered her.
Is that correct?
Yes, yes, surely.
But he had only knocked me unconscious.
Wow, what a cowardly thief.
The second one on the job we've had today.
Of course he is!
And did he steal anything from you?
Yes, about 200,000 yen he had in his drawer.
-He only took the money?
-Yes.
(Thinking) "This is getting complicated."
"Cash is hard to detect."
Excuse me, you mean they can't catch it?
Do you?
Don't worry about it.
You can rest easy.
If we find his prints, we've got him in the bag.
I'd say the thief was wearing gloves, Inspector.
I think I'll start by questioning the neighbors.
(Car: horn)
-Hello, Takagi. -Hello, Takagi.
How are we doing? -Otani.
What are you doing here?
I have to take this one to the scene of the crime.
A temple over there.
Ah.
For stealing the offerings...
-What a foolish thief, can't you find? -What a foolish face he makes.
-What an idiot's face he makes.
Poor thing, don't tell him these things.
His name is Urasawa, he lives in the fourth district, at the end of this street.
(He thinks) "In the fourth district?"
He's a coward, but you can't be stealing.
(Takagi) He's already been arrested twice for breaking into private houses.
(Takagi) We've had some annoying cases.
-(Takagi) Me, a robbery with assault. Huh?
What?
Is anything wrong, master?
(Takagi) Oh.
Ah, no.
No, nothing.
But if you've been sent here because you've been commissioned,
the case will be solved in a jiffy.
He-he-he-he-he...
Well, I have to go.
(laughs) See you later.
I wish it were true, that.
Eh?
Ah, yes... Maybe I should go look for witnesses.
I'd like to help Inspector Takagi solve the case.
Especially since he screwed up and got punished.
Don't worry, this case is very easy.
No set-up, is there, Conan?
Conan.
What the hell are you doing now?
Something doesn't add up.
What are you talking about?
The Urasawa, this thief of the offerings.
Look closely at this map.
The fourth district is next to Beika's temple.
He lives next to it, but he's chosen Teitan's temple to steal from,
which is far away and not very crowded.
And what does this matter?
Heaven has punished him for trying to steal in that ancient temple.
What is the problem of voices?
The sky has punished it?
The Klang-Klang has punished it.
It would not have fallen even if there had been an earthquake.
(Thinking) "I wonder if..."
"Wait."
"There's a reason why I had to choose this temple."
Now where are you going?!
(Thinking) "It should be this way."
"If my deductions are correct,
"It should be between this building and the temple of Teitan."
What's the problem?
Why did you start running?
I've found it.
Conan.
This you've got is...?
Yes, it could be the thief's.
I'm quite sure.
They are from the one who attacked Mr. Takenaka.
Congratulations, Conan!
Good work.
We should explain it to Inspector Takagi right away.
Yes, let's go!
"But the most important thing isn't here...
"And I doubt very much if he still has it on him."
"I've got it. I know where it is!"
Sir, eagerness, please!
I was going to put some money in the box and I dropped the transmitter.
Okay, my boy.
I'll open it right away.
Huh?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What's this?!
I got it.
Thank you very much, sir.
Wow!
Look at this.
How lucky you are!
Th-there's so much money, in here...!
This has never happened before!
Inspector Takagi, what did they tell you?
Yes.
There's no doubt:
that money was stolen from Mr. Takenaka's house.
There were his fingerprints on the bills.
(At the same time) We knew it.
And we also found someone's fingerprints that we didn't expect.
Whose are they, then?
Urasawa's.
That thief of the offerings.
This means that he stole the money.
-What a dolent lord. Hey, wait a second, Genta.
Mr. Takenaka has attacked you at half past five on 3, hasn't he?
Yes.
But the earthquake was a quarter of 3, wasn't it?
Yes.
So, at that time, the thief was unconscious in the temple, right?
Yes, he was!
The Klang-Klang fell on his head,

and at the time I was unconscious.
It is true.
It is impossible for a person who was unconscious
would be stealing somewhere else.
I don't understand anything at all, guys.
(Thinks) "I don't get the frame."
"I thought it was a simple robbery."
Inspector Takagi...
Hey, Inspector Takagi.
Why don't you ask Inspector Megre to help you?
(Mitsuhiko) Maybe that would be best, don't you think?
Ha-ha.
You're kidding, right?
I can handle a case like this on my own.
You'll see.
But... Conan, what do you think?
Eh?
Conan!
-Conan? -Conan?
(Mobile)
Hello, this is Takagi.
Oh, Inspector Megre.
Look, ins-inspector, it just so happens that... "I don't want excuses from a bad paymaster!"
"Otani called me and explained everything."
"Now it's time for you to show us what you're worth."
"Don't lose confidence in yourself."
But, Inspector Megre...
"You are a first-rate investigator. And I know it perfectly well."
"What's wrong with you is that you don't have enough confidence in yourself."
Confidence?
(Megre's voice) That's right.
Confidence.
You can solve this case.
You have to believe in yourself, Takagi.
(Megre voice) Yes, sir!
"I'll be waiting for you to give me good news."
Inspector Megre.
Thank you very much!
(Conan voice) What happened to Inspector Takagi?
He's become happy all of a sudden.
He is called Inspector Megre.
Yes, Inspector Megre has cheered him up a lot.
Of course...
Something, Inspector.
What do you want?
Are you sure the Urasawa was knocked unconscious at 1/4 of 3?
What do you mean by that?
-That's the time when the earthquake happened.
-At that time he dropped the Klang-Klang on his head. -It's the time the Klang-Klang fell on his head.
But no one saw it happen, right?
Ooooh.
You're right!
We only have Urasawa's statement.
-It's true. -Oh!
Got it.
We'll find out what Urasawa was doing at the time of the attack.
We'll follow the theory that he was the one who attacked Mr. Takenaka.
(At the same time) Yes.
The Urasawa was a lazy
who hated to work and was broke,
"so he decided to steal the money he needed."
"He roamed around the neighborhood looking for a place that seemed suitable, and then..."
he decided... to break into Mr. Takenaka's house.
Why did he go into this particular apartment?
What made him decide to choose it?
Who knows?
Probably because he saw that no one was home.
But if it was after midnight, he couldn't know if someone wasn't there.
Ah, that...
It was probably a coincidence.
Yes.
It doesn't matter that he broke into her house.
No, it's important.
He must have had a reason to do it...
He had to have a...
(Thinks) "He's right, he had to have a good reason to do it."
How did he know?
How did the Urasawa know that there was no one else besides Takenaka?
Courage, inspector.
Think!
That something happened, on this floor?
No, impossible, there was no one at home.
Nothing could have happened.
Of course it couldn't!
The earthquake!
The earthquake was just
when I was passing in front of Cal Takenaka.
The earthquake took place at night.
It surely woke everyone up,
and people must have turned on their lights in fright.
"But Mr. Takenaka's apartment
"It was the only one that continued with the lights off."
"That's why he realized that no one was there, and went inside."
"But while he was looking for things to steal,
"Mr. Takenaka returned home."
What a mess!
Everything is upside down.
Did the earthquake do it, this?
What bad luck!
(Object: falls)
Hey, who are you?
Stop it!
You will not escape!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
No, please don't.
It can't be true, he's dead!
I can't believe it!
(Takagi) The Urasawa thought he had murdered her,
and ran away possessed.
He had to find a place
to get rid of the gloves and balaclava as soon as possible.
He saw a place where there was garbage
and got rid of it right there... because we couldn't find them.
Criminals get nervous, don't they, at times like this?
Yes, they do.
In fact, he's a coward.
And even if he was wrong,
he was convinced he'd committed murder.
He must have been scared to death.
He knew that the police would move heaven and earth to find him.

And he lacked an alibi to protect him...
Ah...
An alibi?
An alibi...
I'm sure the Urasawa thought about it... He wanted an alibi!
That's right!
At that moment...
"He found the temple bells on the floor."
"And decided to pose as an offering thief.
"and set it all up."
I mean he didn't intend to take the offerings,
but to make it look like he had tried to steal from them and got caught.
Then he would have an alibi for the time of Mr. Takenaka's death.
-Inspector, he's very clever!
When he puts his mind to it, he comes out on top.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Why did he put the money inside the offering box?
He had no choice.
No one would have believed he was an offering thief,
if he had 200,000 yen on him.
I can understand that.
Besides, maybe...
I've killed a person.
I've killed a person!
I don't want to be in jail for the rest of my life.
No!
Please, please, please, my God!
Help me.
Help me.
Oh, my God!
Maybe she was praying for God to help her.
(At the same time) She was praying?
Maybe she was.
She's right, maybe he was doing just that.
That would just prove how desperate he was.
And then he...
Everything was as Inspector Takagi just said.
Takagi.
-That is, he tried to cover up a crime by committing another crime.
Anyone would have done the same as me, in my situation.
It's better to get arrested for a petty crime like theft
than for something big like murder.
Can't find?
-Capsigrany! -Excuse me.
Hey, Urasawa.
It's no good, making these distinctions.
A crime is a crime and will always be punished!
You're right.
I'm really sorry...
Oh, don't tell me he forgot about us...
and that he went to lunch with his friend?
This is not done!
I can't believe it.
I don't think she forgot about us.
It looks more like she's been implicated in something.
See this keychain.
