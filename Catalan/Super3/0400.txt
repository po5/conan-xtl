Stars have a certain appeal.
Whether they are guilty or actors.
Ran's suspicions and a password that gets closer to the truth.
Love and deduction come together.
He looks like a child but has the brains of an adult and is Detective Conan!

Thank you for the dinner.
It was all very good.
Well, go to sleep.
It's already past 12 o'clock!
Yes.
Ah, wait a minute.
Tell me, Ran.
What do you want, say?
Ah... Nothing at all... Eh... Brush your teeth well, eh, Conan?
Uh... Yes, understood.
Strange, he seems to be nervous today.
(thinks) "He has noticed."
"He knows that I suspect what his true identity is."
"Shinichi..."
Oh, what a mess!
We forgot to lock the office door properly.
Well, go close it before you go to sleep.
Aaaaah... So sleepy...
"There is only one way to check...
"...whether this suspicion is founded or not."
THE SUSPICIONS OF THE RAN
"I have to go return the rental car."
"Conan's cell phone."
"If here were to find the message I sent to Shinichi.
"It would be the irrefutable proof
"that would prove that Shinichi and Conan are the same person."
"I thought so!"
"I had turned off the phone so it wouldn't ring when I got my message."
"Shinichi, after the start, I'll clear everything up!"
"But, wait, I already do well done?"
"If in Conan was really Shinichi,
"He couldn't look me in the face."
"This kid..."
How cute he is!
(Think) "He... the chest..."
"As a little boy he's always been naughty.
"Very self-confident and a fanatic for deductions."
"But you can always count on him, he's a brave boy and he's handsome."
"In Shinichi I like him very much!"
("Racing heartbeat")
"I can't sleep!"
"But it's been so much fun, that we bany√©ssim together, right?"
"Eh? You have blood coming out of your nose? You must have gotten dizzy in the bathroom."
"Maybe what I should do would be to ask him directly."
"There must be some reason..."
"And it's not right to spy on someone else's cell phone."
"But if I just check if my message is to his phone..."
"If I just do this... there's no problem, is there? Forgive me, Shinichi!"
"Mite'ls it. I knew I'd run into that."
"But in these cases,
"You date birthdays and that sort of thing."
"No, that way it would be too easy. What a job..."
"There are 10,000 different combinations with 4 digits,
"And it would take 8 hours to try all the combinations;
"Besides, you also have to think..."
"Ah, maybe it's my birthday."
"How silly you are, this is impossible."
"No, it's impossible. It can't be! But I don't lose anything by trying."
"Let's see, my era..."
"What can I do? If this were the secret code..."
"If this were the code, I..."
"Ya. I was wondering, it wasn't this one."
"Then what number would it be? Grr!"
"Let-me-look, demon!"
"Not like that, Ran. You need to calm down."
"Looks like you're both sleeping."
"Here no one will bother me or feel me, even if I make noise.
"And I have all the time in the world."
2036, 2037, 2038, 2039a, 2040, 2041, 2042...
Ah... No!
It's useless!
At this rate it will be daylight!
"I'll have to resort to deductions
"To find out what code he has put in Shinichi."
"Among the things he likes the most, there's Holmes..."
"Could it be the year one of his cases took place?"
"No, I don't think so."
"Earlier I checked all the numbers up to 2,000-something."
(Horns: commotion)

You hooligans!
You can't make this noise!
"46-49? How much like it? It's already midnight!"
"Come to think of it, there was also the..."
Watching a romantic movie was a fantastic idea.
I was thrilled.
Robbery... blatant...
That actress was very pretty.
Clumsiness?
Clumsiness...
No, it must be... "Hey, I'm coming".
Wait a minute, Shinichi, what's wrong with you?
You're asking me?
I'm talking about the license plate number of that car!
That 10-39 means "blatant theft".
So, if that other one has the 23-19,
it might say, "clumsiness" or maybe "Hey, I'm coming".
I match numbers with words.
That's how I exercise my mind!
And why do you do this?
It's detective stuff.
It's also training to solve secret codes.
You blow my mind.
342 is "locked room."
93-89 is "baseball on the field."
"poopy poop."
48-64!
"Chinese cabbage".
89-31!
Apa, come on, the flames one after the other!
What made me laugh earlier was the license plate number...
of a florist's van carrying 80-83.
80-83?
Mm... "greengrocer"?
You see?
Because it said "florist" it should carry 87-83!
You're right, you're right.
Oh, wait, I think you can also do the butcher's.
Look, if 29-83 is "fishmonger",
it should be 37-83, don't you think?
(laughs) And although there are many more!
"Hot springs" would be 26-83!
And if you take out the 3 for "sir", "natto seller" would be..... 10-28!
The ones now would be the numbers people ask for especially;
in fact, now you can put any number you ask for,
but there used to be no cars that ended with 42 or 49.
Why?
The 42 means "deceased";
And 49, "painful death".
"Deceased"?
"Painful death"?
But nowadays, Ran, people aren't into romance.
Hey, look at that one over there!
46-49.
Many have the expression "mucho gusto".
Ah...
The numbers that are especially popular now
are the ones you'd never get in a lottery.
11-22?
Like 11-22;
those never come up.
"Well-matched marriage."
See?
That one also carries it.
"Well-matched marriage!"
I wish if the father bought a car, he'd put it on.
No, considering the tastes your father has,
I'd put an 11-07 or an 81-09...
The 11-07 or the 81-09?
"Piece of woman"!
Or "bikini"!
What are you talking about?
Stop saying strange things!
Tell me, what number would you like to put?
To say "Shinichi Kudo" you should put 910-41.
Eh?
There's one number left over.
I've got it!
You would put the "Ku" of Kudo and 10-41!
KU of "Kudo" and 10-41?
I'd like that very much!
But, you have failed.
Didn't you?
You can't choose the letter at the beginning of the license plate,
and it is forbidden to put vowels or syllables beginning with K.
Really?
If I had to pick one to put on... Oh.
That car...
Shinichi!
What's wrong with that car?
Sir, listen!
Be careful, it's dangerous!
Keep going, please!
(Think) "Fumuda!"
Mr. driver!
That car...
"I can't ask you to follow him."
- (female voice) "Stop requested."
- (ding-dong)
Say, what's wrong, Shinichi?
"Shinichi?"
(female voice) Damn it!
Mr. Policeman!
I just saw a car with a fake license plate.
Yes, a fake license plate.
A fake license plate?
It's a black car with the license plate number Shinjuku 510-Shi 15-64.
But... but how did you know that the license plate it had was a fake?
Oh!
15-64?
"Killer"?
Just because you can read the numbers this way doesn't mean anything.
The problem is not the numbers, but the letter in hiragana alphabet!
License plates with the syllables 'Shi' and 'He' are not in circulation.
If they have put a false license plate on the car in which they are traveling,
it is because those people must have planned a crime
and are about to commit it.
Take care of it, right away, please.
Understood.
I'll take care of it.
Ran!
Go on home alone!
Shinichi!
Oh, my...
(Phone)
Mouri Detective Agency.
Ah, hello, Shinichi!
How did it go after... after... splitting up?

"The issue to those people's tuition was not 15-64,
"but the 510 of the license plate classification."
Eh?
The 510?
"Heist"!
Thanks to my deductions everything has remained a frustrated attempt.
This means they've been caught!
It looks like they put "robbery" and "murderer" on the license plates
to provoke the police and to act like children...
But they screwed up when it came to putting the 'shi' in "dead".
"By the way, what I was telling you about your father's license plate number,
"If he had to put one, it would be 55-45."
55-45?
"(River) Goodbye, tomorrow we'll see you at school!"
Wait, Shinichi!
Hey, father, if you never bought a car....
Don't be a pain, now Yoko Okino's concert will start.
Oh, Yoko!
Yoko!
"I hope you all will see my concert!"
Viva!
Viva!
Yoko!
Come on, Yoko!
Come on, Yoko!
"(Think)" Yoko!
Viva!
Hurray!
Ah, right, 55-45!"
"55-45? I'll try it just in case."
"I thought so. He's not the father."
"Ah, but I'd swear that day..."
"If I had to pick one to put on him..."
"What was he going to say to me at the time?"
"It's a four-digit number, he could use as a secret code."
"But it's a good clue to find a match..."
"For example... Yes, the 40-62 of 'Holmes'."
"It didn't work? It's still locked though..."
" 'Lock'? Locked?"
"Come to think of it, Holmes' first name was Sherlock, wasn't it?"
"It's 48-69... Well, let's try it."
"Eh? It can't be! I've unlocked it!"
What can I do now?
What can I do?
What a horror!
I have unblocked it!
Oh!
I have to check it.
(racing heartbeat)
"I have to check if she got my message or not."
"Eh? My message... is not there?"
"Sure..."
"It's possible that I was prepared and had deleted it before."
"But it won't do you any good, Mr. Wise Detective."
"If I send you this morning's message again right away..."
"Eh? It doesn't reach you? Oh..."
"What's it like?!" Oh...!
Why not?"
"How strange..."
And I didn't get the wrong number....
(Ring)
They're calling!
Eh?
They're calling?
(Ring)
(Shinichi voice) "What's wrong with you?"
Yes, say?
"Don't you parents send me the same message over and over..."
Eh?
Shinichi?
"What are you up to, silly?"
(They call)
"What time do you think it is? It's 12 o'clock."
"Who's there?"
"I spend day and night working on the investigation and I end up exhausted."
"I was trying to sleep peacefully!"
You've seen my cell phone?
Co... Conan!
I've been looking for it for a long time.
Ah!
That's my!
Oh, sorry.
"I have things to do..."
You dropped it in the car and I forgot to give it to you.
You did?
Well, if I had my phone locked...
Did you check... what was on it?
Uh, no... Of course you didn't.
Why do you get so nervous?
Of course I'm nervous!
There might be a personal message from the girl... I like!
Ah, that's right.
You're right...
"Let's see, you're supposed to..."
Goodbye, good night.
Yes, good night!
"You've always been a bit like that."
"Of course I have. That's why Conan was so nervous."
"He thought he had seen a girl's message..."
(Shinichi) "Why did you send me the same one so many times?"
"Why did you have to send it to me so many times if one was enough?"
- (Shinichi voice) What's that for?
- "Hey, Ran!"
For-forgive me, Shinichi...
It seems that... I'm confused about something again.
(Thinking) "Lucky the doctor's cell phone is the same model as mine."
"If it weren't for the strip on it, you wouldn't tell them apart."
"But Ran's messages took a long time to arrive."
"I've blocked it to save time,
"But number 48-69 of 'Sherlock' was too easy."
"But this was the only thing I could do.
"That the data on my phone and Conan's matched."
I'm happier now.
I hadn't felt your voice in a long time....
Even though I wanted to talk to you, I had no way to call you....
Ah, but don't get me wrong.

Don't look for any strange meaning in what I say.
Dummy, look at your cell phone screen.
Come on, Ran.
What's that?
Is this the number?
This is your phone number?
Are you sure?
Can I have your number?
I might call you at a bad time.
Yes, but I'm sure I'll be busy and you might run into the answering machine.
Although some things can only be said... by word of mouth.
Yes, you're right.
(Think) "It's dangerous for me to give you my cell phone number."
"But if this is the danger I'm in, it shouldn't be that serious."
(Conan and Ran: yawning)
What's wrong with the two of them?
That you haven't had enough sleep?
No, not really...
I remembered a case that happened half a year ago...
Mm?
Half a year ago?
"Half a year ago?"
Tell me something.
What was the license plate number of the mother's car?
I think it was Shinjuku.
Eri's?
Ah...
It was 36-G 87-07.
Eh?
It has G in hiragana alphabet?
Look at it!
A G-87-07!
Ooooh!
That is, "Eqs, what a disgusting woman!"
(uproarious laughter)
Pa... father, please!
"So your 'split' would be a 22-97? I guess..."
But, Conan!
Don't follow the beta!
(Think) "Oh. Did he laugh?"
And the next Conan:
"The Case of the Real Jewelry Store Heist, (part one)".
