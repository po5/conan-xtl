Look at her.
Hi, Eimi!
Oops.
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.
It's just that Eimi also does fencing.
Let's see... And now, which way do we go?
Oh, really?
I didn't know that.
That's good, right?
Don't be an ass.
If we ask, we'll get there sooner.
If we ask, they'll find out right away that we snuck in.
"Sure."
I feel terrible for sneaking in.
And I'll feel terrible if we get lost and end up being late.
-(girl) Sonoko!
- (girl) Sonoko!
(girl) Ah!
(girl) Ah!
Eimi!
(girl) "It's here."
Eimi, what's wrong with you?
Oh, my hair.
Poor girl.
Who did this to you?
She came up behind me and I didn't see her face.
She won't get far.
Be very careful, okay?
"In the end, the culprit wasn't found."
"The years we've spent together are a springboard."
"And we're moving full speed ahead without slowing down."
"The sentimental office of an institute
has received a death threat."
"The truth always comes out in the end."

"Welcome to the Vega Club."
"The first incident took place 3 days ago. The second was yesterday."
"Also, the culprit had sent warning notes."
"The date referred to the day of the incident
and the letters were the initials of the victims."
"The notices appeared in the Vega Club mailbox.
"A sentimental clinic
that Eimi and some classmates had founded in high school."
"They were inspired by the Juliet Club in Italy."
"They only accept handwritten consultations, no emails,
and that's made them very popular with the high school girls."
"This morning, they received a new notice."
"The date was today."
"EC is Eimi Chikada."
"The young woman, who suspected that the notice was addressed to her," said the young woman,
"She has asked for help from the Sonoko,
she met there where she works and they became friends."
I will not forgive her.
The bug and the fake spider are tasteless jokes,
but to cut someone's hair too big, it's aggression!
"He's got a point there."
We should call the police, shouldn't we?
-Not yet, please.
-Wait.
I'll take care of... Eh?
It's just that I just remembered there's another one.
It's from the joker, too?
Let me see it.
What's that?
It's only two hours away.
Today, when the sun sets...
What do we do now, Sonoko?
We can't wait for the police to arrive.
I'll find out the culprit of the warnings and threats
and save the TB, whoever it is.
Ah, no.
Nothing, I'm fine.
Something wrong, Conan?
Aw, come on, then.
We'd better get down to business.
"Now that the warnings are death threats and have a time limit,
"they can no longer be considered mere jokes in bad taste."
"We have not been able to access the data of the students.
"Because of privacy issues,
so we split up and spoke to them directly."
"If the T corresponded to the first name,
it could refer to Tae, Takako, Tamames, Toshiko..."
"There were many options."
"Of surnames beginning with B, on the other hand,
there weren't so many."
"In fact, we immediately found...
"3 girls with the surnames Baba, Bando, and Bito,
but none of them was considered a possible target."
"They didn't even know the Vega Club."
What a mess!
But it's only an hour before sunset!
Poor Eimi...
Sonoko, I think it's about time...
to call the police and ask them to come.
If anything happens, it will be our fault.
"That's true, but... Let's go."
We're back to square one.
"From here I've seen two things that have caught my attention."
"Let's see... Yes."

"The first is a hair that's stuck in the window."
"Could it be that...?"
"Exactly! I knew it."
"The second thing is... that."
They are here.
"The cards of the first and second victims."
"They match."
(Sonoko) Hey, you.
What are you doing, you little brat?
"I've been caught."
This is very ugly, Conan.
You can't read each other's letters.
S-sorry, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean any harm, I wanted to help.
Hey, Eimi.
Who is this Romeo?
"Oh, Romeo. Oh, Romeo. Why are you Romeo?"
What a thrill, he's passed me by.
That's what I expected from Yuto Kariya,
the handsomest and smartest boy in high school.
You have a lot of letters written by women who are pining for you.
But you must find it normal, right?
What do you want?
I just want to know where you were an hour ago.
You snuck into the Club de Vega
and cut this girl's hair, didn't you?
I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about.
But if you want to know...
"It's the same handwriting
as the one in the ads."
Did she go?
Yes, because it is true that I had lost the cutter
and I was afraid to buy another one.
So what?
I waited 5 minutes, but no one came and I came back here.
I don't know anything else.
And you expect me to swallow it, this ball?
You wrote it yourself, didn't you?
To have an alibi.
Think what you want.
I don't care, I have no need to convince you of anything.
Are we done?
I can't waste my time with you.
Studying to get into college?
Are you?
Yes.
That's why I can't dawdle anymore.
I'm in the way, here.
Leave me alone, come on.
You're a pain in the ass.
It's clear to me: he's the guilty one.
This guy can't do more rage.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
This doesn't mean anything.
Who does he think he is?
He's insensitive and selfish, it was him for sure.
Calm down, please.
And you, Eimi?
You have not left any letter to the office addressed to Romeo?
Have I?
I get it.
Victims have one thing in common: Romeo.
I don't write letters.
I'm the person who receives and reads them.
Besides, I...
You never get hung up on that overbearing prick, do you?
Gee, we're out of time.
If we want to find evidence to incriminate him, we have to hurry.
He hasn't listened to me.
Hey, Sonoko, maybe we should look for the TB first, right?
Yes, but since we've already found the culprit,
we'll finish sooner if we take the right one and stop him, right?
Girls, I've been going around for a while.
Anyway...
Are you sure, TB are the initials of the next victim?
What are you getting at, Conan?
What's your point?
Explain yourself.
Listen, Vega's Club is inspired by Juliet's club,
a real Italian love clinic, right?
Eh?
Yes... Why do you ask?
Maybe the letters of the Romanesque alphabet
that appear in the warning notes
are part of the names of the characters in "Romeo and Juliet".
The M and G in the first notice
would correspond to Romeo's family, Montagut.
Therefore, in the second notice,
the C and T would be part of the surname of Juliet's family,
Capulet.
Wow.
And where does a brat like you come up with this stuff?
It's just... I looked it up on the Internet.
Look it up.
Wow.
You may have got it right, Conan.
The love between Romeo and Juliet was always a secret and forbidden love.
Her relatives only wanted to protect the family's reputation.
Of course they did.
Now I understand about...
The rage and punishment of the warnings.
"Now we're doing well."
So, the letters E and C in the third notice...
maybe they're not the initials of the Eimi...
EC, EC... could be another character in the play?
Mmm...
Who are you referring to?
Wait.
Could it be the E and C of Prince Escalus?
He's the prince of Verona who accused Romeo of murder
and banished him.
Look, he explains it very well here.
That's why "justice will be done."
It's true.
I remember.
A friend of Romeo's dies
during a fight between the young men of the two families...
and he kills one of his enemies to take revenge.
Yes, as they say, his friend?
Do you remember?
Mercutio.
Yes.

And the one who dies at the hands of Romeo was...
Tibald!
"Yes. The TB we're looking for."
In short: the threat said "TB will die",
and this obviously means that Romeo will kill Tibald.
You see?
I already told you.
I already told you, that he was the guilty one!
Wait a minute, Sonoko.
But who is the TB?
Well...
We'll only find out if we ask him.
Let's go, let's go!
Wait for me, I'm coming.
He must have gone... to the toilet.
Xxxt!
Excuse me.
His guardian said he wanted to talk to him?
So they say, but he didn't come looking for him personally,
he seems to have sent him an e-mail.
Could it be...?
Do you think it's...?
Yes, he did the same thing as before to fabricate an alibi.
Sonoko, where is the Eimi?
Is it really?
He was supposed to disappear just now?
Now that we finally know for sure who the culprit is?
He always goes his own way.
In Conan has also left.
Hey, Sonoko.
Do you remember what weapon Romeo used to kill Tibald?
Do you?
What did he kill like, you say?
Yes, it was like that.
Fighting with swords, like in a fencing match.
Aaaah!
What is it now?
That I had not fallen!
The Eimi explained to me that he has a special talent for fencing.
"That's why he played the role of Tibald
when they performed 'Romeo and Juliet' at the high school festival."
This can only mean that she is the TB.
Alas, mother.
In Romeo she will try to kill the Eimi.
We have to find her right away.
Eimi!
Eimi!
Not yet.
Have you found her?
Sonoko.
Oh!
What a mess!
Eimi!
Run, Eimi!
Stop.
It can't be.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What is the meaning of this?
I can't believe it.
You have deceived us from the beginning, Eimi?
Have you cheated on us?
You've been using us all along?
Why did you do it?
Now I really don't understand anything.
You owe me an explanation.
Do you hear, Eimi?
Ah!
Aaaah... Aaaaaaaaaah... Inspiration is coming... inspiration is coming.
But... Sonoko!
(Sonoko voice) Let's see.
I'll tell you how it went.
Eimi, remind me why we met at a certain time...
and at a certain place in the school.
You already know.
What?
The Eimi called you to ask you to wait for her there...
and told you to be on time, don't you remember or what?
Sonoko.
"I thought so."
(Sonoko voice) What?
Ah, yes, that's right.
"And then, when we arrived,
you peeked out the window and we saw it attack you."
"Pure chance? No, and now!"
"It was a montage that you had prepared yourself and you wanted to show us."
"It was all part of your comedy."
Eh?
The box cutter, you stole it from Yuto Kariya, in Romeo,
with the intention of framing him.
But if the aggressor had been him, he would have taken it.
That's why you were forced to get rid of it and threw it out of the window.
and threw her out of the window.
"In fact, you planned to use it again later....
and kill two birds with one stone."
"Among the flowers in the flower bed,
Conan found a groove made by a sharp object."
There is only one person
who could have thrown the box cutter through that window.
And that's you, Eimi.
A little while ago you sent an e-mail to Yuto
to leave him without an alibi.
Your plan was to kill yourself and make it look like he killed you.
Really... really?
You wrote the 4 anonymous threats, didn't you, Eimi?
You wanted us to come to the conclusion that the incidents were based
on the characters in the play "Romeo and Juliet".
You invented a set of clues
to camouflage your real goal: to commit suicide.
I don't understand why you want to die, Eimi.
Well, what I don't understand is why you've put me in it,
I have nothing to do with it.
Why did you do it?
It didn't take you long to forget it.
Eh?
Even though it's only been a month, you don't remember.
"I gathered all my strength
and wrote to you to see you and me alone."
"You wrote back and said yes."
"I waited for you for a long time at the place you had chosen."
"A long time."
"Because you had told me you would come."
"But... you didn't show up."
"I figured you'd had an unforeseen event,
something you couldn't tell anyone."
"That's what I wanted to think."
"Until, the other day..."

"You were laughing at me."
"You had a bet about whether I would go to the place where we had arranged to meet
and how long I would wait for you."
"It took me a while to realize what had happened."
"It took me a long time to open my eyes."
"Because... because I...
trusted my Romeo."
Oh, how cruel!
What are you talking about?!
I am not your Romeo and this is not a fairy tale!
You can't be a bigger idiot!
Don't do it, Eimi!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
"Ran!"
And you say you want to die for this jerk, Eimi?
He doesn't deserve to have you spoil
the best years of your life for his death,
let alone commit suicide for him.
Actually, you wanted us to find you out.
That's why you asked me to come.
Deep down, you wanted me to stop you from doing this crazy thing.
Am I wrong?
(Cries)
I'm so sorry.
I am very sorry.
(Mobile)
(Mobile)
Do not suffer.
Do you want to see this?
Your friends are worried about you.
You see?
Even the two victims of your pranks have written to me:
"We don't want poor TB to have it worse than us."
Oh, my God.
They won't forgive me.
If you want to apologize, we'll go with you.
Oi, Sonoko?
Yes, of course...
Of course we'll accompany you, Eimi.
