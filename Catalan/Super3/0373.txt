Today's case is about spiders.
Vertical threads and horizontal threads.

(Genta) Come on!
Afanyeu's-e and let's play soccer.
We'll play after we stop by the library.
It seems that new books arrived yesterday.
I came here because yesterday you told me we'd play soccer.
Hey, say something, Conan.
Well, I feel like reading a little today too, you know?
What's that?
You're the one who suggested we play soccer!
You traitor!
Oops... My God, what a childish thing to do.
xxxt!
(Shinichi voice) Hey, what are you doing?
Let's go, Mr. Detective?
THE TRAP OF THE POISONOUS SPIDERS
Why don't you look to call the professor?
I've got my hands full now.
Why don't you make the call?
-It's not necessary, I'll do it myself.
-Okay, I'll do it.
Listen, it's the lunchtime signal from the factory next door.
It's not on.
Take care of calling him later.
Okay, I'll do it.
All right.
A red-backed spider!
Aaaah!
Watch out!
Genta, don't push me, please!
(call out)
But what is it doing?
Oh, what a pain!
It's that he has disappeared without telling us anything.
It's not fair.
You too, Ayumi?
He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he...
Hey, kids!
What's he doing?
What's he doing?
Mitsuhiko?
You know him?
Yes, he's Mr. Itokawa, who lives next door to me.
He's a professor
who does a research investigation at the university on spiders.
Hey, sir, it's a red-backed spider, isn't it?
Yes, that's right.
Boy, you know a lot.
It's just that a few years ago, they discovered it in Japan and they were talking a lot about it.
Don't you remember?
(All) Oooooh!
See that it has a red back?
Is that why we call it a red-backed spider?
It's a venomous spider
that mostly lives in Australia and Central America.
Oh!
So, is there a poisonous spider in Beika?
No, we have come to this garden to take some pictures of it.
I am a journalist and we work for this magazine.
Next month we will do a special on poisonous spiders.
Do you see it?
-It's my pet.
So, that spider...?
Pet?
I'm a pretty famous person.
They call me "the poisonous spider fanatic".
I have a whole variety of spiders as pets.
Then I have to interview the professor.
Can you call him?
Yes, I'm on it.
Hello, Dr. Shinn, it's me, the Urazaki.
(Man) "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"
What's the problem?
Professor!
"I've been stung! A black widow has bitten me!"
(Think) "What?"
Please inject s serum!
Professor!
The serum!
The serum!
Damn door, it won't open!
The copy of the key...
Professor!
You stay here!
What a disgrace, he's dead.
-It can't be.
The professor is dead?
Why is he dead?
Look!
Everything indicates that he hasn't injected the serum!
No, it can't be.
Mr. Urazaki, hurry, call the police.
Yes...
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Hey, wait a minute!
Miwa, what are you doing?
Look!
It's a poisonous spider!
The one that bit the teacher.
I'm telling you again.
Stop it!
It's already dead.
That spider has a nerve venom a few times more potent
than that of the red-backed spider.
But it's not strong enough to kill a person instantly.
Don't touch it!
We leave everything as it is until the police arrive.
Yes, that's right.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Let me have it for a moment, please.
Hello, should I speak to the police?
Yes.
Yes.
(thinks) "Does this mean she's been bitten here?"
(Thinking) "This means she's been bitten here?
She's not here!

The black widow serum is not here!
We always have it on this shelf and it's not here, it's not here!
Hey, look at this!
Looks like it's escaped over here.
That's strange.
I never forgot to close a terrarium before.
We're not perfect, sometimes we forget things.
This is... Oh!
Kids, don't come in while we're investigating, you hear?
And now, what do you catch him?
We are also witnesses in this case.
If you throw us out you won't be able to solve the case!
The people who had the key to this laboratory
are Professor Shiina and Mr. Itokawa, his assistant?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Urazaki, you knew the professor?
Yes.
The windows and the door were always locked?
Yes, sir.
Because we have all kinds of poisonous spiders here.
That you forgot to lock the terrarium of a poisonous spider is strange.
What are you worried about?
Then keep it up and think about it forever.
I... I've seen it.
Wha... What did you see?
There's a wound on the professor's ear.
As if he wanted to put the telephone receiver in his ear
without knowing the spider was there and then bit it.
But it's strange that a person bitten by a spider...
dies instantly.
Conan, Conan, I told you not to come in!
Oh, just a little...
Look, this medicine is for the heart, right?
Hey, you were having problems with your heart?
Uh... yes.
You did?
I didn't know that.
So, it really was an accident?
Mr. Urazaki, you're the one who called the teacher, right?
Yes, but the Miwa had called him before,
and at that time no one answered, right?
Yes...
Ah, Conan!
Be careful..., be very careful, please.
Yes, I'll call... Kogoro.
"Mr. Urazaki's call is here."
If you want to make a call, I can leave you my cell phone.
No, no, it's no problem.
I've already dialed, don't worry.
Hey, hello, Kogoro?
(Thinking) "It's the same model phone as hers..."
Yes, I'll be a little late at home.
What's up?
Why is that?
"This is no accident!"
Mr. Itokawa, what's wrong?
It's just that... I have to go to an academic conference tomorrow.
I'll have to replace the teacher.
What are you saying?
How can you think of doing a lecture at a time like this?
But it's... it's a very important conference,
and since I have the documentation, even I could do it.
Actually... this was your research paper, wasn't it, Itokawa?
What?
Is this true?
Yes, it is!
The professor has been doing a series of lectures...
about Itokawa's research results, as if they were his own.
-So he stole your assistant's papers, huh?
This means you had a deathly hatred for the professor, right?
Answer, come on.
-What are you insinuating, you bastard?
-Speak for yourself, Mr. Urazaki.
Easy, easy, Mr. Urazaki...
So you also had something against him?
No, not me.
What's he got in here?
Do you mind if we see it?
No, it's nothing.
I repeat, it's nothing!
Then I beg you to let us see it.
Damn it!
These are all exotic species.
They are species that are not found in Japan.
Let's see, what does this mean?
Mr. Urazaki bought the spiders from the professor.
Yes.
Spiders.
"With the excuse that he used them for research,
"The professor would get valuable exotic species from the world."
(Urazaki) "And he was also very cunning."
"He would always choose species he was looking for and m'apujava the price."
So you had reason to detest the professor.
This is crazy, it was an accident.
It is a punishment for having played with my passion for spiders!
In Kogoro says he already knows who the murderer is.
What do you mean?
Conan!
So you were still here?
That's right.
He says it wasn't an accident?
He finds it strange that the black widow's serum is the only one missing.
It's true that everything fits together too well.
If it wasn't an accident...
Mr. Itokawa, you were the only one who had a copy of the key.
Well, yes, I was.

But Mr. Itokawa, just like the others,
heard the teacher's screams, didn't he?
In Kogoro it says that they will introduce the phone very carefully.
Yes, they did.
The handset?
Eh?
There's something shiny there.
What?!
It is evident that there is something
inside the hole at the level of the ear.
It's a needle!
They had put something like that inside the earpiece?!
The tip of the needle is broken!
Conan, what's wrong?
I'm going to the... toilet!
The tip of the needle is broken,
but you wouldn't know it by looking at the outside.
What's stuck in the professor's ear is that needle.
Why did he call that he was bitten by a black widow?
(Phone)
Yes?
Ah, Mr. Mouri!
(Kogoro voice) In Conan explained to me the circumstances of the case.
The murderer has put a black widow
on the tip of the needle of the thumbtack inside the handset.
"Look at the dead spider there with the magnifying glass carefully."
Hey, Takagi...
Excuse me...
Let's see...
That's right!
Hey, Takagi, hurry up...
and tell us all what's going on, come on, come on!
Mouri, where do you want to go?!
Tell us at once!
"In other words, inspector! That's how it went."
"The murderer who put the thumbtack inside the earphone...
"put the spider that had previously died on the tip of the needle...
"To make the professor believe that he had been bitten by a black widow."
"And now comes the subject of the serum."
"The murderer steals the black widow's serum."
"Having done all this,
"Put the phone back in its place and wait for the professor to pick it up."
This is what he said.
Mmmm... This means the professor is dead because....
"Hello, Dr. Shinn, it's me, the Urazaki."
Aaah!
"What's the problem? Professor?"
I've been bitten!
The black widow bit me!
"Please inject the serum! Professor! The serum! The serum!"
It's gone!
The serum is gone!
Okay, Mr. Mouri.
Goodbye, Mr. Mouri.
Detective Mouri says the professor didn't die from the poison.
What does he mean?
Since he was a researcher of poisonous spiders,
he was aware of the danger posed by spider venom
and he went to inject the serum, but he didn't find it.
And seeing that the professor had a bad heart,
it would be difficult for him to get out.
I understand, if the person has a weak heart,
the stress could cause a heart attack.
This means that the murderer is a person...
who can come and go freely in and out of the lab
and that he was aware of the heart condition.
What evidence do you have to say that?
Mr. Mouri told us that we looked at the incoming call log.
At 3/4 and 5 of one, the Urazaki's cell phone.
I made the call.
The professor got on.
When it was 2/4 of 6 in the office of the university secretary.
This is yesterday's record.
You don't understand!
The Yasuda should have called the professor before me.
It was 12 o'clock noon,
because we heard the lunchtime signal at the factory.
Ah, it seems he must have called the wrong number.
May I see your cell phone, please?
Yes, it's true, it's called to another number.
Eh?
This phone is the same as Mr. Itokawa's cell phone.
It's just... a coincidence.
It's just... a coincidence.
At Kogoro she said Mr. Itokawa is protecting her.
What?
He said you two were dating.
Although it's an older model,
it's unusual for him to have the same model phone.
Now I get it!
If the two of you are dating,
Miss Yasuda could make a copy of the Itokawa's key.
"Besides, she knows spiders well,
"Thanks to Mr. Itokawa there is often talking."
"It wouldn't be strange if she knew that the professor had a delicate heart."
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
It's true that we went out together...
But that's not enough reason to suspect her...
Obviously, there is evidence.
For example, the sticker with the blue flower you have in your pocket.
We have seen how you have collected it on the sly from the ground!
Would you mind giving it to me?
Come on, let's go.
Bah, that's the false nail you use, isn't it?
No!
No, it's not!
You... see?

Miss, can you show us the magazine you showed me earlier?
Eh?
Yes...
It's here.
You see it?
Look at it.
Yes, it's true!
This lab got it today, didn't it?
If so, why did Mr. Itokawa try to hide the evidence?
Let's see, answer me, Miss!
"You came here today before the professor arrived, didn't you?"
"Mr. Itokawa realized what he had done.
"And he tried to hide the evidence."
Oh, look at the antenna on that cell phone!
Isn't it full of scratches?
Uh, yeah, now that you mention it...
And there were some scratches on this phone too, weren't there?
Of course there were!
He used the cell phone antenna to break the pin on the handset.
Then, there were the scratches.
- Stop it!
- "Aaaaaaaaaah!"
The professor died
and wanted to make it look like it was an accident.
You made the Urazaki make a call...
so that the Itokawa or yourself wouldn't be suspected.
(Takagi) Why did you do that?
Because every time the professor gave a lecture...
he used the results of the Itokawa's research.
I couldn't stand it anymore.
I just wanted the professor to be hospitalized for a heart attack.
I didn't think things would end up like this... I didn't think so...
Miwa...
But this is an unforgivable crime.
After all, it's taken a person's life.
(Mitsuhiko) After all, that spider was innocent.
Because, up close, you see that it's small and very cute.
(Genta) Yes, you are right.
Conan, you have a spider on your shoulder!
Don't worry, it's not a poisonous spider.
Yes!
It is the one that was in the terrarium of that professor!
What is it?
Do something, please!
Haibara!
He joked.
"Rieu, you laugh. Go laugh."
Ah!
Look, that's the hill, isn't it?
(Ayumi: call)
He probably left them here after the murderer threw him off the cliff.
"Bad lightning, we've lost her!"
(thump)
What were you worried about?
What was that noise?
(Think) "Kudo, don't tell me you...?"
And the next Conan: "The code of stars and tobacco, (1st part)".
