DETECTIVE CONAN
The Alumni Reunion Murder Case, Part 1
Why can't we come, to the alumni reunion?
What do you mean, why?
It's my reunion, isn't it?
Five years ago you let me come.
I can't leave the office without anyone.
What if someone wants to hire me?
If you're not there, we can't accept the assignment, can we?
We'd like to go to the spa, wouldn't we, Conan?
Oh!
Yes, sure...
Aaaaaa... I'll treat you to a good meal, instead of letting you come, eh?
Father, we're not interested, the good food.
Don't talk nonsense!
Lately, domestic trips are more expensive than international ones!
What will it cost us a trip for all 3?
That's why you don't want us?
A robbery!
We've been robbed!
Hey, you!
Hey, you!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Wait-a minute!
Quiet!
You can't run away!
You bastard!
Quiet, don't come closer!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Oysters!
Father, how strong: you've hit the thief!
(laughs) When the brilliant Kogoro Mouri intervenes in any situation, everything is solved, no matter how complicated!
everything is solved no matter how complicated it is!
But, Conan, how could you hit that brick with such force?
(He thinks) "Wow!
I thought that I would shoot it, I shot it hard
and made the pistol jump out of the thief's hand.
Wow!
Is this true?
You saved my father's life?
Eh... I...
Well, the father owes you one.
A trip to a spa to show his appreciation.
Of course he does!
And I'll come to keep an eye on him.
No!
One thing has nothing to do with the other!
(Woman) Mouri!
Gee, Kogoro, what are you doing here?
(woman) Hey!
Yumi?!
Well, what are you doing here?
My office is near here.
I just came from lunch.
You're Miss Horikoshi, aren't you?
Mustn't it be Ran, you? Yes.
How you've changed!
You're coming to the spa, I suppose.
Sure, Father said yes! But what do you say, Ran?
-Well, I'll see you at the spa! -Hey, Yumi, Ran didn't... Hey!
All right, you win.
What a cross!
At your service, detective Mouri, you behaved like a professional!
Thank you very much for your help!
Ah, they don't deserve...
Excuse me, Kogoro,
but shouldn't you pick up the gun that the thief used?
Ah, you're right!
Come on, let's go!
That's strange, I could have sworn that the gun fell here.
And it's not here?
Maybe someone entered the alley and took it away.
What?!
I'll notify headquarters and put out an alert!
(Thinking) "What a mess!"
"We just looked away for a moment!"
"Who did it?"
I love these meals overlooking the train, don't you?
Why do I have to take some children with me to an alumni meeting?
Why does it taste so bad to you?
Five years ago you took me!
It is very different,
you were small and I could not leave you alone.
If Conan hadn't saved you, you wouldn't have been able to go.
So be nicer.
I don't need the help of a little kid to cut down a guy like that.
Kogoro, have they found the missing gun?
That's right, he didn't say anything, the police.
Don't worry, Ran.
These things sometimes happen.
The police are investigating, but they can't find the gun.
and they don't know where to look for it.
It looks to me like it was a Smith and Wesson M439,
but the robber was no great connoisseur of pistols...
He said it cost him money, but he didn't know if it was the real thing.
Well, I hope it was a toy.
(He thinks) "No... the barrel of the gun didn't break, when it fell!"
"If it was expensive and he bought it from gun dealers, it's real."
It's been a long time since we've seen each other, hasn't it?
Oh, so long!
It's been 5 years, since the last meeting.

And that we judokas from Beika University didn't see each other!
Every time I think about it, those hard trainings...
You are not the best one to say it, you almost never trained.
It's true, at Mouri you always skipped classes
with the excuse that geniuses don't need training!
And you were the only one who didn't score in the official tournament.
Well, that was bad luck...
I thought so.
What, Ran?
Whenever you said you were invincible, I always made you up, didn't I?
Hey, Ran!
It's good to see you!
I've already seen you, but see, you're a little woman!
Ah... thank you... thank you...
Well, stop it, where the hell did you guys go?
In the outdoor pool.
But it's for men and women!
Don't suffer, father, there was no one else.
Right, Conan?
And now!
What are you talking about!
Have you bathed together?
And so much.
Conan was so embarrassed
I fought to get him in the pool.
But it was really good, wasn't it?
Is there blood coming out of your nose?
You've been too long?
You mean he's not upset because he's seen you naked?
I don't think so, Conan is a little boy.
(He thinks) "His father will kill me, when he finds out who I am!"
Ah, so this is the boy who lives with you!
He's very snorted. Molt gusto, miss.
My name is Yukio,
and I'm one of the champions of the university's Judo club.
I am Jun Ohmura, the best judo fighter!
I always scored the most points!
I'm the beautiful director of the judo team, Yumi Horikoshi.
My name is Noriko Seikimoto,
also a former judo director and judo idol.
I am the wife of this handsome man!
My name is Nakamichi, I was the captain of the judo team.
I am an inspector of the Chiba police.
Unlike this tawny owl, I have not left the police force.
Flights shut up?!
(Think) "They are all judo champions and judo idols..."
Well, I'm called Beika's Sanshiro in this group,
the detective you all know.
What is this?
An album from the school days?
Yes, I thought we'd enjoy looking at it.
It's rude to interrupt!
Ah... may I see it, Miss Noriko?
Of course, Ran.
You may.
Ah, it's a photo from when we came in second in the city tournament.
-Ah, I remember! -How young...
Come to think of it...
Nakamichi and Yumi were sweethearts, right?
Yes, they were.
How we cried, didn't we, Ohmura?
What do you say!
Yumi was the most beautiful in the judo club, wasn't she?
-Hey, you're my husband now, right? -Yes, yes...
And you two... now isn't he...?
You idiot!
With a man like him?
It's been a long time since we left him!
-Besides, in Kazushi he has promise. -Oooooooh!
Hey, hey, hey...
Is it true, that, Nakamichi, will you get married?
What are you saying now?
Aaaa... I wanted to announce it more formally,
but we'll probably get married within a year.
Who is it, the lucky girl?
The daughter of my head... we met 6 months ago.
I'll introduce her to you next time.
Ah... I, on the other hand, the former queen of the judo club...
I'm still single...
To put it in order,
my company is not doing well and maybe I'll be fired.
Seriously... I have a death wish.
(All) Eh?
It was just a joke, you guys don't have to worry.
Geez, Yumi!
Don't give us these scares!
Now the only singles in the team will be me and Ohmura.
Maybe we should get married, don't you think?
Eh?
Ah... but...
Donkey!
Don't believe it, man!
It was just a joke, that's all!
Look at this picture.
It's from when you came to the spa 5 years ago?
See, I'm also in it, here!
Ah, yes!
It was in the ping-pong room.
That's right!
-What if we played ping-pong? -Good idea!
But Yukio, didn't we have to go to see the fireworks?
Don't worry, the fireworks start at 2/4 of 7.
If we fold before 6, we'll get there in plenty.
I'm not coming.
I'm a bit tired.
I'll go to the room to rest.
You haven't changed a bit, Yumi.
He always goes to his own.
He just doesn't like crowds.
At the spa, you should play ping-pong!
Yes, but my arm is already rusty.
It would be very serious for a physical education teacher to lose a game.
Take it!
-Bravo!

Another point! -We haven't finished yet!
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm going to the bathroom.
Now it's your turn.
Don't dawdle.
Hey...
weren't you a singles champion in the national ping-pong tournament?
Yes, when I was a junior at the university.
And besides, he was the best judo player in college.
No, there was a guy stronger than me...
and I never managed to win.
He'd be really strong, wouldn't he?
Ran, honey, you know him too.
It's here at the spa.
What's he saying now?
But who is it?
Aaaaaaaaaah!
This is called foul play!
He has won in Yukio.
Are you okay, Jun?
You went too fast...
Aaaa... not so much...
-Let's see if the parents.
Also-Has, queen.
Come on, should this comedy last much longer?
It's late.
Shall we go?
Oh, man!
It's after 6:00!
Oh!
How are we!
We've got to go see the fireworks.
(Kogoro) Come on.
(Kogoro) Let's go!
(Kogoro) Hurry up!
I'll bring back the net and the paddles.
Go pulling and save room.
Well, let's go pulling.
We forgot to wake Yumi!
Let her be!
Soon the fires will start!
Someone must have woken her up.
If everyone has forgotten, so what?
I'll look into it.
I'm coming too! Hey, come!
Boy, you guys, you're so annoying... Let her be.
Wow!
They've already started.
Let's go to wake her up.
Room 201. This is it.
Yumi, are you here?
Yumi, wake up!
The fireworks have started!
I'll open the door and come in, understand?
Eh?
Ran, Conan, what are you doing here?
Mr. Nakamichi!
You haven't left yet?
We've come to wake up Yumi, but...
Ah, that's not necessary, guys, leave her alone.
She's in a bad mood, when they wake her up.
What are you doing here?
Well, look, I got all sweaty and went to take a bath.
Now I heard your slides
and I was surprised because we are the only customers.
Are you two still here, too?
But what about you, huh?
Well, you stayed for a bath too, didn't you, Kazushi?
Yes, but I went to the covered baths, unlike you.
Lucky you didn't wake him up.
He has such a bad temper, when he wakes up.
It's better if he sleeps.
(Yukio) But if we don't wake her up, she'll be furious too.
Yumi is like that.
-Oooooooh! -Check it out, check it out!
How beautiful!
What a crowd, isn't it?
Conan, don't let go.
Hey, Ran!
Here Ran, here!
Just the two of you?
But they were with us a moment ago.
We must have lost them in the middle of this crowd...
Don't worry, Kogoro, I'll look for them.
Hey, Ohmura!
Wait, wait!
Gee, what a busy meeting, father.
You can say that again.
What a nerve!
The Ohmura and I saved room for you and you don't see!
You're both a bunch of jerks!
I'm sorry about that.
And you too, Ohmura!
You go to look for them and then you don't come back!
I got lost and couldn't find them.
Let's have a sake and let it go.
And you, go too much on your own!
Still not up yet, Yumi?
Now that you mention it, you're right, Conan.
He should have taken off by now.
He must be in a bad mood because he hasn't seen the fires.
My goodness!
Wow, what a group!
We'll have no choice...
We'll have to go wake up the queen of our judo club.
Come on, yes!
Let's go, let's go!
Is it wise to go, all of us, to wake up that spoiled brat?
Don't tell her this...
Hey, Yumi!
It's dinner time!
Yumi!
How strange...
Do you sleep though, Yumi?
I turn on the light.
Yumi!
Don't touch it!
The only ones who can go in are me and Mouri!
Ran!
Go call the police!
Eh?
Hurry up!
Yes!
Yumi, Yumi...
She's dead.
She has a gunshot wound to the temple.
A gun in her right hand...
Geez Kogoro!
Isn't this the gun that the bank robber was carrying?
What are you talking about?!
It's also a Smith and Wesson M439!
And it has a crack in the barrel!
And besides, Yumi was there when the robbery took place!
Kogoro, what are you doing here?
Yumi?!
And you, what are you doing here, huh?
My office is near here.
I just came from lunch.
Yumi has taken the gun
with the intention of using it to commit suicide.

He came to the meeting with the idea of committing suicide.
-What are you saying?
Why?
It is too early to say.
We're waiting for the police to arrive.
Yes... sure, you're right.
Yumi... but why?
Why did you have to die?
It will take two hours for the police to get here?!
Yes, because there are parties going on and the roads are jammed.
How can we wait so long?
We'll have to examine the corpse ourselves.
Yes.
Have any of you brought a camera?
-I've taken one. -Let me have it!
I'll get it.
I didn't imagine we'd examine Yumi's body.
Neither did I.
Mouri, look at the state of the body.
Let's see...
Rigor mortis already affects her feet.
Well, she's been dead for a while.
Let's look at the other points.
Yes, but having lost so much blood, we won't get anything.
What's that?
Hey, look, Yumi wasn't wearing any underwear!
-What the hell is the meaning of this?
-That's strange...
It's not the only strange thing.
What's that?
Yumi is wearing the fat kimono, the men's one.
When she was downstairs, she was wearing the smaller one.
The index finger of the hand that holds the gun is missing the trigger.
And the most suspicious thing is the boss.
See?
Childish pussy!
How should I tell you to stay out of the investigations!
Father, have you found out anything?
However rigor mortis has evolved,
she's been dead for about 7 hours.
This means that she must have died around 3 o'clock.
Yes, when we separated to go play.
She must have gone to her room
and must have shot herself in the head with the gun.
It's a suicide...
How could it be?
Why would he kill himself?
Come to think of it... he said...
Seriously, I feel like dying.
She must have been very depressed...
and she must have killed herself.

DETECTIVE CONAN
Kogoro, exactly how did Yumi shoot it?
What a thing to say, Conan! But how?!
It's obvious, isn't it?
He's put the gun to his head and then...
Hey, hey, hey, Mouri!
Hey, hey, Mouri!
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
Mouri!
Nakamichi, when you commit suicide with a gun,
you put the gun near your head, right?
Then this wound is not normal at all.
There's no burn mark!
Yes, exactly.
When a gun is fired, in addition to the bullet, hot air comes out.
If you put the gun to your head and shoot,
there are burn marks!
And if there are no marks...
You mean someone must have shot it?!
That's right.
He murdered her and made it look like a suicide.
Someone from the spa!
Jun, sing!
What are you hiding from us?!
I saw it...
What did you see, the murderer?
I saw, Yumi, by the second floor window!
I will paste the murderer who has killed Yumi!
(Think) "I know how he did it, the murderer!"
Yumi's killer is you!
In the next episode...
The murder case of the alumni meeting, part two...
