DETECTIVE CONAN
The case of the murdered actress
You are the father's teacher?
That blessed Kogoro always made a mess of everything.
He always had to pull his chestnuts out of the fire.
Then you must be Heihachiro Shiota, right?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
When they talk about the Japanese Sherlock Holmes, they mean me.
(Think) "On Heihachiro Shiota?! That famous private detective?"
In Kogoro he is doing very well and I come to see him.
The father has gone to solve a case.
Someone is blackmailing a famous theater group.
Blackmail, you say?!
Porta-me please, beautiful!
Yes, okay.
(Thinking) "Wow, this could be hilarious!"
"I'll see a famous detective in action!"
(Man) Higher, higher!
To the left!
"Cancel the performance. Otherwise, there will be a tragedy."
-Do you know who it might be? -Of course not.
Where has she gone, the Shoko!?
When can we start?!
She's not in the mood to go out.
Just because she's famous doesn't mean she's going to be in a mood to go out!
It must be a joke, but everyone is nervous.
So continue this investigation.
But be very discreet, people in the know!
What do you think...
So this is the letter.
What are you doing here?
Heihachiro Shiota wanted to come.
Who is it?
That old jerk!
Where... where is he?
He's disappeared so we've arrived.
Disappeared?
(Girl's scream)
Aparteu's-e!
Oops!
Heihachiro!
What the hell are you doing here?
This man wanted to grope me!
Can't you see I don't have long to live, pretty girl?
(Thinking) "Look at him. What a pervert."
Shoko, what's wrong?
What's wrong with you?
I can't take it anymore!
I hate you!
I don't know why he's giving me orders, this lousy director!
Besides, the main character is my ex-boyfriend!
This is unbearable!
Shoko!
The bad actress gets dramatic.
You show up unannounced, and on top of that, you're in my way!
This actress has very little experience.
The ass is a compendium of life.
With a single touch I know what kind of life a person leads!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
How dare you!
Father!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
What a temper he has!
(thinks) "You mean he's the famous detective?"
What are you doing?
We call it the "bamiru".
They mark the actors' positions on the stage.
They should be marked on the stage so that they are well lit.
What a job, preparing a play.
(Man) What's wrong?!
Don't tell me what I have to do!
You know that last week,
a spotlight almost fell on Shoko.
Is this an accusation?
What a view that is, from here!
Fuck!
Check it out for yourself.
Do what you want!
Thanks a lot, little one.
They want to assassinate the Shoko? There's been an attempt.
You shouldn't be up here, it's dangerous.
(Think) "The blackmailer is after the Shoko."
I'll be damned if I'm going to hell.
I'll never leave you.
(Shoko) Wherever you go, I'll follow you.
(Actor) Our love will be a love from the stars.
(Shoko) What garbage.
They should have done a play by Shiji Kunisada.
You will die with me, won't you, my dear?
As long as we're together, I'm not afraid.
(Thinking) "What a hackneyed phrase."
Shoko, you've done very well!
It's very realistic!
Of course it was.
It looked like the real thing.
I even got excited.
Hey, Shoko.
Shoko.
What's the matter with you?
Come on, you're exaggerating.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
She's dead!
Nobody move!
(Think) "It has passed in front of my face!"
Central, do you hear me?
The skin is bluish, and look at these spots.
Everything indicates that...
That she's been poisoned with cyanide.
Oi, Inspector Megure?
Heihachiro!
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry to talk so much about you.
I came to see if you're doing well.

Well, but you're retired now, right?
Well, no spoonful of goals!
Well, you've got a bit of a nerve, haven't you, Megure?
But who helped you
when they wanted to disqualify you for having let a murderer escape?
Well, now...
I even solved a locked room murder.
Inspector, don't suffer.
I know who it is, the murderer.
If Heihachiro solves this case, I'll have to hear it a thousand times!
Well, I think I'll watch it from here from now on.
The murderer is the one who put the poison on the paper...
It's you, Mr. Uta!
This is ridiculous!
I had no reason to kill her!
Of course you didn't.
You used to date her, didn't you, Yuichi?
But the Shoko had become famous, and it hurt you.
What about you?!
We fought every day, at work!
We'd fight, but it was just to make a bit of a scene.
That's what you say!
(Think) "If you take cyanide, death is almost instantaneous!"
"The Shoko has taken the powders and drank water,
but nothing happened!"
"There was no poison, the little package!"
Very well.
I'll prove to you that this is not poison!
-It is... -No!
(At the same time) What does it do?!
You see?
Kogoro!
"How did he, the assassin, administer the poison in the Shoko?"
"The trial lasted 40 minutes."
"If he had taken a capsule before the trial,
it would have taken 15 minutes to dissolve."
"And the thing wouldn't have worked,
for the effects of cyanide are immediate."
The bad actress gets dramatic!
"She has brought the water and the glasses."
"Isn't it here?"
What do you plan to do?
Come on!
Although you haven't guessed?
That you already know who the murderer is?
What is obvious is that it must be a woman.
It was a woman who brought the water to the scene.
How could I not have noticed!
The poison would be the vase!
What the hell is she doing?!
No, nothing!
I came to order that, nothing else.
What do you have, hidden here?
Let me see it!
Be still!
What are you accusing me of?
I am innocent.
Nobody touch anything until the case is solved!
What's this?
Look, Kogoro!
They've made the blackmail letter out of this paper.
You're always meddling in my investigations.
Don't be so hasty;
it's not that simple!
You can see the pen marks.
Gee, you're right!
Thanks to you, this case has been solved.
How did you know it was a woman, sir?
Because of a saying: "Behind every crime there is a woman".
(Thinking) "Are you kidding?"
Inspector.
What is it, Agent Takagi?
Bad news.
We didn't find the poison.
That's what I was trying to tell you!
I wrote those letters, but I didn't kill Shoko!
You didn't?
It made you angry, when we gave the leading role in the Shoko.
That's logical, Katsuo!
But you said you'd like to see her dead!
I'm the one who loses, if the play is cancelled.
Please don't be alarmed! Inspector!
There was poison in the victim's water,
but there was none in the jug.
It was you, eh?
No!
What a dumb detective!
Mr. Tateoka, you gave her the glasses for her to carry.
That's right!
Yes, you're right!
Mr. Tateoka gave me the glasses!
Yes, that's true, but I didn't poison Shoko!
The Shoko told me to send you away.
Why would she tell me that?
Hitomi Sasaki, you were her manager.
Do you know that?
Well... she told me that Mr. Tateoka was a "go-to guy".
Tateoka was a voyeur.
And he had a grudge against her for it!
He's not the killer.
Why not?
Because he's not a woman, is he?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
You're very clever.
(Thinks) "Why do you say it's so obvious?"
"I don't see it so obvious!"
"It seems that it can't be, that in Tateoka the Shoko died."
"The glasses were the same."
"If the waitress has decided which glass she gave to the Shoko,
there was only a 50% chance that it would turn out well!"
Come on, confess!
You'll take a load off your mind!
I'm telling the truth!
It wasn't me!
I just wanted to scare you and I had prepared...
I had prepared... the curtain!
I had prepared the curtain?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Father!

(Kogoro) I'm staying here!
No need, Kogoro.
Why do you think I'm here, me?
As a teacher, I must finish what you have started.
Don't suffer.
I'll solve this case.
No, you won't!
You always get the medals.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Quick, take him to the hospital!
(Think) "How could the murderer make Shoko drink the poison?"
"He didn't throw it into the glass, nor was it in the water."
"He must have poured it into the water before she drank it."
Gee, you look good, man.
You look like a better detective than Kogoro.
How did the assassin get the poison into the Shoko?
That's a good question.
I guess only God... knows the answer.
Never underestimate the power of God.
Have you heard of the novel "The Spider's Web"?
Yes, it's Ryunosuke Akutagawa's.
Always keep this in mind, my boy.
Buddha sees everything, the good and the bad.
Look at you.
You're a miserable bunch.
Junichi, you wanted to boycott my play?!
Just like you to hire that untalented actress!
What are you saying?!
Look how they fight, these fools.
They don't realize that they're exposing their stupidity, do they.
They're like the fools who destroyed
Buddha's web of compassion.
(Think) "What s'empatolla ?!"
"Our problem is to find the murderer."
"Eh ?! A spider's web?"
"That star is making a bad spine."
"Look at it!"
"It's right above the table!"
"A cut fishing line?"
"It was wrapped around the star's wire."
"I've got it. It's this one, the spider's web!"
"Anyone could have poisoned the Shoko's drink, like this!"
Was it Mr. Tateoka's responsibility to give the water to the waitress?
(Girl) No.
It wasn't a job that was assigned to anyone.
"I already know who the murderer is."
"What shall I do? In Kogoro he's not here."
"I've got it! I have the right person!"
"Legendary detective, I'm counting on you."
Eh?
What's the matter?
Is it nap time?
Mr. Tateoka, come with us to headquarters and tell us about it.
(Heihachiro voice) It seems to me that we have all the actors gathered here.
It's about time for the real star of the show...
to make an appearance.
The star who directed this production!
You mean the killer is someone else?
That's right, Megure!
The killer has been waiting for the right moment!
When everyone was concentrating on the couple on stage,
the killer waited for the climax of the love scene to arrive.
Wouldn't we all have seen it, if the murderer had done it then?
At another time, perhaps we would have.
But the spotlight only illuminated the couple,
and everything was dark around them.
The murderer had planned everything very well!
But it was impossible to approach the table without anyone seeing him.
There was no "nucessitat" to approach the table.
"Nucessitat"?
What does it mean?
Ah... S-sorry, I meant "necessity"!
Sometimes, when someone is concentrating,
there are things that go unnoticed.
Especially if the thing comes from above!
Poisoned from above?
Yes, it's a good idea, but it would be impossible!
If you threw it from above,
you would feel noise when it fell into the water!
Besides, it's impossible to hit a glass!
(Heihachiro voice) He-he-he-he-he!
That's funny!
You have no imagination, Mr. Director.
Do you know Ryunosuke Akutagawa's book "The Spider's Web"?
The one in which Buddha throws a spider's web to the thieves in hell
to save them from the clouds?
Sure, a thread!
Exactly, Megure.
And now look at the stars on the ceiling.
See the one that is wrong?
The fishing line that has been used to commit the crime
is wrapped around it.
There is a weight at the end of that line.
If he looks, he will find poison.
The murderer has used the guiding star
to lower the poison-coated weight and dipped it into the glass.
Then he stretched it upwards again.
I was not up there, then!
This proves my innocence.
Oi, Inspector?
No!
To use this method, you didn't have to be up there.
Then how did you do it?
It's very easy.
Let's see, wasn't the position of the cup predetermined?
You call it the "bamiru".

It could be controlled from the sides.
By passing the fishing line through the ceiling,
and pulling it down the star's cable to the glass.
But when he pulled it down, it got tangled to the star.
And what's left on the ceiling: the fishing line entangled to the star.
And the murderer?
Who committed this murder?
He will find the answer when everyone will show him their hands!
The hands? What s'empatolla, this man?
This is ridiculous!
I do not want to waste more time, me!
Come on, be quiet and be attentive.
The culprit will not be able to open his hands!
Aaaa... Are you sure?
Okay, you heard him, show your hands!
What nonsense!
Very good.
Look at your hands, don't leave your head.
Oooooh?
Miss Hitomi Sasaki, what's wrong with you?
Come on, let's go.
Show me your hands.
How did you get this mark?
It's very obvious, gentlemen: by pulling the hooked thread.
You got scared, didn't you?
Right after the murder
Kogoro told everyone not to move from where he was.
Although he should have a piece of thread in his pocket.
You were his manager!
Did you do it so I'd leave you to go with her?
No, Yuichi.
I was over our breakup, and I didn't hold a grudge.
But then...
I don't go out with Yuichi anymore.
He's as boring and ignorant as I imagined.
I'll give him to you.
Why don't you two get bored together?
I couldn't forgive her for wanting to play with us!
She just wanted to take me!
Hitomi...
Congratulations, Heihachiro.
Eh?
I'd heard about you,
the sleepy air you and Mouri have when you work.
Ha-ha-ha!
At Mouri you've copied my style.
It's a case!
(He thinks) "They're a pair of snobs. What a cross!"

DETECTIVE CONAN
Come on, father, you don't want to run.
Are you all right?
What's this? What do you think?
What's the meaning of this?
Heihachiro!
Ouch!
It's obvious, isn't it, dear disciple?
I'll take care of your research for a while.
You won't have to suffer for nothing, Kogoro.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Heihachiro!
Hello, queen!
You said you were going sightseeing, but you were supposed to be with another woman!
Another woman?!
No, queen!
You're the only woman I love!
The only woman in the world for me!
Who are you kidding?
We'll talk!
Let's go home!
(thinks) "In Kogoro he's a womanizer. He must have learned it from his master."
"In Yusaka, my father had not made it public."
"But someone uses the name 'Night Baron'."
My father is a detective.
Yes he is famous, the father, isn't he?
The "Night Baron"?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
In the next episode...
The mystery of the murder of the night baron, part one...
