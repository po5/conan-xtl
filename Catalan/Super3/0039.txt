DETECTIVE CONAN
The Case of the Murdered Heiress, Part 1
(At the same time) To many years, Reika!
-Congratulations! -For many years!
-Congratulations! -Very good!
-To many years!
For many years, Reika, may you be very happy.
Thank you very much, father.
I am very grateful to you
for coming to share this important day.
And I also wish you continued support,
my daughter and the company, the Yotsui Group!
Don't be a pig, Father!
Shame on you.
(Think) "Eat, this doesn't happen every day!"
There's nothing like a good wine!
But, before we start the celebration,
I would like to introduce our special guest.
The very famous detective Kogoro Mouri!
Will you guys give me a little bit of a hand job?
I would like to take me home.
I'd hate to be thrown away.
Mr. Mouri!
Say.
-It's the famous detective! -The best detective of the century!
Yes, yes, thank you, thank you.
Mr. Mouri the other day helped my dear daughter.
A simple job...
Oh, my goodness!
What did you do, father?
Ha-ha!
On the face of it, it had its complications.
(thinks) "Complication?"
It's all been explained to me!
He spotted Bubble, Miss Reika's little dog.
Allow me to introduce myself, sir.
My name is... Takashi Ichieda.
It's a great honor to meet such a good detective like you.
Ah, don't exaggerate...
No, Takashi is right.
With those piercing eyes,
anyone would confess to committing a crime.
Miss Reika chose the best detective.
Come on, you guys, don't be such a bigot.
Ta... Takuya.
It seems to me that he just wants to look good to Reika,
because I think the detective looks like an ordinary man.
-What are you saying?!
-How dare you?
(Boy) Yes.
(Boy) You are right.
Hey, you agree with me, right?
Man, yeah...
I was really looking forward to meeting you, but it's not how I had imagined it.
How dare you insult me!
This youth knows nothing.
Don't you know that those who have real talent never show it?
An experienced detective always pretends to be harmless.
It's a technique they use because we let our guard down.
Is that so, Mr. Mouri?
(Thinking) "A technique, huh?"
Miss Reika had a lot of eyesight.
And so much.
She's very smart.
And besides, she's pretty and refined.
What kind of man will he be, what will steal her heart?
Mmm, whoever he is, he'll be a lucky man.
Because he will automatically become
the future world president of Yotsui Products.
(Thinking) "Where... where is it, the sink?"
"Why is it so dark, the aisle, why don't they turn on the lights?"
(Adult voice) This is a storage room.
This is the bathroom.
The toilet!
I've already found it!
(Adult voice) Oops.
It won't turn on.
Kid, what are you doing?
Well, I was looking for the toilet...
The lamp in this toilet doesn't work.
Go to the one on the other side.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
That's strange.
No light comes on at all.
Not the ones in the hallway, not the one in the toilet, not the one in the bathroom.
Didn't we change the bulbs?
(Man) Mr. Yotsui!
Miss Reika's car has flat tires.
-What do you say?! - What will I do now?
I guess I'll have to take my Ferrari.
-No, come with my Porsche. My Mercedes Benz is better.
Excuse me...
The wheels on these cars are flat too.
-What? -What?
Oh, shit!
Holy shit!
I've also had my tires blown out.
And my too.
Who else has flat tires?
The father's rental car is intact.
Well, well, there are 6 cars with flat tires.
You'll have to split up among the other guests' cars.
No way!
Father, today is my birthday.

I refuse to go with a stranger's car.
Come on, Reika...
I'll stay at home with Yone.
You'll pick me up tomorrow.
Well, I'll stay too, Reika.
-And me too.
-Me too!
I'll have to stay here to protect her from these rascals, sir.
Thank you very much, I'll be calmer knowing that you're staying.
-Take good care of the daughter, Masashi. And so much, sir.
Come on, we'd better go in, Reika.
They're fools.
They don't know that it's been two years since it's been decided who will be their husband.
Have they already left?
Very well, so are we.
Not until I've passed you the monkey, no.
You're right.
Stay a little longer and tell us about some famous case.
That's a good idea.
What if we had a card game?
Come on, let's have some fun.
I can't take it.
Mr. Detective, I'll drive.
Let me have your car keys, please.
Leaving already, Takuya?
Boy, what a pity.
You're one of the candidates to be my future husband.
I'm sorry to tell you,
but I only came here to make nice with your father,
so he'll continue doing business with our company.
You're not my type, Reika.
-No, Takuya, don't. Let him go.
Yuji's right, with one less rival we have a better chance.
You see how they are, this group, Mr. Detective.
The keys, please.
Ah, you have...
-Why did you do that?
-Takuya, go away!
But because of you,
we'll cut off business relations with your company.
Don't do it to me!
-Yone, I'm going upstairs to change! -Yes, Miss.
You're like birds in a cage.
You'll all die if I don't feed you.
Your business depends on me.
I suggest you all try something to make me happy.
And you were all from the same yacht club?
We used to sail to an island with Miss Reika's yacht.
We had a lot of fun then.
-Yes, of course we did.
Until two years ago, there was the accident.
An accident?
-Well, it's a long time ago, from there. -We swore we wouldn't talk anymore.
What's taking Reika so long to come back from the room?
-I hope she's all right.
-I don't care!
I'm fed up with her airs of superiority!
Anyway, it's true that it takes too long.
Right, Masashi?
He's right, guys.
Yone, could you go see if there's anything wrong with him?
Yes, sir.
I'll see if I can find her too.
-I'll go with you. -Me too.
I'm coming too.
-Miss Reika!
-Answer, if you can hear us!
Strange, we haven't found her anywhere.
What if she went into the forest and got lost?
Now we'll all have to go to the forest to see if we can find her.
Wow!
What a way to complicate our lives!
Reika!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Reikaaaa!
Reikaaaaa!
Shit!
Where the hell has she gone, this girl?!
Wow, now it's raining.
What do we do?
For now, we'll have to run back to the house.
Eh?
Isn't it Yuji's?
Hey, boy, boy!
Who would think of sleeping here?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Hey, Yuji!
Wake up!
It's no use... Yuji is dead.
But what does it say?!
To begin with, I'd say he drowned.
Someone must have held his head in the fountain.
-Come on, don't talk nonsense.
-Yoji was alive a moment ago.
Yes, that's right!
It wasn't long ago that he was killed.
And it must have been someone who was hanging around here.
Who could have done something like that?
What is clear is that there is a very suspicious person.
The Reika, who happens not to have shown up yet.
Miss Reika would be incapable of doing that.
We don't know that, ma'am.
Unfortunately, she might as well be dead.
Now we have to call the police.
We'll talk later.
(Yone) What?!
There's no line?
No, no phone, father.
-What's going on here? -Did the killer cut him off?
We'll call on my cell phone.
There's no reception here.
We won't be able to call.
Well, we'll have to take the detective's car.
Yes.
Someone would have to take the car and go call the police.
I just went to check it out.
Gentlemen, I've had my tires blown out of my car.

All this means is...
there's someone who wants us to be stuck here tonight.
What a bummer!
We'll have to wait until tomorrow, when they come to pick us up.
Mrs. Yone, will you make us a coffee, please?
Yes.
I'll help you, father!
What?
Hey, Takuya, where are you going?
To the washroom.
-I'm going too. -Me too.
In the meantime, I'm going to get some towels.
-We all got wet in the rain. Thank you very much.
You know this house very well, don't you, sir?
It's true, my boy.
We used to come here very often, before.
And now!
How strange.
What is it, Mrs. Yone?
Well, I can't find the sugar.
Could you see if it's in the cupboards upstairs?
Right away.
Let's see...
It's not here.
Ah, I got it!
I didn't remember, I bought a lot 5 years ago.
(Thinking) "Let's see if it's gone."
Can you tell me what accident you had, two years ago?
Eh?
Donkey!
This has nothing to do with this case.
But Yuji said
that Reika's future husband was decided two years ago.
What are you saying now?
Maybe it has something to do with what's going on here today!
Yes, you'd better explain it to us.
Come on, tell me how it was, this accident.
It was a very unfortunate accident.
There was a storm.
On that fateful day two years ago,
we had the yacht anchored near a small island.
No one knew there was a big storm coming.
"When it started to rain and lightning started,
most of us took shelter on the yacht."
"But Yuji, who was fishing, and Miss Reika did not return."
"The island was very small,
and when the tide comes in, it's completely flooded."
"It was inevitable:
someone had to take a lifeboat to go rescue them."
"After 12 hours, they were rescued."
"They were wearing the life jacket and they were saved."
"But the person who went to look for them disappeared."
Unfortunately, she was found drowned after 3 days.
Excuse me, but who was she, the person who drowned?
Well, it was Yaeko, my granddaughter.
Mrs. Yone...
My granddaughter lost her life trying to save the lady.
I'm sure Yaeko won't regret it.
Coffee is ready.
Thank you very much.
Changing the subject...
Now we have to find Miss Reika!
We'll split into two groups and search the house again.
We can't rule out that the killer is around here,
so make sure no one is left alone.
He's right.
If we keep an eye on each other, our lives won't be in danger.
Then prenguem's-e coffee and posem's in it.
What's the matter with you?
It's still early.
I'm sorry, but I'm falling asleep.
All this fright must have tired you out.
Come on, stretch out on the couch for a while.
I'll keep you company.
(Takuya) -Did you find him?
-No.
(Kogoro) And you?
No.
We haven't found it anywhere.
Where could it be?
Miss Reika!
(Thinking) "Come on..."
Very well.
What, shall we continue?
-Miss Reika? -Where the hell has she gone?!
(Thinking) Yaeko...
Well, she's not here.
She's not here either.
We've searched the whole second floor and there's no trace of her.
She must have gone into the forest.
Something must have happened, upstairs.
-Where is it, the main switch? -Behind the kitchen.
-Behind the kitchen.
(Tinkerbell)
(Thinking) "What was that noise? It's coming from nearby."
Who turned off the power?!
Hey, we... we just got here too.
(Kogoro) It was the murderer!
Since we've started the investigation,
the murderer must have realized that we could find out,
and has cut the light in order to escape.
Through this window!
(Kogoro) Damn you!
-You won't escape! -Hey, Takuya!
Hell no!
Come on, we have to chase!
Where did they go, those guys?
Aaaa... Detective, many people get lost in these woods.
But Mrs. Yone, what are you doing here?
They all ran away like crazy, and I followed them.
(Thinking) "Hey, wait a minute. The Ran is alone, now?"
Who... Who's carrying me?
Do I feel water?
Raaaaaan!
Raaaaaan!
Hey, Ran!
Wake up!
Ran!
Ran!
Shinichi!
What happened to you, Ran, say?
Someone tried to drown me.
But I'm so happy,

because Shinichi has come to my rescue.
Ran!
Hey, Ran!
(Thinking) "Phew, you're asleep."
"Don't give me these scares."
"But it's strange..."
"An experience like this would wake anyone up."
"What if a sleeping pill was thrown into the coffee?"
"But I don't know who it might have been."
"Eh?"
"In Kogoro he had left it open."
"It's hot. Why?"
That someone has tried to kill Ran?!
It seems to me that they've given her something to put her to sleep.
A... a sleeping pill?
We had coffee earlier.
That would be the coffee.
Couldn't it be that Ran and Yone didn't prepare it?
Listen, detective, it wasn't me...
Besides, you were in the forest with us, so it wasn't...
It couldn't have been you either, ma'am.
I don't understand that they attacked the Ran, who came here casually.
It could be that it was an assassin who had no specific motive.
Isn't it true that you were here with the Ran when the lights went out?
Yes, I was.
Did anything strange happen?
Let me think...
I noticed a warm air when the lights went out.
But other than that...
(thinks) "A hot air!"
"What if it was the air conditioning?"
"Two-thirty, it's programmed at blackout time."
"The remote controls are set at half past twelve."
"I get it."
"I know how he caused the blackout, the killer."
"So..."
"The killer is someone in the house!"
Don't leave, it's dangerous!
Don't lock yourself in the room!
Takuya, he's right!
In 3 hours they'll come to pick us up by car.
Shut up!
Takashi, the killer could be someone from this group!
I don't want to stay!
Gentlemen, I'll retire too.
But it's safer if we all stay here together.
All right, it's already 7 o'clock.
Excuse me, I have to go to the toilet.
-I'm coming too.
-I'm coming too.
(TV) Now, gentlemen viewers, the weather forecast.
Yes they are late, those 3. What do you want to do.
There are 3, it's normal.
What do you want to do.
Oh, my goodness!
Where did it come from, the coffee?
Mrs. Yone prepared it while I was in the bathroom.
It will help us wake up.
Come on, there's no sleeping pill!
Aaaah!
Like cream! Aaaah!
Like cream!
Sorry, Mr. Mouri.
I have to wash the stain before it dries.

The two murders have been committed with the same system.
Did you do it?
No, I didn't do anything.
I'm about to solve the mystery!
Takuya, it was you, wasn't it?
Don't talk nonsense!
You're as suspicious as we are!
The only person capable of committing these crimes is you!
