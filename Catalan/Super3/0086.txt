"My deductions are your medicine."
"The Conan you will see from today will have a special touch."
"He is... Detective Conan!"

DETECTIVE CONAN
"The kidnapping case"
(Think) "When the opponent lets his guard down...
...I'll kick him twice from the waist up and he'll be mine."
(Think) "On days when the Ran has a karate match,
you have to be on your toes."
Do you feel me?
You better come cheer me up!
What a ?!
Aaa... yes.
After school I'll come to cheer you up.
Of course you will!
With the opponent I have today, I can't lose the match!
Whatever happens, you'll come.
But if you don't come...
Iaaaaaaaaah!
(Think) "What a wild scream!"
(Loud thumps)
(Thinks) "Wow, it's from the works."
Well, Conan!
Eh?
Yes.
I'm off.
See you at 4!
I have to hurry!
If I don't save myself I'll inventory that terrifying "USHIRO mawashi geri"!
(Genta) Conan! What a voice!
What do you want?
(Think) "I'm trapped!"
Look at this thing!
It's a fat band receiver!
No.
It's a wideband receiver!
If it's the same thing, isn't it?!
What does it do?
With it you can feel the radio from cabs
or conversations of people talking through cordless phones.
Well it looks like a toy.
(Radio: man) "Car number 3 head towards....
(Woman) 3 servings of noodles..."
It's a cane!
Eavesdropping on people's conversations is not right.
It's a crime.
If we just listen to them we don't bother them.
(Thinks) "I find it in very bad taste."
"If I'm not going to watch the fight, too bad."
We listen to a conversation of the singer Lleva Amuro, let's see what she says!
-What?
Do you live in this neighborhood? -I don't know...
Then, it's impossible.
He only receives the radio waves
that it picks up by chance at a radius of one kilometer.
It's a pain in the ass.
That's why we can't choose which conversations we want to listen to.
As we move the dial...
we'll randomly pick up radio waves from some phone.
I've got it!
(Man) "I've got your daughter!"
But what did he just...?! Xxxt!
"I'm telling you I've kidnapped your daughter!"
"If you even think of calling the police, I'll kill her!"
It's blackmail!
Hey!
Are you serious?
Where should she call from?
We can't know where they're calling from!
(You've kidnapped a girl, Conan!
We can't tell if it's true.
And if he's really kidnapped her?!
With this conversation we can't even know
which point of the kilometer receiving device
they have kidnapped her.
-If it's only one kilometer... Maybe we'll intercept her again!
We'll wait and see, won't we, Conan?
Right, Conan!
The Junior Detective League starts investigating after a long time!
(Thinks) "I'm sold..."
Beika Budokan-Karate Tournament
With the blue, Ran Mouri!
On guard!
(Think) "If I don't go now, I'll inventory a "USHIRO mawashi geri"!
Hey, Conan, where are you going?
(Man) "Looks like you haven't talked to the police."
(Girl) "-Father! (Father)" -Junko!
What do you want to do?"
"I'll do anything to satisfy your demands."
Well, go out on the terrace with the phone without attracting attention.
(Kidnapper) "Very well! Stay right where you are."
"The satellite dish is bothering me, get it out of the way! Come on, come on!"
What are you forcing him to do?!
The kidnapper sees this man from somewhere.
He has made him come out because he wants to keep in sight.
(Kidnapper) "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
(Kidnapper) "Don't let him get the idea to call the police."
"I can see him very well, from here."
"If he makes any strange move, no matter how small..."
I'll kill your daughter!"
-What will... kill her?! - Shall we call the police?
Xxxxxxt!

(Father) "I'll do anything you say, what do you want? Do you want money?"
(Engine noise)
(Think) And that noise?
(Kidnapper) "Ha-ha-ha! Don't get impatient, you'll soon find out."
"Stay where you are and wait!"
(Mitsuhiko) -He's cut himself off. (Genta) -What shall we do now?
(Ayumi) Call the police?
(Genta) But... will they believe it?
We can only tell them that a Junko has been kidnapped.
Yes, the call has been cut off.
We'll do it ourselves! (All) What?
We can't waste time going to the police!
Let's go to the police!
We'll find the kidnapper together!
-Yes! -Yeah!
Ah, but without clues, how will we find him?
Of course we will!
I've discovered something.
(At the same time) Like ?!
What have you discovered?
Casum!
Why the hell did you take out the matas notebook?
No.
There's an electronic map.
Dr. Agasa invented it.
Ah, that relative of yours who's an inventor, right?
Let's see, the school where we are now is at this point here.
And its reception radius is one kilometer long.
It is in this circle.
In this area is the victim's home.
And I heard a noise in the background....
What a train does when it passes!
And only one railroad line passes through this area!
Beika's!
Sure! Let's go!
Let's go to the Beika line!
(Pant)
At last we have reached the track!
What shall we do now?
This is the only railroad track in the reception radius.
The victim should be about 600 meters from here!
(Pant) Great!
Only 600 meters!
Don't you have anything else I can do, Conan?
Yes, I've got another lead, but...
(At the same time) What clue?!
The kidnapper told the victim to move the satellite dish out of the way.
The satellite dishes face southwest.
Therefore, the victim has a south or west balcony.
The house with a balcony to the south or west....
Is the victim's house!
This is... a satellite dish?
Yes, no doubt about it!
(Genta) You're right.
But this is full of satellite dishes!
That's why this track is not enough for us.
Well...
Hello.
(Genta) Ah!
The kidnapper calls back!
Ouch!
Say something that will give us a clue!
-I'll get a good clue! -I'll find it myself!
Shut up!
(Kidnapper) "I see that you haven't called the police.
(Father) "Is the Junko all right?"
"That depends on how much caution you show me!"
(Father) "Earlier you told me you would do anything."
"Well, then, start by undressing."
"How?"
"Get undressed! Take off your clothes!"
Since... undress?
He wants to force him to go to a public bath.
Whoa, boy!
He-he-he-he!
Come on, do it!
Now some students will pass by and you will greet them!
(Kidnapper) "Never mind, what happens to your daughter?"
"Say loud and clear" Good morning "and shake hands!"
Aaaaaa.... understood....
Good morning!
Good morning!
-Hey!
Did you see that guy?! - How disgusting, a pervert!
-Porc pervert! Good morning! (kidnapper)
(Hijacker) "What effect does it have on you,
that some high school students in sailor's uniform insult you?"
"Go on, keep saluting."
School uniform?
There was quite a large group of students.
In front of that block of apartments
there must be the street where the students pass.
In the area there is Seijun Girls' School and Beika Girls' High School.
The kidnapper must be a guy the girls make fun of.
He is a teacher!
A teacher would never do that!
Which school do they wear that uniform to?
To Beika they wear a sailor's uniform.
What did you say?
My dream is to wear a uniform when I'm a high school student.
I hesitate between the sailor uniform and the uniform with a jacket.
Conan, what do you think would look better on me?
Both will look good on you.
-The one with the jacket! -No, the sailor one.
(Thinking) "Ayyy.... The Beika Women's Institute."
The area where we should search is limited to 300 meters!
It's that way! Wait'ns!
(Genta) A man waving from a balcony?
(Mitsuhiko) -I don't see any... (Ayumi) -Shall we ask students?
(Radio: hijacker) "You don't need to wave anymore."

"Now you will sing! Sing a song!"
(Father) "Sing so loud you can feel the whole neighborhood!"
(Father) Po... po... po... po!
The swallows sing...
-I don't feel anything.
I-It's not because of this neighborhood.
(Loud metallic knocking)
-There's a noise! (Knocks) -It's a temple bell.
The victim's house is behind a temple!
It's a drum.
The kidnapper plays the accompaniment to the song.
(Thinks) "No! This noise is..."
(Loud knocking)
This morning I felt the same noise.
It's a compactor!
A compactor?
The machine that lays the foundations of buildings and goes boom-boom.
To look where they do construction...
I've got it!
That truck will guide us to the construction site!
(loud metallic knocks)
The search radius is 150 meters.
I don't feel it.
We still have a while, with 150 meters.
If we don't get any definitive data, too bad.
(Radio: kidnapper) "All those who are parents are pitiful.
"They are capable of doing anything foolish for their child!"
"I understand how you feel, because I had also been a father."
(Think) I had been?
About a year ago, a little girl fell off the roof of a building.
Do you remember that she fell from the building you were the manager of?
That girl was my daughter!
(Father) Mr. Tomidokoro?
Are you Mr. Tomidokoro?
Yes, I'm the Tomidokoro whose daughter you killed.
That was an accident...
Street!
The rooftop was supposed to be closed to prevent anyone from entering!
Why the hell was it open?
Maybe it was a prank, but someone broke the lock.
It was more than a week old!
How dare he leave it like that?!
It's that without wanting to...
(Radio: kidnapper) "Don't fuck with me!"
"I'll make you go through the same pain I went through."
"You'll go through the same, I'm telling you."
(Father) "What do you plan to do to him, in the Junko?"
-We are not doing well! -We have to do something!
(Warning alarm)
With the noise from the level crossing, we won't hear anything!
Leave me the receiver!
I'm coming!
(Think) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
(Thinking) Ready!
8.2 seconds!
It's this way!
How do you know it's this way?
Because I felt the train at the receiver 8.2 seconds
after passing the level crossing.
Trains on this line run at 100 km per hour.
Every second they advance 27.8 meters.
I heard the train 8.2 seconds after passing the level crossing.
By multiplying 27.8 meters by 8
we get the location of the victim's house!
We should look for a building with balconies facing south,
and that there is a naked man on the balcony!
That's it!
Now we need to find out where the kidnapper is!
Shit!
Where is he?
(Radio: father) "I'll do anything, but don't kill my daughter."
"Anything?"
"Yes, anything."
"I was hoping you'd say that, that. Bring a knife from the kitchen."
"A knife?! OK."
(Think) "The kidnapper would have the victim commit suicide
to take revenge without having to dirty his hands!"
(Father) "I've already taken it."
(Kidnapper) "It's the last thing I ask."
(Father) "Cut 's throat and I will release your daughter."
This I can't do!
"I see that you're so foul-mouthed, whatever happens to your daughter."
"We must hurry! Where is he, that damned kidnapper?"
(Father) "Okay, I'll do it."
(Father) "But let me talk to the Junko one last time."
(Kidnapper) "As you wish."
(Girl) "-Father!" (Father) "-Junko! Hold on a little."
(Father) "Father! I want to go home! This stinks!"
"I don't like it, the smell of burning rubber!"
Burnt rubber?
A tire factory?!
It's over there!
(thinks) "From there you can barely see the building!"
Damn it!
Isn't that the tire factory?!
(Thinks) "It must be a building near this factory
from where you can see this balcony."
"There are 3. Which one is it? Which one, of the 3?"
"The only building that has the right orientation is that block of apartments!"
"Somewhere in that building is the Junko kidnapper!"
We must do something!
That man will do something foolish!

Junko's life is in danger!
(Kidnapper) I will make her experience the same pain I went through!
She will go through the same.
The rooftop!
The kidnapper must be on the rooftop of the block!
The one on that block!
Mitsuhiko and Ayumi, call the police!
Wait, Conan!
(Kidnapper) "So... nail him all at once."
(Thinking) "Hold on!"
That's right.
Keep going like this and in!
Nail him!
Cut his neck!
Junko!
Don't give me that!
Cut his neck!
Junko!
Who's there?!
What the hell are you doing here?
My name is Conan Edogawa!
I'm a detective!
You're so brave!
(Radio: Father) "Junko! Forgive me!!"
Junko's father!
She's all right!
I have stopped the kidnapper!
Father, I'm fine!
I have already been saved.
Junko?!
Did they... They really saved you?
I'm glad.
I'm really glad...
(Genta) Wait for me, criminal, you'll see how...
(Genta) What?
You got off by yourself?
Eh?!
No... The man was so surprised that he fell and hit himself.
What a stick.

DETECTIVE CONAN
Aaah... It has been shattered!
Forgive me.
It tastes so bad to me...
We don't want it, a piece of junk!
But, Mitsuhiko, we've done very well.
Eh?
Ah, yes!
(Thinking) "Apa here!"
"I'm lost! I forgot all about it!"
"Geez! It's over already?"
(Boy) What a cannonball!
The high school student who became the champion
won with a "USHIRO mawashi geri"!
Yes, the Ran Mouri, right?
What an exhibition!
She won with the "USHIRO mawashi geri."
Conan!
You came to see me?
Y-yes, of course!
The "USHIRO mawashi geri" in the final was splendid!
With the "USHIRO mawashi geri" I won the semi-final!
The final did not take place because the other one was injured!
You broke your promise to me!
Please forgive me!
(Thinking) "The arrow was shot from this window?"
"How do you understand?"
"How is it that the broken glass forms a row?"
"They have taken out a good part of the soot that was there."
"Wood that hasn't burned?"
"The murder of the crane's gratitude."
