"He is bright as a spark and has a precise wit.
"The Spider Mansion is getting more and more confusing.
"The Ran and the Kazuha are in danger.
He has the brain of an adult and he's...Detective Conan!"

(Off) "The Takeda had requested the services of in Heiji Hattori.
"He and Kazuha got lost,
and found Robert Taylor, an American.
"We, who were also going to Takeda's house,
passed by there at that time.
"There we had to go to solve the riddle of the Spider Mansion.
"That night, at Nobukazu Takeda committed suicide, by hanging himself.
In addition, a suspicious shadow hovered behind the Kazuha..."
The Spider Mansion Monster (The Suspicions)
Excuse me, Kazuha!
I've already found the pet we were looking for!
It was stuck on the lid of the CD player.
Kazuha, where are you?
Kazuha's flashlight.
Kazuha?
Kazuha!
Kazuha!
(Heiji) I've found something!
On the back of his head, there's the sign of a violent blow.
So, the killer has hit him once, and then...
Yes.
The approximate time of death is before 9 pm.
It coincides with Mr. Nobokazu's departure from the salon.
He would probably have met the killer here.
And then, when Mr. Nobukazu has met with him,
he stunned her with one blow and hung her by the neck, right?
And he entangled the body with a tangle of threads
to give the impression that it was a divine punishment!
But I don't understand one thing:
How did the murderer manage to get out of here?
This and the mess of the sandals and the lantern have me intrigued.
It is not understandable that on the floor
there is no dust that would have accumulated during these 3 years.
Oi, kiddo?
Ah, that small window?
They say it's so small that a child couldn't fit through it.
Do you find anything interesting?
Why is it open, the window?
No, it's just that I thought I heard the Ran.
I heard it through the window.
And also the Kazuha's.
Donkey!
At this time of night, they must be sleeping soundly...
(Wood creaking)
-Guys, what is it, that noise?
-Xxxt!
The stairs!
It's someone coming up!
(Thinks) Heavy footsteps.
It's not the Ran.
Who could think of it, coming up here?
It doesn't matter.
Such is the killer.
We ask him face to face!
Go, the housekeeper of the house.
You wanted nothing?
I thought they'd be hungry, so I brought them rice and tea.
Oh!
He looks so good!
Kazuha?
Are you here?
If you're here, answer!
Kazuhaaaaaa!
Oh, you knew Misa Takeda,
the girl who died here 3 years ago.
Yes.
We worked as nurses in the same hospital.
But that job was too hard and I quit nursing.
Misa introduced me to the family, and they made me a housekeeper.
Thank you.
Really, she was a formidable girl, la Misa.
She was honest and very kind.
Tell me why.
Why should a girl like her commit suicide?
There might be a cause.
Mr. Nobukazu, her father, one day when he came back from the hospital,
had a violent clash with his wife Kinuyo.
"You cheated on me for over 20 years!" he said.
Cheated?
In what way?
I don't know.
I couldn't tell you what they were talking about.
Then, the Mass became that buttonhole.
A buttonhole?
Yes.
On that occasion, Misa came in,
Mr. Nobukazu gave her a shove
and hit his head.
He got 7 stitches in his forehead.
After that, Misa became depressed until she met Robert.
In Robert?
Yes, 3 years ago, one day there was a big storm,

he found it by chance.
(Off) "While he was taking some photographs, he was swept away by a landslide,
and Robert was seriously injured.
"That day the hospital rooms were full,
they could only cure him.
"Afterwards, Mass in took care of him in this house.
"At first it was not easy, taking care of him.
"In Robert was wounded in the mouth and could not say anything.
"To speak Japanese, he already knew,
but he couldn't write it or read it,
and to communicate with the Mass they used letters of the Latin alphabet."
When Roberto was able to speak, it was really very funny.
He kept joking.
"Japanese cuisine is very good,
especially the earth and sand on rainy days."
or "I am the prince of a country and I have come to find a bride!"
"When Roberto had been cured and had his farewell party,
Mr. Ryuji came back to visit with the family and became very much,
and the Mass was happy again."
Although I understand it less.
Two or 3 days after he left, Misa committed suicide.
When Roberto left, Misa became depressed again.
One day she disappeared and I thought she ran away from home.
Then Mr. Yuzo found Misa,
who had committed suicide in the warehouse.
And after a few days, as if following in her footsteps, her mother Kinuyo did the same thing,
his mother Kinuyo did the same in the warehouse.
Since they died,
she has noticed some strange behavior in the family.
At the funeral, Mr. Nobukazu made a rather indifferent face,
and didn't shed any tears.
Mr. Ryuji had a really hard time.
He screamed so loudly that the neighborhood heard him,
and he cried howling in pain.
And then, there's See and Emi....
(Kogoro) Ah the twins...
Yes.
Both the one and the other loved each other very much in Robert.
But two years ago, when they came back for a visit,
they suddenly said something strange.
-(Kogoro) -He did it on Robert. Robert murdered the Mass.
-He's a monster.
-Yes.
A monster.
Why should they say it, something like that, the girls?
I don't know.
Mr. Negishi, who was here, was also stunned.
They were talking to him, and suddenly they said it.
And do you know what they talked about?
No.
I just felt them call him.
I didn't feel anything else.
And 3 years later, yesterday, in Negishi he died in the warehouse...
Everyone went to a neighborhood community meeting,
and Mrs. Yoko, who had come back earlier, found him.
You were not at home?
No, I had gone to the supermarket with Mr. Nobukazu.
With Mr. Nobukazu?
Yes.
Since his wife's death, he's been keeping the accounts.
By the way, the rope with which they hung Mr. Nobukazu's
the threads around were in this warehouse?
Yes, of thread, in this warehouse,
there's the fishing line that Mr. Nobukazu used for the puppets.
The string was the garage.
Do you want to see it?
(Kogoro) My goodness, what a downpour!
Hey, Kudo, you know who it is, the murderer?
What do you say?
(Adult voice) No.
Neither the killer, nor the closed chamber assembly.
After Nobukazu came out of the room,
it's impossible for Robert to have murdered him.
He has immediately gone to get the truck and left.
Mrs. Yoko was bathing with the twins,
and both the housekeeper, who was cleaning, and the grandmother are innocent.
Yes.
The people who could do it are:
Mr. Ryuji, who was putting wood to the bath boiler...
And Yuzo, who went around looking for Mr. Nobukazu.
But something doesn't fit.
This is too confusing.
By thread, right?
Yes, that's right!
Why did he use the thread to make it look like it was divine punishment?
If he had just left things as they were,
I could have taken it for a suicide.
I'm also concerned about the letter that came to you.
Ya, maybe it was sent to me by the killer himself to taunt me.
Behind this one there's something nasty, I'm sure.
Let's see, the rope...
(Crying)
Eh?
Eh!
Anybody here?
Eh ?!
Ra... Ran!
What?!
The Kazuha has disappeared?
It can't be!
Yes.
I only found his lantern on the ground.
When I thought he had been kidnapped, I panicked.

Come on guys, let's divide selected and look for it!
Kazuha!
Where are you?!
Answer me! Kazuhaaaaaaaaa!
Hey!
Did you find her?! No, she's nowhere.
What is it, Hattori?
The warehouse door.
I had it locked and now it's open instead.
Oh!
But this...!
Ka... Kazuhaaaaaaaaa!
Kazuha!
React, Kazuha!
Kazuha!
Kazuha!
Come on, Kazuha!
Kazuha!
Heiji...
Kazuha!
What... what happened to me?
I remember I was waiting for Ran in front of the warehouse.
I suddenly fainted...
Don't talk.
Now we cut the threads.
Ka... Kazuha!
Don't worry.
It seems you've only been suspended with the threads.
Forgive me, Kazuha!
I didn't look for the mascot properly, and this happened to you because of me.
So, the mascot...?
Forgive me.
I found it.
It was stuck to the cover of the CD player.
I'm so sorry! I'm glad you found it.
It would be a pity if you lost it.
Hey, Heiji, look.
Yes, I know!
-Mr. Mouri, keep an eye on the Kazuha! -Hey?
What's the matter?
Didn't you understand?
It is obvious that the murderer wanted to hang the Kazuha on a beam.
After we left,
he carried the Kazuha to the warehouse
and left it hanging.
If he had put the rope around her neck, he would have finished the punishment.
Only one reason could have compelled him to leave it halfway.
The murderer sensed that we were approaching the ordinary warehouse,
he has overwhelmed and fled.
This means... that this person...
...is still here in the warehouse!
Hey, Kudo!
Is my deduction incorrect?
(Adult voice) No, not at all!
Then let's see the killer's face!
Hey, do you see him? No.
I don't understand, we've only been in this warehouse for 3 minutes.
And we've locked the door.
He can't hide anywhere else!
If he ran away, he must have done it through that window.
But is it possible?
In such a short time could he find a way out?
(Ryuiji) What?!
This time they attacked that girl from Osaka?!
Who... Who did it?!
(Ryuiji) We don't know.
Now the Kazuha is resting,
but maybe she'll remember something.
Like the face of one of you, get ready!
Ahem...
In fact, ladies and gentlemen, we have gathered you here
to prevent any more crimes from being committed
and to check your alibis.
What alibi do you want us to have?
We were in the room sleeping.
I was sleeping too.
I was in my room.
But I couldn't sleep.
Where were you?
While we were looking for the girl, we didn't see you.
I was looking for her on the outside.
None of you have a solid alibi.
Don't say that.
Listen, I don't see Mr. Yuzo.
Ah, surely Yuzo must be working in the workshop.
Oh, what did he do?
I've been working here the whole time.
I was finishing the puppet my brother couldn't make for tomorrow.
Oooooh!
So you also make mechanical puppets?
3 years ago, my company folded,
and when I came back, my brother taught me a lot of things,
and let me assemble simple mechanical structures of the dolls.
3 years ago, those disastrous events happened.
Yes.
I came back just as Robert was leaving to go back to his country.
But at that time, Nobukazu still wouldn't let me repair or make dolls.
Each of my brother's works is valued at millions of yen,
and he charged about 700,000 yen per repair.
Millions per doll?
700,000 to fix them?
Do people buy them?
Yes.
There are even those who have had the same puppet repaired 10 times.
For the string puppets he asked for higher amounts and everything.
With the money they made,
my brother and Mr. Negishi went on trips abroad.
Since Mr. Negishi took over the sales,
the dolls became more and more expensive.
That's nothing.
Sir, what is it, this big doll?
Ah!
This is the puppet of the Spider Goddess.
At the time when the father was alive,
they used puppets like this to celebrate the village festival,
as they performed a puppet play.
But over time, the play was discontinued.

What are they, these tied boxes?
Ah!
The dolls he was supposed to take with him to Negishi the day he came.
After his death,
my brother noticed one was missing.
Our client called us
and we undertook... to replace it right away.
Be that as it may, stay in the room where we all are.
Staying alone is dangerous.
Let's go!
We take advantage now!
The price for the repair is exorbitant.
And that there are customers who have had them repaired 10 times
and the value of string puppets is higher, it means that...
Probably, inside there is...
Drugs!
And the mechanical puppets?
You can only put drugs in the head, that's why the price is less expensive!
Now we have it!
That's why Mr. Nobukazu asked for a detective
and wanted to find out who the murderer was without making a fuss.
We already know what the plot of this crime is.
Now it remains to find out the set-up of the locked room
and why he attacked the Kazuha.
Sae!
Emi!
Madam, can I help you?
I have taken the girls to the bathroom and they are not there!
What did you say?
Mama!
Oh!
Girls, you made me suffer.
Will you wait in front of the sink, when I'm done!
-It smelled so bad! -It did!
A strange modesty.
The chandelier's young were burning in the boiler.
-It's burning! -Grandma told us!
She told us!
In the cauldron?
Yes, it seems that something strange is burning.
By the way, what she said before...
What she said, that in Robert is a murderer.
The day he left at Robert's,
Mass asked us to ask him how he felt about her.
She asked him, "What do you think of Mass, Robert?"
And then, in Robert wrote something horrible!
-Didn't she?
Something horrible? -Didn't he?
(At the same time) It said: "Drop dead"!
Fuck you?
-Isn't it horrible?
-Horrible.
Don't pay attention.
They must have been confused when they read it.
I shouldn't have shown them that card.
A card?
Let's see, I think I have it here.
Ah!
Yes, this is it!
This pair found it and they made a big fuss.
They kept asking: "Who gave it to you?"
"Where is it from?"
(Heiji) Hey, look at this!
I found something!
Hey, this is...
No... it can't be.
This is the blunt object!
-Kazuha! Ah, Heiji!
I'm better, take it easy.
Get undressed!
Hurry up!
Listen to me, let me see you!
What the hell are you doing?!
Let go of me!
Quiet!
Why did I only get me? Because I'm just a kid.
You have one.
A small mark on his back, it's like a burn.
They used a blunt object to make him lose consciousness.
Do you remember anything else?
You found a strange bullet in front of the warehouse.
A bullet? A small bullet about like this.
(Think) An air pistol!
(Think) "Sure!" Could he do it that way?
"It's obvious.
It must be in some corner..... of this room!"
I found it, Hattori!
The pin hole!
I've found it too!
A peculiar thread with a knot forming a ring at the end!
Things have gone just as we suspected!
Yes!
(Think) The murderer is that person, we can't be wrong!

But the murderer has had no need to run away! (Kogoro voice)
It's... it's impossible!
He has murdered her to avenge the death of Misa, who committed suicide.
For... To avenge Misa?!
There was only one person who could do it and go unnoticed.
Only you could do it!
In the next chapter...
