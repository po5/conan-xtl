(Man: gasps)
It's this man...
it's this man who has ordered me to kill my wife,
that I love so much, with my own hands!
Why don't you say anything now?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Well, what a great misfortune, it's a pity, isn't it?
But even you don't believe what you're saying, mate.
Because everybody knows that you and I are the same person.
So, don't give me that.
I didn't order you to do anything, you did it all by yourself.
Ha-ha-ha!
-Don't listen to me!
-Hey, shut up!
What are you doing, buddy?
Let me be, please!
I'm going to kill you.
I'll kill you, you hear me?
(Knife: torn)
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
This is what usually happens when someone dares to disobey me.
You are now my... forever.
Who will be the next person to let me possess her?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"The feeling that we have always carried in our hearts
Has made us take flight towards the twentieth anniversary."
"Do you act on your own,
the dummy who pairs with a great ventriloquist?"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The ventriloquist's number (part one)."
(Applause)
I know it was just a dummy, but I was scared to death.
Mm-hm.
Ventriloquism is amazing, isn't it?
"In fact, I do something that looks a lot like it."
By the way, Father, why did he ask you to come see him,
this very famous ventriloquist?
He must have some important problem he wants you to help him solve.
I have no idea...
He just told me to come and see him as soon as the show was over.
I guess now he'll explain to me exactly what he wants.
- (woman) I need an explanation.
-Mmm?
- (man) I know.
- (woman) This was not foreseen!
But just before the show today he told me he wanted to change the number.
Who knows about us?
It would only be missing that he had found out everything.
No... That's not possible.
But he's been behaving very strangely lately.
I feel him mumbling all day long, as if he's lost his mind.
That's because he practices.
Don't worry about it.
He talks without the dummy.
That's why I'm so scared.
Someday he'll really kill me.
Stop it... Calm down, come on.
Ahem, ahem.
Excuse me, is this Mr. Tengan's dressing room?
Ah, you must be Kogoro Mouri, right?
(Man: terrified screams)
(Man: keeps calling)
Aaaaaaaaah!
Get out of here, come on!
Get out from inside me!
Get out, I tell you!
-Paris, Mr. Tengan, please.
-Let her go the knife!
My love, that's enough.
(Dummy voice) Ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Haven't you understood that you and I are the same person?
You can never get rid of me, partner.
Never!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
So, it's not... a role you play, is it?
Wow, that's strong!
You really believe that?
You know I'll do whatever you want me to do...
But you don't have to worry,
because if you don't see yourself capable, I'll do it for you, partner.
Stop it, please.
I can't take it anymore!
Come on, don't be like that.
Calm down.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Stop it!
That Paris, I tell you!
Leave me alone at once, before I do something crazy, you feel me?!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
No way!
"He has a dissociative identity disorder...
or multiple personality."
All right, well, if you don't want to leave me alone, then...
-I'm gonna kill you!
-Hey?! -Hey?!
-Let me go.
Let me go!

-But what are you doing?
(Kogoro) Calm down, calm down...
Where are you going, Kazuko?
Wait for me...
Now he's sedated, he can't hurt anyone.
And the doctor wants him to spend the night here.
I think you should stay and keep him company.
Yes, man!
You stay, if you want.
I've had enough.
Besides, he's already keeping his partner, the dummy, company.
I'm sure he's enough for him.
I can't resist him anymore.
Excuse me, Mr. Tengan has woken up and is asking for Mr. Mouri.
You may come in.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Mouri.
I really didn't mean to behave like this.
I'm very ashamed.
You don't need to suffer, it's me now, Riichi Tengan.
And no one else, anymore.
He's not here now.
And this thing that happens to you... is it real?
Theoretically I have dissociative identity disorder,
also known as multiple personality.
Although it's not a definitive diagnosis yet.
Anyway, the doctor I talked to wasn't very clear about it.
Well, I'm pretty clear, mate.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
You have always been a shy person
and it's hard for you to express your feelings.
When he asked his wife to marry him,
he did it through me.
Did the doll ask her?
I'm very embarrassed, but it's true.
If it hadn't been for him...
well, better said, if it hadn't been for ventriloquism,
my life would have been...
A real unbearable drama, wouldn't it, partner?
Forgive me for asking, why did you want to see Mr. Mouri?
Well, you look like a very smart and clever boy.
I'm Conan Edogawa.
What's your name, handsome?
Eh?
And this girl here is named Ran.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Thanks, sweetie, you too.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-Ehem.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
So, can you tell me what I can do for you?
It turns out that...
Go on, go on, tell him, it's all right.
Hurry up.
Shut up, now!
What do you think?
He does it all himself, doesn't he?
Well, look, I'd say so.
Hey, buddy...
I'm worried... I'm afraid I'm gonna end up killing my wife.
I'm really afraid he's gonna push me.
Excuse me, how do you say?
When I'm alone, at home, I feel him talking a lot of the time.
And I promise it's not me playing the ventriloquist.
Mata-la, partner.
Mata-la.
Kill your wife, partner.
Mata-la, partner...
Kill-la.
Kill your wife.
-Materia-la, partner.
Mata-la.
-Shut up!
-Kill your wife, partner.
-Shut the fuck up!
Mata-la, partner.
Mata-la....
And I know... that it comes from inside me.
It's a voice that I feel inside me repeating itself endlessly.
It's him, speaking from inside me.
But it's as if I were saying it myself.
Listen, partner... He represents that it's a secret...
-Why should I do it?
-I'm telling you to shut up!
That woman is doing the jump with your pupil, partner.
Let's see if you react!
That's why I'm so scared.
-Stop it... Calm down.
-Someday she'll really kill me.
You know what?
If you were really in love, he wouldn't kill anyone.
-You know that's a lie.
-I'd get a divorce and that's it.
-It's a lie.
-It's the truth. -It's the truth.
It's the truth.
I have... no intention of killing her.
I wouldn't do that.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Listen, I... I don't know what to think...
-I don't either, believe me.
-Huh? -Huh?
It's hard for me to understand, you know?
I don't know if it's me who's moving the doll, or..,
or if it's the person inside me,
that manifests itself and thinks out loud.
Whatever it is, it scares me.
Or, even worse, I am afraid of myself.
Every time I lose consciousness,
I'm afraid of what I might do.
As happened at today's performance.
Maybe one day I will kill my wife.
That's why I want you to keep an eye on me, Mr. Mouri.
You have to keep an eye on me so I don't end up killing my wife.
Of course I do.
Now I understand.
That's what you wanted to ask me and that's why you made me come.
I'm asking you please, Mr. Mouri.
I'm very sorry to tell you that.
Look, Mr. Tengan, I'm a private detective.
You should talk to a mental health specialist about your problem.

"Very well said."
But... listen...
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
Okay, I understand.
Hey, Togawa, go get the car.
It's just that they say... he has to spend the night here.
He told you to go and get the car, you asshole!
Is it so hard to understand?
How can you be so useless?
Excuse me, I'll be right there.
Mr. Mouri, I'm sorry I made you come for nothing.
I apologize for the waste of time.
I'm going to get dressed.
-What?
-Photograph the field, detective!
(Dummy: ruminates)
(Phone)
Oysters, but you do not feel that call, father?
Tell me.
Yes, it's here.
Mr. Togawa?
Ah, Mr. Tengan's student, I remember.
What is it?
That Mr. Tengan has murdered his wife?!
What are you saying?
Ouch!
"Help me, please Mr. Mouri."
Help Mr. Tengan.
I beg you to help him, please!
(Takagi) And you say you took sleeping pills?
(Takagi) That's right.
I was so afraid of becoming someone else.
Lately, it's been happening every night.
And, this morning, your student and representative,
Mr. Haruomi Togawa,
came to pick you up for work.
And you didn't know that your wife was dead
until he woke her up, right?
That is correct.
And, you say, when you came home from the hospital last night,
your wife was still gone, right?
That's right.
Lately she'd gotten into the habit of going out at night.
And she almost always came home when I was asleep, in the wee hours of the morning.
(Dummy voice) She would come out at night to do the jumping jack for me!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
What?
But...
While my partner was dreaming with the little angels,
that fresh one went out every night on the sly,
to do her thing, the slut.
Do you get it, you little cop?
What... what's wrong with her?
(Tengan voice) I admit that I killed my wife.
She pushed me... that person inside me that I can't control.
Because of him I killed my wife.
(Dummy voice) Hey, you, I wanted to give you an alibi...
and now you go and say that about me?
How clever!
You don't want to endorse me, buddy.
I'm just a dummy, everybody knows it!
If a murder has been committed, it must have been you...
A dummy can't kill anyone.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's creepy.
I don't know what it reminds me of.
Of it.... Not at all.
Eh?
Changing the subject.
Are you sure you have dissociative personality disorder?
Multiple personality?
Or it could also be that he's just making it look like he's interested.
That way he couldn't be found guilty in a future trial.
I think it could be either option.
Psychiatric tests currently
can't be considered 100% reliable.
Mmm... So, what can we do?
Hey, inspector, leave it to me, please.
I can assure you that the great detective Kogoro Mouri
will unravel this case and unravel the whole truth.
You can have full confidence in my ability.
The victim was here.
The murder weapon was on the floor.
And according to the police,
only Mr. Tengan's fingerprints were found on the murder weapon.
Yes, and, from the distribution of the prints,
he had to pick up the trophy that was here with both hands,
then lifted it up like this and struck the back of the victim's head,
which was the couch, his back to him, drinking wine.
What?
Eh?
And what's that?
Hey, you, what are you doing here, boy?
Ah!
I came in case you needed some help.
Don't be angry!
No, wait a moment...
Go home.
Eh?
Look up there, on top of the speaker.
Mm?
What's that?
A small speaker?
Here's another one.
And here, two more.
And wireless.
This means that...
If we look hard enough, there should be a player around here...
that sends the signal to the speakers.
Ah.
I've got it.
It's on a timer.
- (dummy voice) "Mata-la, partner."
-What are you doing?
Don't touch anything!
"Mata-la. Kill your wife, partner. Kill her, buddy..."
Kogoro...
This... that voice...
Yes, about that, we have to inform the inspector.
Our team has found his fingerprints...

on this wireless speaker and on this player.
Do you have an explanation, Mr. Togawa?
Yes, this is because... they are mine.
They must have disappeared from me more than a week ago.
-Of course.
-Can you tell me where they were found?
They were hidden in the living room of Mr. Tengan's apartment.
And we found that the player
was programmed to start up periodically.
(Dummy voice) "Mata-la, mate. Mata-la."
Oh... That it was... programmed to start itself?
Right, now I get it.
Then the voices that Mr. Tengan felt... came out of the player.
Mr. Togawa, I think you've teased us enough, don't you?
Eh?
I don't understand, inspector.
When you came to testify,
you left the bag you were carrying at the entrance.
Then we inspected it thoroughly
and found these glasses hidden under the inner lining.
These glasses are mine.
In fact, they also disappeared from me a few days ago.
No idea.
You tell me.
How did they end up in the bag?
And it gets more complicated because we found biological remains.
You see?
This here.
A bloodstain?
Wow!
Yes, in addition, the DNA analysis...
has confirmed that the blood is the victim's, as we imagined.
We believe the blood was smeared when the murder was committed.
They... they were stained?
You're not accusing me of killing Mrs. Tengan, are you?
Mr. Togawa, where was it last night at 2:00 a.m., please?
At 2:00 a.m.?
I was at home, awake.
I was actually practicing.
What was he practicing?
Ventriloquism, maybe?
Mr. Tengan told me to meet this morning to take a class,
and I spent almost... all night practicing.
-Of course... I was alone, at home.
-You alone, I suppose...
Another thing.
this key to Mr. Tengan's apartment was in your possession.
Yes, that's right.
Can you explain to me how it is?
I have it because, in addition to being his student, I am his representative, too.
Be that as it may, you have no alibi...
at the time the crime was committed.
And, furthermore, you were free to enter and leave...
of Mr. Tengan's apartment without arousing any suspicion.
You're right, but I... I haven't.....
Mr. Togawa, I understand
that you were romantically involved with the victim.
I'm going to maintain... a relationship.
Is this true?
I did it because I'm immature.
Mr. Tengan wrote to me every day..,
and instead she was always very kind.
In addition, she told me that she was... very lonely,
because her husband was always very busy.
It was only once.
It was just one slip and that was enough.
But the victim did not want to forget the relationship.
And thinking about her future as a ventriloquist,
wasn't she an obstacle?
It could be that she wanted to get rid of it, couldn't she?
No, of course not.
That's why he had to kill her.
And he tried to blame Mr. Tengan
by making him believe that he had a dissociative personality disorder,
what some experts call "multiple personality."
This is not true.
I am sorry for the relationship I had with her.
Basically because I respect her husband very much.
And I could never do something like that.
You don't understand?
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
You have to believe me, please!
He's very stubborn.
With all the evidence we've presented to you so far,
and you still continue to deny having done anything.
I had asked for a warrant for Mr. Tengan's arrest...
And now it turns out that he was totally wrong.
Anyway... I'm lucky for you, Mr. Mouri.
Because I was about to make a mistake that would have led to a tail.
What?
But you saved me.
Yes, it's true, it's true.
You were lucky that I was there.
All the credit goes to me.
Well, what do you know?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"I wanted to say how sorry I am
for all the commotion I've caused around me."
"I want to apologize wholeheartedly to my public
and all the people who work in my team."
"I really didn't mean to cause this upheaval."
"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! There's no need for you to apologize, partner."
"You are the victim of an extramarital affair,

and you are the widower of the woman who was murdered."
I didn't expect it at all, that in the end the murderer was Mr. Togawa.
He looked quite formal.
It has been proven once again that appearances can be deceiving.
And what's more, he had gotten involved with the victim.
I didn't expect this either, to be honest.
"Wow... There's something that doesn't add up, and I don't know what it is."
Well, it's all solved now.
Case closed.
Thanks to Sleeping Kogoro,
aka the great detective Kogoro Mouri, here.
This that I feel like I didn't fall asleep this time.
Anyway, it's okay, I guess.
See, sometimes like this, the thing.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I'm going to the bar for a while.
Listen to me, father,
I don't want you to drink too much, and come back early, okay?
Of course I will.
Take it easy, woman.
I can't be too calm, with you.
(Haruomi) "Please help me, Mr. Mouri. Help Mr. Tengan."
"I beg you to help him, please!"
"I doubt very much that someone who wanted to foist the crime on Mr. Tengan...
would ask Kogoro for help, precisely."
"Besides..."
4ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

I also happened to lose them a few days ago.
I have no idea what they were doing there.

Sorry, mate, to keep you waiting.
