"But the world is more enigmatic.
"Today two very beautiful sisters appear.

DETECTIVE CONAN
The case of the enigmatic murder in the closed bathroom, part one.
I'm home!
What were you doing?
It's already very late.
I've been gone for 24 hours.
I bought all the things you asked for, sis!
Bath soap, duct tape and beer.
I'm sorry about that.
It's just that I hadn't bought any soap.
And since they're renovating the 24-hour store next door...
Do you have them?
They are the videotapes where our idols are recorded.
You can do without that, can't you?
I'm leaving to do you a favor.
You have a good job.
Do you want me to help you?
I'm good.
You know what you can do?
Cut the duct tape into equal pieces
and leave me glued to the edge of the table.
I show up unannounced and give you a job.
Whoa, woman!
It's no big deal.
Oh, by the way, thank you very much!
Kenji is also looking forward to tomorrow's concert!
Ah, of course!
I forgot!
Before I finish packing this...
I have to toast to my sister, who leads a happy life.
But I... It's not necessary, at this point...
I'm doing it because you have already decided to get married...
I've been so busy, I haven't been able to celebrate with you.
This is my special celebration to congratulate you.
Accept my congratulations.
(Kogoro) Ah... Beautiful Miss Yoko!
Your beauty is my killer!
These roses with which I present you petal by petal, just by looking at them,
are tinged with the intense color of carmine...
What a thing!
With this rogue face, she looks like a psychopath, doesn't she!
Children don't understand the elegance of these adult phrases.
(Thinking) An elegant sentence?
And a radish...
(Humming)
It seems that Kogoro is in a very good mood.
Because tonight is Yoko Okino's concert.
If we don't queue up, we'll find it full, the concert venue.
Apa!
Don't worry!
If we show these autographed tickets from Yoko,
they'll let us in through the back door.
Oh!
Wow!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What's wrong with you?
There's... a hole!
There's a hole!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Don't tell me you've lost the entrance.
They're gone!
They're gone!
They're gone!
My Yoko!
Did you check the toilet?
When we arrived she went straight in.
Surely they're there!
In the sink!
In the sink!
I'm sure they're there!
In the sink!
How did it go?
Did you find them?
No... Instead!
If you tell them what happened to you, they'll let us in!
You donkey!
How do you want me to say that nonsense when I give her the bouquet ?!
Wait a minute.
I could have sworn that you...
You had the exams during the week, right?
Yes, that's right.
So give me your ticket and go home to study.
I don't want to!
Very good!
Who got the tickets?
Tell what you say, father...
Yes, yes, yes... We'll say it's Conan, that he got...
Stop talking nonsense! Ah!
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
What do you mean, you won't come?
Kenji!
A cold?
When you see the concert you'll be cured at once!
Do you know how much effort it took me to get tickets for Yoko?
Come right now!
My little sister and I had to go with your car!
What?!
Impossible?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Kenji?
Kenji?!
Oh... You're useless!
Aaaa... Da.. this...
Yes?
Tonight's ticket... can you spare it, Miss?
I mean the one for Yoko Okino's concert.
Uh... yes...
In this case, just one...
Would you mind lending me one at a good price?
Stop it, father.
They'll let you in;
it's an unnecessary expense.
Shut up!
Money is no substitute for a wounded man's pride!
Get up!
You're vain!
Kogoro!
Maybe he's dropped it inside the car, the ticket.
You're right, you're right.
Ah... What do you say?

Do you agree to sell me the ticket?
I see you are a good man.
I'll let you have it for free.
Ah, you give it to me for free... For free?!
Are you serious?!
Yes!
And if you're wondering what I want in return...
Would you mind granting me one thing?
Yes!
Anything!
What's the matter with you, Kogoro?
You'd think you had to buy a man's pride.
I'm sorry I asked you this...
Going to fetch your sister by car is no bother!
It went well, you rented the car.
We were lucky that you had to go far away for a job.
What happened to her, at the Mine?
She was so excited about the concert...
I don't understand why she didn't show up.
-Did you try to play a trick on her? -Yes, but she won't get it.
She doesn't have her answering machine on either.
I hope nothing strange has happened to her.
Strange, you say?
Lately, my little sister does inexplicable things.
Although she's getting married soon, she seems to be in a slump.
She cries for no reason...
I'm going to invite her to the concert to take her mind off her worries.
Well...
By the way, I haven't stopped thinking about it for a while.
This headband she's wearing, it could be...
It's the band they gave away with the first limited edition
of Yoko Okino's new album.
Wow, it's Yoko's?
It's a good thing they donated it to her.
Quina envy...
You're hacen and you haven't bought it?
Besides that, I had a keychain and other things.
As her CD's she has given me in person,
the promotional stuff doesn't reach me.
Eh?
In person?!
You know Yoko in person?!
Yes, that way, following certain crimes.
Cr... Crimes?
Eh, yes... It's just that I call myself Kogoro Mouri.
I'm a private detective.
Have I done anything to upset you?
Uh... no... Your name echoes spectacularly!
You're a very famous man!
Whoa, man!
It's no big deal, miss.
Wow!
What a piece of house!
Your sister lives here alone?
No... Until last week we both lived here.
Starting next month, she'll be living with her fianc√©.
Looks like there's the shoes.
She must be sleeping, though.
I'll go and tell my sister, Mr. Mouri,
you can wait in this living room.
But it's a little late.
We'll be right there.
Y... yes...
Come on, we still have an hour to get to the concert venue.
Au, easy, don't be impatient.
But... Oh, my God!
What's all this?
The room is full of idol posters!
The Yoko, Asuka Anzai, the Two-Mix, Terumo Hoshino...
What an exaggeration!
There's even the Lex, who disbanded!
(Think) And you know them all!
Masayo is very fond of idols.
What a panorama, for the little sister, to live with her it would be....
Well, it seems that they both like them.
They have two of each of the photo books and CDs.
How come Masayo didn't take them with her when she moved?
She had a lot of things and couldn't take them at the same time.
Have you seen those moving boxes?
There's a lot of them.
But I'd say...
(loud knocking)
What's going on? (knocks) (knocking)
Mina!
Mina, answer me!
Kogoro! Yes, come on.
What's wrong, Miss?!
Open up!
Mina!
Aren't you in?!
Come on, Mina!
Mina!
What's this?
"Goodbye"?
Is it locked from the inside?
No, this door doesn't have any lock.
It looks like you've sealed the door on the inside with duct tape.
Well then!
We'll push it open!
All at the same time!
Now!
Mina...
A... a suicide?!
Ran!
The police!
Call the police! Yes!
My sister!
Can you save my sister?!
Unfortunately, she's not breathing anymore...
It can't be!
(Think) "The bathroom door and the window are sealed.
"And also, on the floor, two bottles with two different types of soap.
"Is it really a suicide?
"But that worries me:
the wounds on this girl's wrist...
"No. It's not true. This is not a suicide.
"It's murder!
"But I don't understand.
"If it really is, how did he do it, the murderer?
"How did he do it, to get out of the bathroom?!
"How did he get out of this space sealed with duct tape?!
How did he do it?"
The deceased is Miss Mina Aoshima, 24 years old.
She died of exsanguination.

caused by the wrist incisions that have severed the arteries.
You have found her older sister, Miss Masayo.
Is that you?
Uh, yes...
And then, not to be out of place, we meet again, eh, Kogoro?
You have Kogoro Mouri at your disposal as always!
When we arrived, at the request of Miss Masayo,
we noticed that there was something strange going on in the bathroom.
When you say "strange", you mean the duct tape?
Yes.
It was perfectly sealed from the inside,
the room was locked.
There's no question it's a suicide.
But a person who commits suicide by severing his wrist,
what need does he have to hermetically seal himself?
He must have done it for that.
If he mixed the chlorine and oxygen components of the soaps,
he would get chlorine gas, highly toxic.
It has been closed because the gas is not toxic!
But, neither of these two soaps do not contain chlorine....
And if chlorine gas had been released, it was not necessary to close the chamber.
Mr. Inspector!
The late Miss Mina was not a professional like us.
She must not have known the power of chlorine.
Tot and this...
And another thing:
Miss Mina was quite disturbed before she committed suicide.
This is the truth!
To commit suicide she has prepared the two types of soap.
And Miss Mina realized something when she was going to make the gas:
that she had made a mistake when buying the soap.
And she had to use the method of slitting her wrist
and put her arm in the hot water to bleed to death.
Inspector!
Take a look at this.
Take a good look, please.
It's a receipt that was lying on the floor in the hall!
Miss Mina bought soaps and the tape at 24 hours.
It's proof that she wanted to commit suicide and was preparing for it!
Hey, Takagi!
Come here!
Yes!
Visit 24 hours and take statement from the employees!
I found the roll of duct tape in the bathtub.
If Miss Mina had lost her composure,
it means that we can't think of any other possibility.
But this girl was too stunned.
But, Conan...!
Look at this girl's wrist.
The cuts zigzag, so nervous she was.
It's... It's true!
The cuts that are usually made by suicides are parallel
and end up being mortal wounds.
That they cross each other is not logical.
This could be...
(Kogoro) It's a coincidence!
This means that Miss Mina was really upset.
(Thinking) Come on, let's go!
Someone in that state would clean up? Cleaning up?
Yes.
Look at this blood.
It gets all the way to the edge of the tub.
This girl must have cleaned the envelope after it was splattered all over with blood.
Donkey!
A person who commits suicide wouldn't do that!
Then why isn't it splattered?
Well... When blood started coming out of it,
there must have been something else here, possibly...
When he made the cuts on his wrist, there must have been someone next to him.
Isn't that it?
Hey, hey, hey!
Yes, yes...
Mr. Inspector, this is... could be that...
Yes.
The plot of a murder.
And couldn't it be the duct tape...?
Wasn't it the bottom of the bathtub?
Maybe it...
I've got it!
He left the tape on the edge of the bathtub,
and with the movements he made when he cut his wrist, it fell off.
All the pieces fit!
Thank you so much!
Thanks to you I have solved the riddle!
Inspector Megure!
The fingerprints left on the tape belong only to the victim.
And on the tip of the tape
are the prints of the index finger and thumb.
I see what you mean.
This "Goodbye" can be considered his last word,
like a testament!
So, it really is a suicide.
Of course it is!
Because this bathroom was completely closed!
Oh, my goodness!
I had completely forgotten!
What's the matter?!
Mouri, why are you shouting?
Miss Masayo!
Yes?
You, at that time, I'm sure...
-You told me that, didn't you?
-At that time?
That you'd give me a free ticket to Yoko's concert.
Stop it, father!
At this time...
What's wrong with that?!
If we go now, we can see the end of the concert!
I'm going to look for her.
My sister left them in the living room.
I'm sorry, Miss...
Excuse me...

These boxes have a lot of folds.
Have you ever assembled them?
Uh, yes... The other day...
I had too much luggage and had to reuse.
So his sister gave him a hand.
The edge of this board is sticky!
These marks must be from when he hooked up the tape.
If someone cuts the pieces off it must be more comfortable to pack.
Ah!
Conan!
Where are you?!
Geez, this little guy.
Always the same, always the same!
Conan!
Listen, that girl is calling for you.
Conan!?!
It's true!
I've got to go!
Even if I clean up the duct tape, it'll be useless.
Because when I told the agents,
they took pictures and took samples.
Ah!
So you were here!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Goodbye, Miss!
Goodbye, Miss!
Conan, always the same.
I've always told you not to turn up and down!
Let it be the last time!
(Off) "The thing is obvious.
"The assassin who has killed Mina is Masayo.
"But... I don't understand.
"What method has she devised,
to close the chamber hermetically and get out?
"Besides, what is this?
I've been feeling a restlessness for a while now that's driving me crazy."

Inspector, what is it, that?
This is... It could be a...
(Kogoro voice) Exactly.
Miss Mina hasn't committed suicide, he's been murdered!
He's killed her little sister,
you, Miss Masayo!
In the next chapter...
The case of the enigmatic murder in the closed bathroom, part two...
The clue to the next Conan is... A gang!
The murderer is you, the fianc√©! You're wrong, it's Masayo.
