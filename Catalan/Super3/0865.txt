(Mitsuhiko) Ready, Conan?
Attention, I'm shooting.
Good pass, Mitsuhiko!
(Here, here!
Genta!
I've got it.
(Man) Aaaaah!
(Man) Eh?
Ouch!
Call the police!
(Man) Eh?

"The foul-mouthed bird."
So the victim had a bird, right?
Yes.
It looks like it was a mino.
Right.
From the looks of the cage, I'd say...
Well, yeah.
The top window was wide open.
He must have escaped through there.
(Man) Hello, good afternoon.
Is this Mrs. Kokubo's house?
Trick of the Midoridai police station, in front of the station.
Some gentlemen have come who have found Nine, her bird.
Oh, my goodness.
So your name is Nine, eh, mate?
(High-pitched voice) And you're dumber than an old shoe, mate.
(high-pitched voice) Eh?
What did you say?
I can tell you don't know who you're talking to!
Don't take it so hard, it's just a bird.
What's that?
That he's been murdered, you say?
Mrs. Kokubo?
Donkey!
Idiot!
Shrike!
You fool!
He's escaped us.
Oh, hello, Kogoro.
They told me you found it, the bird we were looking for.
It'll do us a lot of good.
Can you take it to us, please?
What are you saying?
That it escaped from you?
Look how stupid you are!
You don't need to come!
Oh, my...
Today is already the second time they call me "donkey".
Eh?
Oh, what a pain.
What's wrong?
Is there anything wrong?
It's just that yesterday he drank too much and twisted his ankle.
I already told you.
In fact, now we were going to the hospital.
It's no big deal, we don't need to go, in the hospital... Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Come on, let's go.
-Thank you.
-What's the matter? -What's wrong?
It seems that the boy we saw coming in before...
was Mrs. Kokubo's nephew.
I remember that she was always grumbling
that he was asking her for money every now and then.
I can't get over my astonishment.
Even if we made a fuss, she always looked at us with a smile.
How bad I feel...
And who found it, Mrs. Kokubo's corpse?
The man who came home to visit her?
(Takagi) Yes.
Only Mrs. Kokubo and her maid lived in this house,
a young girl named Emi Yahagi.
(Takagi) Ah.
And how come we haven't seen him yet, the maid?
According to a neighbor in the neighborhood, she always goes out shopping at this time.
In the meantime, his mistress takes a nap.
From one to two they always do the same thing, it is part of their daily routine.
Well, it's almost half past five at 3 o'clock.
Do you know if they understood each other well, the victim and her maid?
No one told me they had a bad relationship,
but the maid's mother has long been ill
and she will take care of all the expenses.
That's why she asked Mrs. Kokubo for a raise.
I agree.
It doesn't look like anyone could have entered from outside.
The back door has a semi-automatic lock and it was locked.
There are two keys.
One is held by Emi Yahagi and the other by Mrs. Kokubo.
It can be seen that a duplicate cannot be made.
Therefore, the only access is the front door.
The nephew in Mamoru is studying, isn't he?
Yes, he's taking a course in juvenile literature.
Hmm, so he's not working yet.
Exactly five to one.
What time did you find him, the body?
Eh?
Wow, how precise!
Did the nephew himself tell you?

Ah, no, I was told by some primary school children who saw him come in.
And can we trust them, some elementary school children?
-Huh?
- (Mitsuhiko) 100 percent.
Don't look down on them, the elementary school children.
Nothing more needs to be said, Inspector.
I understand.
Hey.
In Nine has escaped.
You know him too, this bird?
(Mitsuhiko) Yes.
The loudmouth at Nine is well known.
What a mess!
It escaped because of me.
I opened the window.
Oops.
Oops...
I'm sorry about that.
There's no doubt about it.
The bird escaped through the window.
We were playing in the park in front of the front door.
After Emi, the maid, left,
no one went in or out of the house.
-Hm.
-Did I say it right, guys?
It's very late.
What have you done to her?
What have you done to her?
So, you found an abandoned baby...
and you went looking for its mother?
Yes.
I found her sleeping in the stroller.
And where was the mother?
Two little girls who were passing by helped me look for her.
It seems that her hat had blown away with the wind
and she had gone to look for it.
Did you arrive late at Mrs. Kokubo's house because you were watching the stroller?
Yes, and I suffered because I thought Mrs. Kokubo would scold me.
I didn't imagine I'd run into her...
The question is whether you can prove
that the story you told us is true.
What?
Except for the victim, she's the only one who had a key to the back door.
Maybe he came back after he left the house, killed her...
and then quietly left to go shopping.
I didn't kill anyone.
Can you tell us how the baby's mother was said?
I don't know, I didn't think to ask her.
-I don't know either.
-And the two girls who found him?
You didn't ask them what their names were?
If I had asked them, I'd tell them.
Hm.
-(man) Huh?
- (man) Inspector Megure.
In Conan and the kids.
It's Kogoro.
How did you three end up here?
Mr. Sayama.
Who knew, right?
My goodness, what a tragedy.
She was angry with you.
The copy you sold her was a fake.
Who is this man?
Mr. Sayama owns an antiquarian bookstore.
We just met at the hospital.
Don't want to make unnecessary efforts.
I'll give you the prescription for the medicine right away.
-Hello, Mr. Sayama.
How are we doing?
-Hello, doctor.
I've come to ask you to discharge me so I can drive.
I need to go back to work, and I can't do anything like this.
It's out of the question.
At least for 3 days.
Well...
(Bird: gralla)
Look.
Isn't that the bird from before?
No, that was a crow.
It was not a minó, father.
A minó, you said?
Like the one with a red wool thread on its leg?
Oh, excuse me, I thought...
you were talking about Mrs. Naoko Kokubo's mino.
-What's the matter?
-Hm...
Of course, it's normal that I don't know yet.
What is it?
I took her because I thought she might have information about the victim.
You used her as an excuse
to come and snoop around the crime scene.
Maybe so, but even if it is an excuse,
I think you were right to bring it.
The lady had a collection of unique copies of old books.
But the last book she bought from Mr. Sayama...
Eh?
No, and now!
I'm the victim, I was swindled too.
And I told him as soon as I found out.
Yes, but you pocketed your money and you haven't returned it, have you?
Before I went out to shop, I felt like I was talking to you.
Madam.
What do you want me to do, about the inside plant we have on the street?
Do you want him to come in and leave it in the kitchen?
It's not necessary now, you'll do it when you come back.
I don't want to hear any more excuses, Mr. Sayama.
My goodness, it's so late.
I don't care where you get the money from, but I want you to take them to me right now!
Poor man, it's his turn to receive.
With my arm bandaged, I can't work and I have to wear a vest now.
Bad payer's excuses.
I wasn't really planning on paying him back, was I?
When you're angry you're just like your mistress, girl.
- (mobile)
-I don't like it when you call me "little girl"!
(Takagi) Inspector.

We already have the coroner's report.
On the victim's neck there are clear marks of strangulation.
The murder weapon was the white handkerchief
that Mrs. Kokubo was wearing around her neck.
The coroner estimates that she died between 12:55 and 13:55.
In fact, we can be certain...
that the murder was committed between 13:35 and 13:55.
Eh?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Yes.
When you're done, come right back, you feel...
I'm sorry.
What is the function of this room?
Ah... it was the place where my aunt worked.
She was an author of children's stories.
When she was still working, of course.
Oh!
She must have drawn all these stories...
-Oh!
- (mobile)
Ah.
I thought I knew the name of this woman.
She retired after a very loud scandal.
(cell phone ringing) Okay.
Yes, thank you.
Inspector, Mr. Sayama was seen talking on the phone...
in front of Midoridai station.
Yes, I see it was 12:55.
It looks like it was 12:55.
It agrees with what the maid says.
How long does it take from the station?
There's no indication that she took a cab,
and it should be about three quarters of an hour on foot.
Dispense.
Say.
(phone ringing) Huh?
Hello.
What are you celebrating, here?
It's the two girls from before.
Ah.
So you're the maid in this house.
Yes, I am.
Eh?
Have you found it?
He's so famous that we recognized him right away.
Thank you, thank you.
(Nine: gralla)
Conan and the other children have confirmed the nephew's alibi,
but what do we know about Mr. Sayama?
According to the victim's call history,
they've been on the phone from 12:50 to 13:35.
Wow.
He gave him a good scolding.
And then he went straight to the hospital.
Is it possible he killed him?
The hospital is halfway, more or less,
between this house and the train station.
Mr. Sayama spoke to the victim from the station.
If we assume that he then went to her house, strangled her...
and then went to the hospital,
the chronology of events does not match up
with what Mr. Mouri has declared.
The conclusion is obvious, isn't it?
The only one who has no alibi is the maid, Emi Yahagi.
This time, then,
I don't think it will be necessary for the Sleeping Kogoro to appear.
What?
So in the end all the suspects have alibis.
Yes.
I'm willing to testify when necessary.
I guess this just made the case more complicated.
(Nine) Why don't you hang yourself with a thick noodle?
Hehehehe!
(Nine) Huh?
Hohoho!
If I could, I'd slice your head off like a rotten watermelon.
(What?) What?
Carallot!
Ouch... Oh...!
How is it that he only knows how to say insults and threats, this bird?
It was calm before, it even let us catch it.
It is a docile and intelligent bird,
but he has only been taught to speak badly and to insult.
He has taken his mistress as an example.
Ever since her master betrayed her that time,
Mrs. Kokubo was unable to trust anyone.
That's why she said that praise was all lies.
and that criticism, insults and threats were much more sincere.
Yes.
You mean when she was accused
of having plagiarized her teacher's work, right?
Those of us who are in this business know about the case
and we know it was the other way around.
She did not plagiarize her master's work.
In fact, it was he who stole her idea.
But the press took sides with the great master
and they didn't even listen to the lady's version.
Hohoho!
People see, but don't look.
Yes.
Unfortunately, it happens.
"Which of these three people will have killed her, Mrs. Kokubo?"
That's why my aunt kept telling me
to stop writing at once.
You know what, Mamoru?
She used to say this to me:
"This kid will go far, with the talent he has."
That's what she thought of you.
Huh?
Mm-hm.
Wow...
Wow.
What's the plant doing here?
Eh?
Mamoru.
Was it you, who brought the plant in and left it here?
It wasn't me.
I don't know anything.
(Emi) Oh.
(Emi) How strange...
Do you know if your aunt had very bad legs?
(Emi) Very.
She said she could barely sit in the wheelchair.
(Nine) Phew, there's an unbearable smell in here!

He said it smells bad in here?
Maybe he's imitating the culprit.
It's impossible to know, Father.
It's just a bird.
I want to eat rice with eels!!!!
I'm hungry.
Now he has plagiarized me.
By the way, how come he has a red thread on his leg?
The lady put it on this morning,
so that it would be easier to find him if he escaped again.
The truth is that you can see it right away.
Mr. Sayama asked us
if it was the bird that had a red wool thread on its leg.
Question... Is there anything smelly in the house?
Maybe pickled vegetables.
We have all kinds.
My aunt liked them very much.
Well, I don't feel any modesty.
It's normal, because she always prepared them in the cellar.
And where is the cellar?
It's down here.
Why do you want to see it?
Ugh, here there is an unbearable smell!
Ei.
(Thinking) "Sure. I know what happened."
Ah!
Ocellot of the devil!
Hm... He doesn't look like he wants to go to sleep.
-Aah!
-I feel so much.
Eh?
Inspector.
Mr. Mouri.
Oh.
It's about time, kid.
(Kogoro voice) I apologize for taking so long.
But it's just that it's a very complicated case.
It turns out that the 3 main suspects
have a confirmed alibi.
But I can finally prove
that the alibi of one of these 3 people is false.
Come on, come on, tell us who it is.
You say someone has a false alibi?
The owner of Sayama Bookstore,
Mr. Yotaro Sayama.
I don't know why he says that.
I have a good alibi.
But you saw me in the hospital yourself.
I'll ask you a question, if I may.
You knew that the mino had a red woolen thread tied to its leg.
What is the problem?
When Nine escaped from the police station,
it didn't have the red yarn tied to its leg.
Therefore, if you have seen her with the yarn,
it must have been somewhere else by force.
That's true.
You're a genius, Father.
I saw it... I saw it from the street on my way to the hospital.
She flew past with the woolen thread hanging from her leg.
It could be.
But if you saw it flying by,
how could you tell a woolen thread from a sewing thread?
Besides, Miss Emi Yahagi says...
that Mrs. Kokubo picked her up this morning.
I-I don't know... I guess I said it without knowing it...
For that, Mr. Mouri, there are several witnesses who have seen Mr.
Sayama
at the station at 12:55.
According to the call history, he did not hang up the phone until 13:35.
If he had come and the victim had died,
he would not have been able to arrive at the hospital
at the time you met him.
It could be that Mr. Sayama had not been standing still,
while he was talking to the victim.
Perhaps she picked up the phone and continued talking to him while he was coming.
She told him to "come immediately".
Maybe that's exactly what she did.
Right.
So, by the time she hung up the phone,
he had already arrived here at Mrs. Kokubo's house.
Anyway, in Conan and the kids say...
they didn't see anyone come in or out of the front door.
Could you explain to us where the murderer came in, then?
What?!
It was locked!
Through the back door.
The door was opened by the victim,
Naoko Kokubo herself.
But how can it be?
The plant is the proof.
(Emi) Of course.
Now I understand why it was there.
(Kogoro) "The victim told her that he would open the back door for her
and ordered him to take the plant and leave it next to the entrance."
I get it.
Leaving after the crime has been easy.
Since the door is semi-automatic,
all he had to do was press the button for it to close automatically.
Oi, Mr. Sayama?
B-but... haven't you seen what I look like?
I can't use my right hand for anything.
That's the truth.
I couldn't kill anyone.
Mr. Mouri, you heard what the doctor told me.
Yes.
It was your last resort to escape.
I'll ask you again.
It was you, who said that this house smelled,
wasn't it, Mr. Sayama?
At Nine, he even imitated your tone of voice.
We'll soon find out what's so bad.
Soc here.
Conan, are you here?
Ah...
Yes.
Okay, I'll try.
That's it.
That's it.

Eh?
Aix...
Now we know how he managed to strangle
and kill the victim using only one hand.
Oh.
Aahg!
Aaaaah!
(Nine: gralla)
(cries) I don't know what happened to me.
It wasn't enough for her to get her money back.
"Post an apology on the door of the bookstore."
"Publish a letter to the newspaper apologizing to me."
"Change the basement and remove the pickled vegetables."
I couldn't take it anymore.
We will question him at the police station, Mr. Sayama.

As cute as the stories she wrote were, weren't they?
I wouldn't have imagined that such a nice old lady like her
could have such a dark side.
It's just that some women on the inside aren't what they seem on the outside.
H-we have.
Huh?
Huh? (Chuckles)
I felt you, Conan.
Ouch.
(Ai) Me too.
Ay, ay, ay!
(Children: laughing)
Traitors...
...deserve the punishment of death.
What I didn't expect was to meet you, Subaru.
