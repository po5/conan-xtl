Stars have a certain appeal.
Whether they are guilty or actors.
No time, Junior Detective League!
We have to be on time on stage!
He looks like a kid but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

"The Tamanosuke Ito theater troupe,
"That traveling theater troupe, had come again."
"This time, to perform 'The Bamboo Cutter'."
"But Renge Kataoka,
"the leading lady who played Princess Shining Night,
"was the victim of a kidnapping."
"The police began the investigation,
"Then I found out that Renge had invented the alleged kidnapping."
"But she wasn't at the place where she was theoretically being held."
"The thing had turned into a real kidnapping."
"The investigation continued.
"And at the same time the curtain of the theater was rising!"
A KIDNAPPING AND A THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE AT THE SAME TIME, (2ND PART)
(Girl) A long, long time ago,
there was an old man who cut bamboo named Okina.
(Sonoko: thinks) "What's wrong?"
"They've raised the curtain, but they don't have the princess."
"Do they know what they're doing?"
They can't... It can't be!
Are you serious?
You're going to make her go on stage?
(Boy) Princess Shining Night is the main character!
And her speeches are very complicated!
(Boy) It's true.
Don't worry.
I've restructured the play.
Hurry up, take it and memorize it like this.
We'll make more interventions from the Megumi to the princess's childhood,
and I've eliminated the adult scenes.
Now, the staging.
The princess is to be illuminated, but her face is not to be seen.
Instead, when Shining Night returns to the moon,
it is imperative that her face be seen.
That is why it is impossible.
(Man) Life and itinerant theater are like that.
-Sometimes things go wrong too.
If we help each other, we can make a good performance come out.
That's a memorable saying.
I'm not passing from your father, but from the previous director.
-We have to have faith that the Renge will come back and we can all pull through together!
Let me do it.
Yeah, but...
"Ran."
The whole audience wants to see the play.
To suspend the performance would be unthinkable.
Let me do it!
Please let me do it!
Ran.
Shall we try, guys?
So willingly...
-You're right.
-Well, maybe so.
Thank you very much!
Thank you very much.
Thank you all very much!
Tamanosuke, one thing:
From the beginning of the play, how long does it take to reach the climax?
Let's see, the whole play is less than 2 hours, therefore....,
the climax is after an hour and a half.
If we find the Renge before that, everything will be fine, right?
Do you have any clues?
Come on, say.
(Ayumi) We're waiting for you!
Eh?
I, well...
Leave it to us!
Junior Detective League, let's go!
(At the same time) Yes!
(Thinking) "Please... I didn't tell you to get involved."
Then, I'll come with you.
(Thinks) "Tamanosuke."
The emperor appears in the middle, that is, about an hour from now.
I'll look for the Renge with you until then.
The mother...!
"In the meantime, the case continued its course."
Gentlemen policemen, would you sit me down?
"We will soon arrive at the parking lot you have indicated."
(Kogoro) It seems that he has been handed an envelope.
(Kogoro) "Change cars and take what I have indicated in this note."
"The number is..."
"It looks like this one here."
(Mobile)
(Ring)
"Inspector, there is a cell phone. I'll take the call."
"Yes, say."
"Yes. Yes."
(Ring) "Okay."
"He told me to go north on Takayama Street."
"I will follow your instructions."

(Girl) That child filled with light a dark home that had already lost hope.
that had already lost hope.
Ran, soon it will be your turn to leave.
(Think) "Calm down.... You have to calm down!"
(Ayumi) This is... the place where they had the Renge closed?
Well, that was when she was pretending to be kidnapped.
That is to say, whoever helped the Renge carry out the fake kidnapping...
is the one who really kidnapped her...
Yeah, I'd say so.
Is this it, boy?
(He thinks) "Yes, I have no doubt."
The question is who has done it, that.
"But there aren't that many people
"That a young girl could ask for help on something like this."
That you see something?
-What is it, Conan?
(thinks) "Wait a minute."
What's the matter?
It's just a few plays, isn't it?
Wait a minute!
I could have sworn there was...
Exactly, that's right!
-Hey?
What's wrong?
-What's wrong? -What's wrong?
What's wrong, with those works?
(Thinking) "But at that time..."
(Onuki) "Eh? No, but..."
"Yes... Yes."
"Okay."
-But... Ins-inspector!
- (horns honking)
He won't escape!
He's screwed us!
Wait, Mouri!
Hold it!
Down that street on the left, Inspector!
Yes!
Takagi?
-Are you all right?
-Mr. Onuki!
Hang in there!
What happened?
He... He told me on my cell phone
to get into this alley to throw the police off the scent...
"And then, when I stopped the car, suddenly..."
I'm really sorry.
Takagi!
Take care of the police cordon!
Very good!
And... the hostage?
He said he'll return her to us
when he sees he can be... totally safe.
Shit, he tricked us!
Ah, listen, Takagi.
He told me at Kogoro to ask you to check something...
"I'm sorry, but it's not a good time."
Eh?
What do you mean?
"The play was also progressing."
(Girl) Princess Radiant Night spoke to them.
To Prince Ishizukuri she asked for the sacred flight of the Buddha stone;
to Prince Kuramochi, a branch of the Horai gem tree;
and from the imperial high councilor, the jewel of the dragon's throat.
(Thinking) "I'm so nervous! Renge, Tamanosuke, come back soon!"
Yes, I haven't even had time to look back.
No!
No trespassing, guys!
Forgive us, please!
It can't go past this point!
Hey, you still haven't stopped her yet, with the beating she does?
Eh?
No... And that was a hair's breadth away from catching it.
Quiet!
I told you you can't come in!
-Hmm? -Huh?
I could swear you're...
-And there's no witness?
Never mind, that.
Are there any witnesses?
Did anyone see her when she was attacking this gentleman?
-Didn't anyone see him?
-Well, it's just that...
(Onak) It was just getting out of the car.
(He thinks) "Are these...
(Onak) "... surveillance cameras?"
Thank you for your cooperation.
Yes.
(Onak) What?
Something?
It's obvious.
You see any clues?
-But, Conan, what do you mean? -But, Conan, what do you mean?
But with this camera you won't see the scene.
I know... But the culprit...
- (bang)
- (Kogoro) You brat!
Stop it at once!
AIII!
Ouch!
Ouch...
Excuse me, Mr. Mouri, I can explain it to you.
I knew you'd make one.
Eh?
Where did you go?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiii...
What's wrong with you?
Mr. Mouri!
Yes?
(Kogoro voice) Inspector Takagi.
Tell everyone outside to come in here.
(Kogoro's voice) Eh?
Yes.
And also... I must ask you for something else.
Uh... Yes.
Mouri, what did you want to tell us?
Yes.
I already have it on screen.
Inspector Takagi...
This was sent to us from the investigation department.
The issue here is the chimney we see in the picture.
This chimney was thrown to the ground 4 days ago.
How!
The girl from the public toilets told us that it had been thrown to the ground.
This means that the images do not correspond to the time of the abduction.
Therefore, it means...
Only that the culprit prepared a way to send the message,
he could make sure that he would be present when it was received.
What you are trying to say is... that the culprit is from their environment?
Inspector Takagi...
Yes.
Mr. Mouri asked me and I checked.
"The sending of the recording has been ordered by cell phone,

"And it was done by someone who was present when the message came through."
Please don't make such jokes.
Now, I want you to look at the security camera footage.
Mr. Onuki, you said that you misled the police...
because the culprit gave you these instructions over the phone.
And when was this?
Of course it was.
What do you mean, when?
"Well, the moment I stopped at the traffic light."
"It seems to me that the inspectors felt it."
"But we didn't hear the culprit's voice."
Th-that's normal..., I was talking on the phone.
But did you really get this call?
Don't-don't talk nonsense!
Then how come the murderer took the cell phone with the ransom?
(Onuki) Eh?
Well, I...
(Onuki) "Eh? No. But..."
(Onuki) "Yes. Yes."
(Onuki) "Okay."
This is...!
As you can see, he wasn't talking on the cell phone.
"If we had looked at the cell phone,
"We would have known that there was no call received at that time."
"That's why he didn't leave it."
"It's probably with the rescue somewhere near here."
We just do a search, and we'll get the results right away.
But now the important thing is that we rescued the victim.
What do you mean?
The kidnapper knows exactly what I'm talking about.
I don't know anything!
I don't know what you're talking about!
(Father) "Onuki, don't play dumb!"
(Father's voice) "Where is she, my daughter? Where did you leave the Renge?"
Pre-president !?
"If anything happens to my daughter, you will pay dearly!"
I have not done anything!
I have only helped the young lady because she asked me to.
He has helped?
(Kogoro voice) Yes, at first it was all a farce.
But whoever helped the Renge would be marked by the fact.
That is to say, he would look like a real kidnapper!
That's why, even though he knew he was making a mistake, he didn't want to bring her back safe and sound,
I didn't want to bring her back safe and sound.
Had he planned this from the beginning?
I don't know anything!
I don't know anything they tell me!
I will say no more!
Stay where you are, Mr. Onuki!
(Girl) To protect his beloved Kaguya,
the emperor arranged 2,000 soldiers at the cutter's house.
Don't worry.
We promise we'll find the Renge!
Trust us!
- (at the same time) Yes!
-Detective League, let's go!
"Little brother, come back soon, please!"
I'm sure it was here.
I've found it!
It's blades of grass.
But it hasn't rained.
How come there's mud in this area?
Don't these grasses grow near water?
That's right!
(Tamanosuke) "I won't turn it back!"
(Think) "In Tamanosuke!"
Princess, how would I be able to get you back to the moon?
(Think) "No! Impossible! Really?"
If in order to marry you I have to leave the country and parents,
I'm prepared to give up.
(Thinking) "Tamanosuke's eyes...
"They don't look at Princess Radiant Night, nor do they look at me."
Please believe in me.
I want you and me to be together.
Kaguya..., together forever.
It's unlikely that the kidnapper chose a faraway place...
to let her die.
Therefore, he must have left her near the place where he kept her confined.
A place where there is water!
Surely, the place is...
(Genta) Trust us!
(Girl) From the light of noon, we pass to the light that pierces the night.
The envoy of the moon climbs up on a cloud and prepares to descend to earth.
(Ayumi) "Conan, I've found her!"
Look at me, Renge.
Are you all right?
And the play!
What happened to the play?
(Tamanosuke) Au, Kaguya!
Come on.
Come with me to the moon!
(Audience: expressions of surprise)
(Thinking) "It's all over already?"
Ah, I don't even want to see it!
La Renge?
The Renge!
No, I can't!
With all the trouble I've caused you, now I can't... I can't!
But what do you say, now, Renge?!
You must not give up!
Sign up for yourself and for Tamanosuke!
I can understand you.
"Ran."
Renge!
(Audience: exclamations of admiration)
We'll meet again.
I'm sure..., princess.
(Thinking) "No, Renge!"
Yes.
Yes!
(Audience: applauds)
It's made me a little angry, but... Ah, what a thrill!

"After that, they detained the Onuki secretary....
"And also recover the ransom money."
"And in the same way as Princess Radiant Night,
"Once she returned home,
"The Renge managed to convince her father."
"She returned to the company,
"and is now with Tamanosuke performing around the country."
"And that also meant that a new curtain was raised to life."
"To Tamanosuke and the Renge together."
Why didn't you take us with you to see it?
-We wanted to see the fireworks!
-It's not fair, you've seen it alone!
(Think) "Huh? What is this? What does this mean?"
Please help us!
"They've murdered a person and now he's attacked me and the Sonoko!"
And the next Conan:
"The surprising enigma of the temple arcade, (Part 1)."
