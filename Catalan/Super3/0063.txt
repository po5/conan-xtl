DETECTIVE CONAN
The Gomera Monster Murder Case
(Man) Cut!
Very good!
We give it for good!
(At once) It's been great!
(Man) - Oysters.
In Gomera live! -It's awesome!
It's very strong!
Doctor Agasa!
Long time no see!
Hello, Mikami!
Were these the kids who wanted to see the set?
-Who is this gentleman?
He's a good friend of mine, as well as the creator of Gomera.
Daisuke Mikami, the director.
Nice to meet you, my pretties.
How, everything?
Uh, would you like to see en Gomera up close?
What to say?
What to say?
Can you?
Now let's stop for a while.
Just as long as we don't shoot, okay?
-Viscaaa! -Viscaaa!
It's too small, this building.
Hey, Genta!
Hey, Genta!
Look at it!
There it is!
In Gomera has broken in half!
In Gomera has given birth to a man!
It's a disguise,
and they've used these models
to film the scenes that go through the center of the city.
But they are very well done.
Watch.
Hey!
Don't touch them with dirty hands!
You'll get it if you break anything.
Daisuke!
Where were you?
Control these kids!
Alright, alright.
Daisuke, do you want me to take care of myself?
I don't do anything else until this afternoon.
Thank you very much, Shugo.
-In Gomera he's a friend of the children.
Whenever he goes crazy in Gomera, it's always because of some bad adult.
And the one who calms him down in Gomera when he is angry
is this magic fairy, Emera.
Oi, kids?
Isn't the Emera the fairy that only comes out when the data is very bad?
Yes, that's right.
She tricks us!
The Emera is a very little girl.
-It looks just like her. -But it's not a big mass, is it?
Shut up!
You have a fantastic team.
Yes, they all cherish in Gomera.
They are like a family.
They've been making Gomera films for 10 years.
Exactly, but this year will be the last.
Monster movies are very childish.
They have gone out of fashion.
The music is old-fashioned, the action is always the same.
and the set and special effects are very expensive.
The fairy who debuted at 14 is 24.
It's time to move on.
By the way, guys,
the copy of the scenes we finished yesterday is ready.
Why not go see it?
-You don't want to see it, Mr. Osamu? -You don't want to see it, Mr. Osamu? -I don't feel like it.
Shall we have lunch, Tomomi?
We need to talk about it.
Thanks, but I'll stay here.
Tomomi, what do you mean, "that topic"?
It's about the next movie.
He wants me to star in it.
After making me look bad, he wants to have lunch together.
Wow, you already have a job!
Lucky you.
Look at us.
We don't even know what we'll eat tomorrow.
Oi, Shugo?
Ah, well, Osamu-san offered me a part in the next movie.
Oh, gee!
Am I the only one who won't have a job?
Anyway, I'm off to the screening room.
Shugo, thanks for taking care of the kids.
(Genta) Aaaaaaaaaaah!
This is full of monsters!
They are all the ones that Gomera has been defeating!
Eh...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I didn't think you were so scared.
This hand, what's it for?
It's Gomera's hand!
It's for close-ups.
There is a head with remote control.
-He wants to see? (Vez) Yes!
-I'll get it. (Vez) -Thank you.
Too bad they don't want to make more Gomera movies.
That man said they're too expensive, right?
It must be because of the food.
In Gomera it is immense.
(Think) "What donkeys they are."
(Shout)
Mr...
Mr. Matsui!
What's happened?
Mr. Matsui!
It was in Gomera.
In Gomera?
In Gomera it was in this room, he had a knife in his hand and...
Where did he go? He fled through that door.
I got it! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Espereu's-e!

Children, come back!
-Others, where are we?
-You can see the set from here.
Look, there's someone there.
(Genta) Isn't that the producer we saw before?
Who's there?
Shugo, is that you?
Hey, hey...
Conan, come back!
Wait, wait, wait!
(thinks) "It's useless. It's death."
"Footprints!"
"He's fled through that door!"
(Genta) Hey!
Conan!
What's the matter?
What's going on here?
In Gomera, have you seen her?
Yes!
He's gone there!
Eh!
But it's not in Shugo?
(Ayumi) In Gomera it's not here.
It must be here.
There was no place to hide, to the stairs.
-(Ayumi) Maybe he went flying. In Gomera he doesn't know how to fly.
(She thinks) "He has thrown himself down! Oysters! He has committed suicide!"
"He's not here. How can that be?"
Where were you at the time of the crime, around 2/4 of 12?
I was alone in a room on the second floor,
reviewing the script of the chapter.
Is there no one who can confirm it?
No.
Director, you're very sweaty, what's wrong with you?
Ah... nothing, my boy, I always sweat a lot.
Let's see, Mr. Matsui,
when you entered the warehouse,
the murderer was already wearing the disguise, right?
Yes, yes, yes...
Are you all right, sir?
I've made a temporary cure, but you should go to the hospital.
I don't think he could have committed any murder, with this leg.
Miss Sakaguchi.
What were you doing here?
I came to get the producer.
He wanted me to look at yesterday's working copy,
which had turned out very well, according to him.
The work print?
It's the film he just shot that hasn't been edited yet.
I didn't imagine that...
You've seen the killer disguised as Gomera from behind, haven't you?
Ah...
Yes... I don't know who he was, but how fast he was running...
However he was running?
Yes, it was a little difficult for him to run.
He must not have been used to carrying it.
The only thing that the door naturally is in Shugo, sir.
So apart from Mr.
Matsui, Ms.
Sakaguchi and the principal,
everyone was in the projection room.
That's right.
I was also watching the copy.
Eh ?!
Who are you?
My name is Agasa.
I'm Shinichi's cool neighbor teacher.
Ah, yes!
I've already heard about you!
You're always coming up with strange inventions!
Yes... Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Hey, don't look at me...
The whole team was in the projection room?
She's the only one who went out, inspector.
But there's another person who also left.
What other person?
If I'm not mistaken, it was...
I don't know anything about this painting!
Ah... exactly, it was him!
Knowing that we were filming the afternoon,
he'd be a fool to leave a pot of paint on the set!
Yes, I left the room
because I saw something I didn't like on the set.
You mustn't suspect me, must you, sir?
It's only been out 4 or 5 minutes.
(Thinking) "You wouldn't have had time to disguise yourself, kill somebody
and get back to the screening room."
I want to know who left this pot of paint here.
Ryota, wasn't it you, who left it?
Of course, Ryota,
after the morning rehearsal, you left it here.
Ah, that's right!
I didn't remember!
And now!
Why didn't Mr. Matsui come to see the copy?
Matsui?
I do not know!
In Shugo never wants to come.
Poor Shugo was beginning to be very fed up with en Gomera.
What?!
Mr. Matsui?
Ah... it seems that lately,
he was telling the producer that he had had enough of en Gomera,
and that he wanted to do other things.
(Thinking) "I don't understand."
"Where did he go, the killer?"
"We followed his tracks down the stairs..."
What do you think, if we are going to bury in Gomera now?
"And we've gone out on the roof through that door."
Come on, come on, Conan, let's bury him...
Shut up!?
I'm not getting upset, now, Ayumi!
Hey, Conan, don't get mad like in Gomera!
Eh?
Like in Gomera?
That's right!
Look at this!
There is no trace of the tail, right?
This means that in Gomera he went up the stairs in anger.
He lifts the tail, when he gets angry!
(Think) "Wait a minute! It could be that..."
Hey!
What's the matter?

Come back here, Conan!
-What did you see?
-What's the matter?
Conan, say!
Conan...
(thinks) "I know how he did it!"
May I know why they won't let us on the set?
No way, it's not a place to play.
Get over there!
Oysters!
There's more, here.
(Thinking) "I know what I'll do."
Hey! I've neglected something inside.
May I know what's wrong?
Ah, Conan!
It's all right.
We'll take Shugo to the hospital.
He won't be able to play Gomera for a long time.
He won't be able to play Gomera or anything else, this boy!
Y?
Eh ?!
Have you solved the case yet?
(Adult voice) I know how he did it, but I don't know who the killer is.
Why did Mr. Matsui have to attack?
Why did Mr. Matsui have to attack?
He has not entered the warehouse to look for a weapon
and found it by chance in Shugo?
They are joke weapons.
You can't kill anyone with it.
Ouch!
(He thinks) "Wait a minute, this means that the murderer is..."
"He's the only one who could have done it."
Shinichi, what's wrong with you?
I don't have it, the anesthetic watch.
What?
Ouch!
Professor, professor.
(We need to talk.
Inspector, we'll take Shugo to the hospital right now, okay?
Okay.
Just a moment!
We have him right here, gentlemen!
I know who the killer is!
What do you say, now?
(Quietly) Doctor, just move your mouth, I'll do the talking.
Very well, but make me look good, eh?
All right, Doctor Agasa,
if you know who the murderer is, you'll have to explain it to us,
and clarify how he disappeared from the roof, the murderer.
Special effects!
Isn't it true that they are often used?
The three-dimensional effect!
Surely, the figure of the murderer was only a projection.
(Shorty) True that it was that?
What s'empatolla?
I've run into him!
It was no special effect.
Yes... it's true.
Ignore the... (Agasa voice) It's a montage.
A very, very simple montage.
Miss Tomomi and the children have only seen it
until he knocked down the corner.
After that, we don't know if the murderer went up the stairs.
But, Dr. Agasa, there were footprints on the stairs!
Yes, it's true...
(Quietly) Move your mouth when I speak.
Yes.
(quietly) All right.
The prints had been prepared previously, the murderer!
But only those on the stairs.
What?
People in this studio don't just go up to the roof,
and the killer knew no one would see the prints on the stairs.
He must have used the legs of the disguise to make them.
In the hallway you can see the tail track,
but not on the stairs.
The killer has gone toward the stairs and removed the disguise.
He has gone in the opposite direction of the footprints
and entered the room below.
He set fire to the costume and threw it away.
Of course! I get it!
Eh ?!
I mean no...
But how can it be, that the killer prepared the prints
if he didn't know what color paint they would use?
-Couldn't he have known? -No.
Coincidentally, I forgot the can of paint on the set earlier.
This theory doesn't make any sense.
It's the theory of these two, the one that has neither head nor tail.
Because it is a lie invented to protect the murderer!
A lie!
That pot of paint was left by the murderer before committing the crime!
He needed it to make the prints.
So, this couple knows who the murderer is.
Mr. Adachi must have played along with Mr.
Adachi must have played along with the Tomomi,
but the Tomomi knows who he is.
She must have figured it out when she ran into him.
All right, so let's see, who is the murderer?
The murderer is one of these:
Director Mikami or M.
Matsui, who were not in the screening room,
or the Tomomi or M.
Adachi, who have been out.
The Adachi has been out 4 or 5 minutes, he cannot be the killer.
The Tomomi, who has seen the killer running away, is also ruled out.
The director and Matsui are left.
Conan, it can't be.
Matsui is badly wounded and Mikami is a friend of mine.
He's someone no one would have suspected.
Exactly, the murderer is... (Ayumi) Hey!
Conan, what are you doing with that?
(Agasa voice) Don't get in the way.
Go on, out, out.
Out, out?
Ah, a sticky fly... Out, out.

All right, doctor, who is the murderer?
The murderer is Mr....
Matsui!
What nonsense!
It's impossible, that he ran away with this wound!
That is, if it were true that he already had the wound before the murder.
So the wound...
That's right.
After committing the murder and throwing away the disguise,
he went back to the warehouse
and stabbed herself with another knife.
But the children also saw it, the wound, before the murder.
How could it be? It would be joke blood.
This is a movie studio.
It's easy to find.
But after seeing Mr.
Matsui wounded,
the kids have gone behind in Gomera, towards the set.
and there's only one way from the warehouse to the set.
How did you advance them, in Matsui?
If you go out the warehouse door, you have the set in front of you.
When the kids are gone,
he went to the other side and also reached the set.
There, he disguised himself and killed the producer.
This set-up required witnesses to follow the tracks.
For this he chose the children as witnesses,
because he knew they wouldn't run as fast as an adult.
Exactly, children are very curious.
If you tell them not to go somewhere, they go.
He has burned the costume to remove the sweat from the dress.
What proof is there, that Mr.
Matsui is the murderer?
The knife he has used to stab
is in a box of accessories in the warehouse.
He could not hide it anywhere else,
because when he stuck the knife in, he couldn't move.
And another thing: the T-shirt he is wearing.
The T-shirt?
The killer has run a lot with the costume on.
Evidently, the T-shirt should be soaked with sweat.
Well, it doesn't look sweaty at all, this shirt.
Of course it doesn't!
Because he's changed his clothes.
What?
He's changed his clothes? The children can confirm it to us.
(Conan voice) Yes, it's true.
Don't you remember?
The Ayumi has poured the juice on his shirt!
Oh, how strange, the stain has disappeared.
Where did you change?
He was hurt and couldn't move.
Hey, little one, you mean you're not badly fixed?
Maybe it fell on the floor, the juice, and didn't stain it.
Miss, I could have sworn that...
You're sure?
Are you sure?
Think about it... please...
Please, handsome...
(Matsui) Tomomi... that's enough...
The boy is absolutely right, Mr. Inspector.
I've changed my clothes.
The shirt is in my bag.
Go look!
Why did you kill the producer?
Didn't he want to hire you for the next film?
I wasn't looking forward to doing something else.
I was completely obsessed with Gomera.
But how can this be?
Weren't you sick of playing Gomera?
This is a story the producer made up.
There was something wrong with me.
Everyone was trying to cheer me up, but I could see that everyone was sad.
I found out what was going on 15 days ago.
I went to talk to the producer,
but he told me that he couldn't turn back now,
that he had already prepared the campaign "the last battle of en Gomera".
Come on, man, you can count!
You'll see.
In a year's time nobody will remember that rubber monster!
Why didn't you tell me about it, Shugo?
I didn't see myself capable.
It was the last shooting,
and everyone was so willing, it affected me a lot.
But I have no regrets.
After this, Gomera's death scene will take a long time to shoot.
I'm just worried that these children witnessed the murder.
Hey, Tomomi, is it true?
Have you seen Shugo inside Gomera's costume?
No.
I didn't see him.
He was going too fast.
What's that?
How did you know?
Even though I didn't see him, I recognized his movements.
I know him very well.
We've been working together for 10 years, me and Shugo.
He is my partner.

they made a montage with film fragments."

"Mr. Teroaka was about to cut down Mr. Matsuyama,

"Was it an accident?"
There is something that the newspapers have not mentioned yesterday's incident.
We found the fingerprints of 3 people, on the gun.
