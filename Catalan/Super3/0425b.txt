Victory, sincerity, tests for truth.
An inexhaustible drive to try to be the best!
I finally get in touch with the Men in Black Organization.
Moments of tension.
Finally, a terrifying target is revealed!
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

WITHIN ARM'S REACH OF THE ORGANIZATION, (2ND PART)
Ki - bi - wa...?
What the hell is this?
How strange!
What does this word mean?
(Think) "Bi? How come I read that character as 'mi'?"
Ki - bi - wa...
Ki: Thursday;
bi: beauty;
wa: Japanese cuisine... Mmm...
"This sounds familiar..."
Miss Queen,
have you done any programs where you use code words like these?
Well, no.
Rather, these letters, couldn't they be the name of a person?
"A person's? A person's name?"
(Phone)
Inspector Megre, first investigation section.
Hello, Conan!
(phone ringing) Huh?
One second, I think he's there.
Hold on a second.
Mmm...
Let's see, to change the extension...
- (phone) -And that's what happened.
Takagi.
Your extension.
Yes, Takagi! Takagi!
Yes?
Ins... Inspector, didn't I give you my extension... number?
Ha-ha-ha!
Aw, so much for that!
Oh, that's right.
You have a call from Conan for extension 1.
What?
Is it Conan?
What do you want now...?
At Conan?
Investigator Takagi, say.
Hello, Investigator Takagi.
I'd like to ask you a question, if possible.
The night before last, did you enter apartment 305
of an apartment block in Haido City?
Did you?
Oh, yes, I did, Conan.
Mm?
What was the reason?
You see, this vehicle was underneath...
(Flow) I can't explain the reason... You already know...
I wasn't by any chance supposed to be guarding the apartment
of the apartment building across the street?
What?!
Mmmm?
Is there a problem?
No, it's nothing important, really sir....
(Thinking) "What a headache that must be?"
To tell you the truth, you nailed it.
The ex-promise of a murder suspect
lives on that floor of the apartment block.
Since there was the possibility of the suspect making contact,
"We asked the building manager for permission
"And we were watching her from there."
I was thinking about it...
Eh?
Did you know that?
Well, in the end, the suspect, we saw him arrest Toriya,
and the surveillance order was cancelled around midnight.
But since we're still investigating the case,
I'd swear that the management company was told
not to say anything at all.
Hey, how did you know that I was there on surveillance that night?
Investigator Takagi,
while keeping watch, scribbled something on the balcony glass.
There put Miwako Takagi, right?
Eeeeeeh ?!
Takagi, what the hell is wrong with you now?
-Takagi...-What's wrong with him?
Oh, s-sorry!
"This boy has become quite deranged."
Conan, I beg you.
Don't say anything about this, to her.
Please, please, please!
All right, no problem for me.
But the Ran and Mr. Mouri are also here by my side,
and they've heard everything!
Eeeeh?
Don't smoke!
Takagi!
That is to say, while investigator Takagi was watching...
the suspect's expromise,
"All of a sudden," recalled Investigator Sato...
"And wrote the name she would have after marrying him...
"On the glass of the balcony door."
Just after that she received a call from Inspector Megre
telling her that the suspect had been arrested
and that he was to return immediately.
So, leaving in a hurry,

"He neglected to erase the name he put on the glass."
Now I get it!
And then, throughout these 3 days,
Takagi's "Taka" and "Miwako's" "ko" have been fading away.
What a joke!
This is a real tease!
Please forgive me!
But it all does so much for him, it's so nice.
It's true, you would never imagine...
that a police investigator could be so cute.
You're right, you're right.
But now we're back to square one, don't you think?
Oh, yes, you're right.
Yes..., you're right, and tomorrow is one of those Saturdays.
The only thing we can do now is to catch the culprit red-handed.
Queen! -Oh. -Oh.
Yes?
Please allow us to stay here tonight.
I will prove to you that I, the great investigator Kogoro Mouri,
can catch this degenerate tomorrow!
Would you like me to help you sort them out?
Ah, don't worry.
Tomorrow is the day for collecting recyclable waste.
and I'm rounding up the magazines and newspapers that are no good
to tie them up with string and throw them away.
With the profession I have,
I always have to look at a lot of publications.
Oh...!
Are you tidying up?
Oh!
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"!
What fond memories.
I read it in high school and it scared the hell out of me.
Conan, you know the story? Yes.
The story is about Dr. Henry Jekyll,
"A peaceful person who took a substance
"that he himself had invented and became Edward Hyde,"
a man of evil nature, right?
Wow, you're a real smart-ass!
He-he-he-he-he-he-he! Hush, little boy!
This little brat only learns everything from strange things....
Phew, he's heavy!
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
That's it.
Does he always leave them out there?
Yes.
If I leave them out here,
I can take them with me to throw them away when I go out in the morning.
so I don't get careless.
Oh, I get it.
This apartment faces the corner,
and it's no bother to the other neighbors,
because I only leave them for one night.
Tuesday is also waste collection day?
Yes, combustible waste.
And I also leave the Tuesday waste out here the night before.
"Right. Now I understand..."
Tell me, even if we find out who the culprit is,
you promise me you won't get too upset, miss?
I'm sure he's a great admirer of yours!
Of course he's an admirer!
The guy is a stalker!
(Kogoro: snores)
(snoring)
Wake up, Mr. Mouri.
Mr. Mouri!
(snoring) Eh?
Mr. Kogoro, wake up, it's time...
(Ding-dong)
It's him!
Miss Queen, stay here!
You bastard!
Wait and see!
Now I'll get you!
I'll teach you a lesson...
Eh?
But, bread... father?!
False alarm.
There's nobody here... Ha-ha-ha...
What?
It can't be true!
It can't be true.
How can it be true?
I can't believe it.
But why?
Tell me, father!
Why is that?
Well, I do not know!
Yes, you do.
Right here!
What... What is it there?
If it's the magazines!
Co... Conan...
I mean back here.
Donkey!
How can an adult hide in a place like this?
Nonsense!
Eeeeeh?
Oh!
It's a child! Eh?
Coi as a child!
It's you, who rings the doorbell every Saturday?!
Of course it is!
I get it!
We had not seen her because I was a kid.
I never thought
that someone could hide in a place like this.
Now I get it...
Two weeks ago Saturday you're not going to nibble
because there weren't the stacks of magazines in front of the door, were you?
That week the Queen wasn't at home for a business trip
and surely she didn't have any magazines to throw away!
Hey!
What were you wearing on your head?
Why the hassle?
You're supposed to be an elementary school student, no shit!
Let's see, if you don't tell us, you leave us no choice.
We'll take you to the police station
and you'll have to explain everything to your parents and the police.
Just a moment, Mr. Mouri.
I think I was ringing the bell to wake her up.
What?
Because Miss Mizunashi...
won't be late for "Mornings Live 7."
Surely, this child believed...

that she no longer went on "Ma√±anas en directo 7" because it was hard for her to get up in the morning.
because it was hard for her to get up in the mornings.
That's why on Saturdays
I would ring the doorbell at 2/7 at 7 a.m. to wake her up!
Since she doesn't have class on Saturdays,
she can confirm if she is on the program or not,
if she rushes home after ringing the doorbell
after ringing the doorbell!
But it looks like someone also rang the doorbell on a Tuesday, remember?
Don't tell me you're going to ring the bell at school!
I think that day was a holiday.
There are 3 days in a row of holidays in October.
Did you know that?
This second Monday of the month is the sports holiday.
If that Monday is the school sports festival,
elementary students don't have school the next day.
This means that you put sleeping pills in her there
so that she could sleep well and could get off early the next day?
Yes.
The mother always said that if she didn't take she couldn't sleep well.
But why did you do it?
Why are you so much for me?
Because you look like you.
You look so much like my mother...
My mother... died last year in a traffic accident.
That's why... I... I...
Little boy...
I understand that you might feel lonely because you don't have your mother anymore...
But if you keep clinging to your mother,
you'll only make her worry up there in heaven.
You are a child, so you have to be strong....
and let your mother rest in peace.
So don't come back here ever again.
I'm telling you this for your mother's sake... and also for your own.
Have you understood?
Goodbye, Queen!
Farewell...
Excuse me, a long time ago...
I had a little brother about your age.
Ah, let's leave that.
I'll have to pay your fee, Mr. Kogoro.
Au, there's no need!
Besides, you invited us to dinner, remember?
But please, as a token of our appreciation.
Really... really?
Well, then..,
I'll send my bank account number to your cell phone,
if that's okay.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
"Au, go..."
Coi, what a ridiculous research case.
But it's to rejoice.
At last he wasn't a deranged stalker.
"Eh? Rain?"
"What a mess! I didn't get the microphone back!"
Oh, no!
Conan, what's wrong with you?
It's... it's just that I have to go back to the apartment;
I've neglected something at that girl's place...
What?
What a mug.
Father, come in, if you want.
I'll go with Conan.
No need for that!
I'll go look right now!
Eh?
Conan!
Hey, we'll be waiting for you in the parking lot!
"Eh? These footsteps I feel..."
"Miss Mizunashi stepped on it..."
"# (Cell phone: melody playing) #"
"Eh? She has connected a cell phone."
(Key in: melody "Seven Little Crows")

"The 'Seven Little Crows'?"
"No... it can't be!"
"Don't tell me she..."
Ah, sorry.
I had a little problem and had to disconnect the cell phone.
Everything's fine, it's nothing to worry about...
Right now...
"I've updated the person involved with a message."
"Don't tell me that... It can't be..."
Yes... No problem.
We met at 10 o'clock as agreed.
Gin.
"Don't tell me that...!"
"Why?"
What?
What did you say?!
Hey, Shinichi, are you serious?
Yes, I'm sure!
I've found a member of the organization
after a series of unthinkable coincidences!
(Pip-pip)
"Demon... The movement of the transmitter has accelerated!"
"He has climbed into a car!"
"Doctor! Aphan s and come and get me with your Beetle!"
"Naturally, Haibara must not know anything!"
Mmmm?
Eh?
Understood.
Shinichi...
Yes, sorry doctor, I'm in Haido now.
"You won't get away from me!"
Eh?
Conan?!
Did you find what you were looking for?
What?
And now... what's the matter?
In Conan says that he has met Dr. Agasa by chance
and that now they are going together in the Tropical World park.
Change!
Let them be!
Now it's raining.
What's on their minds, these?
I'll call you when I have to go home!
"Wait!"

(Ai) It makes sense.
Coincidentally, he has met the anchorwoman of a newscast,
"She asked you to do a job and you went to her apartment."
"There you have stuck a microphone and a transmitter with a chewing gum on the wall.
"For the investigation of the case,
"And it came off the wall."
"But, coincidentally, it has stuck on the presenter's shoe."
"And what's more coincidentally, she's from the organization."
This is it, isn't it?
Hey, doctor!
It seems to me that I had made it quite clear to you not to let her come!
This is easy to say, but you know....
And then?
Are you sure that the presenter Queen Mizunashi is one of them?
That she belongs to the organization?
Yes.
She has sent a message to the phone number in her head.
And the person who called it back I'm sure was called...
Gin! You can see that.
That's nothing.
Lucky you...
Now you have a lead on them thanks to a series of coincidences.
No.
Quite the opposite.
It's quite the opposite.
It couldn't be worse.
Think about it carefully.
If they find the bug and the transmitter,
it's only logical that they'll try to find out who planted it.
And the first person they will suspect
is the person who has been at the presenter's house until a while ago.
Detective Kogoro Mouri!
Hey, don't tell me that...
Yes.
Even if Mr. Kogoro would have left her there,
because she would have sent him to investigate the case in question,
there is no denying the slightest possibility
that he overheard the whole conversation.
And if this has happened, surely these people?
They will take it upon themselves to silence Kogoro Mouri.
And if necessary,
they will do the same to all the people around him
without... not even a single one.
This can't be! In other words.
The more information we receive about them through that microphone,
the more we'll be risking Kogoro's and our own necks.
We cannot waste any more time,
we must recover the microphone soon, before those people find it.
But I don't quite understand.
The news anchorwoman has asked Detective Mouri...
to catch the person who was ringing the doorbell and running away.
And it turned out that the suspect was a child.
If she was one of them, she wouldn't have asked, that's for sure.
Yes.
That's very strange to me too.
Huh?
The movement of the transmitter has slowed down.
Also, I feel its motor with a kind of echo.
"This means... it's entered some covered parking lot."
This means he's probably going to meet them
somewhere in that building.
XXT!
He's approaching something.
"Is it a car?"
I feel... this distinctive choppy sound.
And that sound of the engine revving up
is typical of vehicles with a horizontally opposed engine.
Hey, don't tell me!
Yes, the only cars equipped with these engines are Volkswagens,
the Subaru... or the vehicle that man loves the most...
Undoubtedly, the Porsche.
What's up, Kir?
You promised me you'd be within 10.
"Gin!"
I'm sorry.
It seemed to me that a vehicle was following me,
so I tried to get rid of it just in case.
"It can't be. Are you talking about our car?"
"We were more than 600 meters away from your car."
"It can't possibly be ours."
Are you sure it shouldn't be a problem?
Yes... I was worrying too much about nothing.
So, can you keep in its holster...
this Beretta I'm pointing the other way?
If you shoot me because you don't trust me,
you won't be able to kill DJ.
"DJ... Which DJ?"
(CLEC)
Okay, anyway we have...
this building covered for 500 meters around.
If a strange car approaches us, I'll know in a matter of seconds.
Doctor, leave the car at the curb, no rush.
After stopping, put on your hood and get out of the car.
Then pretend to examine the car.
Au, eagerness!
OK...
Now, the last confirmation.
Start.
Time, 1:00 p.m.
Place, Eddy P...
I, as your interviewer, will lead in DJ at the agreed place...
(Woman) Yes, exactly.
We'll be waiting for you, Kir.
You do your job.

Take the shot in the middle of my scope and turn me on.
I can't wait!
Caram, Chianti.
In Korn it's also with you?
This is promising.
"Kir, Chianti, Korn... But how many are there?"
I'm counting on you...
Our exploits never see the light of the sun,
but when we fail..., the world knows quickly, like lightning.
Whether we succeed or fail, the world does not and will not know....
That's how the organization works.
Yes... It is also true.
Let's get going!
It's almost time.
fanyeu's-e to do their job.
I save myself the trouble... of having to intervene?
"Vermot!"
Ep, wait a minute!
What's the meaning of all this?
Why do we have this woman here?!
Nobody told me that!
How could they have included this woman in the mission?
She took in Calvados and left him to die like a dog!
Chianti, get back to the car immediately.
The Vermott is just here in case.
But, listen...
Listen, he gave us these orders himself.
It's also a hell of a place to be Eddy P.
Truly, this is the best place to go hunting.
Huh?
What's that supposed to mean?
Maybe you should study a little history..., Vodka.
Eh?
Yes...
The most serious problem we have is the rain.
(Queen) "Don't worry..."
"The weatherman said that it spreads after noon."
"Coi, it's raining so hard that... it doesn't feel good."
Haibara!
What do you know?
Who is DJ?
What place is Eddy P?
You have to know!
It's what they have said!
It's a code word, right?
I do not know.
I don't know what DJ they're talking about,
but if Eddy P is a place,
P is surely a parking lot or a park.
Tell me, do you know who Kir, Chianti and Korn are?
I don't remember any Kir,
but I had heard of Chianti and Korn.
They are very skilled snipers.
"So, these people are planning to assassinate a person."
Hey, what's going on?!
Don't tell me those two are also?
(Transmitter: interference)
Damn it, I don't have enough information.
I have to get closer.
"The position of the microphone is 500 meters north-northeast from here."
"It must be the subway parking lot of that building."
Haibara, you wait here with the doctor!
Hey!
Stop it!
Where are you going? You listen to me and wait for me!
(Woman) You've come this far.
("Thank you for everything")
