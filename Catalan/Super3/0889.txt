(Piar)
Good morning... Eh ?!
Good morning, Conan!
Good morning, Ay!
Aaa... hello..., good morning.
You were both in the library, weren't you, when he showed up at the Kaito Kid?
And Dr. Agasa was there too, wasn't he?
- (Ayumi) Conan, did you discover him?
-(Ayumi) Who did he disguise himself as, this time?
(Mitsuhiko) You should explain everything in detail.
(All 3) What?
What are you saying?
That in Kaito Kid he pretended to be Dr. Agasa?
And how come you won't recognize him?
Yes...
Because he had his knees bent.
So he made it look like he was just as tall as the doctor.
Impressive, in Kaito Kid!
As always.
Dr. Agasa really stunned him with a stun gun
and left him tied up inside a toilet compartment.
He talked and moved just like him.
He looked exactly like him.
How fortunate!
How I wish the Kaito Kid would disguise himself as me, at least once.
-And me!
-And me too.
(Shinichi, thinks) "He already disguised himself, as you, once."
(Shinichi, thinks) "Good morning!
Good morning, everyone!
Have a seat, please.
-Hey, Conan.
- (all) Eh?
No.
Do you know who this girl is?
- (boy) Look, look...
- (girl) Who is it?
(girl) Good morning.
I introduce a new teacher, Miss Wakasa.
From today, Miss Wakasa will be...
the support teacher of your class.
-Aaa...
-Whenever you like, Miss Wakasa.
My name is... Rumi Wakasa.
I-I'm 10 years older than Miss Kobayashi.
I'm... Nice to meet you.
-Oh!
-Huh?
What's gone wrong, Miss Wakasa?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
It's strange, this late in the school year to start a new teacher.
Yes, it's true.
There are a lot of new students in this class, like you and me.
Maybe that's why.
Because there are more students than in other classes.
You never know.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
- (children: laughing)
(Shinichi voice) "A new day begins with a splendid sun."
"It's the time for love and mysteries."
"Miss Wakasa is a little clumsy."
"What kind of influence will she have? The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The case of the skeleton and the new teacher (part one)."
(Ayumi) Eh?
Plaster?
Why do you need it?
Because today at the last minute it's P.E.
and we're going to play graveyard.
I wanted to take advantage of the lunch hour to mark the lines of the field
and get everything ready to play.
But I've seen that there's practically no plaster left in the classroom,
and I couldn't find any more in the storeroom.
Hey, why don't you see if there is any in the old shed?
Maybe you'll find some.
They used to store material.
What was that?
That half-destroyed cover that looks like there are ghosts?
One day they told me
that a teacher got locked out and ended up starving to death.
Yes, me too.
"Help me, help me! I'm so hungry! I need eel!"
- (Ayumi) Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-Hay-hi-hi-hi-hi!
How can a ghost ask for eel to eat?
What's the matter?
That he doesn't know where it is, the cutlery?
- "But" what?
-Yes, I think I do know where it is... -Yes, I think I do know where it is...
Well, that... that is...
What's the matter?
Do you want us to accompany you because you're afraid?
What's the matter?
Well..., yes.
I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry I asked for your help at lunchtime.
No, that's all right.

We have to help each other.
-Thank you very much.
-It doesn't cost us anything.
(Genta) Wow, it's old, and it's really run down.
(Mitsuhiko) There's not even a lock on the door.
There was no lock on the door 10 years ago.
(Mitsuhiko) Ouch!
-How do you know this?
(Mitsuhiko) -What?
Ah, because Ran told me.
Ha-ha-ha!
It doesn't matter.
He should just be shot down.
If I'm not mistaken, the director said they couldn't shoot him down...
because I don't know what was wrong with the fengshui.
He said so in the graduation speech.
Ouch!
I mean in the welcome speech.
Oh, did he?
He said it in the welcome speech?
But what are you saying, now?
If you weren't there, the day of the welcome speech!
What?
You didn't come to school until we had already started the course, right?
Didn't you?
Oh, did you?
You're sure?
- (Mitsuhiko) Yes, it had already started.
- (Ayumi) Oh... Is there anything wrong with you, Conan?
Anyway, enough of this.
(Genta) You look so strange.
Let's go in at once and see if there's any plaster.
(Genta) Oh!
(Man's voice, echoing) "Don't do this. You can't touch this."
Conan, what are you doing, what's wrong?
You can't open it or what?
Yeah, it's all right.
I'll open it now.
Oh, my gosh!
You can't see anything!
Nothing at all.
And there's no light, the bulb is out.
You know what?
I'm going to get a flashlight.
I'll be right back.
-Hey? -No, it's not necessary.
-No, it's not necessary.
We have one.
We carry it all the time.
Wow, that's good thinking!
A watch with a flashlight.
It's very nice.
Dr. Agasa made it especially for us.
And he also made us some pines that work as transmitters.
Really?
He really knows how to make inventions, the doctor!
Let's go!
Junior Detective League, are you ready to go in and get the plaster?
YES!
Here either...
- (both) Eh?
-Ah!
I found a schedule!
It must be very old, right?
The paper is very worn out.
There are a lot of blank boxes.
It's strange, isn't it?
Maybe they couldn't finish filling it out.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Eh?"
"A staircase leading to the basement?"
"It looks like the trapdoor got a little yanked out of its bud not too long ago."
"Could it be that someone opened it recently?"
Hey, Conan, did you find anything?
Some stairs down to the basement?
-It was locked in here!
-Maybe it was in here...
-L'esquelet!
-And maybe there's still...
-We were only joking.
-Ah...!
You get scared right away, eh, Miss Wakasa?
Yes, let's try it.
Come on, let's open it.
MHM..., MHM...!
-Oh!
-Oh!
-There was a skeleton!
-Aaaah...!
Of course there was.
Genta, hold on for a moment, please.
Miss Wakasa, call the police right away!
Yes, I-I'll be right there.
Ouch!
-Yes, that's it, I'm fine. -I'm fine.
-Calm down a bit.
Unbelievable...
What, Conan?
How's it going down there?
Ah... Whoever he is, he's long dead.
From the state of preservation of the bones and the surroundings,
I'd say... about 5 years..., no, more like 10 years.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Eh? He's got something on his right hand."
"Is it a headband?"
"A headband for sports?"
Conan, what are you doing?
What's wrong?
-Conan, what did you see?
-What's wrong, Conan?
(Genta) Get in, come on!
(Shinichi, thinks) "These characters look familiar."
"It seems to me..."
"It was..."
"Oh!"
Shinichi!
I've found a magic rope!
Eh?
A magic rope?
I found it attached to the old deck behind the school.
There's no such thing as a magic rope.
There are some very strange characters written on it.
Yes, I've never seen them before!
You see what I was saying?
You haven't seen them, have you?
No... Maybe they are Chinese characters, or whatever.
Let's untie it and show it to the teachers.
Yes.
(What are you guys doing?
Don't do it.
You can't touch this.
Oh...
Eh?
It's not a normal tape, it's magic.
It's used to stop a creepy monster...
from escaping inside the shed.
(Shinichi, think) "A magic... tape?"
At first it looks like the corpse might be about 10 years old.
The deceased had nothing on him

that would allow us to identify him right away,
but he was most likely a burglar.
He has a fracture on the back of his skull, apparently caused by a severe blow.
apparently caused by a heavy blow,
and from the remains we've found,
he must have been carrying a fat sack of plaster that fell on him.
"It is probable that he tripped on the ladder
when he was trying to run away with the plaster sack."
"He probably fell backwards and hit his head".
"With the Plintons at the foot of the ladder,
and the blow caused his death."
In principle, then, there is no indication of any blood crime,
so we've finished and we'll have to go.
Yes, of course.
Thank you very much for coming.
-Ah!
Well then, goodbye, goodbye.
-Mm?
Eh? (Genta) Oh, what a pity.
- (Genta) Oh, what a pity.
-People, do me a favor!
We've run out of cases.
10 years ago, the last time the police came.
They haven't been back since.
Gee, what does it say now?
What's it like?
That something happened, 10 years ago?
4 thieves broke into a very rich man's house.
He lived very close to here.
The poor man, who was the owner, they murdered him,
and ran off with some gold bullion they found.
valued at 200 million yen.
That same night, someone saw some suspicious men....
entering our school thinking that no one was watching them.
And that's why the police later came to investigate the case.
They did?
And listen, they arrested them, these thieves you say?
No.
As far as I know, they never found them.
But if you do something wrong, you will get punishment for sure.
So, wherever they are, they must live in fear.
Or maybe they're already dead and all.
(Mitsuhiko) What a surprise, she discovered that years ago...
a person died in the basement of the shed.
(Mitsuhiko) -Yes.
(Mitsuhiko) -Who could have guessed?
I assure you, I'm not going anywhere near it ever again.
Yes... and it's a pity the police took the tape.
It could be a message written in code.
What did they mean, those characters?
Ah, I know!
Maybe it was a curse.
It's called "cipher with esc√≠tala".
Mm... "Amci..., Amci..."?
Is it a sauce?
It's an encryption system
used by the Spartans over 2,500 years ago.
-What did the Spartans use?
-More than 2,500 years ago?
It's called "esc√≠tala".
"Esc√≠tala".
Sukiyaki sauce?
First, cut out a long strip of paper.
Wrap it around a stick and write whatever you want.
For example.
"The Ayumi is a girl....
very kind...
and she is also very nice ".
See?
It looks like this.
But if we take the paper off the stick and develop the ribbon...,
you can't read a single word I've written.
(Genta) "Yu-na-ma-ta-ta-lo-mi-sa-to-ca."
-Now it's a coded message.
(Genta) -Ah!
(Genta) It's true!
And if we wrap the paper around the same stick again,
we can read again what I have written.
That is, as long as two or more people...
have sticks of the same thickness,
encrypted messages can be exchanged.
I wish we could wrap that tape around a cane
so we could read the coded message.
Yeah, I don't know why you had to give it to them, the police.
Relax...
The Ai has gone to the teacher's lounge
to print the photo I took with my cell phone.
Look, it's already here.
Yes.
Did you print it, Ai?
They let me print it out because I told them that I wanted it
that I wanted it for a Chinese character contest.
How nice!
Thank you, Ai.
It has.
As the encrypted message can probably be read
by winding the ribbon on the handle of the shed door....,
if we roll it up in a marker of a thickness like this,
we should be able to read it.
What is it, Conan?
What does it say?
(Ouch) The second character from the left is like the E in Edogawa.
But the other characters are not understandable, I've never seen them before.
How strange!
Maybe I haven't used the right thickness.
Neither have I.
Even if I change the thickness of the marker....,
there's no way to read anything.
What kind of code must this be?
- (all) Eh?
-One thing...
Maybe it's that you're not supposed to wrap the paper
around any sticks or anywhere.

The encrypted message that you have written we could not understand it
if not enrotll√†vem to the paper
around the same marker that you have used,
but we could read each character individually,
even if it was not rolled up.
-It is written in hiragana.
-Now that you mention it, it's true.
On the other hand, on the tape we found in the shed with the skeleton...
there were unrecognizable characters, you couldn't read them at all.
Of course!
They are radical to the right and to the left.
-To the left?
-To the right?
You know that the kanji are formed by two individual characters
that join together and form a new character.
The character or radical on the left is called "hen",
and the one on the right, "tsukuri".
For example, the "jima" in the name of en Genta Kojima,
is formed by the radicals "mountain" and "bird",
which together form the kanji.
And, if I am not mistaken, in Conan has thought?
that the characters written on the cipher tape could be radicals that,
rolled up in a stick, perhaps they could be put together and read.
Yes.
Isn't that right, Conan?
On the right side of the message there are many characters,
like for example "fire" and "metal",
which are usual left radicals.
I thought that if we enrotll√†vem the paper,
perhaps the right and left bands would be interchanged
and would form characters that could be read.
But only the second character can be read: the E of Edogawa.
By the way, Conan, have you noticed that there are some dots....
and some circles at the end of the sentences?
What do they mean?
I guess they are just ordinary punctuation marks.
So, I would say that the 3 sentences could be something like this,
more or less:
"Last night, like, in Genta ate eel again, period.
In eats too much, exclamation mark ".
Eh ?!
It can not be!
How can it be that the skeleton knows that I ate yesterday?
It was just an example, man.
Don't tell me you ate eel again yesterday.
How can that be?
If you don't stop eating so much, you'll end up looking like an eel.
Yes, I know that...
What?
Something, this first sentence...
I don't know, but don't you think that in this sentence...
the position particle should be "ga" instead of "wa"?
No, I don't think so.
Why do you say so?
Also, look at this:
the second character in the third sentence has a sonorant mark.
This tells us that it must be a character
belonging to the "ga", "za", "da" or "ba" group.
Therefore, it is almost certain that,
in case there was a "ga" in the above sentence,
there would also be a sonorant mark on the character.
And we also cannot know for sure whether this character is "ha" or not.
We have to think that sometimes the commas are optional
and depend on one's taste.
Be that as it may, surely we are missing....
something else that we can't figure out what it says.
Something else?
What do you mean?
How is it going?
Is everyone studying in silence?
(All) Yes!
-Not yet.
-Is the teacher's meeting over yet?
It's going to be a little longer, though.
We just came to see if everything was going well.
- (all) No...!
-And, besides, I had left something behind.
Sorry, it will take a little longer, but not much longer.
In the meantime, continue studying.
(all) - Eh?
Tell me.
-Miss Wakasa.
Excuse me.
Can you do me a favor?
Can you go drop these rulers in the material room, please?
Yes, of course.
Here.
Oh, by the way, I wanted to tell you that...
Ah!
The schedule!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Oh..., the schedule!"
It's torn!
It's all right, don't worry.
We'll do it again.
(Wakasa) I'm really sorry...
(Shinichi, thinks) "Oh!"
I found a schedule!
It must be very old, right?
The paper is very worn out.
There are a lot of blank boxes.
It's strange, isn't it?
Maybe they couldn't finish filling it out.
Mm?
Hey, Ayumi.
Al covered you found an old schedule on the floor, right?
Mm-hm.
I picked it up.
I got it right here.
Look at it.
Mm?
What's the matter, Conan?
You found out something?
(Shinichi thinks) "Sure! Now I understand."

There's something wrong with this schedule, isn't there?
What's wrong?
What's wrong with it?
What's wrong with it?
Look at this.
This row...
If these are the days, there's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
-That's right!
-That would be Sunday, right?
But on Sundays there is no school.
You don't understand.
And on Tuesday there is this study hour.
See what it is.
One, two, three, four, five, six, sep.
It's the seventh hour.
Nobody does seven hours of class in elementary school.
Not even the students in the higher grades, they don't do that many.
-Mm...
-Mm...
Well, if it's not a schedule... what does this grill mean?
As we have found it in the shed,
the place where we found the skeleton with the tape with the coded text...,
surely it must be...
"Surely it must be..."?
