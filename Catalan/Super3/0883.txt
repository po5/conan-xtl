"Grandpa Tictac and the 3 clocks".
"Tick-tock, tick-tock. Grandpa Tictac is a watchmaker.
'There, I've finished repairing the clock,' he has said.
'But he's so tired,
he can't take it to his long-time customer's house.
I know what I'll do to help him:
I'll take the repaired watch and I'll take it back to its owner."
(Man: gasps)
Run away all of you, hurry!
-Mm?
(Man: gasps) Eh?
(Man:) - Eh?
This is a bomb!
It's about to explode!
- (children) Eh?
-Everybody run away from here!
Please, everybody run away, go!
Oh, it's true!
- (people: calling)
-Oysters!
We must leave!
No...!
I have already done what you asked me to do.
Stop the counter!
Hey, don't you feel me?!
Geez, father!
(Pump, counter: pip, pip, pip, pip)
(Bomb, counter: pip, pip, pip, pip)
(Shinichi voice) "The curtain rises and the main character appears."
"Solve the mysteries by doing a beautiful dance."
"A countdown that doesn't stop."
"The clue to discover the bombs is a pop-up book."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The bombs in the pop-up book (part one)."
Very good!
(Man) Mr. Mouri, I'm carrying a package.
(Mouri) Oh... (Man) What's this?
"Grandpa Ticking and the 3 clocks"?
It's a picture book.
A book and a mobile?
Mm..., mm...
But it's weird...
Mm?
I know it is!
If you cut it out and assemble it, it's a pop-up book.
True, but I'd say this is just the galley proofs.
A printer's proof, you mean?
How strange!
Why are they sending it to me, a book that isn't even finished yet?
Tonight there was an explosion
at the Sand Castle arcade in the Beika district of Tokyo.
What is it?
What is it that has surprised you so much?
What happened?
Look, read this here.
"Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Go take the first watch in the sand castle."
Haven't you heard that they just talked about a place
called Sand Castle?
They said there had been an explosion in an arcade.
It's true, the arcade was called that.
Come on, let's go.
I'm sure it was just a coincidence.
(Mobile: ring)
Oh! (Cell phone ringing)
Eh? (Mobile: ring)
(Mobile: ring)
(Female voice) "Tick-tock, tick-tock, boom!"
"In 60 minutes you'll have another sand castle."
Mm?
But what...?
"Will it be in Haido block 8 or Haido block 3?"
"Where will the next bomb go off?"
"Let's see if the famous detective finds out."
Oh, no way!
This is a bomb threat.
Hey, let's see how the book continues.
Oh, boy!
Yeah, we looked at this.
"Tick-tock, tick-tock.
To find out the second place to go, you'll have to solve a riddle.
It turns out that a bus with 3 people
arrives at a stop where 5 more people are waiting.
Two people get off at the stop and one gets on.
The next stop is the end of the line.
How many people are left on the bus?"
Let's see...?
Doesn't it say the answer?
Oh!
The page is torn out.
To find out where the bomb is, we must solve the riddle.
Wait, wait...
At a bus stop 5 people are waiting,
and a bus arrives with 3 more people.
5 plus 3 makes 8, right?
If two people get off and then one gets on, there ends up being one.
I already have the solution: it is seven.
But according to the cell phone messages,
the bomb must be in block 8 or in block 3.
Ah...
I got it!
The driver.
This means that the result is 8.
The bomb is at the bus stop in block 8. Ha!
Did they think that the great Kogoro Mouri
wouldn't be able to solve such an easy riddle?
Ha!
Ah, good morning, inspector.

(Both) Huh?
(Both) Wait a minute.
Instead it says that the 5 people at the bus stop took the bus.
(Both) That's true.
So, we have to subtract 8 minus 5, which makes 3.
It must be at the block 3 stop.
Mm-hm.
I'm pretty clear on that, too.
Yeah, that's right.
Okay, inspector.
Do they know where they sent the messages from yet?
Unfortunately, they can't know.
The phone is without a contract.
And it looks like the messages are sent from different foreign servers
and they can't trace them.
Hey, how did you get into my cab?
It's a dangerous mission!
I don't know if you remember, but in Conan he solved the riddle.
And if Conan says he wants to come,
it's quite normal that I want to accompany him.
Do not worry.
It is very normal?
We will only try to go far away and we won't disturb anything.
I don't know if I believe it too much, that.
It's true.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Besides, if it's a real bomb threat,
who knows what's in store for us."
"Things could get really complicated."
It's only 40 minutes before it goes off.
(Police: siren)
Come on, search the area immediately!
Good morning, Kogoro.
Hello, Inspector.
We've already identified the suspect.
What?
What's that?
Is he for real?
His name is Takuji Hirukawa and he's 38 years old.
He already planted a bomb 5 years ago.
"It seems he then fled overseas,
but now he must have secretly returned."
"We found his fingerprints
at the place where the bomb exploded this morning."
Anyway, I don't understand...
why you sent a notice to Mr. Mouri.
It's true.
I have nothing to do, with a man who dedicates himself to planting bombs.
Yes, that's what we must clarify.
Yes.
Inspector Chiba...
Mm?
Eh?
Conan, may I see the book, please?
Thank you.
He's got it.
-So it is.
-Is this it?
Three days ago, I was taken by a man...
who said the book belonged to his dead brother.
I have no doubt.
And since he wouldn't give it to him,
Mr. Hirukawa attacked him and hurt him, didn't he?
-Can you tell me what this all means?
-Yes, yes.
It turns out that the author of this book, in Kenichi Imai,
was a half-brother on Takuji Hirukawa's father's side,
our suspect.
Stepbrother?
Yes, but while Mr. Hirukawa was in hiding overseas,
the other one died.
-Oh.
I haven't introduced them yet.
-Oh.
This is Mr. Hiroyuki Tomonaga,
Mr. Hirukawa's little brother's publisher.
Poor thing.
Then we were all convinced
that he would be awarded the Grand Prix du Livre Illustrate.
We at the publishing house gave him our full support.
"But his brother's criminal record
"It started to spread on the Internet,
and people didn't think it was right for him to write children's books."
He was forced to decline that nomination.
From the disgust, the poor guy got sick and finally....
My goodness, it's terrible!
According to what they were saying on the internet,
the person who had circulated his brother's criminal record
was a private detective.
"Mr. Hirukawa was convinced and blamed his brother's death
and blamed his brother's death on this detective."
What?
This, it said?
And that's why he sent me the book?
But it wasn't me, I had nothing to do with it!
Of course I'm sure.
No?
Are you sure, Kogoro?
I'm aware that there are detectives who do things like this
and are not worthy of practicing the profession.
But I assure you that this unpresentable man
I'll make him pay for what he's done.
Anyway, you can see...
that the man was not able to specify which detective it had been.
That's why many think that his accusation was unfounded.
Then I understand why he sent the book to you:
because you are a very famous detective, Kogoro,
and he's made you the scapegoat.
Well-well, there's no right, because I haven't done anything.
Why do you involve me?
I am the victim of a cruel injustice!
Eh?
Listen, Mr. Tomonaga...
When I had this book, there were already pages torn out?
What pages?
What pages?
It's very strange... They shouldn't be torn out.
When Kenichi died,
we decided to stop publishing his book,
but we kept these galley proofs intact.
Well, that's very suspicious, because I'm convinced...

that in the torn out pages there were the solutions
the enigmas posed by the book.
Oh, it's true!
In the book were the clues to find the bombs,
but it turns out that Takuji Hirukawa tore them out.
Oh!
This is important.
It means that there may be other bombs.
There can't be!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Yes, he's right. It's quite possible there are more."
Mr. Tomonaga, do you remember what it said, on the pages?
The solutions to the riddles.
What is it?
It's just that, when we finished the galley proofs,
the scandal started about his older brother.
And I was so upset
that I didn't pay much attention to the text of the book.
Oh, what a pity...
(Man) I found it!
It's inside this bag, in the wastebasket.
In the book were the clues to find the bombs,
but it turns out that Takuji Hirukawa ripped them out.
(Man) Oh!
This is important.
It means that there may be others, of bombs.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Yes, he's right. It's quite possible that there are more."
(Man) I've found it!
It's inside this bag, to the wastebasket.
Takagi, Chiba, clear this whole area.
We don't go near the bomb until they come to defuse it.
Yes.
So, the bomb threat was for real.
This is very dangerous!
Be very vigilant, Father!
And you too, Conan!
What? What?
Wow!
What's wrong, Kogoro?
What-what's wrong, Kogoro?
The timer's jumped and now there's only 20 minutes left!
-Eh?!
- (mobile: ring)
(Female voice) "Tick-tock, tick-tock."
" 'Name', arrow 'make'."
"If you don't make it, boom!"
"If you're not on time, boom!"
"People will die because of the famous detective."
"Run, run, detective."
Eh?
What does this one say?
That I have to run?
Huh? (Laughs)
You do.
Hey, Chiba, show me the book.
Look!
"Which one of us won the race? Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Go take the second watch in the park that makes the finish line."
Wow!
Another riddle to solve.
So what, there's an answer?
The page is booted, of course.
Wow!
And I have to run.
But why?
Why do you want to make me run, this one?
Mm?
Oh!
Takagi, listen...
Look at the map and tell me what parks there are
there are that are a 20-minute walk from here.
Yeah, e-stay tuned...
-Mm?
-I got it!
There are 3 parks within a 20 minute walk:
Aozora Fountain Square, Isobe Flower Garden...
and Kanematsu Park.
Oh my goodness.
Now which of these 3 parks do we have to go to?
Let me think.
Mm...
Ah.
There, I've guessed it.
How nice!
Bravo, Father!
Oh, is that so?
To write "Isobe Flower Garden" can be done with two pairs of kanji:
"Iso" and "Hen", and "Iso" and "Bu": "ISOBUS".
"ISOBUS" is the Japanese name for "Aesop."
-... there's one about a race.
-I get it!
In Aesop's fables...
Yes, sir.
The one about the hare and the tortoise.
This means that the goal of the race is the Flower Garden of Isobe.
Just a moment.
I don't quite see it clearly, me.
(Men) Yes.
Come on, let's go there, too.
Can I come with you, please?
I feel a little responsible for everything that's going on.
Besides, I might remember some other detail, though.
Mm.
All right, then.
Get in the car.
Come on, Conan, we should be getting home.
Huh? (Chuckles)
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Takagi!
Yes, of course, he has.
Can you show me the map, please?
(Shinichi, think) "Aozora Fountain Plaza...,
Isobe Flower Garden..., Kanematsu Park."
"Oh... I got it!"
(Female voice) "Tick-tock, tick-tock, boom!"
"It's 15 minutes to the explosion."
"People will die because of you."
"Run, run, detective."
No, no one will die!
(gasps)
I am... I am, I am!
Now I'm sure the bomb won't go off.
(gasps) - Huh?
Why doesn't the counter stop?
- (bomb, counter: pip, pip, pip, pip)
-Eh?
- (mobile: ring)
(female voice) "Tick-tock, tick-tock, boom!"
"Ten minutes to explosion."
"Insist, insist, detective."
What?
What what?!
Hey, I'm here!
Stop the counter!
Don't you feel me?
Stop!

What's wrong, Kogoro?
I don't know, but the counter won't stop, there's no way.
What's wrong?
It won't stop?!
(Female voice) "Tick-tock, tick-tock, boom!"
-Ay...!
- (female voice) "It's 8 minutes to explosion."
"What's wrong? What's wrong, detective? Are you giving up?"
Of course not!
You know the great Kogoro Mouri doesn't give up!
Eh?
Mr. Mouri, he's not here!
The name of this park was a riddle trap.
Run, father, come with us!
What-what are you saying?!
(Police: siren)
Are you sure, that this is the park you meant?
Yes, look at this sign.
It says "Kanematsu Park" in Japanese and English.
Remember the message you received before reading the second riddle.
You mean what it says " 'name', arrow, 'make'", I guess.
"Name" and "make" are English words for "name" and "make",
but I've deduced that " 'name', arrow, 'make'"
simply means "transforms 'name' into 'make'."
"Transforms 'name' into 'make'"?
And how does it transform?
How does it transform...?
Oh, of course!
By changing the letter ene for eme and eme for ca!
Yes, and if we change the 'ene' for 'eme' and the 'eme' for 'ca'...
in the name of this park,
what phrase are we left with in Japanese?
"Ka-me-ka-tsu."
- (all) Eh?
-Oh!
"The turtle wins"!
Exactly, and that's why I deduced that the finish line of the race is here.
(all) Right!
Run away, everybody, hurry up!
-Mm?
Eh?
-Hmm?
This is a bomb!
It's about to explode!
- (children) Eh?
-Everybody run away from here!
Please, everybody run away, go!
Oh, it's true!
- (people: calling)
-Oysters!
We must leave!
No...!
I have already done what you asked me to do.
Stop the counter!
Oysters, father!
(Bomb, counter: pip, pip, pip, pip)
Hey, don't sit me down!
Mr. Mouri, look how the statues are placed!
The hares and tortoises are running into the park!
No, Conan!
The goal must be there.
Yes...
The goal must be that.
-It's dangerous for Conan!
-Mr. Mouri... -Mr. Mouri...
Takagi, Chiba, help me.
-Oh... Yes!
-You work this lid.
(All) MHM!
MHM!
MHM...!
Get out of the way!
MHM...!
Iah!
Watch out, Conan!
Get down!
(Bomb, counter: pip, pip, pip, pip)
Mm... Eh?
...didn't go off.
The-the bomb...
(Shinichi, thinks) "What happened?"
Ah... That's it.
I've made it.
The pump got wet from the sewer water and failed.
Inspector, I made it.
Kogoro...
-Mm?
- (mobile: ring)
(Female voice) "Tick-tock, tick-tock, boom!"
"Congratulations to the great detective Kogoro Mouri."
"But this game isn't over yet, not by a long shot."
What ?!
What's this?
Hey, Kogoro, does that mean...?
Yes, that the mystery of these bombs will continue,
because it's not solved yet.
Yeah, I can see that.
And where will the next bomb be?
We won't know that until more messages come in.
Eh?
Oh...
Conan, please open the book.
Sure, sure, sure!
We can look at the book.
Look, look at this.
"Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Go bring the last clock in the center of the set."
Mm?
Oh, and what else does it say?
Nothing.
As always, the page is booted.
No!
What the fuck does that mean, "the center of the set"?
Where is the center of the set?
(Shinichi, think) "This is very strange..."
"Until now all the riddles gave detailed forces...
"And they were easy to guess,
but this one..."
"The center of the set 'is very little information."
"It could be many things."
"What could it mean?"
(Bomb, counter: pip, pip, pip, pip)
(Bomb, counter: pip, pip, pip, pip)
(Bomb, counter: pip, pip, pip, pip)

Now they have found 3 bombs.
3 bombs!
