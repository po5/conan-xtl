Ah.
Ayumi, my pretty, it's time to go to sleep.
Go take a bath.
A little more, please.
Now it gets interesting.
-You have a pool tomorrow, don't you? -Yes.
(Mermaids)
Mmmm?
Who are you?
Are you Dracula?
No.
Uh!
I was tired from flying and stopped here for a little rest.
I'm just a magician..., miss.
We've got him!
That's him!
Don't let him get away!
Take in Kaito Kid!
So long..., miss.
Ah!
Ah.
-What?
Did you see the Kaito Kid? -Ayumi, are you serious?
Yes.
He was so cheerful!
How cool, he's the Lupin of today!
And then?
What is our Sherlock Holmes going to do?
Silly!
It is clear that one day I will catch him!

"Detective Conan: The Last Wizard of the Century"
"I'm Shinichi Kudo, a juvenile detective."
"I went to an amusement park with Ran, my lifelong friend,
"And there I saw some suspicious men making a transaction."
"I was so attentive to how they were doing the transaction,
"that I didn't see a man approaching me from behind."
"That man made me take something
"And when I woke up...
"My body had become small!"
"If they found out that Shinichi Kudo is still alive,
"They'd surely show up again to make an attempt on my life.
"And the people around me would be in danger."
"I'm going to hide my identity,
"Suddenly it came to my mind... Conan Edogawa."
"In order to find out more about them,
"I went to Ran's house, because his father is a private detective."
I am the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
Ah.
He became the Sleeping Kogoro.
The reason?
I use a watch-shaped anesthetic dart shooter
and then my voice transformer
to solve cases in the voice of Detective Kogoro.
These two great inventions are the work of Dr. Agasa.
"Despite appearances, Dr. Agasa is a genius,
"And he has devised a skateboard equipped with a motor,
"radar goggles to track suspects...
"And sneakers that make super-powered stitches."
"And he continues to come up with unique inventions."
"As for the skateboard,
"Charging the battery by daylight,
"it can move for half an hour when it's nighttime."
"There are two people who know what my identity is."
"In Heiji Hattori, the juvenile detective of the west.
"and Ai Haibara, a new student who came to our school."
"She had been part of the Men in Black organization,
"But when she tried to run away
"She took the same substance they gave me."
"As I pursue the organization of those men relentlessly,
"I'm dealing with a lot of cases that keep coming up."
"And now, a new opponent has appeared."
"Maybe I look like a child,
"But I have the brains of a detective and for me nothing is a mystery."
"I will give a sliver of light to the chaos and suspicions of darkness."
File number 1,420.
There have been 130 robberies committed by Kaito Kid.
He has acted on 15 occasions abroad in 12 countries.
In the United States, France and Germany, among others.
The total amount of jewelry stolen is 150 pieces
and their value amounts to 389,025 million yen.
We have received notice of a new theft by the thief who calls himself Kaito Kid.
Ooooh!
"When Lion's twilight moves toward Virgin's dawn.
"And the clock with no hands to count the seconds
"Mark the twelfth letter,
"I'll come from a tall building shining in the sky
"And I'll come to steal 'egg memories."
"Kaito Kid, the last wizard of the century."
The "memorias egg" or "egg of memories," mentioned in his ad,
is a secret treasure of the Romanov dynasty,
which has been found in a warehouse belonging to the wealthy Suzuki family.
It is an imperial Easter egg.
"They were eggs that the Tsar of Russia commissioned from the jeweler Faberg√©.
"To give as a gift to the family to celebrate Easter."
"From 1885 to 1916, 50 were made."
"Therefore, the egg found on this occasion would be number 51."
We have been informed that the Suzuki family
will be exhibiting this fifty-first Imperial Easter egg they have found
at the Suzuki Gallery of Modern Art,
which will open on August 23 in Osaka Castle Park.

Here is the meaning of the riddle.
Begin, Nakamori.
First the sentence:
"When Lion's twilight moves toward Virgin's dawn..."
This means that the date on which the robbery will take place
will be between August 22, the last day of the sign of the Lion,
and August 23, the first day of the sign of Virgo.
Next we have
"The clock without hands to count the seconds..."
It looks as if he is giving us the time when he will commit the crime,
but we haven't quite figured it out yet.
With the last phrase, "I will come from a tall building shining in the sky."
must refer to the tower of a castle.
It tells us about the castle of Osaka,
the place where our thief will surely appear.
Therefore, it is indicating that he intends to appear in the Osaka castle,
between August 22nd and 23rd for stealing the imperial Easter egg!
Oh!
So, on this occasion,
we will work hand in hand with the Osaka Police Department.
And we will ask the famous detective Kogoro Mouri to collaborate with us.
Gladly!
Our goal is to protect the Imperial Easter egg to the very end!
Even if we escape, protecting the egg is our priority!
Eh?
We can't take things lightly!
So much so, let it happen with the egg!
Listen to me everyone!
We must put that sneaky thief behind bars
for our pride and for our dignity!
We have to close it at all costs!
Did you hear me?
Yes!
"What death has befallen me."
Ran!
I'm here, girl!
Sonoko!
Come on!
A limousine!
No wonder, this is the Suzuki family...
-Today is a very special day. -Special?
If I have to meet my dear Kaito Kid,
I should take a limousine!
What a fool you are. "Your dear Kaito Kid?"
Let me introduce him to you.
Our driver is Mr. Nishino, my father's secretary.
How do you do?
He's been traveling abroad constantly
and speaks English, French and German very fluently.
Yes?
That's amazing!
Doctor, Conan's got a lot of bar!
He's gone to Osaka and left us hanging here!
I was looking forward to seeing him again in Kaito Kid...
His specialty is running off to leave us behind!
Take this watermelon and freshen up a bit.
-Oh! -Viva!
Bon appetit!
Just a moment!
You can eat once you've solved the riddle.
-That's not done, doctor. -What are you saying?
I don't want you to have what you want too much by the hand.
Attentive.
I have a number of pupils.
Say, how many do I have?
How many?
But you have disciples?
This is a riddle!
Truly, we can't solve it without Conan.
Then we can't eat this watermelon?
One.
An eye has only one pupil.
Pupil refers to eye.
Having a few refers to both eyes.
And one eye has only one pupil.
Super-wrong answer!
Very good.
I knew you could figure it out!
Oh!
-Haibara, you're...-... fantastic.
Haibara is also from the Junior Detective League, isn't she?
That means...
Bon appetit!
"Well, I'll just sit here
"And I'll watch you deduce and solve the case of that egg..., Kudo."
What a tight watch.
It seems that not even a poor fly can get in here.
We're up against that famous Kaito Kid!
There's a reason he's...
A phantom thief and an irresistible gentleman...
who appears and disappears whenever he wants.
No security device or vault can prevent him from committing
can't stop him from committing robberies.
He imitates his victims' face, voice and personality.
You got into a quagmire when you considered him your opponent.
Kudo. "Hattori!"
This bearded man again?
Why do you call Conan "Kudo" every time you see him, huh?
Sorry, girl.
It's just that he reminds me of Kudo when he makes deductions.
-I tell her like that without turning around, "Serious, you look silly!
All morning repeating to me that he came in Kudo one and another...
You should stop by the hospital and get it checked out, pretty boy.
Say, is he in Heiji Hattori, that detective from the west?
Gee, he's really handsome, isn't he?
No, woman, don't even think about it.
That in Hattori he has Kazuha, his childhood friend.

They are always fighting, but they really like each other a lot.
You only have to look at them to see, they're just like you and Shinichi.
Ouch, I can't talk to you.
I'm not jealous, you feel?
(Sonoko) I wish I had a childhood friend like you.
(Sonoko) Oh!
Welcome, Mr. Mouri!
Thank you so much for coming from so far away!
It's nice to meet you.
Ran, Conan, I'm glad you came too.
Excuse me, what about these guys?
Who are these two?
Dad, they're at Heiji Hattori and Kazuha Toyama.
In Heiji, they call her the juvenile detective of the west...
and she's quite a celebrity in the Kansai region!
-I'd love to.
I'm counting on you. Yes!
You can count, Grandpa.
Insolent!
That's no way to talk to the president of the Suzuki Financial Group!
Don't worry, Mr. Mouri.
Let me introduce Mr. Sergei Ovchinikovz.
He is the first secretary of the Russian embassy.
How do you do?
Next to him is Mr. Shoichi Inui,
a businessman of art to conduct the relevant negotiations.
And Seiran Hoshi, an expert researcher on the Romanov family.
Nihao.
And that's Mr. Ryo Sagawa,
a freelance journalist and photojournalist
who has offered his services to film the interviews.
How do you do?
-How much would we be talking about? -800 million yen.
Ah!
800 million?
But if you sell it to me, I'll pay even more.
President Suzuki.
The Imperial Easter egg is a piece that belongs to Russia.
Please, I beg you to give it to the National Art Gallery of Russia
instead of offering it to an unknown investor!
An unknown investor?
Very well, keep it up.
Filming you will be more interesting than filming the egg.
You make a face of absolute indifference,
but, if you're an expert researcher on the Romanov dynasty,
you must be dying to have that egg, right?
Yes, but I won't be able to spare more than 800 million yen.
I thought so.
I, the maximum I could collect, is 200 million.
"In Kid is not the only one? These people also behind the egg?"
Well, anyway we'll talk about the egg again some other time.
Understood.
What a remedy.
I guess we'll have to close the meeting for today.
Eh?
Mr. Chairman, I've brought you the egg.
Ah, thank you very much.
Go and leave it on the table.
Yes.
Go ahead, make yourself comfortable.
How nice!
He'll show us the egg.
It doesn't look very impressive, to tell you the truth.
When I was little, I used to handle it like a toy.
A toy?
Ooooh!
This is an imperial Easter egg?
Mr. Nishino, bring something to drink, please.
Yes.
Gee, it's not as amazing as I imagined either.
It looks like a stru√ß egg. This egg opens, doesn't it?
Indeed, I'm surprised you know that.
There's a reproduction of Tsar Nicholas II's family made of gold.
Apa!
This is really fat!
This watch has a very interesting mechanism.
Ooooh!
This is super interesting!
Some designs of the inside of the egg were found
in some old Faberg√© documents
and that has allowed us to authenticate the work.
Hey, sir.
The English name "memories egg" is a literal translation from the Russian?
Yes, it is.
In Russian it is called "vospominanie".
If we were to translate it into our language, we would call it "memories".
Why do they call it "memories" if the tsar turns the pages of a book?
That the tsar read them a book should be one of his memories!
And is that shining at the bottom of the cover a precious stone?
No, it's just a piece of glass.
Eh?
Even though it's a gift for the Tsarina... Don't you think it's strange?
Mmmmm...
Russia was suffering a very strong economic crisis
at the time it was created.
I'm not quite convinced by the ad in Kaito Kid.
"I will come from a tall building that shines in the sky."
-Why is Osaka Castle glowing? -Babau!
Taiko Hideyoshi Toyotomi built Osaka Castle,
created the foundations and led the progress.
-He is the light of Osaka.
In Kaito Kid will appear in the tower of Osaka Castle!
Still...
"And the clock without hands to count the seconds
will strike the twelfth letter",
there is no way to get the intricacies out.

Shouldn't it refer to the dozen syllables of the Japanese syllabary?
The Japanese dozen syllable is... the "shi"?
At 4 o'clock in the morning?
No, this solution would be too simple because of its riddles.
I know, Mr. Superintendent.
You are talking about the twelfth letter of the English alphabet, right?
Of the English alphabet?
The twelfth letter of the English alphabet is "L"!
That is...
3 o'clock?
I would expect nothing less from a great detective like you!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
3 o'clock in the morning.
Fits the phrase "the dawn of the Virgin sign".
Kaito Kid, wait and see!
This time I'll really stop you!
I'll be so lucky!
Let's see?
"You'll come back... you'll come back to see the person you love."
You must not be referring to Shinichi, perhaps?
Hey, that's great!
See if you can introduce me this time!
"That I'm here."
The question is how we'll hang out until 3 am.
If anything, we could go somewhere for a bite to eat.
You show them around town, Ran and her friend.
What about you?
I'll take this plug to a couple of places.
Let's all go together!
No, men have to go with men.
Oi, Ku-Co-Ku-Conan?
Yes!
He usually dates all at once, geez!
Mi-te him!
What are these fumes?
You want me to explain everything?
Please, I beg you to m'ajudis.
Yes, that's better.
When you ask for something, you have to do it with a big smile.
I find it strange that they get along so well, those two.
Girls have a better time with girls!
We'll find some nice boys and get them to buy us lunch!
We could go to the Bridge of Lovers.
You're worried about the twelfth letter, aren't you?
Yes.
I understand you use "L", which is also in the Cyrillic alphabet.
The Cyrillic alphabet...
Then it would be "K", in English, "kei".
But it would not mark any time.
And, in addition, I am also concerned about the phrase that says "the last magician of the century".
He's arrogant as hell.
He had not dared to call himself by these terms....
Besides, until now he has only been interested in stealing jewelry.
Why should he want to steal the egg?
Changing the subject, what did you get out of the oracle you were given?
Well, I haven't looked at it yet.
It is a very important oracle that will tell us how you will do with the Kaito Kid.
Coi...
Well, you're out of luck.
I see you've been unlucky.
We can't know exactly if he will hunt you or if he will hunt you.
"The person you are waiting for will come to meet you?"
"Journey. A secret will be revealed. Do not go."
Wait a minute, don't tell me.
Yes, it's impossible.
The oracles of this temple are very often right.
What?
Don't smoke! Word.
A fancy Japanese restaurant?
Yes, in Kaito Kid will appear in 3, we can go no problem.
-Let's have dinner in the meantime? -Of course!
President, it's time.
Okay.
Take care of everything.
Now will you take it to the showroom?
Yes, the fake.
The fake?
Up to now, we have always left the objects that the Kaito Kid mentioned
to the place where they were theoretically supposed to be
and he has ended up stealing them all.
We want to hide its target in a place that is not imagined.
I get it!
And then?
What place is this?
I'm sorry, we can't tell you!
The only people who know are me and my two agents.
And naturally, I've already taken care to check...
that none of them is the Kaito Kid in disguise.
What are you doing?
There was also the possibility that you were in Kaito Kid!
Then you might as well be!
What are you doing?
What have you thought?
I am the Natsumi Kosaka
and this is Sawabe, my butler.
It is paramount for me to see the president
and tell him about the imperial Easter egg in the brochure.
The president is out for a moment.
I can take care of you, if you wish.
The egg in the photograph is different from the egg my great-grandfather drew.
Come on!
If at 3 o'clock in the morning they draw an L,
at this time the hands draw the Japanese word "he".
It is 13 minutes past 7.
When it is 20 minutes past 7 in the evening, a "he" will be drawn.

"The word that indicates that Leo is moving towards the dawn of Virgin.
"It is the twelfth of the prayer!"
Hattori!
The time at which in Kid was going to commit the robbery was at 7 and 20!
What!
Kudo, where are you going?
At Osaka Castle!
See that he doesn't steal the egg!
Is it raining now?
The weatherman said we'd have good weather today.
Wait, Kudo!
The tall building shining in the sky is the Tsutenkaku Tower!
The Tsutenkaku?
The tower gives the weather forecast by light!
What are you talking about?
Ladies and gentlemen!
Au, let the show begin!
What's the meaning of this?
Oh!
Look, fireworks.
They always give a poetic warmth in summer.
How nice!
In Osaka they can't be, from the fireworks.
Strange..., there were no fireworks today.
They are launching those fireworks from Osaka Castle!
-And in great quantity, too! -It's not a Kaito Kid thing.
It's still 7 hours before the time that thief had indicated!
He must not even imagine
that we got the egg to a godforsaken place like this warehouse.
Hattori!
Where is it, the Tsutenkaku tower? It's over there!
In that direction there are no fireworks!
He's launching the fireworks from Osaka Castle
so no one will pay attention at Tsutenkaku Tower!
Why the Tsutenkaku tower?
Casumdena!
We won't make it in time!
We'll ambush him right here!
Mr. Mishima, where is the egg right now?
Officer Nakamori has taken it somewhere else.
As you say?
And now, after...
Pip!
Oh! A blackout?
What's going on?
What's the meaning of this?
Oh!
This isn't normal at all.
Oh, the moonlight is illuminating us.
Now that's good taste.
Don't get nervous!
Switch on the auxiliary generator immediately!
Yes, sir!
"I know what your target is!"
Hey!
The Mikado Hospital to Hoenzaka.
The Mikado Century Hotel.
Tenman Emergency Center.
Hotel Chanel 10.
Rosoku TMS Hospital.
World Kansai Hotel.
Mmmm... Prize!
-Get out!
You're clogging up traffic! -Carallot!
The jammed you!
"He was informed that they would move the egg to another location."
"He has caused a blackout in order to locate the location of the egg.
"When the light was connected by means of the auxiliary generators!"
"Their target is a place with light
"That is neither a hospital nor a hotel!"
Demon!
At Kaito Kid!
I'm screwed!
A dead end!
Come on up, Kudo!
The Tsutenkaku Tower is the most suitable place
to see which buildings regain light.
Things would go like this even before you send your notice.
It must be a place that does not attract attention from the outside.
Security must be very tight.
We must hurry or he will manage to steal the egg!
Hattori!
You wait for me here! What are you going to do?
Ep, Kudo!
Kid!
Damn it!
He's getting away!
Hurry up, Kudo!
He's got it!
The best way to go hang gliding is to fly against the wind!
So the ratcatcher's riding the wind, is he?
Look, he's started to descend! Osaka Bay is right in front!
I'm sure the Kaito Kid will land there!
Hattori, are you all right?
Run!
Go catch him!
If you let him get away I'll kill you!
Hattori...
Kid, what's wrong?
Call the police and get an ambulance!
Wait for me, Hattori!
What?
That was...
This wound...
The egg is intact.
Kaito Kid's monocle!
It can't be!
She was shot and fell into the sea?
Who was the man I saw?
What's going on here?
"We could not confirm whether en Kaito Kid was alive or dead,
"despite the desperate search that the police conducted."
"The next day, the exhibition was hastily cancelled...
"In order to check if the egg had suffered any damage of any kind.
"And the Suzuki family returned to Tokyo by boat with the egg."
My great-grandfather's name was Kiichi
and he was working in the Faberg√© workshop as a craftsman.
There he married a Russian woman
and, a year after the revolution broke out, they returned to Japan,
they returned to Japan and my great-grandmother had a daughter.

Even so, my great-grandmother died shortly thereafter.
and, after 9 years, my great-grandfather died at the age of 45.
-And the child they had is... My grandmother.
My grandfather and my parents died in a traffic accident,
so my grandmother brought me up.
And her grandmother also died last month.
I was working in Paris
as an artisan candy maker,
but I went back to Japan to put her belongings in order.
I found a very old sheet of paper with a drawing of my great-grandfather.
The center of the paper is damaged, but....
"Memories"?
It's obvious!
It's the egg of memories!
But this one did have a gemstone embedded in it.
If it had a gemstone in the beginning, couldn't it have been stolen?
Excuse me, couldn't there be two eggs?
Could there be two eggs?
Yes, look.
The difference is subtle,
but the silhouette of the two papers don't match.
There were two eggs drawn on a larger piece of paper,
but the one in the middle must have been torn off.
It is true.
"But why do they call it 'souvenirs'? Eh? Here's a mirror."
Oh, no, it fell, what are you doing, you devil child?
She was carrying a mirror, but she dropped it!
What's that? Conan!
Oh, don't worry.
That mirror is made expressly to come out easily.
It looks like they put it on the egg after the fact.
"Eh? What's this? It reflects something!
"Eh? This could be..."
Mr. Nishino, close the light, please!
-Huh?
Yes. Stop it!
Cut the crap!
Oh!
-Oh! -Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
-Why do you see an image? -It's a magic mirror.
-A magic mirror? -I've heard of it.
In China and Japan a divine dimension was given to these mirrors.
These mirrors were created in a very specific way.
In Japan, Christians who were hiding the Christian faith
had a cross reflected on the wall with one of these mirrors.
-Mr. Sawabe, this castle... It is the castle located in Yokosuka.
This castle in Yokosuka
is what they use to shoot commercials often?
Yes.
My great-grandfather built that castle
and my grandmother continued to take care of it.
It belonged to the Kosaka family then.
Shouldn't it be your great-grandfather, who made those two eggs?
Your great-grandfather must have taken the two pieces he would have created,
when he returned to Japan after the Russian revolution broke out.
It is likely that he sold some of the precious stones from the second egg,
that he built the castle of Yokosuka
and hid this egg somewhere in his castle.
And then, he would have left another egg with this mirror as a message as he had hidden the other one.
as a message as he had hidden the other egg.
Excuse me, along with this sheet of papers,
I found this ancient key.
-Perhaps it has something to do with it. I have no doubt about it!
This is the key to the place where the second egg is hidden!
With precious stones set in it....
If it were to be found,
it would be worth up to 1.5 billion yen!
"In Kaito Kid wanted it for that?"
"No."
Hey, Mr. Mouri,
would you like to accompany me to the castle when we're back in Tokyo?
-With pleasure! -Let me accompany you too.
Me too!
-Let me search you! -I want to come too!
All right, we'll all go together.
"What's this? Now everyone loses their asses to go!"
"Everyone's going after the second egg, too?"
You're a good boy.
Done.
When the wound has closed you can fly again.
Really?
That's good!
Fortunately, on Hattori he only has a slight sprain,
but on Kaito Kid he may have died.
"It's impossible for him to have died. Maybe it's on board this ship."
Yes!
Eh? Oh!
I love the face you made... Thanks for the catch.
(Pita)
"What's on his head, this one?" Hello, Ran!
We've come to see you.
Miss Natsumi, Mr. Nishino, you too?
Please come in.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Oh!
Sorry, I'm sorry.
It can't be!
Eh?
I've got it!
He must have been embarrassed to see so many beautiful women!
I've neglected another beauty.
I'll go look for her.
You're talking about Miss Seiran, right?

Come on, little one! Do I have to go too?
Yes, thank you very much.
I'll be ready in a second.
"Grigori..."
The picture you have there is of your boyfriend, maybe?
Is it?
Yes, it's good.
Lucky you, everyone here is married.
I should have tried harder and fished the Kaito Kid for myself.
"If you were able to catch him, the police wouldn't have such a hard time."
Miss Natsumi,
so you've been living in Paris since you were 20 years old?
Yes, that's why I sometimes speak Japanese in a strange way.
Oh, now that we're talking about strange Japanese,
there are some words that have been stuck in my head since I was little.
What were they, say?
"Barushe nikukattabeta".
Eh?
I think they mean "in Barushe have you bought meat?".
Surely you don't know of anyone with a similar name, do you?
Miss Natsumi, your eyes...
Yes, they are gray.
Mother and my grandmother had the same color.
I guess we all must have inherited it from my great-grandmother.
Miss Seiran, your eyes are gray too, aren't they?
Yes, they are.
I see that in China there are also people with gray eyes.
"Seiran" is written with the characters meaning "blue orchid".
My name also means "orchid".
"Seiran" is the Japanese reading of my name.
My name is Qing-Ran.
Qing-Ran?
The character "sei" is pronounced "xing" and so is the "ran" character.
The surname "Hoshi" is pronounced "Pusu", as is Pusu Chin-Ran.
So, my name is pronounced the same in Chinese.
Yes, and "Mouri" is pronounced "Maori", so it would be Ran Maori.
I love it, it's so cute...
And what would I call myself?
"Sonoko Suzuki" would be pronounced "Ling-mu Yuanzi".
Ling-mu Yuanzi.
Excuse me, but I think you and I are the same age, right?
Yes, 27 years old.
-I knew it!
What month were you born in? -In May.
The 5th of May.
What? I was born on May 3rd!
I was born on May 3rd!
We're two days apart!
Then the two of you are one day apart.
What?
"One day apart? Then it's May 4th."
"The same day as Shinichi's birthday?"
"A coincidence like this..."
"Maybe...
"Maybe it's true that in Conan it's Shinichi."
"Piece of stock. This is completely impossible."
"I'm just imagining it because I'm always thinking about him."
"Seriously, I'm such a knucklehead."
Oh.
Miss Natsumi, Miss Seiran, you want to sit with us?
-Yes, do you mind? -No, woman, sit down.
Eh?
Wow!
How nice that she's so attractive!
"This guy is hopeless."
-Come on, drink as much as you like. -Ah, thank you very much.
Oh.
Mr. Sagawa, this pendant you're wearing...
I'd expect nothing less from a specialist of the Romanov dynasty.
I'm not surprised you noticed it.
He wants to see?
"Eh? But that man was wearing that pendant?"
"Maria?
It's the ring of Maria, the third daughter of Nicholas II?
Very well, if you say so, it's true.
-But where did you find it? -Ah.
You mean it's authentic?
I can't... be sure, unless I examine it properly.
Mr. Nishino, watch out, the pen will fall.
Eh?
Thank you, sir.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Mr. Mouri!
Mr. Mouri!
Is it in the cabin?
Yes!
It's already lunch time?
It's terrible!
I found Mr. Sagawa dead in his cabin!
I beg your pardon? What?
Mr. Sagawa...
He's been shot in the right eye.
"What? They also shot the Kaito Kid in the right eye!"
Don't come any closer!
The brats, get out of here!
Run away!
Conan, are you all right?
Rigor mortis has just set in.
He's probably been dead for half an hour.
Mmmm?
The pendant is missing.
Chairman Suzuki, this is a homicide.
-Please call the police. -Yes, sir.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Hello, Inspector Megre.
Inspector Shiratori, I thought you were on vacation in Karuizawa.
I was bored out of my mind.
What, is there a case?
You've come at just the right time.
Come with us, please.
Inspector Megre, we've been waiting for you.
But, man!
Why are there always murders everywhere you go?

What do you want me to tell you?
It must be God's will.
Who knows?
Maybe you are the god of the dead.
Inspector Shiratori has passed.
What's that?
Why this band-aid?
It's nothing.
I had it out with a suspect yesterday.
Mmmm?
The victim is Mr. Ryu Sagawa, age 32.
He was a freelance journalist and photojournalist.
This is a robbery with murder and the killer stole a ring from him!
A ring?
Yes.
It belonged to Maria, the third daughter of Nicholas II,
and Mr. Sagawa wore it around his neck.
If he wanted to steal the ring, all he had to do was remove the chain from her neck.
Strange that the assassin tore the cushion.
Once again walking around shamelessly...
Inspector Megre, we found that. A pen.
Mmmm?
M. Nishino?
Excuse me, Mr. Nishino, this pen is obviously yours, isn't it?
Is it?
Yes, but how come it was found in Mr. Sagawa's cabin?
You found the body, didn't you? I did, sir.
That's right.
The food was ready, I went to warn him.
Did you enter the cabin? No.
And how do you understand that your pen fell into the victim's cabin?
I don't know.
What were you doing at half past five at 8 o'clock?
Towards a quarter of 8 was in my room showering me
and then I rested for a moment.
-Don't tell me he's dead himself. -No, that's impossible.
N-No, that's impossible.
No.
"If Mr. Nishino were Mr. Sagawa's murderer,
"there's a good chance
"that he was also the person who shot the Kaito Kid."
Inspector Megre!
We discovered that all your tapes were missing.
How!
This explains why they left the cockpit upside down.
Conan!
Don't play your cards without permission!
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on him.
Ah.
Miss Ran,
the boat may have an assassin prowling around with a gun.
Go back to the others, sisplau.
But Conan...
I'll find him and take him, don't worry.
Au.
Daix√≤...
Leave it to me.
Hello, doctor.
It's me.
I want you to check something urgently.
(Doctor Agasa) What?
A sniper who always aims the right eye?
Okay, I'll look at it right away.
Call me back in 10 minutes.
Look for what you're looking for...
"10 minutes?"
"Must be my imagination?"
Shinichi!
I've already found it!
I just went into the criminal files...
and found a thief whose age and sex are unknown.
His name is... Scorpion.
Scorpion?
Inspector, I found it.
It was under Mr. Nishino's bed.
That's impossible.
We seem to have found conclusive proof, haven't we?
I swear I didn't do anything!
And how do you intend to explain the ring going to his room?
I don't understand it either.
"I'll bet you anything that the murderer is the Scorpion."
"If so, that means Mr. Nishino is the Scorpion."
Oh.
"A cushion filled with rice?" Conan!
Mr. Nishino, do you have an allergy to feathers?
Yes, I do.
This means Mr. Nishino is not the killer.
What?
Go on, we're listening.
Yes... You've seen it.
Mr. Sagawa's cabin was full of feathers.
And the killer even tore the pillow.
A person allergic to feathers wouldn't do such a thing.
Do you have a feather allergy?
Yes, I'm a witness myself, Inspector.
Just if there's any feathers around, he starts sneezing.
That's why Mr. Nishino's cushion wasn't stuffed with feathers.
You see?
Mr. Nishino has left the Ran's cabin because of the pigeon.
In this case, who must be the murderer?
Inspector, do you know who the Scorpion is?
The Scorpion?
He only clothes treasures of the Romanov dynasty all over the world
and he always shoots his victims in the right eye.
Ah, yes.
It seems to me that there was an international search warrant out for him.
You're saying the killer we're dealing with is him?
Yes, I believe it's him.
And surely, he also shot the Kaito Kid.
What did you say?
The en Kaito Kid's monocle was broken, remember?
The Scorpion shot the en Kaito Kid
and wanted to get the egg that this thief had swiped.

How do you know the Scorpion exists? No, you see... I wanted to say that...
You asked Dr. Agasa.
Is that so?
Tell me, Conan.
Yes.
"The presence I noticed when Dr. Agasa called...
"Was it Inspector Shiratori?"
"That a secret would be revealed."
"This is what Inspector Shiratori meant?"
But if we consider the Scorpion the murderer,
how come we found the ring in Mr. Nishino's cabin?
I have no idea.
"What a drag."
"Using the anesthetic darts in front of Inspector Shiratori...
"It's out of the question."
"I have no other way out."
Mr. Nishino, did you and Mr. Sagawa know each other?
When Mr. Sagawa met you, he got a scare.
Really?
Mr. Nishino, you've traveled abroad a lot, haven't you?
You must have met somewhere when you were in another country.
Yes!
Do you know where you saw him... Mr. Sagawa?
Yes.
It was when I was traveling in Asia 3 years ago.
That man was filming a little girl who had lost her house to fire.
I told him to stop, he was still filming and I hit him.
At the time, Mr. Sagawa had no sympathy for him.
I got it!
Mr. Nishino, you're the Scorpion!
"Au, go."
He's been cleared of suspicion because of the feather allergy,
do you remember?
Ah, now I didn't think.
He's off the hook for a big one.
What?
Because if Mr. Sagawa hadn't been killed by Scorpion,
you would have been taken for the thief of the ring.
What?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I get it!
In this case, not only are there two eggs,
but there are also two overlapping cases.
Two cases ?!
"So, very good."
We have Mr. Sagawa,
who wanted to set a trap for Mr. Nishino.
"With the aim of making Mr. Nishino look
"as the thief who would have swiped his ring,
"he exhibited it in front of everyone."
"The victim then went into Mr. Nishino's cabin...
"while the latter was taking a shower and hid the ring under the bed."
"And then he took the pen...
"To frame Mr. Nishino for the alleged robbery."
"However, the second case occurred before he could air it."
"The Scorpion has shot Mr. Sagawa."
His aim, surely, was that he would have recorded on the tapes
something that would reveal the true identity of the Scorpion
and his ring.
But since he couldn't find the ring,
the Scorpion turned the cabin upside down to look for it.
Very good, Mr. Kogoro.
That's a great deduction.
To me, this is child's play.
Does this mean that the Scorpion is somewhere on this ship?
About this... A lifeboat seems to be missing.
What?
What?
So, the Scorpion has taken this boat?
I've sent out a search warrant, but I think it'll be hard to find.
Has it got away from us?
"He's really gone?"
In any case,
now that we no longer have a murderer on board, we can rest easier.
-Right? -Yes, we can rest easy.
But the Scorpion must be interested in the second egg
and it's possible that the Kosaka family's castle will appear again.
No, he's probably already on his way to the castle.
Inspector Megre.
I am determined to go to the castle
with Miss Natsumi and her companions.
Yes, please do.
You heard him, little boy.
You can't come with us this time.
Did you understand?
-In Conan, we'll get it too. -What?
Such peculiar ideas as yours can do us a lot of service.
-Your ideas? -Yes.
At Conan he gets on my nerves!
You're right, since he went to Osaka, we don't hear from him.
He no longer has any right to belong to the Junior Detective League.
Doctor, you still haven't found it, the driver's license?
I'm sure he left it here!
If you don't hurry, the Edogawa will arrive before we do.
Mmmm.
My goodness!
Oh, girl, you sure know how to find things!
Oh?
I think I've found another problem.
Huh? (Laughs)
Surprise!
Mr. Mouri, you think the ring that Mr. Sagawa was wearing

was Princess Mary's?
I do not know.
But I am told that Inspector Megre has retained it in his custody
for examination.
Maria was the sweetest heiress of the 4 sisters
and it seems she had very large gray eyes.
"Gray eyes? Like Miss Natsumi and Miss Seiran!"
I guess you are already aware
that they shot the entire imperial family
after the Russian revolution.
But neither the tsarevitx's nor Maria's bodies have been found.
I didn't know that.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ah!
It is a beautiful castle!
It looks like Neuswanstein Castle in Germany.
They say that was the model for Cinderella's castle.
"Eh? And why is it a German-style castle?"
"Natsumi's great-grandmother was Russian."
Hello, Conan!
Conan!
How are you feeling?
Doctor, what are you doing here?
Conan played a trick on me... and I came all the way here with the car.
It has.
As I told you, I've upgraded the performance of these.
Thank you. Thank you.
Let's see, can you tell me why you took them?
They got into the car in an oversight.
It seems that we are in a fairy tale!
And here is hidden a treasure, for sure!
How many bowls of rice with eels could I eat?
-Don't even think of going inside! -Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
"Come on, let's go. This group is too obedient."
Mr. Inui is taking too long.
He said he had to go somewhere else first.
Sorry, it took me a while to make preparations!
What does he have in his backpack?
That he plans to start an expedition, perhaps?
They say so.
One has to be prepared for any unforeseen event.
You'll have to be alert.
The Scorpion may be closer than we think.
Yes, I'm aware of that.
Please lock the door.
So those children can't get in.
Yes.
-Great, great!
Now comes ours! -What's in your heads? -What's in your heads?
We'll find the treasure before they do!
I'm sure there's another entrance.
We're looking for it, guys!
-Yes! -Wait!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh...
This is the knights' quarters.
Here you will find a series of armor and tapestries decorating the chamber.
This is the room of the ladies of the nobility.
The lady often spent all day in this chamber.
She said that this is where she felt most at home.
This is the tsar's chamber.
Excuse me, I would like to go to the toilet for a moment.
The toilets are down the corridor, at the end on the right.
Oh!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I thought so.
Ah.
I didn't find the egg, but what the hell?
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
What's the meaning of this?
It's a security system against thieves
devised by Lord Kiichi 80 years ago.
There are many other mechanisms like this throughout the castle,
so be on your guard.
That is..., Mr. Inui, it's forbidden to act on your own.
I think the little boy will be enough for you.
"Gee, he really liked these mechanisms, Mr. Kiichi."
"In this case..."
Sir, where are the cellars of this castle?
It doesn't have one.
And which is Mr. Kiichi's chamber?
Now, that's the butler's chamber.
Come on in.
This is the butler's chamber,
but here are photographs of Mr. Kiichi
and you can see footage of his daily routines.
Miss Natsumi, there are no pictures of your great-grandmother?
Well look, there aren't any.
That's why I don't know exactly what she looked like.
Ah.
"It's incomprehensible,
"There are lots and lots of pictures of Mr. Kiichi."
Come on!
Wasn't this man here Rasputin?
Yes, there's no doubt it's him.
Besides, there is the autograph G. Rasputin on top of it.
"G Rasputin..."
Father, who was Rasputin, say?
All I can say is that he was one of the most mean-spirited people
there ever was in the world.
He was referred to as the "mad monk."
He got close to the imperial family, ran it the way he wanted to run it
and brought about the fall of the Romanov dynasty.
He had all the power he wanted....,
but, in the end, the grand duke Felix Yusupov, cousin of the tsar,
assassinated him.
When his body was found in the Neva River, his skull had been fractured
and a bullet had hollowed out one of his eyes.
"One of the eyes?"

Mr. Inui..., we are not here for Rasputin, but for the other egg.
We already know that.
But how can we look for it in such a big castle?
Mr. Kogoro, leave me alone for a moment! What the hell are you doing?
Sew air from below!
There's a secret room down here!
What?!
In this case, knowing Mr. Kiichi's fondness for mechanisms,
I'm convinced there's some kind of switch somewhere.
-What is this? -It's the Cyrillic alphabet!
Sure, with it you can open the secret cellar.
I'm sure there is a password.
Mr. Sergei, can you put something in Russian?
Yes.
"Records!"
No doubt it must be "Vospominanye"!
Vospominanye.
What?
No nothing?
Then it must be "Kiichi Kosaka"!
Kiichi Kosaka.
Nothing seems to be wrong.
Miss Natsumi, do you remember anything that was said or explained to you?
No, nothing at all.
Barushe nikukattabeka.
Is it possible that the words you told us about were in Russian?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about? Shut up!
Miss, what did you say after... "Barushe"?
Nikukattabeka.
Barushe nikukattabeka.
Maybe the words aren't exactly the same as you remember.
Baru-sheni kukatta... beka.
Mmm... Barusheni...
And couldn't it be...
"Volshebnik... Consha Veka"?
You are right!
It's "Volshebnik Consha Veka"!
And what does this mean?
In English it would be translated as "The Last Wizard of The Century".
-And translated in this language... - "The Last Wizard of The Century".
The last wizard of the century?
I had heard this before.
It was the ad in Kaito Kid! It's true!
It's a coincidence!
"A coincidence? Can I really believe it?"
We'll type it in to see if it works.
Volshebnik
Consha Veka.
What?
Where is this rumbling coming from?
This was down here?
Extraordinary, boy!
It's impossible!
This one is closed too!
What a mess!
If we waste time, they'll find the treasure before we do!
-Oh, wait!
Where the hell are you going? -I'm going to examine that tower.
Haibara!
What's inside that tower?
-The treasure must be there! -What a thrill!
It's open!
Oh!
-But, Haibara, there's nothing here.
I-I didn't tell you there was nothing.
Kids!
We should just let it go and go home!
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
What? What? What?
It's awful!
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
Ah!
-It's made me sick, eh? -What a soft belly you have.
Thanks to you we haven't had a bad drink.
-Eh?
What's that? -A snake!
Aaaah!
It's no snake.
It's a rope ladder.
It's very old.
It looks like it was nailed on top, but it must have come loose.
Oh, I was scared!
What do we do?
Do we wait for the doctor to come here to rescue us?
Or do you want us to keep moving?
-Well...-...naturally....
We'll move on!
-By the way, Miss Natsumi... Yes?
Why do you think the password was "the last wizard of the century"?
I guess that's what they called him.
I understand that my great-grandfather
exhibited some dolls at the 1900 Paris World's Fair,
when he was 16 years old,
and went to Russia right after that.
Yes, really... 1900 was the end of the century.
We still have a long way to go.
This road goes a long way.
What's the matter? Now I felt a little noise.
It must be the Scorpion? I'll check it out!
Conan! I'll go!
Mr. Mouri, please stay here with the rest.
Understood.
Mmmmm?
Ah!
You are...!
Ah! Guys!
Conan!
"What the hell."
In this world, what I want is to have your love.
I have contemplated...
What the hell are they thinking, these kids?
There's nothing wrong with it.
Besides, the more we are, the more we laugh.
Yeah, but...
Yes, the mystery is clearing up.
In this world, what I want is to have your love.
There's no way out!
Maybe we've taken a wrong turn.
It's impossible.
This is the only way out of this cellar.
"This means... there must be some other mechanism here too."
Look, everything is full of birds.
Strange, the fat bird is the only one with two heads.
The two-headed eagle.

It is the emblem of the Russian Tsar.
Yes.
And behind the crown is the sun.
The sun... The light...
Yes, it could be...
Inspector Shiratori, concentrate the light of your flashlight
on the crown of the two-headed eagle.
Eh?
Yes.
It glowed!
What's the matter?
Everybody back!
An entrance?
Now I understand.
This means that inside the crown there is a photometric mechanism.
Ah.
It's amazing!
It is an impressive mechanism.
It's as if we were inside an egg.
What is it?
It looks like a coffin.
It's western style..., but it's made of paulownia wood.
That's nothing!
What a fat padlock!
Miss Natsumi, what's that key?
What's that?
Yes, I forgot.
It was the key to this lock.
"This means that inside this coffin..."
-Give me permission to open it? -Ah... yes.
It weighs an awful lot!
There's a skeleton inside.
And also the egg.
It looks like he's sleeping with the egg in his arms.
Miss Natsumi, is this your great-grandfather's body?
No.
Surely it must be my great-grandmother's.
My great-grandfather's grave is Yokosuka.
I've always wondered why his body was the only one resting there.
Perhaps she wasn't allowed to be buried in the family tomb
because she was Russian.
Miss Natsumi, I'm sorry to have to ask at a time like this,
but can you let us see the egg?
Yes.
Please go ahead.
Let's see, there's a very small hole underneath.
Is it?
Is it empty?
That's impossible!
How do you mean it is? Empty?
It's a matryoshka.
-What? -A matryoshka?
I have one of these dolls at home.
A friend of my father's went to Russia and brought us one as a souvenir.
What is this matryoshka they say?
It's a Russian doll with dolls inside.
You open them up, and they get smaller and smaller.
It's possible that it's a... Look closely.
There are some slots that had the function of keeping the egg in place.
What a rage!
If we had the other egg we could confirm it!
The egg, we have it here.
Eh?
I asked President Suzuki to leave it with us
because I was afraid something like this would happen.
Ep, I hope you didn't take it without permission.
No, man.
I wouldn't do something like that.
Let us check it out.
It fits.
This means that Kiichi-san didn't make the two eggs separately,
but he made... a pair to fit together.
You don't seem very convinced.
Well no, surely there is another mechanism inside that egg.
What's more, an incredible mechanism only within the reach of the last magician of the century.
It is impressive.
Diamond door.
No.
Looks like it's not diamonds.
-What? -They're just cut crystals. -They're just cut crystals.
"Crystals?"
"Wait a minute. Come to think of it..."
"Under the lid of the egg were embedded crystals."
"Mr. Kiichi's room, the light mechanism.
"And that pillar!"
"The crystals in the egg are there to do the function of a lens! Sure!"
Mr. Sergei, let me have this egg.
-A new you?
Stop it! -Mr. Mouri, wait a moment. -Mr. Mouri, wait a moment.
-Eh? -Can I help you in any way?
Please take the flashlight.
Concentrate the light as before and put it inside the pillar.
Very good.
Done!
Mr. Sergei, Miss Seiran, blow out the candles!
Now what the hell are you going to do? Now you will see.
You can see the inside of the egg from the outside!
We haven't touched any mechanism,
but the dolls of the Tsar's family are rising upwards!
You put a photometric device inside the egg?
-Oh! -What is it?
This is it!
Oh!

These are photographs of Tsar Nicholas II's family!
Of course, the dolls in the egg were not looking at just any book...
It was an album.
That's why it was called "egg of memories".
If they had not murdered the imperial family
and received this egg,
they wouldn't have found any gift more wonderful than this one.
You know, miss?
Believe me, your great-grandfather really was the last wizard of the century.
I'm sure my great-grandfather would be very pleased to hear it.
Miss Natsumi.
Isn't that... a photograph of your great-grandfather?
Isn't it?
Yes, that photograph of two people sitting on a bench.
Yes, that's right.

So the woman in the photograph was my great-grandmother?
My great-grandmother...
I finally know what she looked like.
This photograph was taken in Japan.
Mr. Kiichi was to add it later.
"Eh? This girl..."
"She looks like... Miss Natsumi!"
This egg belongs to Mr. Kiichi.
Therefore, it is a great treasure for Japan.
Russia relinquishes possession of this egg
along with its contents.
Its value lies in the fact that it is in your hands.
Thank you very much.
Ah, but the egg inside belongs to President Suzuki.
Allow me to explain what the situation is to President Suzuki.
I am sure he will understand.
"Where has Mr. Inui gone?"
Photographs of Rasputin.
There were none.
Even though the photos were of the imperial family.
In Mr. Kiichi's camera there was also one...
Eh?
"That was a G! It can't be!"
Let's go.
All's well that ends well.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
And now...
Alert!
Conan, what are you doing?
Ran, don't take it!
What's that?
Ran!
"Shinichi!"
Everybody get down!
Aaaah!
Oh!
The egg!
Damn it!
You're not getting away! Don't go!
Mr. Mouri, stay in charge of the situation!
"Shinichi..."
Ah!
Mr. Inui!
Coi!
Casumdena!
I'm sure of it.
There must be some switch to open the floor from the inside.
One brick is different from the others.
Don't run so fast!
Don't think you'll be the only person to get out of here alive!
I know exactly who he is!
She makes it look like her nationality is Chinese....,
but in reality you are Russian.
You are a descendant of Rasputin, a mad monk.
Miss Seiran.
What is the meaning of this?
You've blocked our way!
-Can't we get out of here? -Come on, follow me all of you, come on. -Come on.
-What? -What?
You heard me!
I said follow me!
Yeah, right.
Yes, at first I didn't notice.
This voice?
Sagawa?
Restructuring the letters of the name Pusu Ching-Ran,
the Chinese reading of the name Seiran Hoshi,
it became the name Rasputin.
But you... I was sure you had died!
The fortune of the Romanov Dynasty
was supposed to have gone to Rasputin,
who was a close friend of the Tsar's family.
Following this approach, he disguised himself
and decided to seize his treasures on his own.
And he shot insistently into the right eye of his victims
to avenge the death of his ancestor, right?
Mr. Inui!
I am the only one here. What?
This is a voice transformer.
With this device I can speak with the voice of different people.
Who the hell are you? I'm Conan Edogawa, a detective.
You murdered Mr. Sagawa
because you were about to find out his identity.
"Mr. Sagawa was given to visiting other people's rooms
"And he videotaped everyone with the camcorder."
"He forgot to turn the picture frame upside down."
"That photograph was not of her boyfriend."
"It was a photograph of Grigorij Rasputin!"
"Grigorij, in English the name begins with G.
"But in Russian it begins with the 'gue' of the Cyrillic alphabet."
"That's why I didn't fall for it right away.
"When we have seen the photograph signed with Gue Rasputin."
So you thought
that Mr. Sagawa had filmed the photograph of Rasputin
and murdered him.
Correct, Miss Seiran?
No, no, Scorpion!
You've figured it all out, boy.
And evidently I can assume that you have murdered Mr. Inui
with this gun and that silencer.
Why, you seem to have seen it with your own eyes.
But he has made an attempt against Mr. Kogoro
because he spoke ill of Rasputin.
Father, who was Rasputin, say?
The only thing I can say is that he was one of the most mean-spirited people
there ever was in the world.
And he even tried to assassinate Ran.
Enough talk.
I'm sorry, but I'm going to kill you.
This gun is a Walter PPKS, isn't it?
As far as I know, it only holds 8 bullets, right?
Huh?
With Mr. Inui, Mr. Kogoro and Ran, you've used 3.
And then you fired 5 bullets up here;
so he must not have any more bullets left.
I'll tell you something interesting.
If the gun is pre-loaded with a bullet in the barrel,

before putting the magazine with 8 bullets, there are 9 bullets.
In other words, this pistol has one more bullet left.
So shoot.
Eh?
If it really has another bullet left.
What a dumb kid.
What's he like?
Ah!
Ah! (Laughs)
It's a pity, Scorpion.
I had asked Dr. Agasa
to make me new glasses with special lenses.
Conan, are you all right? Are you all right?
Yes, yes, of course.
Hurry, we have to get out of here!
Conan!
Come on, let's go!
Ah!
Phew, we're saved.
It's terrible!
The castle is on fire!
Eh?
Conan!
"Shinichi..."
-Conan! -Conan!
What's all the shouting?
Shut up a little.
Conan!
Inspector Shiratori has recovered this egg from the Scorpion.
Inspector Shiratori?
Then what happened to the Scorpion?
Miss Seiran, the Scorpion, has arrested him
and took her to the police station.
-What?! - She was the Scorpion?
Yes.
Here, Miss Natsumi.
She told me to give it to you.
Thank you very much.
I can't believe it, a woman with such beautiful legs was the Scorpion?
(Mermaids)
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!
I beg your pardon.
I'm sorry something like this happened.
The castle has burned but I have left the egg that my great-grandfather created,
which has a lot of sentimental value for me.
Besides, I think the cellars will remain intact.
Yes.
When we have put everything in order,
we'll bury your great-grandmother in the same grave as your great-grandfather.
Well, well, at last in Kaito Kid has not appeared.
I don't know if he's dead.
No, he's alive, for sure.
Eh?
Mr. Kogoro has already fallen asleep.
It seems he was very tired.
You understand.
We've had quite a rough patch.
Ran, what's wrong?
Thank you... for saving my life at the castle.
You were really brave.
You reminded me of Shinichi.
You're certainly just like Shinichi.
"Ran."
But you... you're not him, are you?
Aren't I right?
Conan, say.
"I'm trapped."
Listen..., Ran...
Actually, I... the truth is...
Shinichi.
Eh?
Is it really you, Shinichi? What's with the question?
I came to check on you
because I heard you were involved in a case, and you greet me like this?
"It can't be."
You idiot!
What the hell have you been up to?!
You never call me!
Forgive me, please, I've been very busy with all these cases.
And I must leave at once.
Wait! I'll bring you some dry clothes so you can change!
I'll bring you some dry clothes so you can change!
Wait a minute, Kaito Kid!
You've lifted my shirt.
I didn't imagine
you should go to the boat disguised as Inspector Shiratori.
Hello!
Inspector Shiratori, you've done a great feat!
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I just came back from Karuizawa, I don't understand anything, Inspector.
What's that?
You already knew something was going to happen on that ship.
I knew something was up, but I wasn't entirely sure,
so I tapped the ship's phone.
Another question.
You tried to steal the egg to return it to Miss Natsumi,
its real owner.
You knew that the egg had been created by Kiichi Kosaka
and that she was called 'The last magician of the century'.
That's why you used that reference to your ad, right?
Blow!
Did you notice something else?
You mean the Natsumi's great-grandmother was Maria,
the third daughter of Tsar Nicholas II?
"Maria's body has never been found."
"And that's because Mr. Kiichi took her to Japan.
"Before the firing squad."
Love blossomed between them and a child was born.
But she died shortly after having the child.
"To protect Maria's body from the revolutionary troops," he said,
"He sold the precious stones that he brought from Russia
"And built the castle."
"But it was not a Russian-style castle, but a German-style castle."
"He did it because his mother, Tsarina Alexandra, was German."
"In this way, he laid Maria's body to rest
"In the secret cellar together with the egg."
"And the other egg, he left the clue to the castle,
"in the hope that one of her descendants would find it."
If one looks at it this way, the mystery is solved.
I would like to give you a little advice.
In this world

there are things that are best left under the veil of mystery.
Yes, it will be better to let this mystery remain a mystery.
Then will you be able to solve this mystery, detective?
Do you know why I have appeared in the guise of Shinichi Kudo?
to help you... one of my most troublesome enemies?
Shinichi!
"Ximplet! This is no mystery."
"You have helped me because...
"I've taken care of your pigeon."
"Oi?"

It's just that he said he'd come again.
That's good!
Well, the next time I see him...
Ia!

Oops!
This is what you'll get.
