"The cases he investigates at Conan get more complicated every day."
"Today's case was solved overnight in a library."
"The truth always comes out in the end!"
"His brain of an adult and he's...Detective Conan!"

DETECTIVE CONAN
"In Heiji brought us that liquor."
"That must be it!"
"With the liquor I'm back to my old self."
"If I drink it all, maybe I'll definitely go back to the way I was before."
Conan!
Little kids can't drink liquor!
Your friends have come to see you!
(Thinking) "If I drink that liquor and go back to the way I was before,
I won't have to go with these creatures again."
The library murder case
(Thinks) "My goodness, what boring books."
"How do they want me to comment, on these books!"
"How badly placed they are."
"You know, it's the children's corner, they turn everything upside down."
"Eh?"
"An import book?"
"They've put it in upside down and wrapped it in plastic."
Hey, kid, these books aren't children's books, you know?
Ah, excuse me, sir.
Conan!
Look at this!
Look at this!
It's a police car!
What could have happened?
Maybe there's been a murder.
Mr. Director, the police are downstairs.
What's that?
Understood.
I'll be right down.
Don't move, I'll be right back!
(Genta) Hey!
(Genta) Hey!
Conan!
Wait, wait!
Elevator!
Hold it!
(Alarm)
(alarm blaring) Huh?
There's overload.
It says maximum 7 people.
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Five!
Six!
Seven!
Seven people!
What's the overload?
You haven't counted yourself! Ah!
See what I was telling you?
In Genta it won't get cold anymore.
We'll have to go down the stairs!
You are the director of the library, aren't you?
Yes, my name is Tsugawa, sir.
I've come to ask you
if you know anything about one of the librarians, in Kazuo Tamada.
Ah, he didn't come to work yesterday or today.
Hello, Inspector Megure!
What's happened?
Did something happen to him?
He's been reported missing.
Mr. Tamada hasn't been home since the day before yesterday.
Hey!
What's that?
What's he saying now?
The day before yesterday he was supposed to stay with you for overtime, right?
Ah... Yes... but I left before Tamada.
I don't know what I was supposed to do, he...
Inspector, why are they searching the library storeroom?
Maybe he was kidnapped on his way home.
It's just a formality.
Mr. Tamada always called his wife.
Tamada always called his wife from the library,
before he went home after work.
But the day before yesterday, he didn't call her.
So there are two possibilities,
that someone took him while he was at work, or that he went here,
but if he is, he's most likely dead.
Sir, we've looked everywhere, and she's nowhere to be found.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He must have been taken somewhere.
Well, let's go, then!
Let's go, then!
And excuse the inconvenience, sir!
Ah... Don't suffer.
All right, they've all gone.
(thinks) "Damn kids, I told them to go away."
We're all alone now.
What shall we do now?
We'll look for the body.
But the police said they couldn't...
Something smells, in this library.
(Smells)
Pudor?
(Elevator goes up)
(Thinks) "The elevator! Someone's coming up."
Amagueu's-e!
(Thinks) "The director! Mr. Tsugawa!"
"What's he doing here at this hour?"
"There were some suspicious books, in that closet."
Tamada is an idiot.
If he hadn't seen what's here, he wouldn't have killed her.
And the police, what fools, they've gone so quietly...
without knowing that in Tamada he is dead and I have him in this library.
(Thinking) "I thought so."
"Mr. Tamada's corpse is here, in this library."
"The murderer is Director Tsugawa."
"But where did he hide it, the corpse?"
"Eh? If I'm not mistaken,
these books were stuffed in the box upside down.

And besides, they were wrapped with plastic wrap."
It's so dark I can't see myself.
Ah!
Eh?
Who's there?!
Anybody here?
I've got you!
(thinks) "We'd better stay here for a while."
Hey, Conan, I'm really hungry!
Don't you get it?
Xxxxt!
(Conan) Huh?
It's empty!
He must have taken them with the bag.
It can't be, this.
See how many boxes there are.
They wouldn't all fit in the bag he took with him.
He must have hidden them somewhere in this room.
For the time being, we'll have to look for the books.
Well said, Conan!
The detectives are in action!
Yes... exactly.
First, we'll deal with these shelves.
We divide into two groups and look at the books on both sides.
(At the same time) Okay!
(At the same time) Idiot!
Don't turn on the lights!
We can't see each other, Conan!
What will happen, if the director sees light?!
Don't suffer, he will have already gone home.
I hope so, Genta...
(Think) "Well, it looks like he's gone."
Have you already found a strange book? No, not at the moment.
There doesn't seem to be anything, on this shelf,
because we've already taken out most of the books.
Eh?
Look, they haven't touched them, the books of the other band.
Hey, Genta!
Genta!
-Oh, what do you want, Conan? -Oh, what do you want, Conan? -What the hell are you doing, you guys?
We've already taken out all the books of this gang!
What the hell are you doing, you guys?
How strange...
I could have sworn we've taken them all away too.
What a strange book!
This book has no spine!
-What?! - It's true!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
All the books in this row are the same!
It's not that the books were put in the box upside down.
The books simply didn't have spines.
What's the meaning of this?
What does this mean?
That the books without spines were in the middle of the regular books.
So, there are 3 rows of books.
If someone were to take out one of these books, they would only see the page part of the pages
and you would think it was the book in the other row.
No one would notice that there are books in between.
Besides, it's the children's book room.
If the children take the books out, though it goes more unnoticed.
That's why they were misplaced.
When people put the books on the shelf, they push the books in the middle.
What does this mean, Conan?
If these strange books are imported,
they must be full of weapons or...
...drugs!
Wow!
There's some in this one too!
And in this one too!
The library director is a drug dealer, right?
Yes.
In this room he stores the drugs he receives and sells them.
Mr.
Tamada was supposed to find out by chance
and the director was supposed to kill him...
because he didn't rat him out!
What's weird, there's no line.
Is it broken?
Yes.
Come on, guys, we have to go explain it to the police.
Now that we're here, we could look for the corpse!
Ah, good idea!
Then we'll get double credit.
He's right!
(thinks) "How are they..."
If we find the corpse, we'll become famous.
What an exciting case!
My shoelace has come undone.
How dark.
I can't tie it properly.
Hey, Ayumi!
Ayumi!
What the hell are you doing now?
Shoelace...
Unpractical shoe doors.
You're a bad guy!
I really like these shoes.
No one would be so dumb to hide a corpse on a shelf, right?
Hey, the police searched the warehouse this afternoon, right?
We've already looked everywhere, Conan.
Hey, look, there's some strange cabinets back here.
Look at that!
What a strange handle they have.
It's one of those shelves that move!
-They move?
-Yes, they do.
You turn this handle and...
they move!
Wow!
Yes!
(Thinks) "But it's reckless, hiding a corpse in here."
"If someone moves the shelves..."
Shit!
Genta, what's wrong with you?
This fucking crank won't turn, Conan.
(thinks) "It could be here!"
Mitsuhiko!
Ayumi!
Help us move this shelf.
Ready... ready... go!
Oysters!
There's nothing here!
And there's nothing strange inside either.
That means it hasn't been moved, otherwise I would have seen that...
Genta!
Yes? You're too heavy!
Yes, man, and what else!

Hey, Genta, you've put on too much weight.
How much do you weigh now?
-Only 40 kilos. You weigh twice as much as I do!
(Thinking) "I can't stand it anymore."
"Anyway, patience,
today is the last day I'll have to put up with these children."
"When I drink that liquor and get my body back.... Just a moment."
I only weigh 15 kilos!
You're too heavy.
Shut up!
"Of course, I didn't remember: I'm a child now!"
"And the last time I weighed myself, I weighed 18 kilos."
"Elevator! Just a moment!"
(Alarm)
I know where the corpse is hidden!
Hey, Conan!
Hold on, Conan!
Conan!
(Genta) Where are you?
(Conan!
Where are you?!
Hey, Conan!
Answer me!
(footsteps)
(Conan!
Where have you been, huh?
In the engine room!
And you found the corpse there?
No, I just went there to open the elevator door manually.
The corpse must be...
in here!
What?
You mean this is it?
Yes.
The proof is the overload alarm
that went off this afternoon when we got on this elevator.
Huh?
But the alarm went off because there were 8 of us in the elevator.
Donkey!
We are children, aren't we?
If we were to add up our weights, we would weigh about 100 kilos.
And 100 kilos can weigh an adult.
Adding our weights and the weights of the 4 adults,
we would still need the weight of an adult to set off the alarm!
Because there was another adult in this elevator.
Right on top of us.
On the roof.
I would say that first he was strangled.
Then he was thrown down the elevator shaft from above.
And it was all the work of that director.
Come on, let's call the police.
Hey, what's going on?
What's the matter?
-The one from... of... The... -The... the...
What do you mean?
(Think) "Him, the director?!"
Kids, what's he doing here alone at this time of the night?
Come on boys, come with me, I'll walk you home.
(Quietly) Listen to me well and do what I tell you.
What are you talking about now, children?
Come on, we'll go home.
Well!
Perhaps you think we are donkeys, Mr. Director?
What?!
We've found out everything you've done!
The third row of books, how he hid the drugs....
And we also know how he murdered M.
Tamada because he knew everything.
What are you saying?
Who the hell are you, kid?!
In Conan Edogawa, a detective.
A... detective?
I won't let you run away!
-You've saved yourself by a hair.
-You made it!
Goddamn it!
You little pussies.
But I won't let you run away just like that!
(Thinks) "I've arrived in time."
All right, get ready...
I've got you now!
They're not here?
Have they come down somewhere else?
Well, it's all the same.
I'll stop the elevator, and they'll be trapped like rats.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Get ready, little rats, because I'm gonna kill you one at a time.
(Director) Hey, where are you... cuties?
I was very naughty, just now.
I promise I won't do it again.
Come on, get out.
They're here.
What's going on?
They wanted to make a barrier for me.
Mmm?
It's slanted.
I get it, they've put books underneath.
Now, now, now!
It can only occur to a child, that.
But don't worry, jesters, you won't be lonely...
I'll see to it that you all go to the other world four times.
Ah!
Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(At the same time) We did it!
It went well!
"When we had him trapped, we notified the police."
"They arrested Director Tsugawa."
"They also took away the corpse and confiscated all the drugs."
"And so, Conan Edogawa's last case was already solved."
(Ayumi) It was very exciting!
(Ayumi) -I thought he would kill us.
(Ayumi) -Donkey!
Justice always wins!
(Thinks) "I can say goodbye to this child's body."
We should repeat it, eh, Conan?
Junior detectives!
Junior detectives!
That's right.
If we work together we'll solve any case!
-We can look for the next one! (At the same time) -Yes, yes!
(Thinking) "What am I going to do now... about these three?"
That was incredible.
Conan, come back...
I'll be seeing you!
Looks like he's going somewhere far away from here.

It's true.
(Thinks) "I'll be back to my old self, Shinichi Kudo,
a high school student!"
"With this liquor, I'll finally be able to go back to my old self!"
Conan, you just arrived?
What have you done, up to this hour?
What?
Conan, ot are you?
(Agasa) Your body has returned to its original form?
(adult voice) Yes!
Having drunk liquor from this one.
It seems impossible, but...
Well, if you think I'm lying, look, look!
No!
Hey, hey, hey!
(He thinks) "That's it, that's it! My body is getting hot!"
(Tune of "Step by step")
DETECTIVE CONAN
Hey, doctor... Doctor!
I haven't transformed, though, have I?
It's probably because your body is used to it.
Used to it?
The first time you've had a drink,
some ingredient in the liquor triggered a reaction in your body
and you have been transformed,
but your body has built up a resistance,
and it no longer works.
It is impossible!
I must not have had enough to drink.
Hey, Shinichi... No!
Get down!
All at once! Will you stop?!
Let go of me! Stop drinking this booze, Conan!
-Conan, what happened to you? -You're very pale, boy.
Have you gone cold again?
(Thinking) "You idiots...
I've got a hangover..."
Failed again?
It's the 20th time.
Kogoro is not made for golf.
Això of golf is not his forte.
(He thinks) "What was it, this noise?"
"I know how he did it, the criminal!"
"Sure! The murderer is him!"
In the next episode...
The golf course murder
