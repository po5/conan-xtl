Come on, Father, the movie's starting.
I'll pass.
Hurry up, we'll be late.
I'm not coming.
You're what?
Why not?
But it's Yoko Okino's new movie!
And the other day you told me you wanted to see it.
I read the plot and I don't like it.
You don't like it?
No.
Yoko plays the main character, and that's fine with me...
but her playing a lawyer who has a detective boyfriend...
who is falsely accused of murder...
...and who, thanks to her, is shown
that he is not guilty of the charges against him...
"I can only love you," he says.
"A film of love and mystery that will make you really move...
and will bring tears to your eyes."
Do you really want me to go see this?
Well... I think it might be pretty good.
"You say that because it looks like
they've adapted her life to make the script."
And where did you get it from, this entry?
It's a free ticket, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Yes.
I'm sure your mother gave it to you, right?
Of course she did.
Well, yes.
It's a hint to tell me without telling me:
"Look at this detective and learn."
As if I saw it.
That is to say, that you recognize that there are still many things about this job
that you have to learn, don't you?
You're becoming more and more like your mother.
Yes, and I don't like it.
Oh, you do?
The less you look like her, the better.
She's stubborn as a mule.
Oh...
We already do enough putting up with one, from Eri.
(Mobile: beep)
Mm?
Someone just sent me an invitation to chat.
Who is it?
Ah!
It's the mother!
But... I already have her as a contact.
That's Midori, her secretary,
who wants to play a joke on you and sent it to you as if it were her.
You are right.
I'll accept it and create a group.
Oh.
"U... some men have kidnapped me.
Help me.
Call the police."
Let's see, Ran.
Show him to me.
What?
What do we do?
Ask him if he's joking or serious.
Yes.
"Are you serious?"
Eh?
He's already answered.
He says he doesn't know where he is.
Wow.
Looks like it's true.
They've been broken into.
So it's a lie.
Well, that's not funny.
Just a moment.
Take a good look.
The photo is different.
The person who asked you to accept it does not have one.
It is true.
They are two different people.
The one who uses the account with the profile picture of Eri, is not her.
So this means that the person who doesn't have the photo is the mother.
Wow.
It's getting more and more complicated.
Now she doesn't have either one.
But... which of the two profiles is the mother?
"A new day begins with a splendid sun."
"It is the hour of love and mysteries."
"We've started receiving some very strange messages on our cell phone."
"What happened to Ran's mother?"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"Eri Kisaki's distress message (part one)"
(Woman) Eri, I've already bought everything.
Some sandwiches and tomato juice.
Thank you very much, Midori.
I'm so hungry...
Since I haven't even had time to eat today...
And you'll have enough with this?
It's not enough.
Think that later you're meeting your ex to go to the movies.
-And you don't know... -What the hell are you talking about?
What nonsense!
Everyone makes his own life.
I'm going because my daughter has insisted a lot.
And that one... if in the middle of the movie my belly is snoring,
I don't even want to think how it's going to get, I already know it.
Wow.
Normally you wouldn't mind having your belly snore in front of someone.

But I see that you are very worried that it might happen to you in front of him.
But... but... Don't get me wrong.
(Door: doorbell)
But... I thought we didn't have any visitors scheduled this afternoon.
Can you go and see who it is, please?
Maybe it's someone who dropped by without an appointment.
Yes.
"If it's a new customer...,
bye-bye food."
"Although I can also eat it later in the car on the way to the movies."
(thump)
Midori, what about the customer?
You can come in now.
Do you feel me, Midori?
Midori!
A thief?
I did not expect this.
(Man) "You have called 112. What do you need?"
- "Have you had an accident?"
-Mrs. Kisaki...
I'm here on behalf of the victims' association.
Ah!
Oysters!
Coi de gato!
We're taking your mistress for a ride.
You stay here very still.
(Cat: marrameus)
What about you?
You let yourself be softened up like this...
Pe... Sorry.
(Cat:) "Hey? Hey, sit me down? Did something happen to you?"
Excuse me, it was the girl, she picked up the phone.
And... what do we do about the woman on the floor?
Nothing.
Let her be.
Anyway, she didn't see your face either.
What are you doing?
Don't tell me you're taking the lawyer's mobile...
Yes, we'll make Mouri beg for mercy.
We'll send him some images of his wife that he won't be able to ignore.
Go ahead.
You can put the suitcase up now.
Hurry up.
I'll get it ready in the meantime.
In the meantime, I'll get everything ready for the recording.
Got it.
Eh?
It's blood!
Oh, shit.
What's happened?
What are you talking about?
How could blood come out of the suitcase?
"We already have everything ready to start recording."
Maybe... he bit his tongue and cut it.
He opens the suitcase and checks what the hell happened to it.
-Eh?
-Hey.
Tell him to be very careful... when he opens it.
Sure, man, I know that.
Aaaah!
"Hey! Hey, did you hear me?"
"Hey. Did you feel me?"
"The tomato juice trick worked."
"Impossible. This door is too heavy."
"They locked it."
"This wire mesh doesn't look easy to break."
"I have to hide until they come to help me."
"But it will be difficult to find a good hiding place here."
Are you kidding me?
You've mistaken tomato juice for blood!?
I've told you, eh!
I warned you to be careful when opening the suitcase.
-I'm... sorry.
-Yeah.
And, to top it off, he took your cell phone.
It's okay, man.
It's even more fun that way.
If she ran away, we'll find her.
Hunt her down like a deer
and then have a good time tearing the skin to shreds.
"I have to find a good hiding place."
"But there's nowhere safe."
"Sure! I could do what Ran said."
Yes, exactly.
In the case of the zombies,
the suspects had hidden inside a chest of drawers.
No one expected that.
"They were smart."
"With the platform trick, they managed to hide themselves...
and not even be seen when someone opened the drawers."
"That way I'll be safe until I can escape or be rescued."
Come on, come on, come out!
You're here, aren't you?
Come on, come on.
Don't hide anymore.
Just think, the longer it takes you to come out, the worse it will be for you.
Can you feel me?
"Some drawers come out a little, but I don't think they'll find me."
"Just use the cell phone I took from that man."
"I'll call the police."
(Mobile: buzzing)
Hey, have you already called, or what?
Yes, of course I did.
I just called, but he hung up on me right away.
Oh, shit, man.
If he contacts the police, we're lost.
Take it easy, guys.
You don't need to worry about it.
He has no idea where we are.
Besides, to explain herself properly, she should call and talk for a while.
And, if she does, we'll feel her right away.
You are right.
We'd have to split up to look for her.
We'll finish sooner.
"If I can't call, all I have left is the mail."
"But I don't remember the addresses."
"I know! With text messages. I know Ran's username."
(Mobile: chat tone)
No way!
The nose lawyer is texting her daughter.
-Look.
-No... It can't be.
Oh, shit.
We're busted.

What you have to do is pretend to be her.
Start writing the chat and pretend you are her mother.
I, meanwhile, will look for her.
And I will find her.
Okay, good.
Yes.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Change the image so I don't see that you're someone else.
Yes, that's right.
(Kogoro) It's getting more and more complicated.
Now neither of us has a picture.
Well... (Kogoro) I don't know.
Which of the two profiles is the mother?
I'm getting more and more disoriented, to be honest.
So... what are we going to do now?
It's my fault, as I thought I was the Midori, I created a group.
You created a group?
If she called me, I would know who the mother is.
If she doesn't call, it's because she can't.
Why doesn't she?
Think about it.
Maybe she could have escaped from the kidnappers and gone into hiding.
And, if so, she may be writing to us from hiding.
Leave the group and talk to everyone privately.
Ask them what day their birthday is
and then we'll know who everyone is.
No.
But...
I think it's better to continue like this.
And what good does it do you, to keep talking to those who have kidnapped you?
It will do us good.
At the moment we don't know where she is.
We don't have a single clue yet.
Even she won't know where she is.
In fact, she said so earlier.
She said she didn't know where he'd been taken.
We must continue to talk to the kidnapper
in case he gets careless and gives us a clue.
Mrs. Kisaki is very smart.
She will be very careful not to write anything that might give away where she is hiding.
You haven't understood anything.
We don't even know if she's been kidnapped!
Until we know who it is we can't do anything.
What?
What do you mean?
We already know.
You already know... who is it?
Yes.
Because Mrs. Kisaki is a lawyer.
So what?
So in the legal field a comma is used that is different
than the traditional Japanese comma.
They use the comma typical of Western languages.
Shinichi told me.
They are so used to it, they use it all the time,
no matter what they write.
I hadn't noticed.
It's true!
In all the messages I have from the mother, there is the comma you say.
Look at the first message today.
It says that she has been kidnapped.
There is also this comma?
Yes, exactly, it's the same.
Well, it's not a joke.
Well, it's no joke, she's been kidnapped.
Quick, I call the police to go to Eri's office...
to check on Midori.
Ran, you keep in touch with her.
I'll keep in touch with her.
Say you don't know who your mother is, to throw her off the scent.
Yes, understood.
And use the western commas.
How can it be!?
She's not here!
She's not part of it!
Where is this woman hiding?
Calm down, man, do not t'esveris.
She'll show up.
She hasn't moved from here, I assure you.
She's like a mouse hiding in her burrow.
Yeah, right.
Hey, how are you doing?
"They haven't distinguished themselves yet?"
No, I'm still writing as if I were her.
Ah.
The technique worked.
Now she's unable to tell who's who.
Ha-ha-ha!
As we wanted.
"The Ran has started using the same one as me."
"I don't know how he has done it,
but he has managed to know which of the beads was me."
"What can you see, from where you are?
You can see the Tokyo tower
or the Tokyo City Hall building?"
(Kogoro) But why do you ask him, this?
That you have nothing, after all?
Don't you see that, in order to find out and be able to answer you,
she'll have to come out of hiding?
She can be discovered.
And we do not know if there are windows, there where it is.
Yes, in fact, the idea is not for Mrs. Kisaki to answer,
but the kidnapper.
(Mobile: chat message)
They have answered.
You can see the city hall building,
but there is no comment about Tokyo Tower.
We have a clue.
It has been made clear that they are near Tokyo Tower.
Exactly.
"It's almost 5 o'clock."
Hey, Ran, write a message...
and tell him to call us right away.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Can't you see she can't talk?
This, she already knows!
Tell her and that's it!
"Call her?"
(Mobile)
Now call!
"A phone that begins with 050... Wrong."
Mrs. Kisaki...
Hello.
Hello, mother.

I will speak, you don't need to say a word, okay?
But you have to do everything I'm going to tell you now, think it's very important.
"Near the agency there is a church
that rings the bells at 5 o'clock."
"If you can feel them, tap twice with your fingernail on the phone."
"Conan?"
All right.
They're about to ring.
(chimes)
"(Fingernail: CLEC-CLEC)"
About 3 seconds.
And what happens that it has taken 3 seconds?
The sound travels at 340 meters per second.
And today there is no wind.
That is, your mother is a kilometer from here, more or less.
In a place where you can see Tokyo Tower.
It's going.
Come on, let's go.
"In Conan, he spoke exactly like Shinichi."
"Besides, it's neither the first nor the second hit that looks like it to me."
Hey, Ran.
What are you doing?
Come on, run.
I'm coming.
"I don't have to think about it now. The priority is the mother."
Yes, exactly.
Of course it is.
Mrs. Kuriyama
has been knocked unconscious with an electrical defense.
-No, her life is not in danger.
- (Kogoro) "De a... (Kogoro) "Okay. Okay."
By the way, Mr. Mouri, where is he now?
I feel him breathing hard, as if he were running.
"I'm going to the place where they're holding Eri hostage."
"What? Do you know where she is?"
I don't.
That's why I'm running.
Don't suffer, mother.
We'll be right back.
You keep hiding.
Don't worry, we're here.
What do you mean, we're here!
That the lawyer and her daughter have both disappeared from the chat room?
- "I don't know."
-How can that be?
"Now my messages are coming up as unread."
What if she used the phone number she took from our colleague
to call the daughter, what do we do?
If they pass the phone number on to the police,
they'll find out who it's from and it won't take them long to find us.
"Don't suffer."
I've pulled the SIM on all of our phones.
We can call on the phone because we have IP numbers.
That is, no matter how much they want to, they will not find us,
because the phone is not associated with any antenna.
"Besides, I told you before...
to take the SIM out of the lawyer's phone and turn off the GPS."
-Yes...
- "You have done that, haven't you?"
"Then you don't have to worry."
"What did you answer, she, to your daughter,
when you asked her what she saw from where she was?"
"Well... she didn't say anything."
This means
that it is very likely to be in a room without a window,
hidden somewhere from where she can't see the outside.
"Look for a place with these characteristics."
Understood.
It must be in a closet or something.
We'll start looking all over the building.
-I'll let you know so we find it.
- "Perfect."

A message from Mrs. Kisaki.
Let's see...
"The crab is half done, but, thanks to him,
the two swordfish are looking good.
It's a nice night tonight;
how about dinner outside?"
Well, even if the daughter manages to find us... it won't do her any good.
We'll just peel them both off and that's it.
