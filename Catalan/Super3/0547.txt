Ah, it's you.
That loose cannon who is Kanayama's friend.
Did he ask you to make me come to this secluded place?
Shut up, you bastard!
Stop chatting and give me all the dough!
I'm paying your friend Kanayama a living wage.
Eh?
Misery and company.
Not nearly the salary he deserves.
But what you want to do to me is a robbery!
I'm going to report you to the police!
(CLEC)
What's the matter with you?
The judo black belt
who selected the Olympics is scared to death?
Eh?
Let's see if you dare to denounce me!
You've become a millionaire
with the video game "software" you developed in Kanayama.
You, who don't even know how to turn on a computer!
You have pocketed 20 billion yen,
and Kanayama pays you a pittance!
-It's so unfair! -Wait!
My company has had to invest a lot of money,
to develop these video games.
Shut up at once!
Thief!
Ah! (Car: horn)
(Car: horn)
Aaah!
"Love is magic and triumphs over mystery."
"Connect with Conan at the time of suspense!"
"The kidnapper is not very clever."
"What fate awaits me, in his hands?"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"Two days with the culprit (part one)."
Thank you very much!
You saved our lives.
It's true.
Thank you very much, Conan.
Thanks to you,
Ice Cream Paradise has given us a 20% discount!
How lucky we are!
(Thinking) "Speak for yourselves."
"I wanted to stay home to watch soccer."
The toy section is up ahead.
Hey, don't go too far.
And come back before we run out of ice cream!
Yeah, that's right.
Everything seems to indicate that this is the Oomine.
We think he's taken a girl hostage.
Save the Kayoko.
Please, officers!
We'll save her.
You can trust us.
(Takagi) The girl he's kidnapped is named Kayoko Yuuki, and she's 5 years old.
(Takagi) That's right.
We'll be careful.
We believe the suspect has a revolver.
Please, Mrs. Yuuki, come with us.
Okay. (Thinking)
(Think) "A girl has been kidnapped. And the suspect is carrying a gun."
"If the suspect wants to escape from the mall,
there's only one way."
"He has to take a car."
Eh?
Ran, the kid can take care of himself, I'm sure he won't get lost.
You're right.
Inspector Megure? Eh?
This is the mother of Kayoko, the girl who was taken hostage.
She calls herself Natsumi Yuuki.
"If I wanted to steal a car,
I'd stand where people couldn't see me."
"Behind a pillar."
"And I'd place myself a bit away from the exit."
"It's the Kayoko, the girl you've taken hostage."
-Hey! -What do you want?
I need your car!
- (knocking) - (man: call)
(man: come on!)
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!
Iaaaah... Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Stop, freeze!
Don't move!
Come on, Kayoko!
Oh!
It's over there!
The Oomine is the parking lot!
Come on, come on!
Run! Come on, brat!
It's Conan!
The police! Ah!
Easy, pretty, we'll take you to the mother.
Oomine!
Throw the gun and turn yourself in.
You can't get away!
Don't move a hair, brat!
"They say he's carrying a gun, I have to check."
"If it's true, I have to be careful."
- (wheels: squeak) - (brittle).
The Oomine wants to leave the parking lot!
Attention, block the entrance and exit!
Come on, guys, let's go!
Something's wrong.
Yes.
Aaaah!
(Think) "He's a lousy driver!"
Hold it right there!
Stop right there!
Police!
Get out! Get out of the way!
Asshole!

Please get out of the way!
It's in Conan?
The priority is to save the hostage's life!
Come on, let's go!
Father, it's me!
They've hijacked Conan!
You don't know how to drive!
I remind you that you're a hostage, brat!
Watch what you say.
Hey, hey, hey!
Watch where you're going! Hey, huh?
Ah! (Radio: woman)
(Radio: woman) "And now, the news..."
It's the alley! Oomine!
When I catch it... (radio: interference)
(Radio: male) "Inspector Megure."
Mm?
Come in, Chiba.
We've rescued the Kayoko, the girl is well... unharmed.
But we have a problem.
It's... Conan.
"The Oomine found her in the parking lot and kidnapped her!"
I know, this, no cork!
"He's on his way here now! Immediately!"
-I think she has escaped. I see it.
(Radio: woman) "Last night,
"The corpse of businessman Kazuyoshi Onda
was found in a park in Shibuya."
"The prime suspect in the crime is 25-year-old Ryosuke Oomine."
You're an idiot!
I'm 24 years old!
"He seems to have taken a hostage at the Haido Cho shopping mall
and fled by car."
"Oomine is most likely armed with a revolver. Please..."
Is it true, what they said?
You killed a man?
Yes, I did!
Does it bother you?
(Think) "Does it bother me? Of course it does. Ah... What a question."
That they have kidnapped in Conan? I'm very sorry.
I know I was supposed to watch out.
Where did he go, this car?
Say.
I recommend you stay out of it this time.
Inspector Megure!
She's been kidnapped by a petty criminal
who's committed some crimes in the Shinjuku area.
"We've arrested him twice for assaults and robberies."
"The victim, Mr. Onda,
"was the president of a video game 'software' company
with an annual revenue of billions of yen."
"We suspect he had financial problems,
"Because he paid his employees a pittance,
and he didn't pay his suppliers."
"The Oomine is a friend of an employee of the company, in Kanayama,
"who explained to him that his boss acted like a dictator
and exploited employees."
"It seems that the Oomine got very angry
and decided to mug Mr. Onda to teach him a lesson."
"(Shot)"
"But things got complicated and he shot him."
"A security camera in the park recorded the whole thing."
The Oomine most likely still has the murder weapon.
Let us take care of it.
We've already made a security cordon.
Where are you, Conan?
You and I will stay here for a while.
Let me go.
You don't need me now!
If I let you go, you'll go to the police and explain everything.
No, I won't! I'm sure you'll tell them everything!
Why are you saying this?
That I look like a snitch?
Yes. Ah.
"First I have to check if he's carrying a gun."
"And then I'll have to decide...
whether to stun him, or try to get away."
The car, he's left it here. Yes, sir.
Maybe they're hiding in this area,
or maybe they've fled to another neighborhood.
They searched the area thoroughly! Yes, sir!
They've kidnapped Conan, and you're reading old newspapers?
Eh?
It's just that... a couple of months ago, I remember reading...
a very interesting article about Mr. Onda's company.
Look at that.
Eh?
Tell me what you're looking for.
I'm looking for an employee of Mr. Onda.
He's a man who calls himself Kanayama and is a friend of the Oomine.
Oh.
Oh!
It's very useful, this thing.
Last month a technician came and set up the wifi for us.
The wifi?
What does that have to do with the case?
Kanayama has developed all this "software"?
This guy is a genius of video games.
Stop.
Mm?
Conan..., nothing will happen to him, right?
Of course it won't.
Oh, shit.
There's no cover.
"Come on, I have to do it."
I'm scared! What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?
What's the matter with you? There's a mouse!
There's no mouse here.
Let go of me, you little brat!
"He's not carrying a gun."
Come on, stop it!
Leave me alone!
If he's not armed...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaah!
Aaaaah!
(Footsteps: approaching)
(I think-I think)
Aaaaah!
Come on.
Oh!
Ah!
Yes.
I think this is it.
How come you have a key ring with so many keys on it?
Now is not the time to ask questions!
"What was that?"
In you go!

Perfect.
From here we can go out into the street.
"This means..."
Do you know the person who shot at us?
Of course I don't.
Then who was it?
And how did he know we were in this place?
And another thing: why did he shoot at us?
How should I know, me?
I'll help you.
I'll help you.
Whoever this person was, I don't think he's looking for us anymore.
"Yes, but he gave up too quickly."
"And that noise, like an explosion, what was it?"
(Steps)
Why didn't you call?
These two are cops, right?
If someone kidnaps you and you see two policemen,
the logical thing to do is to call and ask them for help.
Potser.
That's what everyone would do.
But you got hurt because you wanted to protect me.
You could have escaped on your own.
Yes, that's true.
I was also the most logical.
Suppose.
Oomine, say, are you really a murderer?
Yes, he shot him!
I killed him!
Well, I don't think you're that kind of person.
Can I have the cell phone? Why do you want it?
Please! (ringtone)
(ringtone)
Hello, doctor.
You're Seiichi Kanayama, aren't you?
The famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
It's taken longer than I thought.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Did you go shopping?
Yes.
I just came from the supermarket.
Hey, what do you say instead of standing here..,
we both go up to my place?
I'm sure you want to ask me a lot of questions.
I'm sure you do.
That's right, you got it exactly right.
The child the Oomine kidnapped, I understand she lives with you.
The police haven't found her yet.
I imagine that the famous detective Kogoro Mouri wants to find the guilty party
without the help of law enforcement.
And he has thought that, sooner or later, he will come to my house.
Under the circumstances, it would be the most natural thing to do.
Apparently, he is a close friend of the Oomine.
When I went to high school in Morioka, we were classmates.
And when I moved to Tokyo, we continued to see each other.
The Oomine wanted to hold up Mr. Onda,
but things got complicated and he shot him.
Yes, and I confess that I feel guilty,
because I had spoken very badly about Mr. Onda.
"I told him that he made a lot of money,
but he paid ridiculous salaries."
"He was a judo champion,
and he could become a tyrannical and very violent head."
My head was miserable.
It made many millions thanks to me.
That "software" was developed by me,
but it paid me a pittance!
(Kogoro) Excuse me.
(Kanayama) I didn't pick up the phone.
The Oomine has called me many times.
When he calls you back, please answer.
- (computer chat: ringtone) -Oh!
"I can't believe the police haven't come to see you yet."
Come on, don't talk nonsense.
The Oomine got rid of Mr. Onda
because you told him to, didn't you, Momoko?
"I'm just the secretary, I have no motive."
Yes, but flirting with him, and you were getting as much money out of him as you could.
"Are you still mad at me because I broke up with you?"
No, I don't care about that.
What are you doing wasting your time in a chat room?
Don't you have a job?
"Hey, what's it to you?"
I think I should be suspicious of Momoko too.
She was Mr. Onda's secretary, wasn't she?
-Is there anyone else at the company? -Actually, yes.
The vice president, Mr. Kanda.
He had a good reason, because the president was mobbing him.
Mobbing?
That means mobbing, right?
If I were you, I would have left the company a long time ago.
Well, if there was an accomplice,
I'd say they're the most logical candidates.
But there's still another suspect.
Can't guess who it is?
It's you, Kanayama.
Hey, watch where you're going.
Ah! (Chiba)
(Chiba) Didn't you hear a noise?
-Go, you go that way! -(Chiba) Yes.
"I don't want to stop him, not yet."
Run, hide!
Hurry up!
(Car: horn)
(Car: horn) Oh!
Ah! (Horn honks)
Hello, Dr. Agasa!
What a surprise!
Doctor Agasa, what are you doing here?
Has something happened?
Well, yes, it turns out that... I have a job, and it's very urgent.
I'm sorry, it's just that right now I'm in a hurry and... and I have to go.

Goodbye, I'll see you another day with more calm.
You can uncover yourself now.
Thank you very much, doctor.
You saved my life.
"Maybe. But if you stop him now, the case will never be solved."
"I have a feeling that in this mystery nothing is what it seems."

The famous detective Kogoro Mouri
has captured the terrible murderer Ryosuke Oomine!
It's in someone's interest for everyone to think that the murderer is the Oomine.
(Think) "It's stained with blood..."
Everybody freeze!
Or I'll blow his head off!
