Today we're all going stargazing together.
We're going to look for a comet but we find a skeleton.

Eh?
Anthrophobic remark?
No man, no, no, no, Genta!
Astronomical observation, astronomical observation!
Hello, doctor?
Now we're going to see the stars?
Yes, I found a nice guesthouse in the mountains of Gunma.
It's so cold, why should we go out to see the stars?
It's a good time because it's cold.
The colder it is, the cleaner the air is and the better you can see the stars.
Plus, tonight we have a new moon!
It's a perfect night for stargazing.
Hmm?
But won't we get bored if we just look at the stars?
Come on, don't say that!
You can study the stars
and we might have a chance to discover new ones!
If we do, we could name one of us!
What?
Our name!
-Can we name it after us?
-A... a star?
(Ouch) Yes, that's right!
It's impossible to do that when we're talking about asteroids
in which the orbit must be observed repeatedly
in order to verify.
There are possibilities if the star is a comet that only has to be found.
What if we call it Beika's Junior Detective League comet?
-Hey, Conan.
Doesn't that sound good?
-It sounds great.
No.
The only comets you can name after yourself are asteroids.
Comets are named after their discoverers.
The first three people who discovered it will name the star.
Exactly.
If a comet is discovered at the same time
in different parts of the world
it is possible that they mix their surname with other foreigners.
Three people... Me and then... and then... then...
For example: Comet Kobayashi-Burger-Millon.
So, if we find a comet and say it very soon,
we could say Comet Yoshida-Tsuburaya-Haibara, right?
Right?
-I guess...
-So much so.
Yoshida-Tsuburaya-Haibara?
Ep, I'm not on this list!
Put the Conan one too.
Ah, but you can only put three.
Eh... Conan, aren't you...?!
Conan, what are you doing?
Come on, say?
(Mitsuhiko) Oh!
This man is Masaharu Motoyama,
the sports specialist who murdered the Nose player
player not long ago in Okinawa, right?
You were there when it all happened, weren't you?
Yes.
There was something that had me worried, but...
What was bothering you?
Well, it's not important at all.
I just wanted to know who I should call on the phone
while we were in interrogation.
The police were already supposed to be in contact with the family
and parents of the late Mr. Nose, so...
I think it would be some friend in Motoyama.
Casum la olla!
I should have asked who made the call.
Maybe... en Kobayashi, the baseball player.
The player who made the team
at the same time as Mr. Motoyama.
It seems that the three of them were doing the travel program together
when the season was over and that they got along quite well.
It is also possible that he informed him of the death of his best friend.
Things went very well for his parents' pension after he retired 4 years ago.
after retiring 4 years ago.
If I remember correctly,
it was a place called Kurayoshi which is Tottori.
One day they introduced it on TV and it seemed nice.
Now I understand.
"It seems that it has nothing to do, with the men in black...."
"Kurayoshi... Kudo..."
"Don't tell me that you..."
"The code of stars and tobacco. Part 1."
(Man) You're Mr. Agasa, aren't you?
We've been waiting for you.

Please sign the customer register...
Ah, understood.
Hiroshi Agasa...
-Huh?
-Hey, where did you go? -Hey, where did you go?
You told him to come here too, didn't you?
Please tell me.
I want to apologize... Where is the Asao?
The Asao... who is it?
Don't do comedy!
It's a man who wears a ring like this!
The Asao Kono!
You've received an invitation from him, haven't you?
Nonomiya, please...
An invitation?
No, excuse me, this is the first day I've come here.
Ah, excuse me.
I'm really sorry.
(Hiccup)
-I'm sorry for what happened.
(Hiccup) - You scared me...
Who is this woman?
Her name is Etsuko Nonomiya.
She went to the same university as me.
In Kono, the man she said, was a student at the same university.
The two of them are engaged...
They used to come here very often to stay here,
but... after they had a loud argument last year,
in this very boarding house, he disappeared without a trace.
It seems that she received an invitation from him
telling her to come here.
She has been waiting for him for the last three days,
but he hasn't shown up and starts drinking alcohol in the early morning.
But what made him think that I, a person he had never seen before, would come here?
a person he had never seen before, had received an invitation from him?
That's normal.
Because we also received one from this Kono guy,
although we are not his acquaintances.
Well, we saw him here that day almost a year ago.
And, because of what the invitation said, we decided to come immediately.
Please!
May I see the invitation?
Yes... You have...
Thank you very much!
"As a result of a year of observation,
I have made a discovery that will govern the foundations of astronomy.
I would like your opinion;
"Therefore, please come to the Amatsuchi Guesthouse.
Naturally, the rooms are at my expense.
I will understand if you cannot come if you have other engagements,
but please make the effort to introduce yourself.
Asao Kono."
Well, if we take into account that it has been two days already
and he hasn't shown up, we might think it's a practical joke.
Hey, editor, what do you say we go back?
Ha..., editor?
Yes.
We do a very interesting astronomical magazine
called "Sunday in Space"
and Mr. Mikami here is the editor!
Oh!
-Come on, relax...
-He's not an ordinary editor!
It's all right, man.
Listen... Mmm, what do you mean he's not an ordinary publisher?
Well, he just happens to be a great man who discovered a new comet
and was able to name it after himself!
-He discovered one?
-(Genta) Tell us what?
- (Genta) Tell us about us!
- (Mitsuhiko) Where did he find it?
Well, it's not easy to explain where it is...
Is it there?
Is it here?
Au...
I suggest you follow the path behind the guesthouse
that up the hill!
It is a point with a very large panorama
and an optimal place to observe the stars.
If you want, I can also lend you a telescope.
For 5,000 yen.
Oh, so you'll charge us?
- (children) Okay!
-Goodbye!
(children) Be careful!
(Genta) Very well!
I'm sure we'll find a star!
(All) Yes!
Apprentice queue.
Don't think you're so easy to find!
Oi, editor?
Yes...
(Nonomiya) No... you don't know...
No matter how much knowledge you have,
finding a star only depends on luck.
If you are lucky, you can find one.
Oi, Mr. Editor?
I could find my star
with the luck you had to find your?
That star-obsessed boy..,
who disappeared into the darkness of space...
my dear partner...
(Agasa) Oi... Ah... (Agasa)
Gee, it's far away.
-Let's go, eagerness!
-Come on, doctor!
Make an effort!
Oh... Ah...
Ah!
Is that the hill?
Look!
This is not a hill, it's more like a ravine...
And we have to climb up there?
We take a little break.
We have to go up before the sun sets!
Have more respect for older people.
"If you always tell us that we don't treat you like an old person."
-Yes!
-Do you think we should rest for 10 minutes?
What are we going to do, eh?

(Think) "A stone, a stone..."
Don't you find that invitation a little strange?
Yes, why someone should write
Eh?
"I'll understand if you can't come if you have another engagement"?
That's right...
I would have some urgent business and that's why I wanted to gather you all here.
Ah!
I found one!
Ahhhhh!
A skull!
Ayumi, what happened?!
A skull... Don't smoke!
What's it doing, a skull, here?
(Ai) There are more bones scattered here...
(Ay) What?
(Ay) The lower jaw... a humerus... the femur...
"Where's the body? Is it there?"
This is frightening!
Surely it fell down this ravine!
Yes, probably...
They look like the bones of a person who has fallen a long time ago.
The bones, they must have been scattered by animals, rain and wind...
No... This is a case of murder and extremely heinous, moreover...
What?
Look, it's lime.
Lime has the quality of producing heat
after having absorbed some liquid.
When you put lime around a body and in its vicinity,
what you produce is heat after it has been wetted by rain.
Thanks to this, the process of putrefaction of the body is accelerated.
The body becomes a skeleton in a short period of time.
It could be that this person is Mr. Kono you say, right?
It could not be.
But he has sent everyone an invitation, hasn't he?
Yes, it could be that Mr. Kono.
What is it?
There's a ring and a pack of tobacco under the stone...
And engraved on the ring are the words, from the Etsuko to the Asao.
It's likely that Mr. Kono left it here
after the murderer threw him off the cliff and came down here.
This is the proof that he was murdered.
But the killer could have left him here expressly.
If he had,
he would have left it on his finger after leaving him naked.
If a murderer aims to keep the identity of the victim hidden,
why would he hide something like this?!
Yes.
Can someone lend me a tissue?
Thank you.
You got it.
And what does this pack of cigarettes mean?
If my deduction is correct, this is probably...
I thought so.
All that's left are cigarettes?
Huh?
Don't tell me about it!
This is...
Yes... this is the message that Mr. Kono... left!
(At the same time) It's... a message?
(Mitsuhiko) These cigarettes?
Yes, all indications are that that man, Asao Kono,
left clues about his killer before he killed him.
Let's see, but only two of the six cigarettes are in the middle, right?
Eh?
Look carefully, Genta!
The two short cigarettes have the filter, right?
He folded them to make them shorter and put them inside the pack.
Up close, you'll see that under the rock where he had hidden the tobacco is rotten,
but the rest of the cigarettes were removed
and then arranged in a particular way, right? Í
In other words, Mr. Kono, who left this,
wanted us to look only at the four long cigarettes
and the two short cigarettes.
Oh!
We should tell the people at the boarding house what happened.
Wait!
We better not explain this to the boarding house!
Call the police.
- (Ai) You don't understand?
-(Ai) What?
(Ai) Why?
The customers of the pension are all people who have come here
because they received those invitations from Mr. Kono!
If those bones are really those of Mr. Kono,
it's obvious that someone else sent them, right?
A year ago, Mr. Kono disappeared from the guesthouse
and the people we have gathered here now
are the same as they were then.
If the reason why those bones are scattered around is not the rain, wind or
is not the rain, the wind or the animals...
it means that someone chopped him up.
Yes... The person who sent the invitations
is surely wishing that someone would find Mr. Kono's bones
and so he must be planning some not very exemplary action, right?
What is it, that bad thing he's planning?
I don't know.
Anyway call the police!
Afan sy have them come here.
Doctor, what's wrong?

No, nothing, it's just that this area is out of coverage
and I can't make the call...
Then... we'll have no choice but to go back to the guesthouse
and call the police on the sly.
The police?
What happened?
Mr. Amatsuchi?!
What are you doing here?
I remembered that I had forgotten to put the weight of the telescope
inside the bag...
"Fumuda..."
-No, nothing...
-By the way, what's the problem?
Have you seen anything strange?
Bones?
Ah!
But...
"Oh, no..."
(Nonomiya) What?
You found the bones of the Asao in the forest?!
All you found were the bones, right?
Who knows if they are the Asao's...
Well, we found this next to the bones.
The ring that you gave him to match his initials!
But... it could be that the Asao Kono had murdered someone
and put the ring there on purpose!
But the ring has been found...
Say... Did Mr. Kono have a cavity?
In the upper denture on the right, the second starting molar...
The upper molar?
Ha-ha!
Then those bones are not from the Asao!
Ha-ha!
Yes, he had a cavity, but he had it in the front,
in the lower jaw...
-Yes, it was him.
-No!
No doubt about it...
Eh, what do you mean?
Answer me!
I'm sorry to tell you that the dental treatment
had been done on the incisor of the lower jaw dentition.
That is, it is located exactly in the place you specified.
The cavity was, but in front, in the lower jaw.
He has expressly lied
so that you would not agree with him or feel conditioned.
Forgive me...
It can't be.
This means... This means that the Asao...
(Cries)
Anyway, we must hurry to call the police...
The phone doesn't seem to be working.
Hey, this phone is only connected to the power,
but it doesn't have the line cord...
What?!
Ah!
Strange, if I have used this phone just a moment ago....
Does it have any other phone or any other line cord?
This is the only phone and I did not buy any spare cable.
Then we won't be able to call the police.
You must be kidding!
I'm going home with the car!
But, editor!
Just a moment...
Yes, just a moment.
I don't think I can do it either.
What?
I went outside for a moment and checked.
All the cars have flat tires.
Someone must have let go of the air valves
and deflated the tires.
This way, no one would be able to use the cars
and they could keep us locked in here.
But that-that's ridiculous...
Hey, don't tell me this has something to do with that... Kono?
-Sure!
-Of course it does!
XST!
Because it was a Homi...
When I found the bones you guys were looking at them, right?
I'm talking about the four long cigarettes and the two short cigarettes
that were in the handkerchief, right?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
But this is a message from the victim?
No... we can't be sure.
That's not it!
That's not a posthumous message.
I'm sure the Asao is just playing dead to make me suffer.
He wouldn't die.
Don't you think so?
Ha-ha!
Oh, it's so nice...
Today we should stay in our rooms and not go out.
We'd better wait until it's daylight, right?
Yes...
Mmm...
We have a total of six cigarettes.
Four long ones and two short ones!
If it was Futagawa, there'd be one more match than the count.
and if it were Amatsuchi, there would be another one.
The Nonomiya and Mr. Mikami,
their ideograms cannot be shown with 6 matches.
And if it were written in katakana syllabary?
It is impossible.
It would take 14 matches for Futagawa, 12, for Amatsuchi,
8 for Nonomiya and 9 for Mr. Mikami, right?
What if they were the initials?
For example, for Ai Haibara it would be the hache and the a.
Only 6 matches are needed.
Mmm!
Lla... so, you're saying you're the murderer?
You heard it, it was just an example.
An example!
For the tea and the eme of Tsuburaya Mitsuhiko
and for Yoshida Ayumi's Greek y and a, you need 6 matches.
Yes!
Of course... and for Genta Kojima...
How romantic, only the three of us need 6 matches.

And the a and the hache of Agasa Hiroshi, can also be formed with 6 matches!
Eh...
Ah yes, what a coincidence...
That's nice.
Maybe you're right about the initials!
(Mitsuhiko) What?
The murderer is Mr. Futagawa?
Yes.
If these cigarettes refer to the initials.
Mr. Amatsuchi Ryoji's are a-yerra.
Miss Nonomiya Etsuko's are ene-e.
Mikami Heihachi's are ema-hache.
Only Futagawa Hajime's are efe-hache,
can be formed with 6 matches.
I don't know if it would be a good idea to meet Mr. Futagawa.
Don't worry, I'm going to ask him a trick question.
(It stings)
Hey!
It looks like Mr. Futagawa is not here.
The cigarette filter is still wet.
He hasn't been out of the room for long.
Ah!
Someone is walking outside!
(Mitsuhiko) Ah... That's Miss Nonomiya!
(Mitsuhiko) Oh no!
And not only Mr. Futagawa,
I don't see Mr. Mikami or Mr. Amatsuchi around either!
Coi!
I told them not to go outside!
At Mitsuhiko, Ayumi and I will take the Nonomiya back!
Doctor, Ai and Genta, go get the other three!!!
-Oh!
-Yes!
Yes!
Miss Nonomiya!
(Miss Nonomiya!!!
That's the road that leads to the place where we found the skeleton, isn't it?
She's gone there to check if the bones are Mr. Kono's....
- (branches: creak)
-No...
What was that noise...?
Mr. Futagawa?
What was it?
Wrong.
His neck is broken...
He's not breathing anymore.
A pack of cigarettes?
He's holding something in his hand...
Same message as before, right, Conan?
No, this time... there's one too many...
Please, I beg you not to stir things up too much.
Oh!
Did you bring a telescope?
How long do you plan to be here searching?
The only thing that could serve as a weapon is that umbrella...
Now it's your turn, Mr. Amatsuchi.
Come on, come on, hurry up.
He kept looking at the list of customers!
Yes, very carefully, too!
"You're wrong."
And the next Conan: "The code of stars and tobacco. Part 2."
