(Traffic murmur)
-Hey?
Good morning to all!
-Hello, Mr. Mouri.
Good morning, Mr. Mouri.
-Ah!
Good morning, Mr. Mouri.
I'm sorry, but we're not open yet.
I know, but there's such a good smell in here!
It's the breakfast special of the day:
stewed meatballs with cabbage, milk and tomato sauce.
My God, my mouth is already watering!
Come on, give me a plate.
I-I'm so sorry...
Well...
You go ahead.
I'll make breakfast for the day, too.
And you, Ran, what can I get you?
Well... another one.
What about you?
Understood.
Guaita!
I never noticed before, in this fridge.
I have.
They've had it here for almost a month.
In fact, we bought it to store the cakes.
Ah, you mean the special cake!
Yes, it's a delight.
Have you tried it, the special cake?
This cream cake is Toru's specialty.
Do you use a kettle to heat the water?
Yes.
It's just that our kettle is very old.
It takes a long time for hot water to come out, first thing in the morning.
I start the kettle from my cell phone when I leave the house,
and by this time we have hot water.
So it's got the technology of the internet of things, right?
"The internet of things"?
It's appliances that can be programmed via the internet,
like this electric kettle.
-Aviam?
- (Azusa and Ran) Aaah....
(Azusa and Ran) -Ah!
-We'll be right back!
(Azusa and Ran) Eh?
What's wrong?
What happened?
(Toru) Eh?
(Toru) You don't need to shout, woman.
I just... I don't understand.
Why did it happen to us again?
When you made them last night, they were perfect.
(Both) Yes...
Has it happened to you before?
Mm...
(Shinichi voice) "A new day begins with a splendid sun."
"It's the time for love and mysteries."
"Toru Amuro's special cake is in trouble tomorrow."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The cakes are falling apart!"
Ah, that's good!
Mm!
Yummy!
Mm?
This one's for you, Father.
No, I told you I didn't want it, me.
A cake, now?
I don't feel like anything, at this time of the morning...
Mm, that's good!
Mm!
The egg flavor is very noticeable.
Yes, it has more eggs than the other cakes.
I find it as good as ever.
The flavor is the same.
Maybe it is, the problem is that, with this aspect,
we can't serve it to the customers.
I don't understand.
How did it fall apart?
Maybe you skipped a step in the recipe.
Father, please!
If it's happened to you twice, it can happen again.
Do me a favor!
Yes, the truth is that I'm starting to think about it too...
-Ya...
-I can't find any other explanation.
The thing is, we should find a way to solve it.
(Mitsuhiko) Yes, we're at fault doctor.
Come on, come at once, Conan, we're waiting for you!
We are impatient to make fly the drone
that Dr. Agasa has designed and built.
It can fly very high!
Come on, doctor, we can't wait!
Ah!
- (drone: zzzz)
- (all) Aaaah...!
- (all) Aaaah...!
- (drone: zzzz)
(drone: zzzz) Eh?
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?
- (both) Ayumi!
-Ah...!
(drone: zzzz) -Huh?
- (dron: zzzz)
(drone: zzzz) Oh!
What happened?
What's wrong with him, in this thing?
"How strong!"
Hey, what happened, Mitsuhiko?
It was the drone, it started flying by itself!
Without anyone touching the remote control!

What do you say now?
It has taken off by itself without anyone directing it?
(Agasa) "What has happened here? My goodness!"
Oh, guys!
I said not to try to fly it until I got there!
It wasn't us!
We didn't even touch it, it took off by itself!
Oh, it was brand new...!
I think it's going to take a while to fix it.
-What?!
But you'll finish it today?
-What?! -What?!
Don't get your hopes up.
We won't be able to fly it today.
(All three) Oops!
(Mitsuhiko) "We had to cancel the flight, Conan."
In the street, in front of Caf√© Poirot.
"And where are you now?"
Eh?
(Ayumi) "Ah!"
Lately at the Poirot they're making a great new cake!
(Ayumi) "We just tried it."
What a face!
You ate it without us?
Wait, we've come to try the new cake!
Hey, wait!
The cake is...
(All three) "SIII!"
(Mobile: end of call)
(All three) "SIII!" (Mobile: end of call) Eh?
Are you coming to breakfast with us too, Haibara?
No, don't count.
I have to stay to help the doctor.
(All 3) What a drag!
Have they run out of cake?
Man, Conan, you could have told me when we talked!
I tried to warn you, but you didn't listen to me.
Well, that's too bad, because I really wanted to...
I'm sorry about that.
Right now there is a technician trying to fix the refrigerator.
I hope we can have it back tomorrow.
Guys, I've checked the fridge from top to bottom and it works perfectly.
What do you mean?
If the fridge is working fine, how come our cakes are falling apart?
-Mm...
-I don't know.
Of course you don't!
I think I know!
Ayumi!
Can you tell what a in head doors?
Look closely at these cakes here.
What to say, huh?
They look a lot like Toru's cake.
What does this mean?
That they have copied the cake from en Toru?
Ayumi is right, it's very suspicious.
Don't shout so much, Genta!
Hey, guys..,
how much money do you have on you?
-We won't have enough with it.
-That's all.
Come on, Conan, pay up.
We know you always have a full wallet, don't pretend.
What a reputation I have!
Mm... it's similar to mine because, when you put a lot of eggs,
the cake usually has this color.
Also, if it has many layers of cream like you do, it is normal that they are so similar,
it is normal that they are so similar.
So, you don't think they copied it?
I would say no, but... we will try it.
(Ayumi, Genta and Mitsuhiko) We're done!
The taste of this one was very different.
Yes, the cake you make at Toru is a thousand times better.
What do you mean?
Well, we've solved the mystery.
The manager of that bakery sneaks in every night
and spoils the cakes so he can sell more.
Ah, maybe his default customers buy...
because they know that the ones here are better.
(Shinichi, thinks) "How do I tell them that they are half wrong?"
All right, well, we know what we have to do now.
Tonight we'll stand guard at the Poirot.
(Conan voice) Ah, yes?
What to do?
Who do you want to do it?
We do!
Who will do it?
Oh..., ah.
Ha-ha!
The Junior Detectives!
- (both) Huh?
-No thoughts.
-Don't suffer for it, we can do it. -You're still too young.
-You're still too young.
Listen to me...
If we stand idly by,
we won't be able to taste Toru's cake again.
It would be a disaster!
We must find the culprit!
Okay, you guys...!
Azusa, could we put a camera on the premises, tonight?
What? A surveillance camera?
A surveillance camera?
No need to go out of your way for us, Conan.
It's true.
You don't need to, we'll get wise.
-Don't worry.
-Yes, but...
I assure you that very soon
you will be able to eat again this cake that you like so much.
Have you come up with a magic solution?
(All three) Really?
Yes..., I think I have a good idea.
Ah...
(Toru) Eh?
You've been filming the place from the street?
Yes, since I'm closing last night until now.
I'm curious as to why the cakes are falling apart
if the fridge isn't broken.
And, as always, you need to investigate anything that intrigues you, right?
Also....,
the kids really like your cake,
and yesterday they went home a little catty.
Ah...

You are capable of going to any lengths necessary for those you really care about.
Eh?
And what is the result of the night surveillance?
Ah, well... I didn't find anything strange in these images.
Wow, he's in one piece today!
He has, he eats.
Yes, tonight he hasn't been undone at all.
I thought you found him undone every morning.
It doesn't always happen, I'd say that...
the cakes fall apart two days out of three, or less.
Yes, but that's not always the case.
Two out of three days?
You're sure?
Yeah...
Mm?
I've left a camera
recording the Poirot's door for three nights in a row.
Look!
The interior of the premises is not visible for a few seconds.
Well...
How is it?
With these images it's hard to say.
What we know for sure is that only two of the three days have passed.
On the night of the 21st, the interior of the premises...
disappears for 11 seconds at one o'clock.
And on the night of the 23rd, early this morning, it disappeared for 12 seconds at 02:26.
(Azusa) The night of the 21st and the early morning?
Those are the days that the cakes have been unmade!
That's right!
Therefore, it is very likely that something will happen...
during the seconds that we stop seeing the inside of the cafeteria.
Sure, I've got it!
Surely the culprit, whoever it is, comes in and undoes the cakes!
No way, the door's been locked all night.
And you didn't think it was forced?
Well, no, I'm sure.
Then this is an impossible crime.
Unless the culprit is someone who has the key to the cafeteria.
Ah...
Well, well, well, well.
I think he suspects me.
(Genta) -Huh?
- (Genta) Look.
Every time the inside of the cafeteria disappears,
a car passes by on the street.
Yes .. And what relationship do you think there is?
Coincidentally, it passes in front of the premises
every time we stop seeing the inside.
- (Azusa) You're right!
-Do you see it?
Such is the culprit's car.
Yes, it could be.
What do you say, Conan?
Yes, but...
the night the cakes didn't fall apart there were also cars passing by.
It's a bit of a hasty conclusion, don't you think?
Every time they have been undone, a car has passed by.
I'm convinced there's some connection.
Yes...
The truth is that we don't have any other pretty clear clue, so...
I'll ask the doctor to see if he can enlarge the image a bit.
What doctor?
The one who invents all sorts of nifty gadgets... and gives them to you?
Mm?
Huh?
Yes.
Mm.
Ah, right.
I'd say this car is a cab.
Also..., it's the same on both days.
(Shinichi voice) Does the same cab pass by the street right at the time...
that the interior disappears?
I had never noticed this refrigerator before.
In fact, we bought it to store cakes.
Why did it happen to us again?
When you made them last night they were perfect.
I checked the fridge from top to bottom and it works perfectly.
It was the drone, which started flying by itself!
Without anyone touching the remote control!
Such is the culprit's car.
(Shinichi voice) Now I understand what happened.
I have discovered the culprit.
(Both) What?
(Radio: male) "Unit 227, proceed to Beika station."
"Unit 227, Miss Mouri is waiting for you at Beika station."
-Yes.
Unit 227.
- "Can you go?"
I'm going to Beika station to pick up Miss Mouri.
Understood.
Excuse me.
What is it?
It's the Azusa.
(Mobile)
Mm.
So, that's it!
- (mobile)
- (man) Miss.
I'm sorry, but I'm already engaged to another.
Yes, this is Miss Mouri, I called you.
(man) What?
Is that you?
Yes..., it's us who ordered a cab.
(Shinichi, think) "But what undoes the Poirot's cakes is..."
(Electrical device: sound like interference)
The Ayumi was right.
The cakes would fall apart
at the moment that the interior of the premises was not visible.
I knew it!
But why couldn't we see inside?
Because the windows were fogged up.
Do you want to know why?
Oh yes?
And so they were fogged up?
(All three) What?!
That's why.
The kettle gives off steam when it heats the water.
Yes, but... I don't know if it produces enough steam to steam up the windows.
Yes, and besides, it has a technology called "internet of things".

Do you have it programmed so that you can start it through your cell phone?
Mm?
Of course I do!
Azusa would turn on the kettle every night from home, via her cell phone.
That way he could undo the cakes without having to go into the cafeteria.
W-wait a minute!
I would never do that, that!
Huh?
It wasn't the Azusa, guys.
What?
Then who was it, the culprit?
The culprit we're looking for... it's reflected in the window.
-What?!
It's the car, then?
-What?!
Yes.
You said it was a cab, right?
Last night we were talking to the cab driver.
"Every night, after 12 o'clock,
he stretches out for a nap near the Poirot."
"When he's called to pick up a customer...,
he makes the same route and passes in front of the Poirot."
"Then, the windows, fogged by the mist coming out of the kettle...
"They act as a mirror and reflect the cab
passing in front of the cafeteria."
I checked the date and time of the last calls,
and it coincided with the times and days when the windows were fogging up
and the cakes fell apart.
And who's to blame for all this?
The cab driver?
Not the cab driver, but....
The culprit was the cab's radio.
Yes...
Isn't it?
The radio waves activated the electrical circuit of the kettle.
Coincidentally, it turns out that the cab radio...
is broadcasting on the same frequency that makes the kettle turn on.
What?
Is it normal for these things to happen?
It's "radio frequency interference",
and it's a fairly common phenomenon.
(Both) Aaah...
That's what happened with that drone that took off by itself.
(All) Oh, yeah?
You were using the pin transmitter to talk to me, weren't you?
Yes, that's right!
So, the pin transmitter made interference with the drone?
Yes.
These pins have a fairly wide emission range.
This means that the waves they emit must be quite powerful.
We should tell the doctor to change the frequency of the drone.
So, the radio frequency interference...
is what was causing the cakes to fall apart.
-But how?
I don't get it!
-Aaah...
The kettle's always on here, isn't it?
Yes, but... Ah!
Yes..., and, as all kettles do...,
"...it blows steam as it heats the water."
"The fan at the back of the cooler sucks the hot steam...
sucks in the hot steam...,
"And for about 10 seconds,
while the windows are fogged,
it turns the inside of the fridge into a kind of sauna."
"The cakes fall apart and keep this shape as they cool."
Who knew!
I won't be able to use it anymore, then.
Woman, just take it out of the side of the fridge.
Yes, you're right!
I'll give it a try.
Then, we can go back to eating Toru's cake, can't we?
Oh, of course, of course!
But I've decided that, from now on, I'll make it a little differently.
It's called "soft cake", and it's half-done from scratch.
"Over-watered cake"?
Gee, I'd say more like "withered cake"....
The way it looks, I looked it up specifically.
The sponge cake is cooked, but I left the egg half raw inside, like this.
Can you see it?
-Brutal!
-Oooh!
It looks great!
Eh?
Was this the idea you said you came up with?
Yes.
This cake is not like the one before, with layers of cream in between.
So I can keep the sponge cake and the cream separately.
Of course, that way you don't have to worry about it falling apart.
No, just put the fruit and the cream on top....
just before serving.
I'm sure we'll never have any problems with this cake.
No.
And besides, it's completely different from the ones in the bakery.
You weren't trying to figure out why your cake was falling apart,
you were looking for a recipe for one that wouldn't fall apart.
Exactly.
After all, that's what my job is all about.
(Shinichi, thinking) "Yes, but other than that....,
he has another job as a public security officer..."
- (Kogoro) Hey!
- (door, about: bell)
Oh!
Wow, I see something that makes a very good face....
Ha!
(Kogoro) Come on!
Who's up for a taste of my new specialty?
(All) Viscaaa!

My goodness, that's good!
The Poirot's cakes are a delight!
I thought you said you didn't like them,
the cakes, in the wee hours of the morning...
-Oh, so much!
-Your new cake is really good, Toru!
I even like it better than what you made before.
It has an irresistible creamy texture!
Maybe it's because...
the egg flavor is even more noticeable than in the previous cake.
Yes, it has the same amount of eggs,
but since they are not fully cooked, they have a much more intense flavor.
Also, I think the cream is not overly sweet.
This is because both the cream and the cake are made with yogurt.
are made with yogurt.
Ah!
So, it actually tastes like yogurt cream.
Yes, if you use yogurt, the cake is much fluffier.
And the acidity of the yogurt makes a delicious contrast with the sweetness of the fruit.
You can eat the cake on its own or just the cream with fruit.
It's so much fun to be able to choose
a different combination in each spoonful.
I'm so glad you liked it so much.
Ah...!
I forgot!
I just remembered why I came all this way.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Ah, it's about the summit next month.
Yes, it's a map of the traffic closures on the day of the summit.
By the way, Azusa, I told the manager...
that on the day of the summit I plan to take the whole day off.
Yes, I know.
The manager already told me.
(Shinichi, thinks) "This will mean
that the Amuro will participate in the security of the summit."
Mm?
(Conan voice) Hey, Amuro.
I see you don't forget that you're a Public Security officer.
And you've got as good a nose as ever, little detective.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Then I couldn't even imagine that Amuro,
"Who enjoyed baking cakes more than investigating cases,
would have what happened to him."
- (all) Me!
I want more!
-Come on, who wants to repeat?
Mifuyu!
What happened, Mifuyu?!
Mifuyu, please hold on!
It can't be!
Are you absolutely sure, that it's on this floor,
where you found your friend stabbed?
This must be the murder weapon.
It's stained with blood.
She must have hidden the Mifuyu's body halfway,
while he was taking it home.
Oh, shit!
He tricked us!
