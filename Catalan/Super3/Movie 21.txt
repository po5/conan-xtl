He has the same favorite cards as his master.
I found out everything thanks to you,
Momiji Ooka.
When we finish filming today's TV show, I'll have to say thank you,
I'll have to say thank you.
Oh.
Gee, that was quick!
Looks like he's already arrived.
Oh! (Laughs)
But... What are you doing?
Have you come to...?
Aaaaaaaaah!
- (man: screams in pain)
- (loud bang)
Wow, karuta's letters really go far!
-Huh?
Ah...
-I'll get it, don't worry.
Will you excuse me, please?
Please behave yourself, father.
What a beauty!
-Like a singer.
-She's so pretty...
And the kimono suits her so well.
By the way, what are we doing here, watching them play karuta?
(Kazuha) I should have listened to Mikiko.
She told you to wait in the dressing room until the interview time,
but you've run off after this pretty girl.
and now we're bored here in the studio.
-But I've introduced him to you before!
-And who was she, Mikiko?
She's the girl with the glasses who plays karuta with the pretty one.
She's the captain of the high school Karuta Club.
- (Heiji) You're a member too?
-I'm a member too.
-Of course you are.
Didn't you know?
-Kazuha, do you know how to play too?
By the way, how come it took you so long to come back from the toilet?
Sorry, it's just that we found the studio door locked...
and we were a little afraid to go in.
-Eh?
-Excuse me.
Could you please not knock so much, please?
We're rehearsing.
Yes...
"(Loudspeaker: a man recites a singing poem)"
-My goodness, what reflexes he has!
-Oooh!
Kudo, I don't think he remembers in Kogoro...
that he's come to Osaka to record an interview.
(Shinichi voice) Let him get it off his chest, poor thing.
He thinks that the children have insisted a lot on coming to Osaka
and, since the doctor was busy, he took them.
Come to think of it.
What happened to her rich friend?
Oh, you mean Sonoko?
She couldn't come because she's sick.
The truth is, I didn't know either,
that you were a member of the Karuta Club.
Actually, I'm from the Aikido Club.
But because the Karuta Club had very few members
and it was about to close, I signed up.
But I never go, I'm a zombie member....
who revives from time to time to help Mikiko practice.
A zombie member?
That's funny!
So, you can talk.
Just like two friends in a coffee shop.
Ui.
Excuse me.

DETECTIVE CONAN "The Scarlet Love Letter"
"I'm teenage detective Shinichi Kudo."
"One day, I went to the amusement park with Ran Mouri.
"my best friend and classmate,
"And I witnessed a suspicious exchange
between two men dressed in black."
"I was so focused on watching those two men,
that I didn't realize there was another one behind me."
"He made me swallow a poison.
"And, when I woke up,
(Conan voice)... my body had shrunk."
"If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
they would want to kill me and the lives of those around me would be in danger."
"That's why Dr. Agasa recommended that I hide my identity.
to hide my identity."
"When the Ran asked me what my name was,
I randomly told him I called myself Conan Edogawa."
"Since Ran's father is a detective,
"I went to live with them
to try to get information about the Men in Black."
"This boy is in Heiji Hattori, the teenage detective of the west."
"He has inherited his father's ability of deduction,
superintendent of the Osaka Prefectural Police."
"She is one of the few people who know who I really am."
"She is the Kazuha Toyama. She's Heiji's friend and classmate."
"She always overthinks the things he says to her."
"I don't know how they'll end up, this pair..."
"And this is the mysterious future champion."
"But who should she be, really?"
"I'm small, but I have the brains of an adult."
"A detective who solves all mysteries."
The truth always ends up knowing!
(Genta) What a stick!
For a day when we come to TV and we have to wait for the dressing room.
- (Mitsuhiko) Well, it can't be.
- (Ayumi) I wanted to see the recording.
I've even scolded Mr. Mouri for making too much fuss.
(Ayumi) I'm sorry.

I was also calling more than I should have.
I have an idea.
What do you say we go out shopping when the others come back?
-You mean it?
-What?
Yes, but they won't have to wear well until the recording is finished.
-Oh, sure we will.
-You can count.
And we're all going shopping together?
Come to think of it, why didn't you come, Conan?
Ah, it turns out that...
I asked him to keep an eye on the father while I'm not...
Hey, man.
I think I told you that he's waiting for you in the dressing room, right?
Yeah, the thing is that Ran asked me...
to stay and see how the recording was going.
- (man) Attention.
-Well...
Let us through, please.
We'll take the cards.
(Mikiko) Ooh!
The letters from the Satsuki Association.
You'd think they were carrying the crown jewels...
You don't know what you're talking about, Kazuha.
They're the legendary cards
that are played in the finals of the National Championships
organized by the Satsuki Association.
Didn't you tell me one day
that your dream was to play with this fight?
Not only me.
Since the Satsuki Association was born 20 years ago,
there's no one who hasn't wished for it.
Oh, I wish someday I could make it to the finals...
to play these legendary cards.
How come, these cards are only used to play the finals?
They are very deteriorated, because they have been through many intense games.
That's why they're usually kept in a display case
and they only come out for the final.
The rest of the year, they are on display at the Art Museum.
And don't you find them a bit exaggerated, so many security measures?
Not at all.
Last year, after the Satsuki Cup, the cards were lost.
In the end they were found right away, but Mr. Yajima, the champion,
convinced President Achiwa to tighten security measures.
I see what you mean.
By the way, tell me who are these two people?
What's wrong with you?
They are the two men with whom you will be interviewed!
Very well, you understand.
"(Heiji) It seems that he is doing it expressly..."
(Heiji) Here is a picture of President Kensuke Achiwa.
He is the tycoon who founded Achiwa Real Estate.
He is called "the king of Naniwa real estate".
And how does such an important businessman like him play karuta?
Because it is the only hobby he has.
And, moreover, they say he plays very well.
Well, it says here that Mr. Achiwa
had always wanted to be a reader of poems, and not a player.
Stop.
Who is this attractive woman?
That's Satsuki, the president's wife.
Well, too bad she's married.
It was she who founded the Satsuki Association
when she was a karuta champion.
Then Mr. Achiwa inherited it
and became its president.
Let's see what other topics might come up in the interview....
Ah.
This might be interesting, look.
He says, every time his wife has a big game,
Mr. Achiwa washes the car the day before to attract good luck.
He claims that having a clean car is the key to success and victory.
And do you represent that today's interview should be with this superstitious couple?
with this superstitious married couple?
No, his wife, the Satsuki,
died 3 years ago because of a serious illness.
Today's interview will be with President Achiwa only.
(Kogoro) Ah, well.
Understood.
By the way, who is this burly man...
who is in all the pictures next to Mr. Achiwa?
This gorilla in Togo is Kaieda, Mr. Achiwa's former secretary.
They say he is a very intelligent man
who managed the dark side of real estate.
But it seems he resigned and now we don't know where he is.
Stop it, Heiji.
Stop spreading unfounded rumors, okay?
President Achiwa has no illegal business.
-It's no big deal, it's just rumors.
-It's true, Heiji.
(Man) The chairman has arrived!
President Achiwa.
I'll go greet her.
Hello, Mr. President.
I thank you very much for coming.
And now, thank you for inviting me.
If I understand correctly,
in Yajima and Momiji first will do an exhibition game.
and then we will do the interview, right?
That's right.
When we go live,
we will broadcast the special report on the Satsuki Association's cards.

which we shot last week with the collaboration of Mr. Yajima
to start to liven up the audience.
Ah, you already have the Satsuki Association letters on display.
-Of course.
-I hope you take good care of them.
He looks very good.
Why do you think they call him "the king of Naniwa real estate"?
Excuse me.
Can someone call Mr. Yajima for a moment, please?
He should have arrived at the studio a long time ago.
and I can't find him anywhere.
I'm very surprised.
He told me he would try to arrive an hour before the program starts.
In Yajima he doesn't do later, he's a very punctual guy.
Why don't you call in Sekine and ask him to come just in case?
If necessary, we would ask him to substitute in Yajima.
(Mobile: vibrates)
(Mobile: vibrates)
(Mobile: vibrates)
No... it can't be.
It seems that the program will start late.
Yes, it is.
Which okonomiyaki restaurant are we going to?
You know exactly which one is the best.
You're right, they make them as good as... Oh!
Sorry, I didn't see you.
Did you get hurt?
You're the girl who played karuta, right?
It was my destiny.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I knew I'd end up meeting this man.
How?!
The man who will become my future husband.
Future husband?
Your what?
-What?!
-What?!
I have a little free time today after taping the program.
"My goodness. What big breasts she has!"
-It's just that...
B-b-b-but what are you doing?
-Huh?
-Miss Momiji!
Excuse me, but you should go back to your dressing room.
Precisely at a special moment like this...
Look, it so happens that Mr. Yajima hasn't arrived yet.
He hasn't arrived?
He's the one who came up with the idea of recording this program.
He must be busy with preparations.
Excuse me, Heiji, I have to go.
I'll see you later.
-You!
-Yes, see you later.
Tell me how you know her, this girl.
-Yes, she's the pretty girl from before. -Yes, she's the pretty girl from before.
-Oooh...
-So much so.
-She's even prettier up close.
"I think she's been called Momiji."
-How come she knows your name?!
-I don't know who she is, I don't know her at all.
-Ran, it's better than waiting for them outside.
- (Kazuha: continues speaking)
-Let's go, let's go.
-I don't know why they are arguing, now.
Why is she so angry, Kazuha?
I don't know... Maybe we had met somewhere else.
You finally recognized him.
I knew it, that you knew her.
I already told you I don't know who she is.
Besides, if I'd seen a girl as pretty as her, I'd remember.
A girl as pretty as her?
I'd remember you too, of course, but for other reasons.
What the...?
What did you mean by that?
I'm sorry.
Heiji, are you sure you haven't seen her, this girl?
Momiji... Ooka?
"Junior Satsuki Cup champion for two years in a row.
and a sophomore at Senshi High School in Kyoto.
She's probably the future karuta queen."
-The future karuta queen?
-Momiji Ooka?
(Male) This is the notice we received by email?
Yes.
It says that she will blow up Nichiuri TV studios.
And what do they have to do with it, the karuta letters?
They were attached to the e-mail.
But we still don't know what they mean.
By the way, are you aware, Nichiuri TV staff?
Yes, we've already alerted them.
How do you see it, Heizo?
Is it a bad joke or a real bomb threat?
You can't tell from a simple email,
but if it's not a joke, it's a very serious matter.
(PA: female) "Attention, please."
"We have received an urgent evacuation order from the Osaka police."
Heiji, do you think it's true, what they say?
"Immediately discontinue all activities and recordings..."
Mm?
What now?
An evacuation drill?
-I thought I heard "police".
-It sounds like something's starting.
(Mitsuhiko) They must be recording a program.
(Mitsuhiko) "Immediately cease all activities and recordings...
and leave the building through the emergency exit..."
(Mitsuhiko) -Yes.
(Mitsuhiko) -You.
Go check it out.
What happened?
Is it true, what they say?
"...from the Osaka police."

Kazuha, go to the emergency exit right now.
-And... and you, Heiji?
-All right?
Before we leave, I want to know what's going on.
-Wait, Heiji!
-Go out, I'll catch up with you.
It's not right.
Keep watch.
Come here, you brat.
Where do you think you're going, huh?
It's just that I got a little careless on the set.
Unconscious.
You didn't hear what they just said over the PA?
(Man) I'm sorry.
I hadn't missed it, that's all.
(Momiji) It's the first time
I do an evacuation drill with a kimono.
The situation is serious, we must evacuate the building.
Calm down and tell me what happened.
The Osaka police received a bomb threat.
What do you mean?
Mr. President, it could be a bad joke.
But we'll have to leave until we check that there's no danger.
-Attention.
-Yes, I agree.
You heard him, we must evacuate the building.
Come on, hurry.
-Run, hurry up! -Hurry up!
-Hurry up, you smart session! -Hurry up!
(Achiwa) Don't dawdle, Mikiko.
We're in danger here, we have to leave immediately.
-What are you doing?
(Achiwa) Run!
-You too, Mr. Achiwa.
(Man) Attention.
Try to remain calm, please.
There is no danger, stay calm.
It's better if we stay here waiting without moving, right?
What a drag, all day we wait for everything.
Not the phones.
The father has stayed inside, I hope he can come out...
Ran!
It's the father and Conan!
Hey, hey.
What was that?
If they were doing an evacuation drill, they could have told us.
I asked an employee of the TV station about it.
and he told me they'd received a bomb threat.
Hey.
Where are the Kazuha and Heiji?
A bomb threat?
I don't know, I thought they went out with you.
No... I'm worried, I'd better go look for them.
No.
I'll go.
You guys stay here and don't move.
Okay?
Oh, man.
With all the work we've got, all we need is a drill...
-Ah, Heiji!
-I don't see the point, really.
Mikiko!
Didn't I tell you she's waiting for me on the street?
I know, but I was just worried about you guys.
-What?
-I'm sorry, Kazuha.
I couldn't leave without those letters.
What?
"He'll locate it through his cell phone's GPS."
"I can't believe it. How come Heiji is still in the building?"
Hey, you.
What are you doing?
Leave the cards and get out of here.
-Mikiko!
-Unbelievable...
(Mikiko) Kazuha.
Heiji.
(Watchman) Can't you see that there's danger if she stays here?
(Mikiko) -Huh?
Me too.
-I'm sorry.
Creatures... I'm set number 3, 3 people left.
Mikiko.
Don't be silly, you feel...
(Radio: male) "Get them out immediately."
(Mikiko) It's just that if the bomb threat was real, I couldn't leave them here.
(Man) We don't know when the explosion will be.
We've been instructed to wait at a safe distance.
Okay, thank you.
You can see that the 3 people who were left in the building are already leaving.
-No.
-There's no one left, then?
All right, we'll go in and look for suspicious objects.
Now we'll go inside and look for suspicious objects.
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
Have the groups start moving in.
(Boy) We have entered.
Is it true there's a bomb?
I thought it was a joke.
(Watchman) Hurry up, mail.
Follow me.
(Boy) Huh?
Was it true?
(People: shouts of panic)
Everybody take cover!
Move back a few more meters!
Get away from the building!
- (snapping)
- (panicked shouting)
Mail!
Mail!
-Ah!
Current, president.
-Kazuha!
Watch!
Hold it.
Don't come closer, it's dangerous.
How strong!
Damn.
Where did those kids go?
"I hope Heiji and the others weren't involved."
Kazuha!
Get out of the way.
It's too dangerous.
-It's too bad!
Ouch!
-Come on, let's go.
-Ah... Yes.
-Are you okay? -You okay?
Can you run?
Well, come on, let's go.
(man) This way.
(Man) Now we can't get in so easily, can we?
(Man 2) No...
-There are people left.
-Now someone is coming out of the building.
You can see that there are still two people...
(Man) Follow the instructions, please.
(Man) Move aside.
No.
Kazuha, this way.

Oh!
Shit.
-Heiji!
-Aaaah!
- (explosion)
-It's gone a hair's breadth.
Take cover.
Get away from here!
"Down we can't go."
Kazuha, follow me.
We'll go up.
But why do you want to go up?
Shouldn't we go down?
Since we're stuck, we have to find a place where we can breathe.
"But what's he doing in Heiji?"
"He's going up?"
Shit.
The line is collapsed.
Come on, Kazuha.
Kazuha!
Come on, Kazuha!
I thought... the terrace was made of cement.
(Man) Closer.
We have to get closer.
(Man 2) Impossible.
It would be too dangerous.
Will you let me pass?
(Man) Thank you.
"Damn. You can't see anything, with this smoke."
"I just won't make it. I can't take it anymore."
Kudo!
I'll have to gamble.
I have no choice.
Endavaaaaant!
"Oh! It's him. I knew he'd come."
Heiji!
(Kazuha) Wait, Heiji.
Where are you going now?
Come on.
It's the only way out.
Don't tell me you want to go down this way...
-Heiji!
-Stay here, Kazuha.
Okay?
How do you want to go down this way?
You're kidding, right?
Me too.
Hey.
We're all set.
There's no time.
You'll have to come down at once.
-You want to go down this way? -You want to go down this way?
What are you doing?
-Hey, Kazuha.
I don't see anything... Ah!
Are you kidding me, Heiji?
-What?
But...
-Close your eyes and hold on tight.
Ah... Hold on.
Ah!
Ah!
-Thanks, Kudo.
I'll wait for you downstairs.
-Hey.
You idiot.
You're a nutcase.
I am.
Don't be long.
(Kazuha) I'm scared.
Let go of me!
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
-Kudo.
- (explosion)
(Kazuha) Shit!
Kudo!
-There's someone there.
Hurry up!
-It can't be.
But it's Heiji!
-The stretcher.
Take the stretcher.
-Yes, there's someone.
Kazuha.
Heiji...
Shit.
It was the only place to get off.
"Think. There's got to be some other way out."
A rescue helicopter.
No, impossible.
With the flames and smoke it wouldn't be able to get close, let alone land.
Wait a minute.
Next to the TV studios there's a river.
If I could jump down there...
Let's go, let's go.
Ah!
I won't be able to.
There's not enough room to pick up speed on the skateboard.
Ah!
How awful!
My lungs burn every time I take a breath of air.
I have to do something right away.
Ran.
It's too soon... to give up.
I have to find a place where I can get some momentum on the skateboard.
There has to be a place.
I've got it!
"What are you doing, Kudo? Hurry up."
Oh... Look at him.
It's him, I'm convinced.
But I don't understand how he intends to...
Of course.
Now I know how he'll do it.
Faster.
Faster!
I can't... breathe.
A little more, it won't be long now.
-The antenna will fall!
-It's about to fall.
Watch out!
The time has come!
Shit, I have not been able to pack enough.
I won't make it...
Ah!
Ah!
Iah!
I was waiting for you, buddy.
Get over here!
I've got you.
Are you okay, Kudo?
Ah... I think so... But geez, kid...
Thank you.
Here, you've been dropped.
By the way, how did you come so well equipped?
Did you already know, that they would put a bomb on Nichiuri TV?
Don't be an idiot.
How was I supposed to know?
I always come well-equipped, just in case.
You look like you're shouting about bad weather, man...
Ha...!
You can say it...
Ran.
Kazuha.
Are you alright?
Yes, but I don't remember much.
Luckily, I didn't get hurt, I just inhaled some smoke.
I'm glad you're safe and sound!
-Yes.
-I'm glad to see you well too.
About that..., Ran.
In all the commotion I lost my car key.
I'll see if I can find it.
I'll see if I can find it.
I don't know, Ran.
By the way, where is it in Conan?
I thought we'd find it here, but it's not here.
-That's right.
-Look, it's him.
-We were worried about you.
-Conan.
Where have you been?
-Hey, what about you?
Where have you been?
-Ah... Kazuha.
Me? -No, nowhere...
No, nowhere...
And you, Conan?
Where were you?
You don't know how I suffered.
By the way, where's the Mikiko?
Sorry, Ran.
He hurt his arm before he left the building
and was taken to the hospital.

-It seems to me that it wasn't serious, but...
-To the arm, you say?
I asked to which hospital she had been taken.
Yes.
If you wish, we can go and see.
-Yes. -Yes.
-Let's go.
-Inspector Otaki.
-Heiji.
I'm so glad to see you well.
Kazuha.
Do you mind going on without me?
-I'll catch him right away.
-What?
Yes, yes, I do.
Come with us, Conan.
What a face!
Come on, come on, Ran.
And don't separate from me again.
All right, I'll see you later, Conan.
See you later, Conan.
Yes.
So, is it true you received a bomb threat?
This is the e-mail that came into the station.
Oh!
Some karuta letters in an attachment?
Yes.
Could have something to do with the show they were taping.
But, the way the Nichiuri TV building's been left...
I imagine it'll take several days
before they can get in there to look for evidence.
Yes, they will.
What would be the target of the culprit?
-You're welcome.
Take care of yourself.
Thank you very much, doctor.
-Fortunately, fine. -How are you, Mr. President?
-How are you, Mr. President? -How are you, Mr. President?
-What rest...
-It's just a little scratch.
What a coincidence, that all this happened just before the tournament.
Oh, I wouldn't have imagined it.
It's been many years in a row that we've organized the Satsuki Cup, but I think we'll have to do it this year,
but I think we'll have to cancel it this year.
-Huh?
-Huh?
You can't do that.
Precisely now we have to prove
that the Satsuki Association is in top form.
The problem is that the association cards
that we had to use during the finals will have been burned.
If the problem is the cards, don't worry.
-What?
-They're all intact.
They can't be!
Y-you mean they haven't been...?
Miss Hiramoto took them just before evacuating the studios.
La-la Mikiko, you say?
If the cards had been burned, I'd understand if she canceled the tournament.
Really?
Is it true that nothing happened to them?
Really?
Yes, the museum staff is examining them to check,
but they seem to be intact.
Mr. President, the letters are in perfect condition.
-Good.
-There's no need to suffer any more.
What a break... I thought we lost them.
Or... so Mikiko saved them by the skin of her teeth.
And how is she?
Well, from what I've been told, she doesn't have any serious injuries.
-All right.
-But they're still examining her.
Don't you think it's taking too long, Mikiko?
Especially since the doctor said
she only needed first aid...
- (Kazuha) Mikiko.
Thank you very much, doctor.
(Kazuha) -Yes.
(Kazuha) -Oh, my God.
That you broke it?
I was told I have a broken arm.
-It's the punishment I deserve, Kazuha. -Wow.
-Wow.
And now!
For having endangered you and Heiji
when I turned around to get the letters.
-We're very grateful, Mikiko.
-Don't talk nonsense.
You saved our letters,
the visible face of the Satsuki Association.
As president and highest representative,
I have no words to express our gratitude to you.
I'm very sorry, because this way I won't be able to participate in the championship.
Yes, it's a pity that such an important and talented player like you...
and talented player like you can't compete in the Satsuki Cup.
But now you have to rest to recover completely.
That's right.
You'll participate next year.
-I can't afford it.
-Huh?
If we don't place well in this year's tournament,
the high school Karuta Club will have to close.
And as long as I'm the captain, I can't tolerate it.
Mr. President...
The police gentlemen are waiting for you.
Shall we go?
-Don't be sad, Mikiko.
-Yes, I am.
It's just that we don't...
Yeah, apart from the two of us,
the Karuta Club there's no one else who plays well enough to compete...
-Me?
-I got it, Kazuha.
You participate.
You will replace me as the representative of the Kaiho Institute.
Stop the cart.
Let's not be hasty...
Have you ever participated in a tournament, Kazuha?
No, I haven't.
No, but you do practice when you help me train, right?
That's right...
(Mikiko) You're fit, you have reflexes and a competitive spirit.
Any opponent seems small to you.
And you're shameless and unscrupulous.
Now I don't know whether to be flattered or offended...

When does the competition start?
The first round takes place the day after tomorrow.
I'm sure you'll make it.
How can I?
If we train rigorously from now on, you will do well.
It's your first time competing and you intend to reach the final?
Maybe we should change the category of the tournament
from professional to amateur.
Don't despise it.
I train often, with Kazuha,
and I know her skills like no one else.
It's true that she lacks experience,
but she has the talent of a top player.
Oh, really?
This girl?
Come to think of it, I seem to remember seeing you with Heiji before.
I don't know what kind of relationship you have.
We've always been together since we were little,
in Heiji is my... is my...
(Ayumi) You like him a lot, don't you?
-You can't hide it.
-But it's plain to see!
Stay out of it, you guys.
"I love her in secret", just like the poem.
Two longtime friends playing at being sweethearts.
It's so cute and romantic.
What do you say we make a deal, then?
The one who wins the karuta championship the day after tomorrow
will have the right to marry Heiji.
She can propose to him before the other one and keep him.
What are you saying?
Wait, that doesn't make sense.
If you really care about him, prove it and accept the challenge I'm proposing to you.
Kazuha, don't be provoked.
You can't accept.
But you should know... I care about you too.
(Kazuha) Wait.
I understand.
I accept.
"I can't believe it."
Ka... Kazuha...
Let's see if you can keep up this spirit until the day of the tournament.
Speak for yourself.
Let's see if you can't lose until we meet.
I think we've had enough, for today.
I'll go get a manicure
and I'll start looking for the words to tell you how I feel.
-Yes...
-This girl's a little scary, isn't she?
That was amazing.
I knew it, you're fantastic.
You stood up to Momiji.
-Huh?
-What do I do now?
I'm in big trouble.
-Oh!
-Huh?
Oops.
- (Momiji) It was my fault.
- (Kogoro) Oops, sorry.
Father, did you find the car key?
No, and I've been looking for it everywhere.
I don't know what I've done, it seems that it has evaporated...
What do you say, now!
I guess I'll have to make a duplicate.
Oh.
What have you found, Conan?
I think it's that girl's purse.
Oh, is it?
Let-let me see.
She must have dropped it.
Yes, it's Momiji's.
You know her?
I'll be right back, Father.
I'll give it back to her.
Oh, I'm all messed up.
What do you think I should do?
I do not understand what you mean.
(Genta) It was a bit scary, but...
She was beautiful, wasn't she?
If a girl like her proposes to him,
Heiji will have no choice but to say yes to her...
Ui.
But you and he would make a much better couple, obviously.
-Yes, woman, of course.
-Really?
We can't waste another minute.
I'll start training day and night from today.
It's my first time in a hospital.
It's huge, isn't it?
Looks like you have to get lost...
Look, Ran.
I've found it.
It's over there.
Momiji.
Just a moment.
Momiji.
Wait a minute!
Wow, it's gone.
What are we going to do with this now?
We know her name and where she goes to school,
but maybe we'll find her phone number inside.
You're right, you're right.
Yeah, I'm sure you are.
Let me take a look?
Let's see, this is... a picture.
"Who is this man?"
What? Oh, look, there's another one.
Ah, look, there's another one.
Eh?
This is Momiji, and the other one...
It looks like a photo from when I was little.
They're making a promise to each other.
Isn't it in Heiji?
That's funny.
And what should they promise each other?
That, when they were older, they would get married.
I don't think that's it, is it?
But they were so young, here!
"Although, knowing Heiji..."
"...it's very likely."
(Moto: approaching)
Ah.
It's Heiji's motorcycle.
Don't tell anyone about the photo.
Yes.
Especially not at the Kazuha, huh?
What are you doing here?
Are you the welcoming committee?
What do you get, the Ran?
What's that?
Ran.
Ah... Ahem...
Were you able to return her purse?
(Shinichi voice) You took too long.
Hey.
No.
Did you find out anything else?

And the police don't know what's going on either.
Inspector Otaki said he would contact me when he had more information.
when he had more information.
Mr. President, I received a call for you.
It seems to be urgent.
Could you take it?
-This wench... It's unbelievable.
-Yes, right away.
- (Achiwa) From the Kyoto police?
-Whoever understands it, let him buy it.
Yes.
And then?
What happened to him, to Yajima?
As you say?
That she was murdered?
Heiji.
(Achiwa) I cancel my engagements and come.
Where are you going?
Come this way.
Thank you, officer.
Ep, nanos.
It is forbidden to enter here.
We are the assistants of Mr. Kogoro Mouri.
-Let them pass.
They are not dangerous.
-You're kidding me, right?
-I haven't seen you for a long time. -Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
(Conan's voice) Inspector Ayanokoji...
(Ayanokoji) The man who was killed is Toshiya Yajima.
He was the son of a wealthy sake brewing family
and lived alone in this mansion.
We estimate that he died around 6 am,
but she was not found until after 8 hours, at two o'clock in the afternoon.
By the way, be careful where you put your feet.
This looks like a battlefield.
- (man) A violent robbery, you say?
-(man) Okay.
(Kogoro) From the state of the crime scene,
I'd say it was a robbery with murder.
Yes, we have this theory too.
The murderer broke in to steal money and valuables,
but he met Mr. Yajima and...
...he was forced to kill him
by striking him with the Japanese sword he intended to steal.
Then he took the money and ran away.
I don't understand.
Why would he do that?
Everything seems to indicate that the victim was playing karuta.
-Ah!
Who the hell let him in?
- (Heiji) Yes, it seems so.
Hey, Inspector.
You'll let us take a look at the crime scene, won't you?
Forensics are done, so do your thing.
Eh? (Heiji)
Are you sure?
But we'll have to take the sword that served as the murder weapon.
Of course, of course.
Answer everything they ask you on it until they're done.
Yes.
If you'll excuse me, I'll wait for you outside.
If you discover anything new, let me know.
What do you think?
(Shinichi voice) It's too early to tell.
Yes.
But the right hand...
Yes.
You noticed it too, didn't you?
It looks like something bloody was taken out of his hand.
And the only bloody thing in this room...
is karuta's letters.
There must have been some incriminating message in the letter.
The killer has taken it and mixed it with the others.
Yeah, but it'll be like looking for a needle in a haystack.
Mm?
I'll take care of it.
I know just the person to look at it.
Look at it.
Look at the blood trail on the remote.
It was right next to the victim when she was killed.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Can I turn on the TV for a second?
-Thank you.
-Yeah, go ahead. -Yeah.
If he was using the remote just before he died,
there might be some recorded image.
It's Momiji Ooka.
So Mr. Yajima was looking at this,
just before he was attacked...
It looks like old karuta games.
What's wrong?
Yes.
These are the games from the Satsuki Cup school championship,
from the fifteenth to the twentieth edition.
Why was he looking at them, these games?
I don't understand.
When you reach the final,
the level of your opponents is usually very high.
By watching how your opponents play
you can get to know their strategies
and the way they arrange their cards.
I don't think this detail has anything to do with the murder.
I'm sick to death of the buts.
(Conan's voice) Yeah, but...
-But-but...
-And so are you.
We're leaving.
Enough of playing detective.
I'm sorry.
You won't be bothering us anymore.
Of a... all right.
Let me go, Kogoro.
(Let me go!
"And now, the news. Today, around one o'clock in the afternoon..."
I've seen it a thousand times, that.
Sick of suffering, aren't you?
Hey.
May I know why you're turning it off now?
Because he suffers too much every time he hears this news.
-Yeah, but...
-In the end, he'll have a stroke.
You've already located the children and they're all fine, right?
I know, but I'm worried that Shinichi won't return my calls.
(Mobile: vibrates)

Oh.
Look.
We would have rather said it.
-Yes.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
Let me talk when you're done.
You, there's no right.
What are you doing that you can't even talk on the phone?
"Dr. Agasa was very worried about you."
(Shinichi voice) Yes, I'm sorry.
It's just that I've been a little busy.
"Tell me, what do you want?"
Look, I just emailed you some photos.
"I want you to analyze the karuta letters that come out."
Huh?
Weren't you investigating the bombs?
What's that got to do with blood-stained letters?
I want you to try to figure out
which of these cards is the one the victim was holding in his hand.
"I need a square person like you to do it."
Square, me?
Oh.
I see you've also sent me a picture of a man.
"Yes. Could you look into it, while you're at it?"
"I don't know, but I suspect so."
Does it also have to do with karuta?
"I'll do what I can, but I'll need a little time."
Thank you.
I know you're coming out.
H-hang on.
The doctor wants to...
"Good-bye."
Let me... Always the same...
So, it looks like the target
are the big shots of the Satsuki Association.
Yes.
We should keep an eye on that pair.
I'll keep an eye on Mr. Achiwa.
In fact, I think they're staying at the same hotel.
Then, I'll keep an eye on Momiji Ooka.
Hey, stop.
Who are you?
Soc from the Satsuki Association, let me through.
Wait a moment.
I'll go ask for confirmation.
Sekine!
Where have you been, until now?
I've called you a lot of times.
I'm sorry, president.
Yesterday I drank more than I should have and fell asleep
without realizing that my cell phone was out of battery.
It seems unbelievable.
And, when I woke up,
I learned that the television building had exploded.
I called the association and they told me that I was at Yajima's house
and that he was looking for me,
I came in and found all these people here.
How come there are so many police?
Did anything happen to Yajima?
Unfortunately, yes.
It turns out that she was murdered.
What?!
According to the police, she was attacked by a thief...
with a sword she had in the hallway.
With a sword?
Wow...
Mr. Achiwa, may we meet your friend?
Sure, excuse me.
I'm a camera operator and a member of the Satsuki Association.
My name is Koji Sekine.
In Sekine was the main rival of Yajima.
They have met in the final
of the last two editions of the Satsuki Cup.
And I lost both of them.
I thought that this year I could beat him, but...
now I won't be able to face them anymore.
But the tournament will be held anyway, as planned, right?
Well, I don't know, really.
I've thought a lot, and I don't know....
He will organize it anyway.
If he cancels the traditional Satsuki Cup because of this murder,
our partner will have died for nothing.
He will have been beaten in vain.
(Achiwa) Watch out, Sekine.
Be careful what you say.
Sorry, I said it without thinking.
I'm from the Kyoto police.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Could you spare me a couple of minutes of your time?
Yes, by all means.
You can ask me anything you want.
-Of course.
-Accompany me, please.
Mr. Mouri, it's getting late.
It's time for us to go back to Osaka.
(You know what, Kudo?
I know who the murderer is.
Yes, so do I.
It's very likely that he killed Mr. Yajima.
But it's not clear to me that it was him, too,
who put the bombs on the TV
to kill the members of the Satsuki Association.
You are right.
To avoid complications,
we'd better keep an eye on Mr. Achiwa and Momiji, as we said.
Yes.
-Second.
-First!
(Ayumi) It's not fair.
Wait for me.
Wow!
What a big room we have, right?
Yes, Sonoko booked it.
She really wanted to come, the poor thing.
That's why she chose a hotel that was very close to Nichiuri TV.
(Kazuha) "It's a hotel worthy of the Suzuki Group..."
(Sonoko) Exactly, that's right.
(Coughs)
He'll spend the whole night training,
so bring some snacks.
Okay, thank you.
Oysters.

I always have to pull their chestnuts out of the fire.
"When I saw you cheering for your friend..."
Well, it doesn't matter.
(Kazuha) Come on, let's start the training.
We'll help you too.
If there's anything we can do for you, just say so.
That's great!
You have all our moral support.
- (mobile)
-Really?
Thank you.
-Who is it?
-They're calling me.
-I want to talk too.
-It's Dr. Agasa.
-Yes, good thinking.
-Let's talk to him, all of us. -We'll go.
In the meantime, start without us.
We'll stand back a bit, so we won't bother you.
This is the moral support you'll give me, isn't it?
Probably.
Ah, look, I see them.
Any more scares, after the bomb?
-We're all very well.
-(Agasa) No.
- (Agasa) Perfect, ideal timing.
-Yes, we just arrived at the hotel.
-(Agasa) It can't be...
(Agasa) - Eh?
Tataaan!
You were waiting for Dr. Agasa's riddle, weren't you?
So this is the only reason he called us here?
Let's get started.
They say that the peculiar and unique style of the karuta games recalls
one of Japan's most ancient traditions.
Of these four, which one is it?
One: harvesting tea.
Two: flying kites.
Three: chopping mochi.
And four: mowing rice.
The part that picking the cards and stacking them is reminiscent of harvesting tea.
A green tea with rice appetite, at this hour.
When they chop the cards, they seem to chop the mochi.
Is it the final answer?
Surely?
-But Ay...
-The answer is number 4.
(Ai) Once the rice is mowed, you separate the grain from the chaff.
What you do is...
-Discarded.
(Ai) -Of course.
(Ai) What?
(Ai) What?
You don't have any compassion for this poor old man...
Even if he's on a trip, don't go to sleep late, okay?
(All) Okay!
(Ai) Good night!
- (Ai) Au, good night.
(Ayumi) I didn't realize it was so late.
It's late, my father!
I don't know if Heiji is still with them.
If you suffer because you don't know where he is, why don't you call him?
Eh... Yes, you're right.
(Mobile)
-Mm?
- (mobile)
- "Like what's wrong?
-What's wrong, Kazuha?
Look what time it is.
May I know where parents?
Where?
In Kyoto?
What are you doing in Kyoto?
"I'm sorry, I have to settle a little thing and I'll be late."
-What do you mean, don't wait for you?
- "Don't wait for me, okay?"
I thought you're helping me train for the karuta tournament.
What tournament?
"I've decided that I'm going to participate instead of the Mikiko."
But you've never competed in a tournament, have you?
"That's precisely why I have to train a lot."
I know that you played karuta when you were little, and you were very good at it.
Yes, that's true.
When I was in elementary school I signed up for a tournament
I hadn't prepared at all.
(Kazuha) That's why I was so shocked when I saw that you won.
But that was a long time ago, I hardly remember....
"Well, I do, and very much so."
In fact, it's the first memory that came to mind...
when Mikiko asked me to join the Karuta Club.
"Ah, yes?"
"Anyway, if we're done talking about old times, we can say goodbye."
What's the matter, you want to hang up on me already?
"I see you're in a hurry to get rid of me..."
Hey, I didn't say that.
"Don't worry, don't suffer. I'll get over it without you."
-It doesn't matter.
You're an idiot.
-Hey.
What's wrong with you now?
I swear, when I see him, I'll scan him.
I'm hallucinating.
What's wrong with her?
Anyway, what's wrong with her...
Hi, it's me.
Look, I'm calling to ask you a favor.
Yes, that's right.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Phew.
I'm beat.
Mm?
-Ah... Thank you.
-Welcome, Mr. Mouri.
I wouldn't have guessed,
that even in Osaka I should investigate a murder.
Aaaa...
Father, where is Conan?
First he said he wanted to come back with me and we got into the car together,
but as soon as we arrived at the hotel he said
he had to talk to Mr. Achiwa and left.
He did?
Wow.
"This Conan is a case."
"If the culprit is who I think he is,
I doubt he'll try to attack Mr. Achiwa tonight."
(Mobile: vibrates)
Oh.
"Have you finished what you had to do?"
(Conan voice) Is anything wrong, Ran?
Yes.

"Well, come on, go back to the room."
"I'm not at ease, after all that's happened."
Yes, understood.
I'll be right back.
"That's perfect. So I can continue even if I go out on the street."
Hold it.
Isn't that woman...?
"But what is she doing here?"
("Poem reader: recite singer.")

(Genta) Wow!
You're so hot.
I knew I wasn't good enough to help you...
Please keep watch.
A little more and I'll empty my eye.
Hello, Conan.
I'm here.
I've come with a top-notch assistant.
-What?
-What?
-What?
-Who is she?
If it isn't Heiji's mother!
Heiji explained everything to me and I decided to come.
(Kazuha) Really?
Why? (Kazuha) Why?
Mm... (Kazuha) Oh.
I've come to help you, Kazuha.
Don't you need intensive training?
Yes, that's true, but...
I can give you a hand, although I may have lost my agility...
since the last time I was champion...
Champion?
As Heiji asked me to do,
I'm willing to teach you everything I've been learning about this game.
But keep in mind that we are very short of time,
so it will be a tough training.
If you agree, we can start.
Yes.
Thank you very much for coming.
I knew you'd come, Inspector Ayanokoji.
I see we had the same feeling, Heiji.
-And the little detective?
-Yes.
How come he didn't come with you?
We agreed he'd keep an eye on Mr. Achiwa.
Gee, that's... Now that's good teamwork.
Yes, but I really regret choosing her.
I didn't imagine that Momiji Ooka
would live in a mansion as big as this one.
- (blow)
-Eh?
-Ah, you're welcome.
-Thank you for coming to watch.
I don't think we've met before.
I'm Miss Momiji's butler, my name is Muga Iori.
Why don't you rest for a while and have some tea?
(Momiji) You've come to suffer for me,
married my...
"(Loudspeaker: poem reader recites singer)"

"Wow! Looks like he hasn't left the hotel yet."

(Heiji's mother) You're doing very well.
To tell you the truth, I didn't expect anything to last this long.
But now you should rest for a while.
No.
I can continue.
Rest is part of training.
I'll go get some boiled rice for breakfast, okay?
Kazuha.
Let her sleep for a while.
Are you all right?
She thinks she hasn't slept a wink all night.
She's more talented than I thought.
Do you think she's ready?
Still, she'll have a hard time making it to the top four,
and getting to the final won't be easy, really.
So...
Let me explain without interrupting me.
(Mother Heiji) "I said it won't be easy, but not that it's impossible.
"In a karuta competition,
the most important thing is to have mental stamina and concentration."
"She has both."
"If she is able to keep her concentration without getting distracted,
she might even win the tournament."
"If I show her this picture, it will only break her concentration."
(Kogoro voice) We'll finish right away.
Just sit still and be calm.
Look, it's just that... I'm in a hurry, I'll have to leave soon.
But go ahead, you wanted to talk to me about something, right?
Yes, I want to talk about Mr. Yajima's murder.
-It looked like it.
-Wasn't it a robbery?
But, according to my theory,
it was a premeditated cold-blooded murder.
Come on, it's true that Yajima wasn't very charismatic,
but no one resented him enough to kill him.
-What are you talking about?
-Not even you?
-Mr. Sekine.
-Why me, precisely?
You've lost the Satsuki Cup final for two years in a row.
and both times you've been defeated by Mr. Yajima.
If your great rival were to disappear, you could....
This is all nonsense.
Of course I want to win this competition,
but I'm not so obsessed with it that I'd kill the rivals
to get them off my back.
Besides, the police said I was a thief.
Why are you now saying...?
-Huh?
-For several reasons.
First, the mess in the mansion didn't follow the pattern of a burglary.
It turns out that the burglar didn't damage
anything that was karuta-related.
Now.

He had just killed a person, he must have been really scared.
Maybe he was,
but I thought maybe the culprit
had a close link with karuta,
that's why he had not been able to damage the objects related to this game.
The detectives come up with some very far-fetched hypotheses.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
Your theories are your business and I'm not going to get involved.
Eh!
"M'enxamparà."
This has nothing to do with me.
-M'enxamparà?
What's the matter?
-Oh... -Oh... Oh, of course it is.
The floor in the hallway of the annex pavilion is noisy.
It creaks with every step you take.
Do you remember?
Yes, so what?
It makes so much noise,
it's impossible to enter without anyone noticing.
(Kogoro voice) However, the corpse...
had no marks of having fought back.
You're insinuating that Yajima knew the person who killed him, right?
Well, you're wrong.
Karuta requires absolute concentration,
even when you're training.
And I assure you, when you are concentrated, you don't feel any noise.
That's why in Yajima he didn't realize that someone had come in
until it was too late.
This is impossible.
The wound that killed Mr. Yajima was in the middle of his head.
If he had continued to play karuta
without noticing the presence of his killer,
"The wound would have been found in the occipital or temporal region of the victim's head...
or temporal region of the victim's head."
Therefore, the only explanation for the wound that he presented...
is that he knew his killer.
(Heiji) We have a culprit who is a karuta aficionado,
who knew Mr. Yajima and has no alibi for the time of the crime.
And who, in addition, would benefit from his death.
How interesting!
All indications point to me.
In any case, everything you have said so far is a mere hypothesis.
If you want to accuse me, you will need proof of my guilt.
(Door: call)
Mr. Sekine, it's time.
You can come out now.
Yes, I'm coming.
I've had a lot of fun, but I have to go.
See you soon.
(Kogoro voice) Before you go, I'll ask you one last question.
What a pain!
What else do you want?
I was struck by a comment you made yesterday,
although I don't know if you remember.
"If you annul the traditional Satsuki Cup for this murder,
our comrade will have died for nothing."
"He will have been beaten in vain."
It seems to me that's it, what he said.
When you are told that the murder weapon is a sword,
you deduce that the victim has been stabbed to death.
You, on the other hand, knew that he had been beaten to death.
Only the culprit could have known
that the sword was rusty and could not be unsheathed.
How did you know that he had been beaten to death?
Well... because I saw the corpse at the crime scene.
Come in-well, good.
When you arrived, the body had long since been covered up.
So you didn't have a chance to see it at the crime scene.
I-I... I imagined it.
I saw the blood stains on the floor
and I deduced that she'd been beaten to death.
Be that as it may, I had nothing to do with the crime.
What an impertinent man!
Let's see what moves he'll make after this shake-up....
(Shinichi voice) What we'll have to keep an eye on now...
...are the tournament facilities.
Well, yes.
I've already taken a look, and it looks like it's going to be complicated.
Wow, this place is huge.
What's this house in the middle of the cliff?
Satsuki, you say?
The Satsuki pavilion.
Mr. Achiwa built it in honor of the Satsuki,
his late wife.
That's why people call it that.
I see what you mean.
You can only go up to the Satsuki Pavilion once a year,
and only Mr. Achiwa, who acts as a reader,
and the two finalists.
The game is recorded by cameras and microphones set up in the hall
and broadcast live in the hall where the audience is,
located on the other side of the river.
Wow, what a set-up!
The temperature and humidity of the competition hall
are kept uniform by an air-conditioning system,
and the soundproofed walls keep the space
completely insulated from outside noise.
It is a state-of-the-art system.
In other words, it's a competition pavilion...
designed exclusively for playing karuta.

-What if we go to the free buffet?
-I'm so hungry!
I'd like a cake.
Have a good time.
Girls, I'm taking the kids shopping.
-Come on, let's go shopping for once.
-You're not coming, Ran?
Bye. Bye-bye.
Oh.
See you later, then.
Be careful, now.
I'm here, guys.
Let's see if the memories will run out...
Mrs. Shizuka, it's time to continue training.
Don't be in such a hurry.
If you don't get some more rest,
you won't have the strength to make it to the finals.
-Just a moment, Kazuha.
-I've had enough rest.
You got a former champion like Mrs. Shizuka to train you?
-That's great!
-Yes, it is.
Then maybe you'll win.
Come on, it's time to go back to the room and continue training.
(Momiji) If you want to train so much,
why don't we practice together for a while?
Otherwise, it will be very difficult for you to play the final against me.
How dare you...!
(Shizuka) You have to rest, Kazuha.
-But I can practice with you.
-But it's just that...
Or am I not good enough for you?
(Shizuka) Oh!
It's former champion Shizuka Ikenami.
Why is she training him, this girl?
What do you say?
Will you grant me the next match?
If you insist, I accept.
I'd be honored.
And the Achiwa and Sekine?
It looks like they've gone to the Achiwa hall,
the competition hall where the rehearsals will be held tomorrow.
They will be escorted by the police, so there is no need for us to suffer for them.
But once they have entered the hall, they will no longer have protection.
It will be fine.
What about Momiji?
Since she lives in Kyoto, she'll travel with everyone else.
Oops, sorry.
I'm being paged.
(Mobile: vibrates)
I have identified the man in the photo you sent me.
What are you talking about?
Really? I know who he is and how to say it.
I know who he is and how to say it.
"Yes, and I'm sure he'll surprise you."
I've emailed it to you, you'll confirm it.
"Thank you. By the way, have you had a chance to look at the pictures of the letters?"
I just entered them into the analysis program.
You can tell it was designed by the doctor.
Within an hour he will have found the letter that the victim had in his hand.
Understood.
Let me know as soon as you get the results.
Yes.
Oh...
It's always the same.
Shikao Nagori.
Wow.
(Momiji) I haven't had so much fun playing cards in a long time.
Thank you very much.
I have to go, Muga.
Yes.
In any case, I have to admit that you are very brave.
You've stood up well, with this level of play,
and yet you still want to compete.
Keep in mind that my name means "autumn leaves",
and you, on the other hand, just means "leaf litter".
-We've had enough for today.
-Leaf litter?
Even if my rival is a beginner like you,
don't think I'll give you a minnow.
Years ago, I made a mistake by underestimating a nerd...
and experienced a humiliating defeat.
And I promised myself it wouldn't happen again.
So, therefore, I will play at 100% of my ability.
That's... that's what I expect from you.
Well, that's enough talk about karuta for today.
You mean you should be here with us?
The president must be worried about you.
Thank you for asking, but there's no need to suffer for me.
I'm under the protection
of what they call "teenage detective of the west" in Heiji Hattori.
What does that have to do with Heiji Hattori?
Wow.
I see he hasn't explained it to you yet.
In Heiji is my private bodyguard.
What's that?
He's been up all night without sleep,
standing guard outside my front door.
Well, now it's really time to go.
I'll look forward to seeing you again tomorrow during the tournament.
Oh, my goodness... Heiji is smarter than I thought.
Hey, Kazuha, what's wrong with you?
Talk to me.
Heiji!
I don't understand what kind of relationship you have with this one,
but I assure you I'll crush her when I meet her at the tournament.
Have no doubt, Heiji!
(Shizuka) Very well said.
What's wrong with you?
AAAI...
Nothing, it's just that I had a chill...
that ran up and down my spine.
Cold?
I wish it were just that.
You must have caught a cold.
It's like I've been possessed by a demon.
Yes.
They're here.

President Achiwa, Momiji Ooka and Koji Sekine.
The three of them together.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah... It can't be.
Sekine's car...
(Man) So?
How is Mr. Sekine?
We talked to the doctors a while ago
and they told us he was still unconscious.
He has a 50% chance of pulling through.
And Miss Momiji Ooka, how is she?
She was also involved in the explosion.
Apparently she has no injuries,
but he has been taken to the hospital with Mr. Iori,
who was driving the car, and they are examining them just in case.
There is something big behind this case.
It would help us if you could tell us everything you know, Mr. Achiwa.
The thing is, we have a suspicion that the Nichiuri TV explosion was also aimed at Nichiuri TV members.
was also aimed at members of the Satsuki Association.
(Conan voice) Mr. President, do you know who Mr. Shikao Nagori is?
Ma-chiquillo... Where did you get it from, this picture?
(Heiji) For the reaction you've had, it's obvious you know who he is.
If you have information that we don't know,
we'd appreciate it if you'd tell us everything you know, Mr. Achiwa.
There used to be another Karuta Club in Kyoto, the Nagori Association.
It had a reputation for being very elitist.
It had only about twenty members
who underwent very rigorous training every month.
This man, in Shikao Nagori, was the president of this association.
He was extraordinarily talented,
and everybody said that it was only a matter of time
that he would earn the right to be an aspiring grandmaster.
But he was very obsessed with competition,
and the truth is that, seen from the outside,
you can't say he had a very sporting attitude.
Hey, you.
I was faster.
This letter is mine!
This was not a mistake.
The problem is that you don't look where you need to look.
5 years ago, in Nagori challenged the Satsuki, my wife,
who was then the president of our association,
with the condition that the loser would dissolve his karuta club.
(Heiji) How crazy!
It's like an all-or-nothing game.
But Mrs. Satsuki
was under no obligation to accept a head-to-head duel.
No, but Nagori leaked her proposal to the press...
to put pressure on my wife and force her to accept the challenge.
He said that the Satsuki Association was afraid
and that's why he was trying to avoid the duel.
I understand.
He put her between a rock and a hard place.
And she had no choice but to accept.
And what happened in the end?
How did the game end?
It turns out that, in the end, the duel did not take place.
We waited on Nagori for a while,
but he didn't show up at the time we had arranged.
"He was considered to have dropped out,
so the Satsuki won automatically."
"Everyone said that at Nagori
he had damaged the reputation of the karuta world,"
because he had fled on the decisive day
after staging a real media circus.
He simply disappeared from the stage.
And what became of him and the karuta association he led?
The Nagori Association was dissolved when its president left,
and we haven't heard from him since.
Could it be that this series of explosions
were Nagori's revenge against the Satsuki Association?
I don't know.
What is certain is that, then,
the only thing that insisted on shutting down the Nagori Association
was on Yajima, who was killed.
-What does this mean?
-(Achiwa) What?
(Achiwa) Satsuki Association tried to settle it amicably,
we didn't want to make the situation worse, but we didn't get out.
And what was done, the Nagori Association members?
We offered them the possibility of joining the Satsuki Association,
but there were only two who accepted.
Wait a minute, could it be that these two were...?
Yes.
They are Momiji Ooka and Koji Sekine.
The two who have been involved in the explosion.
Yes, both of them, especially Momiji Ooka,
had thoroughly studied the en Nagori technique
to improve their skills.
"They made en Nagori's favorite cards their own."
"Moreover, in their fights,
there is never a shortage of six letters with poems about autumn landscapes."
"They were his best disciples."

How come en Nagori's favorite letters were poems about autumn?
They say it's because en Nagori's first name is Shikao.
"Deer meat"?
From deer meat is also called "momiji", "autumn leaves".
I imagine that en Nagori must not have looked kindly on his favorite disciple
that his favorite disciple would unite the Satsuki Association,
with its main rivals.
But what's the point of taking revenge now?
Besides, if she had wanted to take revenge,
he wouldn't have bothered to send a bomb threat, would he?
It's true that we still don't know
what the motive is behind these 5 years of silence,
but maybe the bomb threat was a letter of introduction,
a way of announcing his return.
This means that we should investigate the case
as a possible revenge of Shikao against the Satsuki Association.
(Mobile: vibrates)
(Mobile: vibrates) Excuse me.
What's the matter?
Yes.
Yes.
(Male) We should coordinate with the Kyoto police
to organize a joint investigation.
- (Otaki) What do you say!?
-(Otaki) Yes...
Superintendent.
We examined Koji Sekine's cell phone.
It looks like he received an e-mail just before the explosion.
-The sender is unknown.
-What kind of e-mail?
There seems to be only one attachment,
an image of a letter from karuta.
What poem is there, a la carte?
Well... "Before this journey I have not been able to make any offerings.
I pray to the gods to accept in exchange the red-leaf brocade..."
It's Nagori's favorite letter.
-I have to check something right now.
-What's wrong, Heiji?
Momiji is in danger.
(Mobile)
-You must be Mr. Hattori, right?
- "You're in Iori?"
"Yes."
"I need you to check
if the Momiji's mail has any messages from an unknown sender."
-What is it, Iori?
-In her email?
It's a call from Mr. Hattori.
He called me at Heiji?
Let me speak.
Momiji?
Check the mail inbox.
"From e-mail? What's the hurry?"
Anyway, I'm really excited to hear from you, Heiji.
"Eh? What a strange message."
- "Is it a letter from karuta?"
-There's only one attachment.
- "What poem is it? Read-me."
How strong!
How did you guess?
Eh?
Mm...
"Storm winds are blowing over Mount Mimura..."
Oh... Momiji, listen to me.
Tonight you can't stay alone, it's important.
And don't go home, come to the Osaka Police Station.
"Even if you ask me to, Heiji, I won't be able to do it."
I have to prepare for the Satsuki Cup tomorrow night.
"This is no time to think about the tournament."
-And now!
Nothing will happen to me.
- "You could be the next victim."
It's reassuring to know that I have you.
-Of course, you'll protect me.
- "Me?"
-What?
-I'm counting on you.
"I have very much in mind... the promise you made me."
- "I'll see you later."
-The promise?
This fool hung up on me.
You received an e-mail with a letter from karuta, then?
Yes.
Otaki, give the order to reinforce surveillance of Momiji Ooka now.
Yes.
So, in Yajima...
he's the only one who didn't receive the email with the letter, right?
No, but instead the assassin left a message...
in a karuta letter at the scene of the crime.
This means that, after Mr. Yajima died..,
in Nagori, the real culprit,
left his favorite card in the corpse's hand.
But then Koji Sekine tampered with the crime scene and camouflaged the letter.
and camouflaged the letter.
I get it.
In Sekine saw the letter between the victim's fingers
and knew that the perpetrator of the murder was Shikao Nagori.
In order to cover up the crime of his former teacher,
he manipulated the crime scene to simulate a robbery.
So, this means that in Sekine?
saw the crime scene before the police arrived.
Yes, it is very likely that this was the case.
In fact, we have asked an expert...
to analyze the letters from the crime scene.
Having examined the direction and shape of the blood spatter,
we were able to determine the exact position of each letter

at the time of the murder.
Look at the screen.
On the right side are the letters that were scattered on the ground
and that had been splattered directly with Mr. Yajima's blood.
And on the left side we have the clean cards
and also some that have blood stains
because they were mixed later with bloody letters.
So, knowing that it must be a card with little blood?
and that it is slightly bent,
the letter that the murderer put between Mr. Yajima's fingers...
It was number 32. Tsuraki Harumichi.
"In a stream there is a reed fence built by the wind.
It doesn't let the autumn leaves blow downstream..."
Therefore, at Yajima's home,
there was also one of Nagori's favorite letters.
Note the letters of the crimes that have been committed so far.
From the top left:
Nichiuri TV's, Mr. Yajima's, Mr. Sekine's, and Mr. Sekine's,
Mr. Sekine's and the one Miss Ooka just received.
These 4 letters all have red autumn leaves in common.
As we imagined, they are all Nagori's favorite cards.
So everything seems to indicate
that the real culprit is en Shikao Nagori.
(Achiwa) It seems that Nagori is the culprit after all, then.
I can't get over my astonishment.
(Heiji) What worries me is that there were 6 of them,
the letters with poems about autumn leaves.
The ones that Nagori never let go.
You mean two more are missing.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
If in Nagori he sends karuta letters
with the intention of letting us know he's the culprit,
I don't think he'll give up using the two missing letters.
After the Momiji will come two more?
We should find out who these two letters will be addressed to.
If we don't do it soon, it will be too difficult to protect them from their executioner.
Bravo.
I trust that you will manage to stop Nagori
before the police do.
Mm-hm.
But to stop him we will need more information.
What happened, 5 years ago, between you and Nagori, Mr. Achiwa?
-We know something happened.
-No... it didn't... -No... it didn't...
Don't try to make us believe otherwise.
You are right.
I didn't want to explain it before, but I can tell you.
Come here for a while in my hotel room.
I promise I'll tell you in detail
everything that happened that day.
Wait here for a moment.
I want to turn this back to Momiji.
Until now.
-We'll wait here.
Miss Momiji, I received a call from the police.
They told me they want to reinforce security at your house.
I'm sorry.
Okay, I understand.
You're Momiji, right?
Soc Ran Mouri, I called you earlier.
Ah.
So it's you.
Thank you very much for coming expressly.
No, and now!
Ah, there you go.
How nice!
This purse is yours, isn't it?
For me, this purse is like a lucky charm.
I didn't know how I would compete tomorrow if I didn't have it,
but now I'm saved.
But I imagine you must feel
like I'm helping your friend's rival, right?
No.
I hope that girl doesn't hurt her fingers from training.
What beautiful nails!
Yes, I wear them painted to protect my fingertips.
They are essential for playing karuta, that's why I always have a manicure,
except when I have to train.
Of course, how interesting.
Ah, that...
I opened the card holder to find your contact details.
And I saw the photo.
Oh...
Ah, I guess you mean this one here, right?
Yes, it's in Heiji.
This boy in the picture...?
I knew it.
This picture was taken on the day he beat me
in the final of a children's karuta championship.
When I lost, in Heiji he saw me crying and said....
(Girl: cry)
Don't cry, you feel?
Next time we meet, I will marry you.
You wait for me.
Really... Really?
I promise.
I promise.
"What? You're really engaged?"
Why do you think I always say that Heiji is my future husband?
But he was small, when he promised you that he would marry you.
It doesn't matter whether it was small or big.
A man shouldn't break his promises so easily.
Ah...
Shouldn't he?
"When you like a girl,
it's impossible to read her heart accurately."

Yes, you are right.
"A rock divides the swift river into two swift currents
that flow apart, but will come together again".
Even though we may be separated, our hearts will remain close together.
I have always believed.
You can tell that to Miss Hojarasca.
Hojarasca?
Tell her... that when I want a letter, no one takes it away from me.
That's what my teacher taught me.
"Momiji..."
Eh?
(Kazuha) Ran.
Ran.
You're over the moon, girl.
What's that?
You look so strange, ever since you came back from taking a walk with the kids to Osaka.
I'm sorry.
What about you, how are you?
How am I?
How should I tell you...?
Heiji's mother has given me homework.
She says that, to win the tournament, I have to choose my favorite card.
The problem is that I don't know how to choose it.
What's that?
Well, it can't be that hard, either.
Of these 100 poems there are many about love.
Don't think about the tournament, let it be.
Just pick a poem that's special to you.
A love poem...?
The most special to me is this one.
"While I was wondering..." by Shikibu Murasaki.
It's a poem about two friends
who have to say goodbye to each other just after they meet again.
Every time we meet, he has to leave right away.
And I have a lot of things to explain to him.
You're right, you're right.
So, then...
My poem would be...
"I promised myself... that no one would know my love for you,
but I can't hide it anymore and people ask me about it."
This is about a love that cannot be hidden.
It is the ideal poem for you.
Even Momiji noticed it.
Now that you mention it, how come she gets so confident with him?
She behaves as if it's her real promise.
No, no, of course.
It's not my imagination, is it?
"I can't tell you that, when Heiji was a little boy,
he promised Momiji that he would get married..."
What do you mean?
That in Nagori he went to play against Satsuki the night before the duel?
-Yes...
-Is it true, this?
He came home when I wasn't there.
In this newspaper article it says that in Nagori he ran away
because he was afraid to compete against Satsuki,
but the truth is that they had faced each other the day before.
-Go and find out.
-Why was it the night before?
The real reason is known only to Nagori himself,
but the Satsuki had a theory
that surely his aim was to defeat her
using the cards of the Satsuki Association.
They played with those cards?
I thought that the Satsuki Association's cards
were usually on display in the museum.
Yes, but 5 years ago no one had tried to steal them,
so we had them at home.
But you can't play a game without someone to read the poems.
See all these cassette tapes on the shelf?
Before, Satsuki and I used them for karuta practice.
What else?
What happened that night?
Satsuki won hands down.
As a rival, Nagori was no match for her.
I came home and found myself in the foyer as she was leaving,
with his tail between his legs and pale with rage.
I remember it like it was yesterday.
He vanished and I have never seen him since.
I should have explained it to the police.
How come you didn't?
I was afraid the press and the other members of the association would find out.
and the other members of the association.
If it had leaked out that those legendary cards had been used to dispute a duel
had been used for a private duel,
the fellow members of the association would have been upset.
I understand your reasoning, but anyway....
I don't want to say that I don't trust the police, but....
it seems that in Nagori always go one step ahead.
"There's something about this picture that makes my head dance."
"Maybe it's because Mr. Achiwa now has another car..."
Please, guys, stop your feet as soon as possible.
Yeah, count us in.
Eh?
Ran, two is not enough for me.
Can I have two more lumps?
My brain only asks for sweet things.
Ah... Mm-hm.
Did you feel that noise?
"Unbelievable."
"I'm not doing well. I'm still not covering the cards well enough."
"I can't even make the gesture of moving two cards in opposite directions."
"If I don't improve..., that one... will take me on Heiji."
-What are you doing, Kazu?
-What are you doing, Kazuha? -Ah!
-Ah!
Heiji.
-You look half scared, with this face.

-Leave me alone, donkey.
-You had a fight with someone?
Aren't you that girl's bodyguard?
Well, go with her.
What a nerve!
I've come expressly to replace this withered old woman...
and practice with you for a while.
Besides, I haven't lost any game against you.
This was when we were in school and we were little.
Something, Heiji.
You're no match for me now.
Don't you remember at all,
of the children's karuta tournament you won?
Or the girl who lost the final to you?
Now I've fallen.
Of course, Kazuha.
It was that karuta tournament.
The one you signed up for at the last minute and ended up winning?
Yes.
When I won the tournament,
there was a little girl in tears.
-So she...
-She was Momiji Ooka, I swear.
Yes, but you don't remember anything else?
Such as what now?
Such as a promise you made to Momiji that day?
I guess I told her I'd have better luck next time.
Never mind, you should go back to her.
-Your job is to protect her, isn't it?
-Huh?
-Get the hell out of here.
-That's the police's job.
If they hurt her before the tournament... she won't be able to compete.
Are you sure?
Then I'll go.
-Yes. -Yes.
-Mother. -You take care of yourself, okay?
You take care of yourself, okay?
"I promised myself
that no one would know my love for you.
But I can't hide it anymore, and people ask me about it."
Master Nagori.
Give me the strength I need to win the tournament, please.
I ask you to watch over me, Satsuki.
The Kazuha has taken the card!
It is easy to distinguish her from the other players because she is wearing a kimono.
"In fact, it's the aikido uniform."
Yes.
-Yes, but what can we do.
-Too bad Conan's missing out.
He said he had to run an errand with Heiji and couldn't make it.
I got it.
Shall we send him the photo that Genta took in the souvenir store?
When did she get scolded?
(Poem reader: recites singer)
-Yes.
-It seems that it has already begun.
With all these security measures,
you won't be able to enter Nagori anywhere.
No.
And not only in Nagori.
No one will be able to enter who has not registered in advance
as a staff member.
We have checked everyone's background.
You won't be able to carry out your plan.
What's that?
Nothing, it's nothing.
(Shinichi voice) What do you have, Heiji?
(Shinichi voice) Oh.
Who is it?
(Mobile: message tone)
Ah, it's from Mitsuhiko.
But what's he doing, at Genta,
picking up the radish slices with his hands to eat the...?
Oysters!
(Poem reader: recites singer)
(Knock)
Oooh!
I knew it.
It was the first one.
-Still playing.
-And the Kazuha?
Where is she?
-Oh, so much, it's the Kazuha!
-Hey.
Isn't that her?
-Yes, it's her.
-Yay! -You're the best, Kazuha.
You're the best, Kazuha.
"She made it through the first round. This is called getting off to a good start."
Oh.
Mr. Sekine.
Mr. Sekine!
(At the same time) Ben played.
Oooh!
I wouldn't have guessed, he'd make it to the finals.
What a surprise!
I didn't expect to find another finalist so good.
-Bravo!
-Bravo!
-Of course she is.
-I could win the tournament.
Well done, Kazuha.
You are one step away from victory!
"I don't know if the Kazuha is aware."
"If he defeats Momiji,
she must confess to Heiji that she's in love."
You are doing very well, the Kazuha.
(Conan's voice) Soon she will play the final against Momiji.
- (Otaki) What do you say!
-Oh, so much so.
Mr. Sekine has regained consciousness?
Yes, so what?
It's what we had imagined, isn't it?
I'll leave the Kyoto police in charge.
I'll leave the Kyoto police in charge of surveillance and come.
-It looks like it.
-Mr. Sekine woke up?
And he explained what you had anticipated, Heiji.
But I don't understand, why did he go to Mr. Yajima's mansion?
It seems that, lately,
Mr. Yajima had been searching Shikao Nagori lately.
Mr. Sekine found out about it and decided to spy on Mr. Yajima
with the intention of finding a clue that would lead to his former master.
But then he realized that something was wrong and found the corpse.
and found the corpse.
That's likely.
I suppose, when he gets to Osaka and talks, he will explain everything to me.
Yes.

We'll stay here, don't suffer.
Yes.
Hey, wait for me, I want to come too.
This is the last one.
I don't understand why you need to blow up a hut like this.
-A fire?
-Where's that smoke coming from?
No, it would have set off the fire alarm.
-Don't make bad jokes, eh? -Don't make bad jokes, eh?
-Is it a bomb?
Is it a bomb?
What's all the fuss?
I want to know what's in the west forest.
There's nothing there but a shack full of junk.
What do you see on the cameras?
There are no cameras, it's outside the property boundaries.
Don't tell me.
(Shinichi voice) Have you seen the smoke plume?
(Achiwa) Yes, let's go.
(Achiwa) That's the Satsuki Pavilion up there, where I'm taking you now.
Oooh!
(Achiwa) -Ah.
-(Achiwa) I feel a strange stench.
The other day they came to check the elevator.
It must be the stench of the lubricating oil they used.
Does it bother you?
No, and now, nothing's wrong.
I guess I'm a little nervous and a lot.
It's just so exciting, isn't it?
I can imagine how you must feel.
The truth is, I wouldn't have said it, that I would make it this far,
and I don't quite believe it, so I'm a little nervous.
-On the contrary.
-You must be calm.
My heart is about to burst out of my mouth.
I don't know what face she'll have to make at Heiji.
I don't even know what he'll say when I confess how I feel about him.
And that makes me nervous.
"I'm not going to lose. Whatever happens, I can't lose."
Stop, guys.
You can't come any closer.
-Inspector.
-What happened? -Yes.
-Yes.
-Was it an explosion?
There's a victim.
The body is mangled.
It will take a long time to identify him, it's impossible right now.
We understand.
The question is when and how the bomb got into the barracks.
Considering the situation,
it is likely that it was carried by the victim himself.
How!
"Did the bomb explode accidentally?"
Have him autopsied right away.
(Mobile)
This is Inspector Ayanokoji.
What is it, Kudo?
What is it, Kudo?
Oh!
Heiji, did you see what's here?
Yes.
Probably the victim's.
What's this?
It looks like a ring.
-Yes, look at this ring. -Yes, look at this ring.
-Did you find anything, fellas? -Yeah, it's a pretty big ring.
-It's a pretty big ring.
-Could be the victim's.
Yes.
You don't see them every day, so big.
"A big ring... Wait a minute."
(Conan's voice) Ah... Togo Kaieda.
Eh?
Isn't Togo Kaieda Mr. Achiwa's bodyguard?
Yes, I'm sure.
This ring is what he wore on the thumb of his left hand.
What's the meaning of this?
That the killer is Mr. Kaieda?
No.
If we hadn't found the ring,
we probably would have thought the victim of the explosion was Nagori.
Therefore, this explosion was a set-up...
to make us believe that he is dead in Nagori.
If with this bomb he wants us to believe that he has died in the explosion,
it means that he must have already sent the two letters
to the last two missing victims.
-Huh?
-There are no longer two.
I just got a call from Inspector Otaki.
President Achiwa's secretary has checked her email
and says she received a message this morning
with a letter from karuta attached.
(Heiji) So, only one letter is missing.
"Only one letter... and one game to dispute...?"
Eh?
(Heiji) Sure.
If Chairman Achiwa has received his letter this morning,
only one is missing.
And the last letter they couldn't send until now
because they didn't know who the recipient would be.
It can't be.
Inspector, someone check Kazuha Toyama's cell phone.
What is it?
Yes... But Heiji, I don't understand what's going on.
Why did it take the culprit so long to send the last letter?
Because until now he didn't know who would be the other finalist of the championship.
This means... the target...
are the three people from Satsuki Ward!
-Huh?
-I must apologize to you girls.
That said, I hope you will show all your talent...
and play a fantastic game.
Thank you, Mr. President.
(Reader: recites singer)
Ready, set... Long live the Kazuha!
"Kazuha, show him what you are capable of."
What have you found?

Have you received a letter from karuta?
Yes.
About a quarter of an hour ago.
It's one of Nagori's favorites.
-What?
-That confirms the suspicions.
Give the order to suspend the final immediately, okay?
(Shinishi voice) Hey, where are you going?
Follow me, Kudo.
With motorcycle we'll get there sooner.
(Shinishi voice) What?
Suspend the final immediately?
Okay, right away.
Yes, I'll call the pavilion right away.
-Oh!
-What's wrong? -What's wrong?
An earthquake.
Don't worry about anything, girls.
We continue...
(People: exclamations of disapproval)
-It must have been a breakdown.
-Come on.
What happened now?
A roll.
-No, the lights are on.
-Is it a blackout?
Yes.
Hold on tight.
Shit, they've already started.
Hey, Heiji.
How do you plan to get there, in the pavilion?
You're kidding, right?
Trust me, I had an idea.
(Achiwa: recites singer)
"I knew it. La Hojarasca hasn't moved at all."
"This means he'll let my favorite cards run."

(Ayanokoji) What a blaze!
What kind of fire is this?
We think some fuel has fed the flames.
Haven't the firefighters arrived yet?
The roads inside the complex
are too narrow for fire trucks.
And the disaster prevention system was disabled...
Yes... There's nothing to do...
Heiji.
Even though you think the killer is in Nagori?
No.
"There is only one man who has been able to re-register in Togo Kaieda.
"As a staff member of the association,
even though he had already left it, and give him the bomb."
"President Kensuke Achiwa."
What does he intend to do?
To commit suicide up there and take the girls with him?
He gives me, whatever he wants, I won't let him do it.
(Kazuha) "He has placed in the most inaccessible place,
"And the Momiji knows for a fact
that that's my favorite card, too."
"You want to take this card, don't you?
"Well, I won't give it to you. If I keep it, I'll win."
"I have to take it. I'll take it. It must be mine."
(garbled sounds)
"Shut up, shut up, shut up! Out of my ears, you useless noises!"
What are you doing, Kazuha?
You make half a fright, with this face.
-Ah!
-Did you have a fight with someone?
-Mm?
Permission to get up.
"Let's see. I can't face. I can't."
"The noise of the air conditioning, the rustle of the kimonos,
"the rustling of the cards,
the soft breathing and also... the beating of my heart."
"They are my allies."
"It's okay, I can let them into me."
Thank you.
"I just have to catch the right sound."
It was all a set-up by Mr. Achiwa to make us believe
that he was taking revenge on the Satsuki Association in Nagori.
He planned it all to mislead us.
Five years ago, Nagori challenged the Satsuki to a duel...
and, for some unknown reason..,
he showed up at her house the night before.
Mr. Achiwa told us that his wife had won,
but there was something strange.
You're talking about that article we saw at the hotel, right?
"Yes, it said in the newspaper that Mr. Achiwa always washed the car....
"The day before the Satsuki played an important game,
but in that picture it looked dirty."
The chairman didn't wash the car before the decisive duel
because he knew that Nagori would not show up.

It seems to me that I was the fastest.
No, I was faster and got there first.
The faster of the two knows better than anyone else who won.
"I didn't think this final would be so close."
What if the Satsuki had lost that preliminary game
that was played 5 years ago?
Oh, so much so.
That would be a compelling reason, wouldn't it?
Maybe she decided to silence Nagori
to protect the honor of the club.
And maybe there was some evidence left on the association's cards
and Mr. Yajima discovered it by reviewing old games.
But what can it prove, a deck of cards?
Maybe the Achiwa took a fight with the blood of Nagori
without putting on gloves.
Of course he did.
The fingerprints.
I didn't notice them either until I saw a photo they sent me.
It's possible that Mr. Achiwa's fingerprints are on the letters.
That's why en Yajima came up with the idea

to record a television report about the Satsuki Association.
In order to record images of the cards and use them as evidence.
And that's why the explosion at the studios
and the assassination of Mr. Yajima were the reason.
Of course they were.
But there's something I don't understand.
What's the point of continuing to kill the facility
where the karuta championship is being held?
It's quite possible that Nagori's body is hidden
somewhere in the Satsuki Pavilion.
You're right.
It's the perfect hiding place.
So he had all the crimes planned from the beginning.
Even if he had managed to frame Nagori
with this near-perfect plan,
if the body had turned up later,
the whole thing would have gone down the drain.
Yes.
Did you see it?

- "A trap letter."
-Oh!
Dang it.
The flames go way up.
But how do we do it?
We must get down at once.
We can't waste a second.
First we'll have to put out the fire.
Keep thinking until you can think of a way to put it out.
You don't want to...?
You're kidding, right?
Go ahead, Kudo!
(Heiji and Shinichi: call out)
Hurry up!
What's happened?
Come on, now you have to pump it up.
Hurry up, or we won't make it in time.
(Heiji and Shinichi:) -My God!
-A fire.
- (at once) Heiji!
-Don't go out.
Stay in here.
What are you doing here?
(Man) Look.
The course of the waterfall has changed.
-But what...?
How did this happen?
-It's a miracle.
Phew.
Looks like I managed to put out the fire in time...
I knew you'd make it.
Heiji.
I don't understand anything, what's wrong?
It's dangerous, I told you to stay inside.
Conan has come too?
What is the meaning of this?
What are you both doing here?
The quickest way to find out is to ask Mr. Achiwa.
(Momiji) I don't understand what you mean.
(Heiji) I advise you to stay behind me.
(Kazuha) Why do you have to stay behind you?
(Conan voice) Mr. Achiwa.
(Kazuha) What will happen, if the police analyze this fight?
Heiji, please explain to us what this is all about.
I came here because I wanted
this man to answer some questions about the case.
What is it?
It all started exactly one year ago,
when Momiji won the championship in this very pavilion.
The fight that Momiji had chosen for the finals
was very similar to the one used by her master Nagori
during the match against Satsuki.
Since master Nagori taught me how to play attack,
our favorite cards were the same.
But it would be too much of a coincidence if I had chosen exactly the same ones.
Well, this coincidence happened.
Look at the black marks
on the edges of these cards.
The late Mr. Yajima noticed that the stains had suddenly appeared.
that the marks had suddenly appeared 5 years earlier.
What do these black marks mean?
They are the fingerprints of the person
who took the letters with his hands stained with Nagori's blood.
Wait a minute.
Master Nagori's blood?
Mr. Nagori, who is considered missing for 5 years,
was actually murdered.
-But... How can that be!
-What? -What?
And when they analyze the fingerprints, they'll discover...
the man he killed in Nagori.
It's true, I'm busted.
I'm willing to confess.
In exchange, I ask you...
not to use the Satsuki Association letters as evidence.
Ah, now I see how it went.
Our association is very...
There was something I didn't quite understand,
but now it's clear to me.
The fingerprints on these letters
aren't yours, are they?
Of course they are.
There is no doubt that they are my fingerprints.
It's true that the culprits in the latest crimes that have been committed
are you and Togo Kaieda.
But the person who murdered Mr. Nagori 5 years ago
was not you.
It was his wife, wasn't it?
(Satsuki: sobs)
"When I saw that scene, I understood what had happened."
"In Nagori had challenged her and Satsuki had lost."
(Satsuki: cries)
"They had used one of the cassette tapes
we had saved for training."
Do you understand what this means?
Satsuki had listened to those tapes dozens of times.

Of course, that tape contained only one of many variants,
but she knew by heart
the order of the letters that were recited.
She was in a situation of absolute superiority.
And yet he defeated her.
Nagori's skills far exceeded our expectations.
Can you imagine the fear she must have felt, the Satsuki?
She was convinced that the next day she would suffer a humiliating defeat.
And it was that fear
that pushed her to make Nagori disappear forever.
"After that,
"My wife became an emotionless wreck...
and gradually disassociated herself from the Association."
"After two years, an illness took her away."
Therein lies the truth.
Please be sympathetic.
Stop!
Stop it!
It was all Nagori's fault.
If I hadn't humiliated Satsuki that night,
none of this would have happened.
He didn't want to humiliate her.
That's precisely why he went to see her the day before she confronted him.
What?
He once asked Master Nagori to tell me the reason
why he was so hostile to the Satsuki Association.
Enmity, you say?
Yes, that's what it must look like from the outside.
But, if we weren't enemies,
I could never play a game against her.
I want to win a game against her
to be worthy of her recognition and praise.
She was my first love.
Your... first love?
That's right.
According to what you told me,
Master Nagori started playing karuta because he admired Satsuki.
But he had been found to have an eye disease
and he could only continue playing for one more year.
I guess that's why his style became so aggressive.
Because he wanted to make the most of the little time he had left.
What he intended, then, was to show the Satsuki?
her skills and let her win the next day.
Then his disciples would have a reason
to join the Satsuki Association
when he lost his sight and could no longer guide us.
But she knew nothing of all this,
and she killed in Nagori in a panic.
Soc... I am a monster.
(Achiwa: cries)
Ouch.
My mother, what have I done?
-Oh!
-What was that?
Kazuha!
(Heiji) Kazuha!
(Heiji) -Yes.
But I can't get up.
-(man 1) Are you all right?
- (man 2) There are people up there.
- (man) The tower.
It will collapse!
Go up all in the elevator, hurry!
-(man) Yes.
-Momiji.
Hurry up.
-I'm staying here.
Leave me alone.
-Aixequi s, we have to go. -No way!
No way!
I won't let him die, yet.
Momiji.
Run, get in!
- (Heiji) Kazuha.
(Heiji) -Ah!
(Heiji) -Yes.
-Try to get here.
(Heiji) Hurry up.
Come on, a little more.
- (rumbling)
-I've got you.
Oh, shit.
Please, hold on.
Don't fall, yet!
Shit!
What? What? What? What?
This won't happen.
- (man 2) We're coming.
- (man) Are you okay?
Now it's gone hairy... Heiji!
He's about to collapse.
Get out of here!
Ah... (man) What do you mean?
Wait a minute, what's wrong?
Wait, don't go.
-Heiji.
- (wheels: squeaking)
-Come on, get in.
-Get in, run.
"Heiji. Kazuha."
"Please escape from up there."
-Yes.
-Heiji, look.
-Agafa't you feel it hard?
-Heiji, what's wrong?
You're kidding, right?
Don't tell me you intend to get to the other side in one jump.
No, I'm not kidding.
It's what I intend to do.
I don't believe it.
Are you out of your mind?
Can't you see it's too far?
Do you feel me, Heiji?
Wouldn't it be better if you jumped the lake directly?
It's out of the question.
If we jumped from so high up,
we'd splash into the water like concrete.
Hold on tight, Kazuha.
If you let go... I'll kill you.
Yes.
I'm not going to die...
in a place like this!
But it's... in Heiji!
There's something I have to tell you before I die, though.
That motorcycle....
Something meee!
Heiji!
Kazuha!
-Oh, it's about to fall.
-There are two people up ahead.
Are you okay, Kazuha?
Yes.
I've had enough of dramatic escapades.
(Where are they?
They've been saved.
They've been saved, that pair.
I thought we wouldn't get out.
-What?
-By the way, Heiji.

What did you say you were going to tell me?
What did you say you wanted to tell me?
I don't know... what you mean.
You just said... that you couldn't die before telling me something.
-And a radish!
-You didn't hear it right... -You didn't hear it right...
The training has helped me to sharpen my hearing even more.
If you have any complaints, let me know.
What's the matter?
-Don't run away.
-Not if I don't...
What were you supposed to tell me?
Speak at once, go on.
(Heiji) I have nothing more to say to you, me.
(They continue arguing)

Thank you for coming to say goodbye to us.
We are the ones who have to thank you.
By the way, what happened, with the karuta club?
The high school has recognized
that it's very commendable that we made it to the finals,
so, fortunately, we won't have to close.
Although it's a pity
that, in the end, I couldn't win the tournament...
Come here for a moment.
Kazuha...
-What are they doing now?
-Where are they going?
It's very ugly, telling secrets in each other's ear.
Yes, it is.
Really?
I took my favorite.
You finally picked that poem as your favorite card, then.
No, I didn't.
Not just because of the poem.
I chose it mostly because of the author's name.
Taira Kanemori.
Of the 100 names of poets,
this is the only one that is written with the same symbol as "Heiji".
That's why for me it's Heiji's letter.
Of course.
Then I will send him a picture with the poem.
And I'll tell him, "This is how I feel about you."
(Momiji) Will you send her this poem to confess your feelings?
This is not what we agreed on.
(Kazuha) Momiji.
How could you feel what we said?
You're not the only one with developed hearing.
Hey, hello, Momiji.
What are you doing here?
How come you've come?
I've come to propose, just as I promised I would.
Although Heiji was the first to confess his feelings for me.
-I have proof.
-What?
What are you talking about?
- (Ayumi) Oh.
They're holding their little finger.
-(Ayumi) This picture proves it.
(Mitsuhiko) It's the symbol of a solemn promise.
If you don't keep what you've promised, you must swallow 1,000 needles.
Stop, stop the cart.
I don't remember what I promised you.
"Next time we meet, I'll marry you. You wait for me."
What a ?!
"It's your bad luck that everyone remembers
the most awkward moments of his life..."
Now you will forget and pretend that this story never existed?
Mm?
Ah, I remember.
I know I told you.
"Don't cry. Another day we'll face each other again.
But the next time we meet, I'll drop by with you,
so you go train tea and wait for me.
...I'll drop by...
"I'll...
...with you," he says?
As she was a little girl, I didn't want to hurt her
and I tried to play, trying not to overdo it with her.
- "Yes, miss."
-Muga.
We're leaving.
Okay.
I'll make an exception today and let you go.
But for the record, I won't let
anyone take my trinity cards.
You better remember..., Kazuha.
You said you want to play karuta against the Kazuha again?
Excuse me, you were sleeping?
You know the 100 poems of karuta well, don't you?

Yes, I usually play with the family on New Year's Eve.
I just sent Shinichi a picture of the letter
of the letter "While I was wondering"
and he replied with the letter "A rock divides".
Do you know what he meant?
I don't remember anything...
"Although I am now separated from the person I love,
I am convinced that someday we will meet again."
"It's a love poem by Emperor Sutoku."
Hey, wait a minute, Sonoko.
"How romantic!"
These things are not forgotten.
