(Ayumi) I see you bought a lot of books today, Mr. Tamaki.
(Ayumi) I see you bought a lot of books today, Mr. Tamaki.
Yes.
I found a lot of very interesting things.
Well, well.
Au.
Let's go then.
(straining) Aaaah!
Aaah!
Eh?
Thank you very much.
I'll do just fine.
-We'll give you a hand.
-And now!
We'll be glad to.
You're very kind, guys.
Careful, they're heavy.
Will he be able to?
I don't want you to take it wrong.
Do not suffer.
If I have anything, it's enough.
If we help you unload the boxes together, we'll finish sooner.
Watch out.
It's too heavy for you.
AAAI...
Y-yes.
Thanks for helping me, Conan.
Whew.
We're finally done.
I can't thank you guys enough.
In exchange, I'll let you each pick a book, whatever you like best.
-Yes. -Yes.
-Really? -Yeah.
Yay!
And you, what about you, not in flights?
Sure you don't mind?
I mean... business-wise...
W-we do.
Kids don't have to worry about this kind of thing.
Come on, take any book you want and take it with you.
Yes.

"The whistle of a train among old books."
"Incredible!"
A first edition of "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes?"
How strong, I hadn't seen it until now.
(Think) "It's worth a fortune."
"I can't ask Mr. Tamaki to give it to me as a gift."
Hehe!
(Man) Here we go again, Father?
Where do you think we'll put them, all these books?
We already have the bookstore full to overflowing with books that don't sell.
When you find an old book, you have to seize the opportunity.
I am convinced that, sooner or later,
these books will fall into the hands of someone who wants them.
-Eh?
-That's not a book warehouse.
Oh.
Besides, to continue with the business we need money...
I hope you understand this, because if you don't...
Yes, of course I understand.
You're hopeless.
Eh?
How long have you been here?
Xxxt!
(man) Huh?
(Conan.
Hello, my pretties.
It's so good to see you again.
You've come to buy books, haven't you?
(Man) - Huh?
As a matter of fact, no.
-Huh? -Yeah.
Well, yes...
We helped your father to load some boxes and he gave us a book.
Shut up, Genta!
(Genta) W-what's the matter?
It's not a lie, it's what he promised us.
(Genta) - Yes.
-Is it true, what they say, father?
I find that you are very splendid.
You mustn't remember, we're up to our necks in water.
What do you want?
About it, Ichiro...
You've just come home from work, haven't you?
Since you're still wearing your apron...
No, I forgot my purse and came to pick it up.
Wow.
I hurried.
I'm sorry, Ichiro.
I always make you suffer.
If I knew you as much as you say, I'd close the bookstore at once.
I just don't...
You know what it is, what makes me angriest, of all this?
That you are indecisive!
Ah!
Watch out!
Aaah!
-Yes, don't worry.
-Are you all right, Ichiro?
The wood on the shelves has eaten away over the years.
This bookcase and your... it's already reached its limit.
Open your eyes, father.
Oh!
They're all tidy now.
Ah.
Thank you, boys.
Hm...
I guess not.
Mr. Tamaki hasn't opened today.
Come on, what are we waiting for?
Let's go to the park at once.
Yes, let's go.
Oooh!
-Oooh, they're so cool.
How beautiful!
We didn't know it yet, this park,
and we often come here, at Tamaki bookstore.
We've been there.

I have only recently discovered it myself.
Besides, you must know you have a secret.
You will stand still.
What secret?
The wheels of the locomotive move by themselves.
What?
How can that be?
But there are no rails!
You don't need it.
The wheels move, but the train doesn't move forward.
Aaah... And at what time can we see this?
It looks like it starts up twice a day, at 11 and 3 o'clock.
It's still a while before 3 o'clock.
And in the meantime, let's have a soccer game?
Teva, Conan!
Nice pass!
Teva.
Good save.
- (Ayumi) Yes.
- (Mitsuhiko) Are you ready, Ayumi?
(Mitsuhiko) Oh, sorry, huh.
(Ai) It'll be time soon.
What a thrill, huh?
Mitsuhiko, what's this you brought?
It's my father's camera.
I brought it because I want to take a picture
when the wheels of the machine start moving.
And you know how to operate such a good camera?
- (Ichiro) Guys.
-Hmm, sure.
Trust me.
-We want to see the locomotive running.
-What are you guys doing here?
-And you, Ichiro?
What are you doing here?
-Ah, very well.
Today I'm working the afternoon shift
and I went for a walk to make time.
"A leaf?"
Eh?
(Beep)
(Mitsuhiko) It was a blast, wasn't it?
(Mitsuhiko) Huh?
(Mitsuhiko) Oh!
(Genta) Brutal.
(Mitsuhiko) Oh!
(Mitsuhiko) My God!
(Genta) What?
M-Mother.
(Genta) Huh?
Oooooh!
No!
Father!
Thank you for coming.
I hope he recovers soon.
Your life is not in danger, I'm sure you'll get out.
What a rest.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
Do you?
"The clock stopped at 3 o'clock."
"Just as we were looking at the locomotive."
"That's probably why we didn't hear the rumble."
Oh!
"At first glance,
"I'd say the bottom shelf fell and knocked the others over,
which fell on top of each other like dominoes."
"The wood was old and badly decayed."
"I guess it would have happened sooner or later."
Eh?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Oh.
Come on, you guys.
It's dangerous, let him stay here, you'd better go.
-It's time for you to go home. -It's time for you to go home.
-It's just that...
Yes.
Hm?
Caram.
You came to see me?
Yes.
How are you, Mr. Tamaki?
I'm fine.
It's a mild concussion, I'll be sent home soon.
That's good, I'm very glad.
It's unfortunate that the shelves fell down, isn't it?
Yes, oh so much, yes.
But the most important thing for me is that, luckily,
none of my customers have taken it badly.
-Oh!
-It has been a divine punishment.
I say that because, in fact,
I had not planned to be in the bookstore at that time.
I went out to buy books and suddenly, when I was already halfway there, I realized that I had forgotten my book,
I realized that I had forgotten my purse.
I turned tail and you see, I ended up like this.
It's funny...
If I had listened to my son and had closed the bookstore....
What?
You want to close the bookstore?
I've been thinking for a long time that the time has come,
but I'm the way I am and it's hard for me to make decisions.
This accident has given me the push I needed.
Yes, I guess it's the best solution.
What a thing to say!
That bookcase is in a bad state of disrepair.
To bring it back to the way it looked when it first opened
it would have to be renovated from top to bottom,
and this work would cost a few million yen.
And it seems to me that they don't have it, so much money.
You are absolutely right, Ai.
And what will happen, with all the books they have?
It's a pity, but I'll have to auction them off.
That way, at least,
I'll know they'll go to people who want to have them.
Oh, by the way.
Would you like to see the photos?
We've taken a lot of pictures of the locomotive in the park next door.
Really?
Yes, of course, I want to see them.
What beautiful pictures!
(Pip, pip)
Oooh... This is the one I like the most of all.
Yeah, me too.
Hm?
Hm?
Let me have the camera for a moment.
Oh!
Huh? (Laughs)
What's the problem?
Hm.
Thank you for inviting us.
My father told me you went to see her at the hospital.
Yeah, it looks like she only has a mild concussion...
and that she'll be discharged very soon.
Yes.

Your father says he wants to close the bookstore.
Hm.
(Ouch) Well, you don't look very happy.
Eh?
You've been asking him to close it for a long time, haven't you?
- (woman) Ichiro.
-Yes, I know, but... -Oh!
(woman) Oh!
Michiko.
My girlfriend, I guess.
What does that "I guess" mean?
I'm Michiko Yoshikawa, nice to meet you.
Hello!
Come on, tell me what you're doing, everyone here.
They went to the hospital to see the father
and then they came to explain to me how he was.
That he's in the hospital?
I didn't know anything.
Yes, he had an accident at the bookstore.
But he's all right?
He told us they'd let him go home soon.
Is he sure?
He was lucky.
So, you're Ichiro's girlfriend?
Yes, that's right.
-You know, it's been a long time.
-We started dating 5 years ago.
What do you like most about Ichiro?
I'd love to know.
What a question, for being so small.
I don't know, I like him because he's a very nice guy.
And I love the devotion he has for his father.
Ah, he doesn't seem that way to me.
The other day we saw them arguing.
He's a bit clumsy, and even more so in front of his father.
I made it for you.
Hmm.
How nice!
I'd like to talk to you later, when you get home from work.
I'm not doing so well tonight.
Do you want to go see your father?
I'll come too.
Don't worry, it's just that I have to do some paperwork and prepare a lot of things.
-All right.
-It'll be better if we leave it for tomorrow.
Call me when you have a moment.
Au, have a good job.
Oh!
And don't worry about the place, okay?
Don't worry, there's no hurry.
Tell your father for me that I hope he gets well soon.
Yes.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
Which venue was she referring to, your girlfriend?
Hmm...
Michiko and I want to open our own coffee shop.
That's why I'm working here, to save a little and learn how to run the business.
But then, when you go,
Yujiro will be left alone in the bookstore, won't he?
That's why I wanted him to close it now, before I open up my own business
and I can't have him around to be there for him.
You already said that the other day, that, too.
How is it, that you care so much, that your father closes?
Hm?
The bookstore takes a lot of work,
and such a big person can't make so much effort.
He would have suffered too much if he had had to leave her working alone
in that dilapidated place.
(Ai) Thanks to this accident you had, then,
things are working out just the way you wanted them to, right?
-Stop it at once!
-Now you'll be calmer.
-Really?
-You're overdoing it a little, aren't you?
-Oh...
-I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have come in.
It's dangerous.
Eh?
Conan... What the...?
Hello, Ichiro.
We didn't expect to find you here at this hour.
Ah.
It's just that this afternoon,
while I was here in the park with you, I lost something.
No flashlight?
That's why I came back.
And what are you doing, hanging around the park?
It's already dark, I should go back home.
It was you who caused the accident at the bookstore, wasn't it?
Was it me?
Accidents like this afternoon's don't just happen,
there must be a trigger.
Do a little memory.
I don't understand what this is all about.
In the bookshelf at the back of the room
there wasn't a single book, was there?
So it was the one that weighed the least.
Do you think that an empty shelf
could have knocked down all the other shelves, which were full of books?
It's true, it's impossible.
Well, it doesn't seem so extraordinary to me, really.
You saw that the wood on those shelves is so badly decayed,
that it crumbles.
Besides, at the time of the accident, I was...
Oh.
You were the park with us, weren't you?
This picture was taken at 3 o'clock,
when the locomotive started up.
The clock in the bookstore stopped at 3 o'clock.
Therefore, the bookshelves have fallen at the same time.
Yes.
That's why it's impossible for me to go to the bookstore when they went down,
it's more than obvious.
Directly it is impossible, unless you used a trick.
Take a good look at this photo.
A trick, you say?
What kind of trick?
Hm?
It's an ordinary group photo.
It's several successive photographs,

is made in burst mode.
Now you will see the whole sequence.
You look at the movements of the butterfly
on the side of the screen.
Oh.
Doesn't it move naturally?
It's weird that it stops flapping its wings as it flies,
and in the photo below it seems to be shooting upwards.
That's because the butterfly is resting on top of an invisible thread
that has broken and made it jump upwards.
Ichiro.
You have stretched a thread between the locomotive's wheels
and the bottom shelf, right?
At 3 o'clock,
when the locomotive started up and the wheels began to turn...
Oooh!
(Beep)
So, the shelves would be falling on top of each other.
Then, the thread continued to wrap itself around the wheel...
until it broke and the butterfly flew off.
This afternoon, when you came to greet us,
you had a leaf on your shirt, on your shoulder.
It's because you went into the trees to install the thread, isn't it?
And now!
So, show us what you're hiding in the hand behind your back.
If my theory is correct, what you're trying to hide is evidence
that the shelves have not been accidentally knocked over.
Isn't that right?
You've always been so nice to us,
I can't believe you'd do such a terrible thing.
-Huh?
-It's a lie, isn't it?
Oh!
There are burnt pieces and frayed pieces.
"I'm sure they'll match the marks
I've seen before on the shelves."
Enough of this comedy.
Yes, that was me.
That's a lie.
There's no way you tried to kill your father, I don't buy it.
Mitsuhiko, I didn't mean to kill him.
Mr. Tamaki told us earlier.
It wasn't supposed to be at that time,
He came back because he forgot something.
Ah... Now that you mention it, it's true.
Ichiro just wanted to smash the shelves.
But, unfortunately, his father was there and he got hurt.
It was silly, I don't know how I could have done it.
Then why did you do it, if I may ask, eh?
Because I didn't want the father to continue to lose his health in this business.
Oh.
I tried to convince him and he wouldn't listen to me.
But if he was left without a bookstore, he would have to close down.
"Finally, the Ichiro decided to confess what he had done...
and turned himself in to the police."

Isn't this where Tamaki's bookstore used to be?
Yes, I'm sure it was here.
Hello, welcome.
Look, the kids from that day.
And another one.
Ah, Mr. Tamaki...
I thank you for all you've done for us.
-Hello, my pretties.
-Ichiro.
You were finally able to open the cafe you wanted.
Yes.
The three of us talked it over and decided it would be the best solution.
I love it, this coffee shop.
Don't you think it's great too, Ai?
Yes, I think it's not bad.
Do you?
Thanks, then.
"At first, the police arrested Ichiro,
"but his father understood why he had done it...
and didn't report it."
"So, he was immediately released without charge."
By the way...
This is for you.
So many things happened that day, I couldn't give you.
"It can't be."
Yes.
Are you sure I can stay?
What's up?
Hurray!
-Me too.
-I want that one too.
E-eh?
Leave me alone, you already have yours.
(I want your book!
What?
No, it's mine!
Let me see it!
-You're cooler.
-Come on, don't fight.
Leave me alone!
I want you to change me for me!
Hm?
Where does that little boy stop now?
Today Conan went out with Ay and the others.
Oh!
Aaaah!
Yes.
He's badly wounded, but he's still breathing.
Eh?
"Don't miss the next episode:
'On Conan falling off a cliff (part one)'."
