"The Sonoko invites in Makoto to the Suzuki residence.
"To introduce him to her parents,
"but it turns out that Tomoko, her mother,
"finds that the boy does not do for her daughter
nor does he fit into the future plans she has for her."
"And when in Makoto sees that the Sonoko gets excited talking about the Kaito Kid..."
-Can you tell what happens?
- (thinks) "In Kaito Kid?"
Mr. Suzuki...
Good evening, my name Makoto Kyogoku, I'm the boy who goes out with Sonoko.
-Ah.
-Nice to greet you.
So you're Sonoko's boyfriend...
And what do you want to tell me?
I know that they want to steal a very valuable jewel.
That's why I've come here to offer you my help as a watchman.
I ask your permission to become part of the security service
in charge of guarding the jewel.
(Mobile)
Well, this is it, yes, the nano.
And I have already seen that he knows how to karate.
He not only knows strength.
He has been world champion 400 consecutive times.
He is the prince of kicks.
He is invincible.
Hm?
How?
400 times... in a row?
(Man) You don't want me to put any agent in the room where the jewel will be exhibited?
And may I know why?
If the Kaito Kid has already said that he would come to steal it!
Mr. Suzuki called me and told me that if we put them head....
it would interfere with the new security system and would be a problem.
What's that?
He sent you a video?
Wow!
A lone man surrounded by armed security agents?
Evidently, the guns are BB guns.
Still, he's surrounded by many men.
And, if you notice, the one in the middle, on top,
is wearing a gas mask that makes it difficult for him to see.
It's easy to deduce that he can't dodge all the pellets, right?
"It's called Makoto Kyogoku. And it's the best security system in the world."
"The Tomoko proposes a bet on Makoto
and, simultaneously, the Kaito Kid is proposing another one on the Sonoko."
"What a paradox!"
"The sun warms with a dazzling radiance."
"A spectacle of deductions that engages."
"What strategy will you follow, in Kaito Kid,
to confront the best security system in the world?"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a kid, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"In Kaito Kid vs. in Makoto Kyogoku (second part)."
You have to be strong, you promise?
Yes, I promise.
You will come out.
Because you are very good.
Yes, I'll protect the jewel with my hands and my life.
-Oh.
-Come on, come on, Sonoko.
She's right.
I know you're going out too.
And I trust you won't deceive me, that I can count on your word.
Yes, you can,
you can count on it.
I know it.
And I'm already looking forward to checking it out.
(Tomoko voice) "Would you be willing to make a bet with me?"
A-a bet?
Yes, if you manage to protect the jewel,
I'll accept that it's a sign of destiny,
that fate wants you to date Sonoko.
And I promise you that I will give you a free hand to date her.
But if you fail, if you don't get out....
and the thief finally manages to get hold of the jewel,
you will break up with the Sonoko immediately,
no questions, no explanations;
Do you understand me?
Oh...
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
(Man) What what?
That a letter has arrived from the Kaito Kid here at the museum?
And that it's also addressed to this kid, in Makoto?
Yes.
But not one, no.
Almost 100. All of them.

(Man) 100 letters?
And they must also approach the fire to read them.
What did you think?
We can't just warm up 100 letters one by one, now.
(Man) -Huh?
-Agent.
Can we have candles and candlesticks, please?
I think we can save time if we heat the ink with candles.
You heard the man.
Somebody get candles and candlesticks.
What?
But what is this?
"I never let go of the target I've set for myself
because I am the best thief in the world."
Nothing is impossible for the Silver Moon Wizard.
That my adversary is the best security system in the world?"
He mocks us.
It's over!
No more letters!
It doesn't say anything worth reading here!
-Huh?
-Please, stand back.
Stand back, please.
You can't go beyond the distance marked by the agents.
He-he...
"Why do they call it an exhibit if no one can see anything?"
"But what is this? What are all these letters?"
"I don't know if they're to mislead Makoto
and get him to let his guard down or if they're for..."
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
(PA) "Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to close the museum."
"Please everyone go to the exit. We are closing the museum."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come to close the museum."
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
He-he-he-he!
What, are you ready, Kaito Kid?
I'm waiting for you here.
And I can't wait to make you pay for everything you've done to me over the years.
Well, not me, him.
Ha-ha-ha!
"I have a bad feeling,
it seems to me that the thief has set him up."
Eh?
Hey, what's the matter, Conan?
Ah, h-hello, Ran.
What a face you make!
Aah!
Is it the way I'm dressed, maybe?
Have I chosen a dress that's too conventional, or what?
Thank you very much.
I'm so glad.
Ah, no.
I find it suits you very well.
He-he!
"Conventional? But it's low-cut!"
-Hm?
-Makoto, look!
Oh!
What do you think of this dress I've chosen?
Don't let your guard down, eh?
Oh!
No.
Be alert.
It's five minutes to the appointed time.
Hurry up.
Everyone out of the room.
From now on, and until the danger has passed,
I will consider anyone who enters here an enemy.
and I will attack him with all my might.
Eh?
-A-an enemy?
-Wow-ow.
Very well, then.
We'll leave it in your hands, then.
Attention.
Do not let anyone into the room, not even us.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir!
I'm going to the washroom for a moment.
Eh?
Hey.
This in the bag are the letters you sent in Kid, right?
There's a lot of them, right?
Yes.
Someone from the Post Office must have come expressly to take them, right?
I don't know;
what I can tell you is that Miss Sonoko told me...
that someone gave them directly to her a moment ago.
"The Sonoko?"
She was wearing this dress, when you gave her the letters?
-Very good, guys.
Good job!
-Huh?
Yes.
She told me that after she changed
he went outside to see how things were going
and found a factor he knows personally.
Huh?
Would you let me look at them for a moment, please?
I don't even have to take them out of the bag.
But-but what are you doing?
"You can't see anything. Not even in the black light."
"That means... It can't be! What if the Sonoko...?"
Oh!
The light's gone.
Oh! (Clock: tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.
(Clock: tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...)
(Thinking) "Forgive me. Forgive me, Makoto."
Kaito Kid!
Kaito Kid!
In the whole museum?
Oh!
"Eh? I see something glowing. All the masks have it."
"It looks like fluorescent paint."
What's that?
Something's rolling.
Watch out!
No.
Ran.
Don't come any closer!
-Ah! -Ah!
-Ah! -Ah!
Calm down, please.
It's a very common anesthetic gas.
If everyone wears masks, nothing will happen to us.
Ah!
-Ah! -Ah!
-Ah!
No!
This is the Kid's thing!
(Sonoko) Ah!
(Sonoko) Aaaaah!
(Sonoko) Oh!
"It's the Sonoko's voice."
- (Sonoko) Makoto, please!
(Sonoko) Open up!
- (Door: knock)
(Door: knock)
(Door: knock) Oh!
Makoto!
Sonoko, what are you doing here?
It's just that the Kaito Kid just left the museum in the dark
and released anesthetic gas in all the rooms.
Good thing one of the agents gave me one of these gas masks.
and I didn't fall asleep.

But, taking advantage of the darkness, he shot all the policemen?
with his card gun and made them drop their masks.
IIH!
What?
How can this be?
I saw that all the masks had a spot of fluorescent paint on them.
I would say that the KID used them
to be able to aim at the exact spot in the dark.
This means that he's definitely hanging around here.
-Huh?
-No, no.
I'd say he's already fled.
It looks like, before the electricity was cut off,
another letter from him arrived at the museum saying he already had the jewel.
That can't be true.
You can see for yourself that I'm wearing it around my neck, I haven't taken it off at any time.
I believe you, but we should go look in a place where there is enough light to check if it is the real thing.
to check if it's the real thing.
It's hard to see here,
only with the moonlight coming through the window.
Wait a minute.
Let's look at it with a candle.
Wow.
It's a good thing they brought the cards to warm them up.
If I'm not mistaken, the stone was green, right?
Oh!
Now it's red.
It's bright red.
So... it's true that you have changed it for a fake one.
But... I don't get it.
How can it be!?
How did he do it?
I don't know, but, for the moment,
I'd better take this... to the police.
I'll take it to the police.
And, in the meantime, why don't you keep an eye...
that nothing happens to the policemen who have fallen asleep with the gas?
Ah!
Oh! (gasps)
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
you're not Sonoko, are you?
What are you saying, man?
Of course it's me!
It's the jewel, it's a fake.
I am the Sonoko.
Oh!
The jewel is not a fake.
Conan!
The jewel is an alexandrite.
And the alexandrite is a stone with a deep blue-green color
when viewed in sunlight, which in normal electric light,
like the one in the museum, it can take on a dark green hue.
If exposed to incandescent light or the heat of a flame,
it turns a bright red color.
This is one of its peculiar characteristics.
That is why the KID has sent so many letters without content:
To make sure there would be candles in the room.
Then you disguised yourself as Sonoko
and made it look like you were meeting a letter carrier.
It was all a lie.
The letters were already here.
You had already taken care to hide them in the museum beforehand.
You couldn't risk mailing them,
because if, for some reason, they didn't arrive on time,
your plan would not have worked.
And I found out that none of the envelopes have the bar codes on them
that the Post Office prints to sort and deliver them.
This code is printed with a special ink
that can only be seen with black light.
But what do you mean?
Are you implying that in the KID I strip naked
to take my clothes and dress up as me?
No.
The Sonoko has voluntarily taken off her costume and given it to you.
She has done it to follow the bet you yourself proposed to her.
A bet?
Yes, they gambled to see if you would be able to realize...
that the Sonoko... was the Kaito Kid in disguise.
Ah!
"No! He dodged me!"
"Oops!"
I don't know.
Where is it?
Where did he go?
Oh!
Huh?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
The Green Emperor is already mine.
Oh! (Laughs)
I bet it hurts you now that you didn't learn to fly,
because it would have done you more service than karate.
And that's because you're the "best security system in the world".
Wow!
Eh?
Get out of here.
Iah!
IIH!
(Kid) "Do you want to knock down the pillar with your fists?"
(Kid) "What are you doing? Do you want to collapse the roof by punching this pillar?"
"What a monster! It's okay for me to leave."
Iah!
Oh!
"How strong!"
Oh!
"It flew?"
"It sure is the best security system in the world."
Come on.
Now give me back my joy.
And while you're at it, give me back the Sonoko's heart, too.
Yes.
Since the jewel is not what I really wanted,
I can give it back to you today, I don't mind.
But Sonoko's heart can't be, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for what?
Because something I don't have, it's impossible for me to give it back to you.
Because when you proposed to her to enter this game...
I-I don't know.
I don't see it clearly.
But I accept.
I accept, but on one condition: that you don't hurt her.
The week has a very important karate tournament.
(Who's here?
B-but it's the Kaito Kid!
Look where, you.

I see that in the end my visit could not be kept a secret.
You will have to invent a credible explanation for your little friend,
and especially for that little boy with the glasses.
I am very sorry for you,
because in the end I see that you did hurt your hands a bit.
I think it can be considered...
...that I lost the bet with Sonoko.

(Mr. Suzuki) What?
Don't tell me he had the nerve to take off your clothes...
and lock you in the toilets all this time?
-Yes, more or less.
-He told me.
Did he do that to you?
What a face!
He doesn't even respect women, this one.
"That's what the Kid told you to say...
so you can't be considered his accomplice."
So the fluorescent paint marks on the gas masks...
on the gas masks were made by...
Good job, guys!
Grrr!
Right under our noses!
I can't stand it!
But you delivered.
You've protected the jewel, and you've done very well, boy.
I don't know.
I wouldn't say that much, because the Kaito Kid has escaped.
I apologize.
And now!
You don't have to apologize for anything.
So that next time I'm sure... we'll catch her.
And so much.
Next time she won't get away.
That's the way I like it, kid.
That's the ideal attitude
of the best security system I've ever had.
He's a proper boy, this Makoto, don't you find, queen?
Yes.
He's honest and unsophisticated.
But he's also a polite and very strong young man.
He's one of those men who make you dream.
Eh?
I have to apologize, Makoto.
For putting you to the test like this.
-But tell me something.
-Don't suffer.
When did you realize, it was the Kaito Kid in disguise and not me?
What?
I know that!
Surely you've seen that I'm much prettier.
What?
Say?
-Well... the truth...
-Is that why?
Look, actually...
Hm?
(whispers)
What?
That you've noticed because you've seen
that his index finger is longer than mine?
But how can that be?
And that's the only difference you noticed?
Yes.
It's just that I have the habit of observing attentively all the details
of my adversaries with a quick glance.
Well, you must have seen some other difference...
Like now that I have a purer heart.
Tell me, go on.
The purest... heart?
Yes, the most candid and innocent heart and something else.
-Do you have to think about it so much?
He-he-he!
-What a rage!
-Stop-sorry, I'm sorry.
"The truth is that they say that, due to a hormonal issue,
women have a longer index finger than the ring finger."
"And men, the other way around. Although you can see that there are many exceptions."
Ah.
I have a longer ring finger!
Mm-mm-mm-mm!
"There must have been an accident, here."
"The plant that makes these flowers..."
Which I don't have.
I mean that.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You mean you don't have the...?
"The stench I felt was coming from here."
Especially don't tell anyone, I'm embarrassed.
I- Sure, no one.
"Don't miss the next episode:
'A love story between cops (the confession)'."
