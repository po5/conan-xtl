Waiting does not get things started sooner.
We take a step into the future.
The countdown of love and deductions begins!
What is the truth
that doesn't show up in the karaoke security camera images?
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and is Detective Conan!
Kaze ni makaseta kokoro no ibasho,

-Ouch...- Yeah!
-Maai...- Yeah!

Oe, oh...

"The dead angle of karaoke, (part one)."
(Children: laughter)
Look what an animal, this one here!
I'm dying laughing!
It looks like Genta!
(They laugh)
If you're looking for mystery novels, they're on that shelf over there.
Great, thanks!
(Think) "It's here!"
It's Kaori Shinmei's new mystery novel,
"The Night Identification"!
There's only one copy left... What a filly!
"It's The Eisuke Hondo!"
Ho-hello, Conan.
How are we doing?
We're doing fine.
Conan!
What are you doing here?
Look at you!
I hit you, you bunch of kids!
You've come to read comics in the bookstore...
having folded from school, eh?
"Ah, he's talking to them."
Surely it's you two, the ones he's come to read comics!
I'm sorry to say no...
We've come to buy some books
that we need to prepare for our high school exams.
Now that the exams are coming up,
they want to do the work they haven't done all year...
They always do things in a hurry.
It's true! What responsible children!
By the way, Eisuke, I didn't know you were back at school.
I'd heard you hadn't been to class for a while.
Yes, I have.
Yes!
Today's the first day.
He's been recovering from an illness.
That's right!
He was lovesick!
He wasn't lovesick, it was an ordinary illness!
Wow!
This guy is the famous Eisuke Hondo?
Yes.
"He's the boy who came to the high school
"On the trail of Rena Mizunashi,
"an anchorwoman identical to her sister."
"In the end, it turned out that Rena was his sister.
"a CIA spy
"who had infiltrated the organization of the men in black,
"the ones who made me swallow the poison that shrunk my body."
Because she knew her sister's secret,
the FBI offered him protection, but...
If he's back in high school, it means...
he has waived the witness protection program.
Wow!
Now that I look at it, this book is the first volume!
(Sighs)
It remains for you to do it, because I don't want to make the collection.
But... they say that the second and last volume will be released next month.
I can't wait that long!
I don't like to feel tied down or dependent on time.
Buy-you.
Look!
Isn't that the book the professor recommended?
Mm?
Yes!
And it's good value!
You should buy it too, Eisuke.
The questions for the next exam will come out of this book!
Buy it yourself.
Because it seems to me... that I won't need it.
That's right, because you always get good grades, eh?
As you wish, but I'm not going to leave it with you before the exam,
even if you ask me on your knees!
See you tomorrow, Conan!
Goodbye, Ay!
(Mitsuhiko) See you tomorrow!
(Genta) Remember to forget to do your homework!
You too!
Look 50 meters back,
by the supermarket drink machine.
It seems to me that there's a man following us.
Yes, he's been following us since we left the bookstore.
I don't know who it is yet,
but I can assure you it's none of the men in black.
Yes, you are right.
They don't use such clumsy surveillance methods.
Considering the situation, it can only come from somewhere else.

He must be an FBI agent guarding the Eisuke Hondo.
Could be.
At the distance he is,
he can be both a lookout and a bodyguard.
If we want our normal lives back,
this army of vultures had better hurry up
to catch the men in black.
Come to think of it,
we should go celebrate your return to school, right, Eisuke?
I'm all for it!
You bet!
Seriously, girls.
We don't need to celebrate.
Hey, what do you think?
You don't want us to toast to your health, or what?
It's not that... I'd say no.
Why don't we go to have a snack
the new bakery in front of the station?
It's just that I don't really like cakes.
Well, we'd better go
at the hamburger place in district 4, the usual one.
Yes, why not?
I hear they have finger-licking spicy chicken now!
It's just that I don't like spicy food.
-I didn't know you were so prissy!
So, there's only one option left.
I know a place where I assure you we'll have a great time!
(At the same time) Those tears, the summer breeze....,
memories of a few months that will never come back...
If your dream comes...
"We finally went to the karaoke! And Haibara was spared."
How?
You mean the guys who just walked in with a little boy?
Yes... Could you do me a favor and let me know when they come out?
It's just that the last time I came
I missed something in the cabin where these guys are.
But I don't know that we've found any missing objects here.
-It's just that my friend hid it to play a joke on me,
that's why you didn't find it.
In the meantime, I'll wait in another booth and sing for a while.
(Desafina) Think that you'll have to walk, too.
only this way you'll be able to get ahead.
If your dream comes to an end
at dawn, the sun, for you, will shine again!
Well done, Conan!
Very good, Conan!
(Think) "With these cries, he looks like a scalded cat."
Oops!
Where is Eisuke?
He's gone out to go to the toilet.
Look, we've already got him here.
Hurry up!
It's your turn to sing the next song.
Oops, wow!
Eh? What do you want?
It's just that... Ah, this is booth number 3!
I made a mistake.
Sorry, girls.
Ah!
Oh!
(groans) Ah!
(groans)
Did you hurt yourself, mate?
Ah... (groans) Sorry, it was my fault... I'm...
Be careful.
Isn't it taking too long, that Eisuke's handyman?
Yes...
-You came alone, sir? -Yes, he did.
That's good.
Well, I'll tell him...
(thinks) "Has the karaoke come alone after fishing? How strange!"
What a stick!
It's the second time he goes to the bathroom.
And he is the protagonist of the celebration!
Maybe he is not yet fully recovered....
A little while ago, he was in bad shape.
You're right.
Ah... Look at this.
He's here.
Not feeling well, Eisuke?
You look so pale!
Yes, it's all right.
If you're not feeling well, we'll go home whenever you want.
Maybe yes... we should get out of here...
-Yes, we have to go! -Yes, we have to go! - (phone: ring)
(ring)
-Yes.
Hello? - (boy) "You have 5 minutes left."
(Takagi) According to the driver's license he had on him,
the victim was Mr. Tatsumi Moniwa, 46 years old.
Here!
(Takagi) -He was hit several times in the head with a blunt weapon
until the man died.
She was beaten to death.
But how come she's wearing her coat?
I imagine that the culprit must have put it on
so as not to get splashed with blood.
He left nothing but...
Inspector!
I found this on the victim's coat.
Oh, my goodness!
It's a camera.
What can you tell me?
It's a camera like the ones from before, we'll have to develop the cart.
Chiba!
Yes, I'm coming.
Take this camera cart to be developed immediately.
Right away.
If I'm not mistaken, you must be the karaoke receptionist...
and the person who discovered the victim's corpse.
Myself.
When the victim arrived at the karaoke, was he alone or accompanied?
He came alone, he didn't have any companions...,
but he asked me for a rather strange favor.
And what favor was that? Oh!
He asked me to tell you

when these 3 boys who had entered the cabin accompanied by a child
came out of the booth.
(All) What?
He wanted you to tell him when they came out?
Did he explain why?
He told me that the last time he came in....
"He forgot something in the cabin where these went,
"And he wanted to look for it when they left."
Did he specify what it was, what he had forgotten?
No.
When I went in to let him know these guys were leaving,
I found him dead.
"No, I hadn't forgotten anything."
"The only thing he wanted was not to lose track of us.
"When we were leaving the karaoke
"To continue to follow us as before."
"The only motives a person can have for following another person
"Are either to keep an eye on them or to try to protect them."
"Yes..."
"If this man was an FBI agent,
"who was on a mission to follow us,
"The prime suspect... for committing the crime is his target,
"That is, the person he was following: Eisuke Hondo."
"Earlier he said that he didn't like to feel tied down,
"And when he came back from the washroom
"He behaved very strangely."
"However, it could also be that he had seen something important...
"Related to the murder that has just been committed."
From the time the victim entered the cabin
until you came to warn her,
approximately how many people left the karaoke booth?
No one left, but several new customers came in.
First came these 3 boys accompanied by the child,
and they entered booth 3.
Right after that, the man who had died appeared,
who was in booth 5,
and after a while it seems to me that...
the dark-haired man and his companion entered cabin 4.
Then this guy arrived, from cabin 2,
and finally the older gentleman arrived,
and I've assigned him to booth number 1.
Well, then, we can be sure...
that the murderer has stayed inside the karaoke room
after having committed the crime.
-What? -What do you mean?
That he suspects us?
No, and now, excuse me, gentlemen.
But you should tell us your names and surnames, just in case.
Yes, of course.
My name is Kyoto Honma.
My name is Konjo Arimoto.
And I call myself... Kunio Tamai.
Let's see, let's recap.
The outline would be something like this. Yes.
Oooh.
Wait... just a moment, Inspector!
Earlier, you said that the dark-haired man was accompanied, right?
Yes.
This gentleman arrived with someone else.
Yes, that's right.
The person who came with me is lying on the sofa in the cabin.
You didn't wake up yet, did you?
No.
I'm sorry, uh...
She's losing her voice, isn't she?
Yeah, she's like a soup,
but he wanted to sing and he's lost his voice.
But he didn't come out of the booth,
so it has nothing to do with this case.
Yes, but if we don't have anything to prove it, we can't...
How do you want me to prove it to you?
Are you sure you're all right, Eisuke?
You don't look so good.
Y... yes.
Stop it, boy!
You look guilty, don't tell me you killed her!
I didn't kill anyone!
But I've seen everything!
What did you see?
When I was coming back from the toilet for the second time, I went to the wrong door...
and I-I went into the dark man's cabin...
-So... Uh... - Then what?
The... the... the... I saw them...
fe-fe-fe... making each other a petóóóóóóó!
(At the same time) What?
It was too strong a scene for a young man.
Not only for a young man, and for everything else!
What?!
That it is forbidden to kiss in a karaoke booth?
I did not say that normal couples can not kiss each other,
but, of course, the nano was surprised to see two men kissing...
What?
Don't suffer, we have nothing against... Nothing...
Impertinent!
I am a woman!
What...?
U...... na...
...woman?
Ah... I can see that.
Stop it.
No wonder they mistook him for a man,
she's a muscle freak, like me.
Wow!
Now I understand everything.
What a break!
The truth is that you have left me a little worried
when... I saw you so upset.
Ah...
That's good... that was it.
Yes.
Thank you, Ran.

"You and I still have unfinished business."
Do you want to take a look at the images
recorded by the security camera?
The booth where the customer who died did not come out,
but you'll be able to find out who came out of his booth
and at what time he left.
Oh!
Now one comes out.
The first one was Mr. Honma, from booth 2.
How is it that he went to the victim's booth
and disappeared from the screen?
I went to the washroom!
You know, to get to the washroom you also have to go there.
The next one was Eisuke.
I also went to the toilet.
Mr. Honma and I met when he was coming out of the washroom.
That's right.
(Takagi) That's him, he'll be right back.
Then Mr. Arimoto, from cabin 4, came out.
Yes, he was going to the bathroom.
Later, Mr. Tamai came out of booth 1.
Did he also go to the toilet?
No, I went out to buy tobacco,
but it turns out that the brand I normally buy was out of stock.
and I had to come back empty-handed.
(Takagi) Yes, he came back after 2 minutes.
And that's Mr. Arimoto coming back from the toilet.
The Eisuke hasn't come back yet, has he? I'd say no.
Let's advance the tape a little.
Yes.
That's him, he's coming back!
As you recognized earlier,
he got lost and entered the side booth by mistake.
Yes.
When Eisuke returns to his booth,
the receptionist appears in the images.
Yes, of course.
I explained it to you before.
I went to warn the client who had been murdered
to tell him that the boys were about to leave.
I might as well have taken the opportunity to kill him then.
I don't believe it.
I didn't believe it, did I?
I ran out of my booth
when I heard the receptionist scream,
and the victim's blood was almost dry.
Ah.
Got it.
It's true.
The receptionist went over to the victim's booth
and, after only a minute,
Conan ran out of his booth.
This means that the suspects are... Eisuke...
and the other 3 customers.
We will question them all 4 separately.
I have to ask you
each of you to wait at the door of your booth.
We have to search them for something.
And may I ask what you're looking for?
The murder weapon.
We still haven't found the blunt object
that the killer used to beat Mr. Moniwa to death.
"Yes..."
"The suspects are the 4 customers
"that the security camera has recorded
"going in and out of their booths:
"Mr. Tamai, from booth 1,
"Mr. Honma, from booth 3,
"Mr. Arimoto, from booth 4...
"And... the Eisuke."
"One of them has murdered Mr. Moniwa...
"By hitting him on the head with a blunt object,
"But the weapon has disappeared from the scene of the crime."
"Perhaps the culprit has taken it away."
"Mr. Moniwa had been following us on the sly for some time."
"If it was an FBI agent who was watching him or protecting him.
"Eisuke must have been fed up and had motive to kill him."
"But... what if the victim was not an FBI agent?"
"Who died...Mr. Moniwa?"
What-what does all this mean?
But these are our photos!
The gun... it's nowhere.
"Somewhere in this karaoke room there must be... the murder weapon!"
It's obvious that the killer is the guy with the round glasses!
What?
I don't...
(Sonoko voice) I know where it is, the murder weapon.
(Sonoko voice) Eh?
Sonoko!
It's a burst of inspiration!
Don't miss the next episode!
