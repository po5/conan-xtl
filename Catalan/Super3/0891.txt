"A mysterious character named Komakichi Kurataya.
"has sent a letter to Kogoro
to tell him that he must deliver a family treasure."
"La Ran and I want to accompany him in Yamaguchi Prefecture."
"I'll wait for her at 3 p.m. in front of the fox statue,
"at Yuda-Onsen Station.
Komakichi Kurataya."
What are you betting that she will give me a priceless treasure?!
Father, please be more discreet.
Eh?
-What nonsense!
-What do you say about a treasure?
Gee, how serious it tastes to me.
I didn't want to bother anyone.
You're a case.
Ouch...
Finally, we've arrived in Yamaguchi!
We didn't meet until 3 o'clock. It'll be a while yet.
Well, bird.
We're going sightseeing, aren't we?
There are many things to see in Yamaguchi,
such as historical monuments of the Bakumatsu Revolution and Restoration
as well as remnants of the Industrial Revolution.
Hm-hm-hm...
-Oops.
-Hm?
E-excuse me. You're so attractive, I couldn't help but follow you.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Aren't you Mr. Kogoro Mouri?
-Oh, of course I am!
-Huh?
You're the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
Wow.
It's an honor to have met me on the street, Mr. Mouri.
And now, it's an honor for me.
Oh, by the way, I'm Asuka Natsume,
from the Yamaguchi News Agency.
Yamaguchi News Agency?
We post local news on an internet portal.
What are you doing here?
Don't tell me you've come to investigate a case.
Father.
Well, the truth is...
What is it?
Weren't you asked for absolute discretion, a la carte?
You're right, I didn't remember.
Well, no, today I just came for sightseeing.
My daughter Ran and the kid with the glasses wanted to come here at all costs.
and I was sick of hearing them.
Sightseeing, you say?
Gee, I'd be so happy if you'd let me be your guide.
-Yes.
-What?
Are you sure?
Well, thank you very much.
This escapade looks better than I expected.
(Think: Shinichi voice) "When he sees a beautiful woman, he doesn't know how to say no."
"A new day begins with splendid sunshine."
"It's the time for love and mysteries."
"An attractive journalist and Yamaguchi's treasure."
"This combination cannot end well."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The tour of mysteries: the Bakumatsu Revolution (Yamaguchi's part)."
(Asuka) During the Muromachi period,
the Yamaguchi region became more prosperous than Kyoto.
That is why it earned the nickname Nishinokyo,
which you know means "western Kyoto".
Oysters, a 5-story pagoda.
It is the one at Ruriko-ji temple,
one of the 3 tallest and most important in Japan,
together with the pagodas of Horyu-ji and Daigo-ji temples.
At night it is illuminated and offers a beautiful image.
Everything I have seen so far is beautiful.
Here we are.
This is where the Chinryutei, the Abe pavilion, was rebuilt,
a wealthy merchant family of the Bakumatsu era.
In this room were held secret meetings between men
such as Saigo Takamori and Kido Takayoshi of the Satch Alliance.
It seems unbelievable, so small it is.
Wow...
From up here, I almost feel like a brave samurai
fighting to restore imperial rule.
Ha-ha-ha!
Mr. Mouri.
What are you planning to do, tonight?
As a matter of fact, this afternoon I'm meeting a person...
by the name of Komakichi Kurataya.
Komakichi Kurataya?
Hm?
Father!
Wow.

Sorry, it slipped my mind.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Would you mind waiting here for a moment?
Eh?
No...
What's wrong with him, now?
He must have remembered he had things to do.
Yes.
Don't you find it takes too long, Asuka?
(Steps: approaching)
Look, he's coming.
You must be Mr. Kogoro Mouri, right?
Hm?
Eh?
I am Mr. Mouri, yes.
And who are you?
-And I'm Sergeant Tsurumi.
-Inspector Washiyama, at your service.
From the police?
You should accompany us to the police station to ask you some questions.
Eh?
Hey, hey, may I ask what you're doing?
Hey, hey, hey!
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Aah!
Aah!
Kogoro!
Father!
Aaah!
-Aaah!
-Escape!
Mr. Mouri, there's no escape!
Don't try it!
You're under arrest!
What are you doing?
(I don't understand what I'm doing here.
Can someone explain to me why the hell I'm being detained?
Don't look at me like that, I want an explanation.
What?
I'm Inspector Takaji.
From now on, I'll be conducting this interrogation.
I want to know what I'm accused of.
You're charged with obstructing the work of the police
and also of attempted escape, Mr. Mouri.
I have not attempted to escape at any time.
We have learned that you have come to collect the treasure of one Komakichi Kurataya.
Eh?
This Komakichi Kurataya
is the suspect in a robbery that took place a year ago.
What?
A robbery, you say?
A person who called himself Komakichi Kurataya,
the name of a Hagi shipowner who lived during the Edo period,
"He entered Mr. Takarada's cafe armed with a pistol,
shot the owner and robbed him of a collection of ancient coins valued at hundreds of millions of yen.
valued at hundreds of millions of yen.
The family treasure of Komakichi Kurataya
is the "Koban" collection he stole.
Therefore, you must be the accomplice of in Komakichi Kurataya.
And now!
What nonsense!
I only came here so that I was invited by letter.
Is that so?
If it's true, I'm sure you can show it to me.
Oh, so much.
One moment, I'll show it to you.
Well...
What's the matter?
We detectives have to maintain professional secrecy.
If you want to see her, you'll have to bring me a warrant.
- (Kogoro) Hey, stop.
-Escorcolleu-lo.
We have to do something, Conan.
Otherwise, these people will think the father is a thief.
We should get Inspector Megure to contact the Yamaguchi police...
with the Yamaguchi police.
-Asuka.
-One moment, inspectors.
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri.
The person who reported it... was me.
-Excuse me.
-Sorry? -What?
Look, I was really hurt that I ended up involved in the case.
That's why I called the police,
because I wanted them to protect him from Komakichi Kurataya.
Well, now I'm starting to understand everything.
I have to apologize, Mr. Mouri.
Ah, don't worry.
"He who has a mouth, is wrong," they say.
Eh, wait s.
The fact that you have arrested me as an accomplice
proves that the investigation of the robbery hasn't progressed much, right?
-Don't take it like that, man.
-It's none of your business.
How would you like it if a big shot detective like myself
to help you get the case back on track?
And don't be ashamed to ask me just because I'm famous.
I'm ashamed that you're always sticking your nose where it doesn't belong.
Hm.
How can a simple detective help us?
Hm.
"A simple detective," you said?
Investigating this kind of crime is only the job of the police.
We don't need any sleazy detectives.
I advise you to try Yamaguchi's typical noodles
and go home to Tokyo.
Hm.
What a fool!
You have made the mistake of underestimating the great Kogoro Mouri.
In the letter he sent you in Komakichi he said
that he would wait for you in front of the fox statue at 3 o'clock, didn't he?
We have lost the opportunity to discover
the identity of the man in Komakichi Kurataya.
I'm really sorry.
What a pity!
I should have thought better of it, before I reported you.
You didn't do anything wrong.
It was the fault of that fool, Chief Inspector Takaji.
By the way, come to think of it,
I don't know where I put it, the letter from Komakichi.
Oh, yes, the letter.
Don't suffer, I have it.
When did you take it?
Here.
I thought it was important

and I decided to keep it so that it would not get lost or spoiled.
I don't know, father.
Are you sure, it was this Komakichi end,
who wrote you the letter?
What is it?
Don't you find it strange that a thief who escaped from the police
would invite you to come and see him?
Yes it is, yes.
If you want me to tell you the truth, I don't understand why he wrote me either.
The only way to find out is to ask this Komakichi.
Am I right, Asuka?
Eh?
I'm saying that because I think that in Komakichi Kurataya...
it's you, isn't it?
What do you say?
What?
And now, what a hooliganism!
How do you want Asuka to be the thief that the police are looking for?
How do you want Asuka to be the thief that the police are looking for?
Nn-hn.
That's not what I meant.
But you were the one who wrote the letter to Mr. Mouri
impersonating Komakichi Kurataya.
Hey, kid.
What do you think?
That you can say anything that comes to your mind?
Listen to me.
Before, when you talked to Asuka about Komakichi Kurataya,
you only told her your name.
How did you know, Inspector Takaji,
that you had come to collect your family's treasure?
I kept the letter and did not show it to anyone,
so Inspector Takaji couldn't have known what it said.
Therefore, it is obvious that Asuka told him when she reported it.
-Hm?
- (Asuka) I am very sorry.
Conan found me out, it was me.
But what do you say now?
What does it all mean?
Actually, a year ago the police arrested a person...
suspected of committing the robbery.
-No, no.
-An accomplice of the thief?
A metalworking expert named Yuichi Fukuhara.
-Yes.
-A metalworking expert?
"One day, he received by e-mail an order from a person calling himself Komakichi Kurataya.
who called himself Komakichi Kurataya."
"It asked him to recreate a weapon from the ancient feudal domain of Choshu.
"To commemorate the fact that the reverberatory furnaces of Hagi
had been declared a world heritage site."
"As a work of art, naturally, without the ability to fire."
But, just before he finished,
the gun disappeared from Mr. Fukuhara's factory.
And the person who had stolen it
modified it so that it could fire real bullets.
Yes.
So this means that Fukuhara did not commit any crime.
No, but the court concluded...
that he had illegally manufactured a firearm
and sentenced him to serve a one-year prison term.
As it turns out, shortly before Fukuhara received the assignment from this client....
"I recorded a report on the factory he owns in Deba
and posted it on the online news portal."
I guess the culprit saw it
and commissioned en Fukuhara to make the replica gun for him.
That's why in I'm partly responsible.
I get it.
Anyway, he should have told me the truth from the beginning.
I think...
Asuka must have some clue about the identity of the culprit.
That's why she had to think of a way to invite Mr.
Mouri to Yamaguchi
without the culprit realizing it,
so that he could avoid involving her in the case.
Is this true?
The culprit is capable of shooting without a second thought.
If he finds out that I've hired a private detective to investigate her, I don't think he'll rest until he does,
it seems to me that he won't rest until he kills me.
I am very afraid.
I take charge of the situation.
Therefore, what I recommend you do is to leave it in my hands.
Mr. Mouri...
I can't thank you enough.
And now!
You don't have to thank me for anything.
It's the fate of any detective.
I have a kind of magnet for mysteries.
I've got it.
Why don't you announce to the culprit, via the news portal,
that from now on, I'll be investigating the case?
Then he will no longer have any reason to want to kill her.
B-but then he would come looking for you.
Don't worry, the great Kogoro Mouri has it all under control.
Ha-ha-ha!
(Man) So you are the famous Kogoro Mouri.
The Asuka has already talked to me and explained everything.
I know you've come to investigate the robbery
that was last year.
I will not disappoint you.
Those who know me know that I have solved a lot of mysteries.

that the police didn't even know where to pick up.
We can start now, Mr. Takarada.
Your coin collection was upstairs when it was stolen?
Yes.
Did you get to see the culprit's face?
Look, I was actually surprised by the clothes he was wearing.
He was dressed strangely.
In what way?
Could you describe me?
Wait, I can show you an image...
that I captured with my webcam.
-(Kogoro) Yes.
- (Kogoro) Your webcam?
I installed a couple in the garage
as security cameras,
in case anyone thought to do anything naughty to me in the car.
(Kogoro) Go ahead.
(Kogoro) A school uniform and a white sash?
It's not a very discreet outfit for a thief.
(Thinking) "Wait a minute, where have I seen this outfit?"
Hey, Ran.
Ah..., yes.
May I see the guide, please?
Thank you.
You have it.
Hello, Mr. Fujiki.
Welcome, Mr. Fujiki.
"I got it."
You are Mr. Kogoro Mouri?
Myself, at your service.
Who are you?
Yosuke Fujiki, lawyer.
I manage the estate of this place
since the previous owner asked me to.
What is it, Mr. Fujiki?
Do you have any news?
I read on the online news portal
that a detective named Kogoro Mouri would start investigating the case.
It is here.
"Komakichi Kurataya, you won't sleep easy."
What a shame...
Eh?
Mr. Mouri, I'd like to ask you to stay out of the case.
Stay out of it, you mean?
The previous owner expressed his will
that the works of art and antiques kept in the second floor storeroom
to be given in their entirety to local institutions.
Because of the robbery we had to postpone it temporarily,
but next week the warehouse should be empty.
Oh, right.
Now I understand why there is a truck parked outside.
(Fujiki) Yes.
(Takarada) The construction site next door makes a lot of noise.
It's very tiresome to work here from 10 o'clock in the morning until the afternoon.
I also want the case to be solved as soon as possible.
Mr. Takarada...
Even if the case is solved, you may not get the coins back.
What do you mean?
The ancient coin called "koban" contains almost 90% gold.
It is possible that they were melted down and turned into ingots
so that they could sell the gold much more easily.
Gee, Mr. Fujiki.
You seem to understand quite a bit about these things.
My job is to manage personal fortunes.
Mr. Mouri, I am telling you this for your own good.
You know the culprit has a real gun.
If you don't want to risk your life, drop this case right away.
What was that?
A threat?
And now!
It was just a warning.
That's all.
How suspicious...
What?
About it, Kogoro...
It seems to me that here, in Deba,
we might find some clue to solve the case.
Hagi, you say?
According to Inspector Takaji,
in Komakichi Kurataya was a real personage
who lived in Haya during the Edo period.
In addition, Asuka said that Mr. Fukuhara's factory,
the gun manufacturer, is also... ah!
Shut up at once, you bore.
What don't you know, that the robbery was committed in Yamaguchi?
Mr.
Mouri, if you don't want to come, Ran and I can go alone.
Good thinking.
No way.
There's a bus that only takes an hour to get there.
I'd love to visit Hagi City while we're here.
We won't be alone.
It's dangerous, you going alone.
The Asuka said he had to go to Haya today to film a report.
What?
The Asuka will be there too?
He-he!
(Kogoro) What, kid?
Where is Asuka?
She had to come to look for information at Shoin shrine,
that's why we came here first.
We'd better not disturb her while she's working, right?
Ah...
By the way, you've been looking from side to side for a while now.
Me?
What are you looking for, may I ask?
Ah, no.
No, nothing.
Oh, no. Nothing.
Look at it.
In Deba-meow.
What kind of doll is this?
In Deba-meow, the city mascot.
What's that?
Ran.
Can you take a picture of me with Hagi-miau, please?
"Bah."
Oh, sure.
"Even if it doesn't look like it, it's a creature."
"Now that I look at it, this doll dressed in a very strange way."

"In a strange way..."
"In a strange way..."
Eh?
Hey, Hagi-miau.
Why are you dressed in these clothes?
I just want to know if the costume you're wearing has any meaning.
What's that?
The Kiheitai.
I got it.
The thief was dressed as a fighter of the Kiheitai,
the militia he founded in Takasugi Shinsaku.
And why was he wearing the militia uniform?
How should I know?
All I know is that dressing up as a local hero to commit a robbery
is a real indecency.
Hey, kid.
Do you know where Asuka is now?
She's broadcasting from Kido Takayoshi's residence.
It's not far from where we are now.
(Asuka) Takayoshi is one of the 3 great architects of the Meiji Restoration,
along with Saigo Takamori and Okubo Toshimichi.
Before moving to the capital he lived here for 20 years.
Hey, Ran.
Shouldn't we make a call to the Asuka to let him know we're coming?
I'm doing it now.
(Mobile)
Yes, tell me?
"Hello, Asuka. Soc in Takarada. It's a video call."
Oh, excuse me.
"Hello, Asuka."
"Hello. Has something happened?"
It turns out that Mr. Fujiki came to see me a while ago.
He heard that there's a private detective investigating the case...
and I thought he was a bit nervous.
So, the culprit must be...
Gee, we're lost.
Where are you going?
Maybe I can help you.
I don't think we're very far away.
We wanted to go to Kido Takayoshi's old residence,
but we got lost.
Ah.
Don't worry, it's close by.
Pugin and we'll be right there.
(Kogoro) Gee, that's funny.
I've always wanted to know if they were comfortable, these seats.
(Kogoro) Oh.
(Kogoro) Oh.
(Kogoro) Wow.
This is paradise.
Ha-ha-ha!
Ran, ajupe't.
Apa, we can go now.
What?
Ep, don't touch that.
Hey, what are you doing...?
Aah!
Aah!
Hide session back here.
What was that?
A feature?
Yes.
You all right, Ran?
He's escaped.
"It seems to me that now in Komakichi Kurataya wants to kill in... Kogoro."
