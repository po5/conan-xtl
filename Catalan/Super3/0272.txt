Suspense and deductions resolve the tug-of-war between us.
between us.
What does a cross mean?
What case is behind the message?
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is Detective Conan!

(Off) "When we were with Miss Jody at a coffee shop,
"There was a general power outage in the building."
"And when the power came back on,
"On the escalators we found the body of a man
"who had an envelope over his arms."
"The victim was Katsunori Chuujo, head of a detective agency."
"On the envelope, which had been left empty,
"there were signs drawn in his blood."
"A circle, an X and a triangle."
"And then..."
There was a sign written in blood!
A what?
A square?
It could be either the ideogram meaning "mouth"
or the sign for the syllable "ro".
If we follow the sequence of the circle, the cross and the triangle,
I guess it must be a square.
Hm... I understand it less and less.
(He thinks) "But isn't this square fatter
"Than the message of the circle, cross and triangle?"
THE ENIGMA OF THE abbreviations, (PART TWO)
(People: whispers)
Hm... Hm...
Hey, Ran.
Say.
If we put the circle, the cross and the triangle together,
do you think you can get an ideogram?
Eh?
Yes, for example.
If we put the square and the cross together, we would have the character "ta".
Yes, it is true.
This Mr. Hari would be a suspect.
Besides, it is an unusual name.
But in this Mr. nawat, the pattern is repeated 3 times.
And the shape of the I in "Asai" has many crosses!
The shape?
Of course it does!
For example the Suzu of Suzuki means "rattlesnake"....,
it could be related to a circle.
You go too far.
My name is Suzuki too.
I'm sure this Mr. Suzuki is not a bad person.
Ah, but... (wringing his neck)
He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he...
Be that as it may, from now on, the case is handled by the police.
I'd prefer that we keep you away from the scene of the crime.
Takagi.
Leave this alone.
Upstairs to help in Chiba.
Yes, right away.
I should call Father to tell him we'll be home late.
(Keys: pip-pip)
Ah, hello.
Is that you, Chiba?
Where are you now?
To the eighth floor?
Yes, the inspector asked me.
I'm here to help now.
Ah, wait a second.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Yes, ok.
Come on, see you now.
Eh?
Ah!
Ah!
Oh! (Laughs)
Oooh!
Oooh!
Wait, waitaaaaa!
Xxxxxt!
Ra-Ran?
What... what's wrong?
What... what does... what does... the X stand for?
Eh?
Yes.
Earlier you said you were being teased about the X, right?
Yeah, Yumi puts me on messages to tease me.
She usually puts me 3.
You'll know what it is soon, I don't think I have to explain it to you.
Right now.
Explain it to me right now.
Please, Inspector Takagi.
Ra-Ran...
Uh, I-I don't know...
I don't know...
She's late, the Mouri.
And that little devil boy is gone, too.
Oh, he's a very clever boy!
(Mite'ls, it's over there.
What a pain in the ass.
(Hey, clever boy!
You're a good little struçot.
(Jody) Eh?
An estruçot?
Have you figured out
what the circle, the cross, the triangle and the square mean?
No... He-he... I have no idea.
Let's see if the Mouri is right.
Maybe you can get something out of their shape.
For example, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense...
they always call it "the Pentagon".
And they call it that precisely because the building has a pentagonal shape.
In the United States there are many things with special names
that have nothing to do with their meaning.

The White House is the official seat of the presidency of the United States.
The Oval Office is the presidential office because of the shape of it.
And then, we have the FBI which stands for Federal Bureau of Investigation,
but it actually stands for Federal Bureau of Investigation,
and it's a law enforcement agency under the Department of Justice.
Smart guy, was that helpful?
Uh, yeah...
He-he-he-he-he-he-he!
Changing the subject: what did you mean, "estruçot"?
Oh.
Well, I meant you.
The scientist's agent saw that you were hiding behind the suitcase.
In America, we always call clumsy people "estruçot".
Even though their bodies are visible from a distance,
they believe that if they hide their head, the enemy does not see them.
In Japan there is a saying that means the same thing:
"Cover your face and show your ass!"
(Think) "Cover your face... and show your ass?"
Leave me the envelope for a moment.
(Thinking) Hey?
Hey, wait, man!
"I get it. So that's what it was!"
"The thing is quite clear."
"Out of the 31 suspects on the list...,
"He's the killer."
Ah, I get it!
Well, we'll be right back to start investigating.
Yes...
Don't touch anything
on the head of the detective agency's computer.
What happened?
Mm?
Ah, nothing...
The victim was the head of a detective agency,
and there's a good chance that the killer is the person
he was investigating for embezzlement.
That's why I wanted to talk to your agency.
I thought someone might know the name of the person in question,
so I called them.
Y... And what did they say?
Uh, well...
The head of the agency was handling this case alone,
in the utmost secrecy, and he hadn't said anything to anyone.
The only clue we have is the data he left on the computer,
but there's an access code, and no one knows it.
(Sonoko) An access code.
(Sonoko) Of course.
An access code!
The circle, the cross... Can't they be an access code?
I've thought about it, and I've asked the man I have in your office...
to enter this code to check it out, but nothing.
Yes, I know, but...
And he's tried every combination possible.
Hm... And they didn't work?
So, the symbols refer to the killer's name?
Oh.
And can't it be some kind of test question?
Of course it can!
At quizzes
you use these signs to say yes or no.
(Sonoko) I know.
It's a quiz question.
-The victim was the king of quizzes. Maybe yes, he was.
(Wringing his neck)
So much so.
I want you guys to stay here.
Please, I beg you not to get mixed up in this case anymore.
But if this is the name of the murderer, the suspect would be Inspector Chiba.
Yes, look at this.
If we take the "Chi" from Inspector Chiba's name,
and cover that up, we have a cross.
And if we cover this up we'll just see a triangle, right?
Don't you find that very suspicious?
Ta-tapar?
Hm.
Wow!
Come to think of it, Inspector Takagi is also suspicious.
Eh?
Look, the "Taka" in Inspector Takagi's name.
If we cover up though, it might look like a square and a triangle.
It may look like a square to you, but why a triangle?
Because some people write the character for "mouth" in the form of a circle.
Dr. Agasa writes this character to the A of his name like this.
He says that when he is in a hurry to write something
he can't help abbreviating some things.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(He thinks) "Hm.... Cap... Being in a hurry... Abbreviate? Hm..."
Ooooh!
Hey, you.
Inspector Chiba and Takagi came when I called them.
They can't be the murderers.
Hey, can you hear me?
"Wait a minute..."
"I swear there was one on the list of suspects..."
"I'm sure..."
"This is the one!"
Wait a minute.
"I could have sworn there was one on the list of suspects..."
"I'm sure..."
"It's this one!"
Bunta Kuniyoshi.
Bunta Kuniyoshi?
Yes, that's right.
And what does it have to do with the circle, the cross, the triangle and the square?
As it is logical, for now we don't have any nexus to clarify it,
but if we hide the top of the characters "Yoshi" and "Bunta"...
a circle, a cross and a triangle come out.

Oh, yes!
They are a circle, a cross and a triangle.
But it's rather impossible for the character "Ta" to look like a triangle.
"Sonoko, shut up."
What we see now is that of a printed text,
but when this character is written by hand,
if the last stroke goes out of place...
What do you think?
Now it looks like a triangle, doesn't it?
Why should I cover the top part of the characters?
It's not that I wanted to cover it, it's just that they have taken it away.
Do you remember?
The circle, the cross and the triangle were written in the margin of the envelope.
And there is also the square that we found later,
which was bigger than the other signs.
This is the proof
that the other halves were written on the documents that were sticking out of the envelope.
that were sticking out of the envelope.
Therefore, the other half of the signs are the documents that have been taken.
So, what is the square?
Naturally, it refers to the character "Kuni".
If the person who has written it must have been in a hurry to do so,
it is not strange that he abbreviated the character
with the radical that surrounds the central part of the sign.
Of course!
This makes a lot of sense!
If he wrote it in a hurry, it is normal that he left out the "Tama".
Oh.
"Great!"
It sounds like it's straight out of the novel and everything, Jules Megre!
It's no big deal.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
All right, then.
Now we know who the killer is.
Let's go upstairs!
Yes! Yes!
Oh.
How late it's been!
She's late, Mouri.
Maybe she wanted to call Shinichi
to ask him what the X means.
And if she knows what it means, as I said before, she...
Hey!
Where the hell did you get that I would give her my "dear X"?!
Eeeeeeh?
Inspector Takagi explained it all to me.
He already told me what it means.
Oh, right...
If it occurred to me to tell you that I'd give you my Xs,
I wouldn't know what to say.
Well, it's impossible for me to know what it is.
He's more of a short grandmother, that's why.
Aaatxum!
Eh?
And where did she go, Conan?
Eh?
Wow.
That little boy has disappeared again.
Coi, he's always going somewhere or other!
(Man) Eh?
Are you looking in Kuniyoshi?
Yes, it's here.
Kuniyoshi.
They're asking you!
(Man) Eh?
What do you want?
Sorry to disturb you,
but we'd like to talk to you, please.
Do you mind if we go to another office?
(thinks) "Ah, it is..."
Okay.
"A machine to destroy documents!"
What?
How do you say?
What does it mean?
A square and a circle, a cross and a triangle?
They say what's missing, deduce that it says Bunta Kuniyoshi?
Yes, that's right.
But, Inspector,
aren't you running a little too fast, when it comes to pinning the murder on me?
But this was the message he left before he died.
And couldn't it be that the murderer had written those signs
with the victim's fingers?
I'm sure he wanted to pin the murder on me, with those signs.
If you want to interrogate me,
find those papers you say the murderer stole and we'll talk.
Do you think that if I were the murderer...
I would have stayed in the building where the murder took place,
instead of running away and burning the documents?
That's why he put them in the shredding machine.
But since the strips of paper it makes are wide,
it was very easy to retrieve them from the machine.
Isn't that right, Inspector Takagi? Yes..., a-that's right.
Oh!
Did you find them?
Yes, we were just looking for a piece of paper stained with blood,
it was easy.
It completely matches the characters written on the envelope.
There is no doubt that it accuses Bunta Kuniyoshi.
Knowing that he has used the document shredding machine,
it's a matter of time before we find the rest of the listings.
And as he has left the gloves to the services during the process,
and we can assume that in Bunta he has put the documents to the machine,
it is likely that we can find his fingerprints.
Circle, cross, triangle... Right, now I get it.
Hmm?
No nothing...
When I was in college,
I used to call myself Boca Grossa and circle, cross, triangle.
In those days I didn't know why I was being called that.
I wanted things not to remain empty words.

And it occurred to me to start appropriating money from the company
so that my wife and children would have a good life,
but seeing that I don't get caught, this became a habit.
I'm just a big mouth... and they say that he who has a mouth is wrong.
Did you finally get the one with the circle, the cross and the triangle?
Yes.
The police took it out the back door.
By the way girls, at the end you want to explain it to me?
What is it, the X?
(they laugh)
Oh, you're so worried about knowing?
Uh... Yes.
Well, go ask Ran.
It's there, he writes a message.
"Tor-na... a-vi-at...
"Do the do-vor."
That's it.
Ran.
What does it mean, the X?
Eeeeeeh?
Sonoko told me to ask you.
No, you don't have to know that.
You can't!
Eh?
Can't I?
Oh, right!
X means "no" or "wrong"...
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Suzuki, Mouri, goodbye.
Watch out for stalkers.
SIII! SIII!
(Think) "Looks like it's time to get the apple."
The Ayumi?
(Genta) Yeah, she's seen Bruce and Jackie in that park.
Look at this!
There's a spot next to here.
(Genta) What is this? (Genta) It's blood.
And the next Conan:
