Victory, sincerity, tests for truth.
An inexhaustible drive to aspire to be the best!
Here is the first role of Aya Ueto!
The promise that she and Shinichi Kudo made to each other resurfaces
in the setting of a case.
He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and is Detective Conan!

(Girl) Eh?
Really? (Girl)
-I can't believe it!
-Yes!
In Suwa and Kobayashi!
I swear it's true!
(boy) -Huh?
- (boy) Yuki...
-...from the tennis club?
-At Kitada...
Yuki...
-Kitada!
-Hey!
Kitada... Kitada!
(Girl) What's wrong?
(People: rumors)
(Girls: call)
(Girl) "The formula for a deduction."
"If you are circumscribed to the correct equation to solve a case.
"the answer will emerge on its own."
Ah!
(Girls: snort)
I knew it.
So you were the murderer.
This is the solution to the test, isn't it?
the promise of the aya ueto and shinichi's 4 years ago
(Sonoko) This has no name.
Why should a girl in her youth spend a splendid spring day
a splendid spring day dusting someone else's dust?
This is torture!
They're devils!
How dare they have the nerve to have their wren's wife
to clean their house when they're not around?
Your in-laws are demons, beautiful!
"Hey, don't overdo it..."
Just say "his wife" to me, and "my in-laws" to them!
If I'm doing this, it's because I feel like it...
As far as I know, I didn't ask you to come and help me clean up!
Yes, I know... That's true.
But that's just it, this is awesome.
If they have it, from books!
Eh?
"Yami no danshaku," "The Night Baron."
Yusaku Kudo's books are here?
Eh?
Blow!
"The Cases of the Yuki, Junior Detective"!
This is the series they made for TV, right?
Yes, the 2-hour special!
"It's one of Father's youthful works."
"Now, when I read something I die of embarrassment, really."
Mmmm?
Eh?
Look at this!
If this is Aya Ueto!
Mmmm?
Yes, at the beginning of choosing her for the role,
she came with her manager
to formally greet Shinichi's parents.
Come to think of it, you had already told me something.
How many years has it been since then?
That was the first year of junior high school;
so it's been 4 years already.
Since I've always been a fan of Aya,
when Shinichi told me she was coming,
I went ballistic and went over to him
because he would sign an autograph for me.
But Shinichi didn't seem very enthusiastic.
"He was in the garden playing alone with the soccer ball."
"But I remember Aya stared at him...I don't know.....
"with such a serious face that I thought it was strange."
Then, when I asked her what they talked about, she said....
What did he say?
Nothing.
Well... I don't know what he was talking about... Shinichi...
Surprise, maybe they said to meet one day...
"Sonoko, you witch! This is impossible!"
(Ringing)
Oh, someone has come.
(Intercom) "Yes?"
Excuse me, Shinichi Kudo is at home?
"Me?"
Is it a young girl?
Ah, now Shinichi is not at home,
"Can you tell me who's asking?"
A young girl?
About it...
The Aya... Ueto... I am Aya Ueto!
(At the same time) What?
The Aya Ueto?
Wow!
It's her!
It's Aya Ueto in person!
Hey, you remember me?
Say.
Yes.
You're Ran Mouri, right?
Shinichi's childhood friend.
Yes!
Ah, a classmate.
I'm Sonoko Suzuki!
Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you too!
Hello.
And that's Conan.
Ah, hello, nice to meet you.
Estruçot of the glasses, you've turned red?
"Shut up already!"

Listen, do you know when Shinichi will be back?
Well, we don't know.
He left to investigate a case and we don't know anything.
Miss, you've come to see Shinichi?
You want to take a case to him?
That's right.
Can I get in touch with him somehow?
I don't know...
I call his cell phone often,
but it almost always goes to voicemail.
Thank you.
I'll try to do a trick on him!
"You're wasting your time. I'm here."
If you want a case investigated, ask Mr. Kogoro Mouri.
I don't think Mr. Kogoro can do it.
Why can't he do it?
Because he had a hangover and will spend the whole day sleeping.
"He'll never change!"
He's got his answering machine on.
Really? I don't know what I'll do.
I don't know what I'll do.
Listen, if I leave him a message on his voicemail,
he might call to get in touch with you.
Yeah, that's right...
If you don't mind, can you explain what the problem is?
Yes, of course.
Near the apartment building where I live,
there's an 80-year-old woman named Fumie Koda, who lives alone.
I get along very well with that lady
and I often go to visit her when I have a day off.
But today, when I stopped by the house to see her....
Grandma Fumie, it's Aya.
I came in the house.
Grandma Fumie?
I've come to see her!
Grandma Fumie?
How strange... Where did she go?
Since Grandma Fumie is in the habit of
not to close the door when she goes on a small errand,
I thought it might be the case today and waited for a while.
"No."
"And she hasn't come home?"
"I worried about his absence.
"And I went to the neighbor's store to try my luck."
"And then..."
Yes... Grandma stopped by a while ago.
When I asked her where she was going, she told me she was going to Beika.
-Yes.
-To Beika?
She just said that and then she left in a hurry.
She looked scared and didn't look like her usual self.
I was a bit worried.
Then I took a cab and went to Beika's town.
I didn't know what reason she had for coming here
and I didn't know where to start looking.
At that moment I remembered Shinichi.
We only met once four years ago....,
but now he's solving cases as a junior detective
and I remembered that he used to live in this town.
So, this is the reason for the visit.
Yes.
Besides, he and I...
Nothing, it's not important.
Did Grandma Fumie know Beika?
Uh... I don't know...
Anyway,
I'll write a message to Shinichi now with what you've told us.
Other than that,
tell us all the things you know about that old lady!
It's just that Shinichi once told me that the more information, the better.
He-he-he-he-he-he-he!
Ha-ha-ha... Yes, that's true.
Other than that, I know that when Grandma Fumie was young,
she lost a daughter to an illness.
A daughter?
About half a year ago, a close friend of Grandma Fumie's told me about it.
At that time, Fumie was 40 years old.
Her daughter Ayako was only 17.
Since Fumie was a single mother, she would bring her daughter up alone,
and that day she went to work like many other days.
While she was away from home,
"Ayako's condition suddenly worsened,
"And when Fumie arrived at her daughter's room,"
"At the hospital it was already late..."
"Fumie always regretted
"That she hadn't been with Ayako the day she died."
"She seems to have always blamed herself for her daughter's death."
No... I didn't know.
Because the Fumie was never supposed to explain these things to anyone.
The truth is that you have a retreat to Ayako.
And, besides, your name is also Aya.
I guess that's why she's so fond of you.
(Woman) I'm home!
I went shopping and I'm late.
Welcome home!
(Flow) What I told you is a secret.
Grandma Fumie always has a smile on his face
and I wouldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams that she had such a sad past.
At 17 years old...
More or less, that's the same age we are.
It would be very hard for Grandma Fumie and also... for her daughter.
Her daughter liked classical music.
Specifically, it seems she listened to Mozart very often.
"I still don't know if this whole story
"May have... no relation to the case or not."

"What if we change our point of view?"
Hey, when you walked into the living room,
the little light on the TV was on, wasn't it?
"Grandma Fumie may have been watching TV before she came out."
I think so,
because she had the newspaper open to the program page.
And she hadn't had her tea?
So, Grandma Fumie was watching TV...
and, for some reason, it came on all at once in a rush.
Do you know what channel she was watching?
Yes, I do!
Yes, while Grandma Fumie was waiting...
(At the same time) "Nichiuri Television!"
Nichiuri TV.
It was Nichiuri TV, wasn't it?
Yes...
Conan?
I thought we had to check what program Grandma was watching.
Remember they don't deliver the newspaper at her house in Shinichi anymore.
Of course they don't!
Now you'll call to ask someone!
What am I wrong?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You're wrong!
Even everyone can do this with the mobile?
Wow!
If this was the series we were talking about before!
Look, look.
It was Yusaku Kudo's "The Cases of Yuki, a Juvenile Detective".
-Oh... I didn't know that...
-You watched this rebroadcast.
You starred in it and you didn't know?
Eh?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This special was shot in Beika, right?
Yes.
At Beika Station, at Beika Park...
and at Shunichi Shitara's memorial mansion.
You're talking about that old western mansion?
Yes... It was the mansion of a musician who died 10 years ago.
Since then, his wife, a pianist,
turned that building into a memorial mansion.
Aya, the killer beat you...
and locked you out of the cellars of that mansion, right?
Yes, but we only used the exteriors of the building...
The interiors we shot on the studio sets.
I got it!
Oh, really?
You did?
I know what made Grandma Fumie come to Beika.
Sonoko, really?
You see, according to the deduction of the great junior detective Sonoko...
There's no doubt about it!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"You know what this is about?"
Pay attention.
Grandma Fumie hasn't been able to differentiate
what was going on in the series special from reality.
What do you mean?
What?
It's likely that Grandma Fumie
watched this program from the beginning
because she had seen your name on the schedule page of the newspaper.
But the woman must have fallen asleep in the middle of the special...
Then, when she suddenly opened her eyes...
and came across the second part of the special...,
"She saw that a person had attacked Aya...
"And that she was closed to the cellars of that mansion."
Grandma Fumie, who had not yet fully awakened...
and who was not very clear-headed,
mixed up the facts of the special with reality
and went outside with the will to help you.
And then, he went straight to the city of Beika.
But if it were what you say,
Aya would have found the TV on when she came to visit.
The fact that she closed the TV means that at that moment...
she was well aware that it was a program.
Shut up, you nuisance!
You don't need to look for three feet to the cat!
It has!
That's why Grandma Fumie is now at the mansion...
Aya, what do you think?
There's no doubt about it!
"Coi, a macaronic deduction befitting the Sonoko..."
"But, in the first place, there is no doubt...
"That the lady was watching that special of the series."
"And there is no doubt that the fact that she came to Beika...
"also has to do with that special."
You guys, instead of just standing here thinking,
we should go to the mansion and check it out!
Yes.
Let's go check it out.
If you're asking about that woman, I saw her just now.
I knew it!
I knew it!
Just as I had deduced!
And even if she's in the pavilion?
No.
He left about 10 minutes ago.
We must have made a mistake?
-He left?
Since the Aya wasn't there,
it's possible he went to look for her again.
What impression did she make on you?
Was she calm?
The first thing she did when she arrived
was to stare at the window on the second floor for a while.

Then he asked me if he could enter the mansion and I said yes.
and I said yes.
It doesn't seem to me that he came to help Miss Aya.
Why should he have come?
Anyway, if he left 10 minutes ago,
it's possible that he's still near here!
-Yes, in that direction.
-Do you know in which direction he went?
Wait!
I'll come too!
I'll go look for her!
So will I!
How did you see it when you left here?
He looked as if he had observed something he didn't quite believe.
I tried to tell her something,
she went on her way, completely mute.
Thank you!
"Just a moment!"
"Here inside is a key that will allow me to solve the mystery!"
Go ahead!
I can go inside?
"That... was Beika's old hospital ward..."
Specifically, it seems she listened to Mozart quite often.
"That could be it!"
Ayako... Forgive me.
Mother will be right with you.
Eh?
"Damn it!"
Mrs. Fumie!
Mrs. Fumie!
"Please don't!"
Maybe Mrs. Fumie has already gone home.
- (mobile)
-Yes...
Eh...?
It's Shinichi!
Yes, hello?
"Ran, I've looked at the message. Where do I pay now?"
In front of the mansion.
"Ask him to play some Mozart!"
Mozart?
I'll go ask him!
"Yes, hurry!"
Now we ask him.
"Pass the phone to Aya!"
Thank you.
Shinichi is asking for you.
"Aya!"
Yes, say.
This is Aya.
"Mrs. Fumie is now standing
"In front of the old Beika hospital pavilion!"
Beika's hospital?
Hurry up, please!
Mrs. Fumie wants to meet her dead daughter!
"You have to be on time! Please!"
(Piano)

"Aya, the place where Mrs. Fumie had her daughter hospitalized..." (Piano)
"It was Beika's hospital."
Surely, in a room on the second floor.
"From the chamber, her daughter could feel Mozart's music...
"played by Mr. Shiraki,
"And, surely, that was a comfort to her."
"Mrs. Fumie saw on that television series...
"The image of the Shiraki mansion...
"that she could see from that hospital room."
Surprised by the vision,
she couldn't help but leave the house in a hurry
and go in the direction of Beika.
"And then, when she looked out of the window on the second floor of the mansion," he said,
"What she saw was Beika's old hospital ward."
Surely, he felt as if he couldn't believe...
to what his eyes were seeing.
"Because that building has been preserved as it was 40 years ago."
It's this way!
"Mrs. Fumie has left Shiraki Manor...
"And went to the hospital..."
"And when she stood in front of the old pavilion...
"She suddenly remembered the day her daughter died."
"And she, who in her heart...
"feels guilty about her daughter's death,
"Now she tries to go to meet her wherever she is."
Aya, you must hurry, you are the only person who can stop her!
The only one who can?
(Aya) Grandmother Fumie!
Ayako?
"Aya, you must hurry, you are the only person who can stop her!"
Hey, mother,
I could only live for 17 years, but I was very happy.
Eh?
It makes me very happy that you had me and that I was your daughter!
-Ayako...
-That's all I wanted to tell you.
That's why, mother, you have to live for many years...
Also the ones I missed.
Ok, Ayako... Okay, Ayako... Thank you, Ayako.
Grandma Fumie!
-Grandma Fumie!
-Aya?
The Ayako has come to see me, hasn't she?
She has forgiven me, she has forgiven me.
She has forgiven me...
I'm very happy, Grandma.
Very glad.
Ran!
Oh, they found it!
Shinichi, I think I've kept the promise...
I made to you... four years ago.
Yes, I think I've kept it too.
"You're very good at playing soccer."
When you grow up, do you want to be a soccer player?
No, I'll be a detective.
A detective?
Sherlock Holmes?
Yes, as in Holmes.
But I guess I'll be a junior detective first.
And that's no game.
I'll be a real detective.
Aw, we make a promise?

The next time we meet, exactly, in 4 or 5 years,
I will have become a real actress
and you, a real detective.
Yes, I promise!
You have surprised me.
You figured it all out just from the message.
"The formula for a deduction."
"If you're narrowed down to the right equation to solve a case,
"the answer will emerge on its own."
Yes, yes, goodbye.
"Goodbye, be well."
Ran, I'm here!
Conan!
You were all in the old pavilion?
Were you?
Gee, you found Mrs. Fumie!
What are you doing on the other side of the fence?
Look where you are!
You couldn't keep up with us!
That's funny!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"You'll pay for this."
Ran, Sonoko, thank you very much... Thank you too, Conan!
I'm so glad!
Grandma Fumie.
Shall we go home?
Come see us anytime.
Well, bye.
Yes.
- (Ouch) Bye.
Goodbye... Conan!
- (Sonoko) Goodbye!
(Sonoko) Goodbye!
"Good performance, detective."
"The case had a happy ending. But since that day..."
(Mobile)
"Come on, again?"
"Shinichi! What was the promise from 4 years ago? Ran."
"I can't even jokingly call him like that..."
Of course, of course, this means...
Now that boy is not... with his father?
"What happened?"
"Besides, what I don't quite understand is the fourth message:
" 'Maybe it will happen to me like the fish, that I will die caught in a net.'"
And the next Conan: "Following the clue of the fish's message."
