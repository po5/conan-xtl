The Magic Friends Murder Case (The Crimes)
(Sonoko) Look at me everyone!
Pay close attention!
Here we have a white handkerchief,
an orange string and a silver ring!
All right, miss, can you tie a knot in the middle of the string, please?
Like this?
Put this knot on the palm of your hand,
leave this ring together...
My demon-possessed fingers will slip into this handkerchief...
and chant the dark incantation.
OPPE keppe, OPPE keppe...
Mystery of mysteries!
The ring has passed through the cord!
Blow!
What a blast!
How did you do it, Sonoko?
It's a secret.
I'll do it tonight in front of everyone!
Ah, those of you who gather here are fond of magic games, aren't you?
That's right.
We met through the Internet!
That the heiress of the distinguished Suzuki Financial Consortium
corresponds over the Internet...
Au, nowadays the Internet has become an indispensable tool!
What if she were to put a computer in her office?
I was quite surprised.
You started surfing the Internet and you're getting excited about magic.
I found a fantastic guy!
A fantastic guy?
His name is Katsuki doit, he is 21 years old!
He is a regular of the Society of Friends of Magic.
He uses a very respectful language
and his jokes are refined and full of wit.
And from time to time he has outings full of romanticism.
And he has never met? No!
Today will be the first time!
I'll show him this trick and I'll blow his mind!
Nothing will stay!
It's the typical beginner's trick that is often shown on TV.
Push the knot and insert the string into the ring,
put your thumb and tighten it.
I get it! As repellent as ever.
Don't listen to him!
Ever since I told him I would attend this meeting he's been like this.
By the way, I won't disturb?
No problem!
I told them I'd bring the bride.
Bride?
Why rivers?
You wrote the messages pretending to be a man?
Yes.
I was pretending to be a 30-year-old man!
But looking at Sonoko Suzuki's name, they had to find out what you were.
No, because on the Internet we use a made-up name, an alias.
My was "The Magician's Apprentice" and Katsuki's was "Red Herring".
It comes from words that were from a magic spell.
How do you know his real name?
Because I asked him.
You've taken the first step to catch it.
Oooh.
How do you know me.
I'll meet friends I only know from chatting!
Isn't it exciting?
Yes it is!
(Think) It's like a masquerade ball.
Don't you notice a strange smell?
Aaatxim!
Good morning.
I have been invited to the meeting.
Welcome.
You must be "The Magician's Apprentice", right?
-Eh... yes... -We've been waiting impatiently for you!
But how did you know I was "The Magician's Apprentice?"
Just by seeing how you express yourself I figured you out.
It was obvious that you were a girl pretending to be a man.
Oi, folks?
Yes, it was exciting, seeing it from the other side of the monitor.
Oh, my gosh...
But about that sex change, Tanaka will tell you about it.
Oops!
What are you talking about?
I didn't want to pretend to be a boy.
But I imagined that "The Vanishing Rabbit" was a woman.
I achieved my goal!
(Girl) What a face!
I thought you were a woman,
I talked to you about intimacies and underwear, to the messages.
Yes, that day I was overwhelmed.
Excuse me, I will introduce myself.
I am the owner of this shelter, my name is Yoshinori Ahora.

He is in Kiyohiro Sugamo.
He will help me run the shelter.
Hello.
Hello...
From it..., and at Katsuki, known by the nickname Red Herring?
Ah, it's upstairs.
Ah, it's coming down.
You must be "The Magician's Apprentice", right?
I am in Katsuki doit!
(Think) Oh, sir!
What do I do now?
I knew it.
So it's true, I was a girl.
What an illusion!
Changing the subject, who are you?
She invited me.
My name is Ran Mouri!
I'm her father, I've brought them.
Thank you.
Au, come in.
I'll take them.
Ah, don't touch the girls, or you'll have to deal with me.
But father!
You can... you can be quiet.
Quiet here!
We're going back!
I want to stay.
Donkey!
Don't talk nonsense, you've got a cold!
Well then, we're leaving.
Take good care of the girls.
No!
I don't want to leave!
Let's see, have not come the head, "The Escapist King" and "The Shadow".
Eh?
Caram, is "The Shadow" coming too?
What is it, Sonoko?
It's just that the man only writes disturbing things,
like: "I fly through the sky" or "Can I make my body disappear".
It's not normal for the head not to come.
Does anyone know the phone number of the Escapist King?
Yes, I know it.
I'm going to call him, understand?
(Answering machine) "This is Nishiyama! I'm not at home right now."
There is an answering machine on.
When you hear the signal, leave your message."
We'll have to try to have fun until he doesn't arrive.
I'm going to prepare dinner.
Go to your rooms and make your beds, okay?
(At once) OK.
Oh!
The back garden is immense.
How beautiful!
It's fantastic!
Oooh... If Katsuki was just as I imagined it to be,
I would have been speechless.
Come on, don't talk like that.
Excuse me, dinner is already on the table.
Ah, thank you...
Wow.
You scared me.
No boy worth his salt here!
He's the only prince I'll ever love.
Are you still thinking about princes?
Yes.
I still dream of that prince, though I haven't met him.
What shall we do?
What shall I eat, for dinner?
I'll make you boiled rice.
Sleep until we get there!
(Radio) "In an apartment in Haido,
Mr. Tsutomu Nishiyama, 41 years old, was found dead."
"The body has been discovered by the mother of the deceased."
"On his computer screen,
they had left mysterious words:"
"First, the first victim... The Shadow."
"Mr. Nishiyama was a regular Internet user,
and today he had to go to a meeting
of the magic group he had founded: Society of Friends of Magic."
It's the meeting where we left the girls!
Kogoro, let's turn tail.
Hurry up!
The Japanese magician I admire and respect the most?
I liked a lot in Toichi Kuroba.
His numbers were dreamy.
It is also my favorite!
I prefer in Yoshiro Kinoshita.
With 20 years, he had already won all the awards of the world of magic.
Well I trio his master, in Motoyasu Tsukumo.
Just choose magicians who are already dead.
I'll stick with Kazumi Sanada.
And you?
I have it very clear!
The splendid Kaito Kid!
But he's... he's a thief.
I'll always choose him!
Is he the prince of your dreams? Yes.
Why not? Why not?
Run, Kogoro!
Eagerness! Shut up!
I can't run anymore!
What is it, that?
A fire?
Ooooh!
The rope bridge is burning!
It's the only way to get to the shelter!
Kogoro, call the police!
Hurry up!
Where are you going?
(Think) "Ran, wait for me!"
Raaaaaaaaaan!
Gee, that's strange.
The phone has been cut off.
What's wrong with you?
I had the feeling that someone was calling me.
Here, in the middle of the mountain?
I'll go take a look.
I'm sure there's no one there!
Co... Conan!
How can it be?
How come this child is here in the middle of the snow?!
He has a high fever!
Ran..., you must run away.
What?
Run away.
Get away from me very quickly.
Run away from here...
Co... Conan!
Don't faint, Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
You were fainting on the stairs at the entrance?
Why did he come back?
Surely he wanted to stay here.

I don't think he came back for it.
Conan told me...
You have to run away.
"Get off me real quick."
What did he mean?
I don't know.
Then he lost consciousness.
I'll take the antipyretic for the fever.
From what I've observed, it's a common cold.
With the medicine, he'll be cured soon.
Thank you very much.
-You're welcome. - "Observed"?
What do you mean, "observed"?
It's just that I'm a medical student.
I'll try to get in touch with the head, okay?
What?!
You won't be able to mobilize until tomorrow morning, inspector?
Don't shout so much, Mouri.
At night, going up that mountain by another route is dangerous.
We can't take the helicopter either,
because there's a risk of hitting a tree.
At least you could call the shelter.
We've been trying it for a while, but the line must be cut.
We are coming.
Wait'ns without losing our heads.
Ah, inspector!
Eh?
It doesn't make any sign...
The line must be cut somewhere.
That's quite a setback.
At today's party he was in charge of the drinks and everything.
For the time being we could choose someone to replace him.
-You're right. I don't want to replace anyone!
Let's play rock, paper, scissors!
Just a moment.
If we decide and enough is enough, it won't be fun.
Why don't we decide with a trick?
With a trick?
Yes.
You'll help me, Sonoko.
Eh?
Shall I help you?
Of course you can!
First we'll cover Sonoko's pretty eyes, this little princess.
Does anyone of you have a pencil and paper?
Does this notepad suit you, Toshiya?
That's fine.
Write everyone's name on a sheet of the pad.
Make a pile with the sheets face down
and give it to Sonoko.
We have it all.
-Here you go.
Here you go, Sonoko. Oh, the pen too.
Here you go, the pen.
And now everybody stand back.
Sonoko, take the pile and make a different sign on 3 sheets.
A circle, a cross and a triangle?
The circle will be the substitute for the head.
The cross will be the master of ceremonies who will animate the party.
The triangle will add fuel to the fire.
I am the one in charge of the bath fire.
As it is a game, it will be interesting to exchange jobs.
I have already marked all 3 of them!
Have a volunteer put all the sheets of paper on the table.
Naturally, with the name that cannot be seen.
Let's see who will be our boss today?
Stop it!
First, let's try to predict the name behind it.
Predict?
If my sixth sense doesn't fail me...
the head substitute... is you, Naoko!
Is it?
It can't be!
-Oh, oops! -Oh! -Oh, you're right!
We'll continue with the bath fireman.
Kikuei, it's your turn!
What's that?
Me?
How cool, he's got it right!
Look at that!
Oh!
You haven't exchanged them for others at some point, have you?
Have you seen that this is impossible?
I haven't touched them at any time.
And Sonoko, who was blindfolded, drew the pictures.
You win.
I'll put wood on the fire in the bathroom.
Don't get angry, woman.
Do you know where we keep the wood?
I'll wake up.
You showed me the shelter first.
We still have the sign of the cross.
The splendid master of ceremonies...
is our friend Katsuki!
Eh ?!
What do you think, I didn't want it.
Let's see, let's see?
Wow!
My name doesn't appear.
Your name appears, Toshiya!
The thing is clear.
It's strange.
You have to close yourself in the room and think games!
And try not to leave any details!
What a stick...
Caram, what do we do now?
I haven't been in a group for years, since I was a listener.
Don't worry, after all, you're just a substitute.
I'll go to the cellar to choose a good wine.
Sugamo, prepare something simple for a snack, please.
So far, none!
Sonoko, you can go check on that boy with the cold.
Sure, I'll be right there.
-And if we lend a table, Katsuki? -Yes.
What, how is he feeling, Conan?
Well, his fever has gone down a lot thanks to Katsuki's medicine.
What a rest!
Sonoko, I don't see him as a bad person for you to be disappointed.
The fact that he is a medical student makes him a bit attractive.
I wish you could have seen Toshiya's magic!
He messed up a bit in the end, but it was fantastic!

It seems to me that he's going to do something special, Ran.
But it's that in Conan...
He'll be fine!
Besides, his fever is down.
He won't die for a couple of hours.
Ah, he must have finished the preparations.
Yes, bird, come and see.
Where are the others?
The master of ceremonies, in Toshiya, is thinking tricks in the room!
And Yoshinori is in the cellar.
Uuuh!
How cold! Ah, he's here.
The Escapist King and The Shadow have not yet arrived.
Since they can't suffer each other, they'll be fighting.
They can't suffer each other?
No.
One day they made a big fuss.
Au, boys, we don't talk about unpleasant things.
The Shadow and the head, The Escapist King, will be here soon, for sure.
He won't come.
Co... Conan!
Because she was murdered early this morning in her house.
Murder?!
What do you mean, Conan?
This gentleman's name was Tsutomu Nishiyama, right?
Yes.
Well, he's dead.
They gave the news on the radio.
I rushed back to tell you.
You're all in danger.
Why should we be?
Because on the victim's computer screen, there was a message.
It said: "First, the first victim... The Shadow."
-What?! - What?!
Toshiya wanted to intervene in the disputes, and he got involved.
We have to explain it to him too.
Toshiya?
Toshiya, come in.
Eh?
It is not...
(Thinking) "The window is open."
"It can't be."
"It doesn't seem to have fallen."
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Look at that.
Isn't it Toshiya? It can't be.
(Thinks) "This is incredible!"
Toshiya!
What happened to you, Toshiya?!
Don't come closer!
There's nothing we can do.
He's already dead.
He can't be.
We can't touch anything from the scene.
The scene? This is curious.
The body is more than 10 meters away from the shelter,
and around it, only Katsuki's footprints are left.
But then... you mean...?
I mean that no human being has wings, it's impossible to commit such a crime!
It's an impossible crime!

DETECTIVE CONAN
You have found out the identity of the Shadow ?!
One of the people in the shelter
has used his secret access code and sent messages.
What is this?
The arrow!
My God!
Who is there?
It's coming out!
Come in! Out of the window!
The case of the murder of the friends of magic (Suspicions)
The clue to the next Conan is... The sails of a yacht!
In the next, the challenge of an impossible crime!
Let's go out!
You won't know the outcome until the end!
