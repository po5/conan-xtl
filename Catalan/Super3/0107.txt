DETECTIVE CONAN
The Case of the Mystery of Mogra, the Alien, Part 1
Mitsuhiko, is there a place nearby where we can play baseball?
Yes, there is.
(Thinking) We could also play soccer, don't you think?
Here we are!
-What?!
-Now I don't understand you.
It is here.
But it's the works of an apartment building.
That's right.
But it's been half a month since they suspended the works.
So we'll play here?
Yes!
You can't get in here because it's locked,
but yesterday I found another entrance.
Follow me!
(Think) Why?
It's here!
Oh!
There's a hole!
-Have you burst it, Mitsuhiko?! - No!
I didn't do it!
He crashed a car.
Fixeu's to it, see the car oil impregnated in the fence?
Surely the car hit the fence.
Let's go inside, guys!
I'm going in first.
Oh!
It's huge!
Hey, pull a little more, guys!
(Think) Do yourself a favor and get on a diet!
This cap will be our goal!
I'll be the batter!
-Me, pitcher! -Me, inside catcher!
Message received, I've got to be the outfielder, right?
Guys, let's go!
YIII! Yes...
Conan, we don't feel you!
SIII!
Okay, let's start, Genta!
Let's start, Genta!
Yes, pull!
Conan, it's coming your way!
(thinks) "Funny, I'm just here to pick up balls.
"But, whichever way you look at it, we're doing something illegal.
"If someone were to find us here...
"What is it, that?
We're lost!
It's looking at us with binoculars!"
Ah, what a mess!
It's gone beyond the fence!
-Maybe it's gone to the other side.
Yes, there's quite a chance it has gone.
We ask the people in the house to let us take the ball.
Yeah, let's do this.
That looks like the back door.
The main entrance will be on the main street.
What if we get a stubborn as a mule?
We can't tell what he looks like, but someone was looking at us with binoculars.
-With binoculars? -So there is someone!
Hurry up, let's go!
Surely he's ended up in this garden.
It looks like a haunted house.
A haunted house wouldn't face the main street.
Hey, Conan.
What name does it say, up there?
Oh, it says Watanuki, Yoshikazu Watanuki.
Wow.
Looks like it's coming out.
(Genta) It's scary!
Co... Conan, you speak in them.
You have the body of a giant but you're shy.
Excuse me, we dropped the ball in your garden.
Can we catch it?
You pupils of Teitan elementary school?
Yes.
I won't allow you to enter my garden!
I told you to leave!
Will you... wait, please!
Without the ball we can't...
This is what he gets for playing baseball there.
If I see you again, I'll talk to the school!
It's not right.
He wasn't a difficult man, but a difficult grandfather.
He had no trouble letting us into the garden.
Damn it!
Give me back my ball!
There's nothing we can do about it.
It's our fault for trespassing in a place where it was forbidden to enter.
It's your fault, Mitsuhiko!
Pay for the ball!
Guys, let's go play with the console at Conan's house.
Yes, good idea, Ayumi, then we'll get a snack.
-I'm really looking forward to it. Snack?
Hey, he's got a scary face!
-So, shall we go? -Yes, let's go!
What?
There's somebody.
There is.
Must be a customer.
Listen, sir...
(Thinking) You have terrible features.
Looking for Kogoro Mouri?
Who are you?
I live here, I'll guide you.
I'm home!
Hello, Conan.
Ah, good morning.
(At the same time) We come to play!
I've got that group of heavies again.
Kogoro, you have a customer.

A customer?
Good morning, my name is Koda!
A month ago, my little sister disappeared.
Don't run so fast, come closer and follow up quietly.
Ran, go make some tea.
Yes.
I'm sorry, can you stay out a little longer?
Ouch.
We're out of luck! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Do you want me to find out where he is?
No!
She was murdered!
It was a man named Watanuki!
Watanuki?
When you say Watanuki, you mean Yoshikazu Watanuki?
Do you know him?
We don't know him, but we-we just found her.
The ball in Genta has fallen into his garden.
He told us: "I won't let you enter the garden!"
Because he has buried the body of my little sister!
(All) What?!
Wait a moment.
Speak to me with some more order.
I've seen this gentleman somewhere else!
But I don't remember where it was.
My name is Masao Koda.
My little sister and I were born in Saku City.
Ah, Saku!
It's where the daisy road is.
My sister was very fond of daisies.
This is Sanae, the little sister.
Oh, wow, she was a very pretty woman.
Mitsuhiko) She looks nothing like her older brother.
She has very white skin.
Casum...
My sister came to Tokyo 6 years ago
to work in a financial company.
She was promoted to Beika branch manager.
On the 8th of last month, she was supposed to meet a client.
She left and nothing more has been heard.
Are you sure that client was Mr. Watanuki?
That's right.
Two days later, I went to Tokyo,
and the next day I found out what had happened.
What time did your sister leave the company?
At eight o'clock.
She said she would stop by Watanuki's house before going home.
Why go so late?
According to the branch manager,
Watanuki's stock had gone down a lot,
and he demanded that my sister compensate her.
An indemnity to cover the losses, then.
And you went to see Mr. Watanuki?
Yes, on the 11th, together with the branch manager.
Mr. Watanuki said my sister hadn't gone.
But that was a lie!
My sister went and refused to compensate him!
And Watanuki, in a rage, murdered her and buried her!
Sir, why do you think he has her buried in the garden?
I have two proofs.
The first is that Watanuki doesn't have a driver's license.
And without a car, it's impossible for him to take the body very far.
And the other, that at 2:00 a.m. on the morning of the 9th,
an office worker felt that someone was digging a ditch with a shovel.
A ditch?
It's a man who lives nearby, and his name is Mochida.
That night, on the main street,
they were doing construction work from 12 o'clock until 3 o'clock.
Watanuki took advantage of the noise to open the ditch.
Yes... And listen, did you tell the police?
Of course I told them!
But Mr. Mochida was drunk that night,
and the police judged him to be an unreliable witness.
It all turned out to be a mere formality.
Watanuki lives alone in that house,
and since that night he has hardly gone out at all,
except every Saturday morning.
At 10 o'clock he leaves for Beika Central Hospital.
And then, Mr. Mouri... here's what we will do:
Tomorrow, Saturday, come with me to that man's house.
I want you to investigate where he buried my sister's body!
I will dig up the body.
Do you want us to sneak into Mr. Watanuki's garden?
-Yes! We can't do that!
Entering someone else's garden is a crime.
No matter how good a detective I am,
I can't find out on such short notice where he buried the body a month ago.
Mr. Koda?
Understood.
I've had enough!
Mr. Koda...
I'm sorry to have disturbed you when you were so busy!
I... sir!
I remember!
It's identical in Mogra the alien!
On... Mogra?
The alien?
Now that you mention it, he looks a lot like him.
In Mogra he pretended to be Yaiba's partner and tricked him!
And he came out from underground as in Mogra the alien.
Of course he did!
That's why he wanted to dig the garden.
(Thinking) Hey, he doesn't give a damn....
Father, will you leave things as they are?
What else can I do?
He himself said he'd let it go.

Besides, it is so much for Mr. Watanuki to accuse if he has no proof.
As for the noise of the shovel,
it could be that it was from the construction work being done in the street.
That's true, but still...
Well, I'll try to look into it anyway.
(He thinks) "Kogoro is partly right.
"Today we can't know anything for sure.
(Genta) All right, decided!
(At once) Yes, yes, let's go!
"This gives me a bad feeling....
I knew it, they wanted to come here."
First, we must think of some way to get in.
I'm sure the door is locked.
Wow!
It's unlocked.
What luck!
I'm sure it's out!
Come on, now it's ours!
Hey, guys!
At first glance we can't tell where he buried it.
We don't even know if he really buried it here!
Then, we'll dig holes in the garden!
I'll go get the shovel!
Hey, Genta!
What are you kids doing!
Mr. Koda has also driven us upside down.
Please explain.
Mr. Watanuki lost 1.5 million on the stock.
You mean this is enough motive to murder someone?
In fact, he's right...
But that man takes it for granted that Mr. Watanuki is the killer,
and he's been following him for about a month.
From our point of view, Mr. Katanuki is the victim.
Excuse us, please!
We wanted to look for the ball and we have entered without permission!
Excuse us! (At the same time) Sorry!
It's the same.
Before I was nervous too, I'm sorry I booed you.
If you are looking for the ball, I have found it before.
If you promise me that you will not enter more in the works, I will come back to you.
Yes!
We promise!
Wait a moment.
(Answering machine) "You have a message.
(Man) "This is Beika General Hospital.
Remember that tomorrow is your visiting day and you must come to the office."
Eh?
This voice... Xxxxt.
This was extra!
You don't need to tell me, I already know!
It has!
Emporteu's-e-la and leave immediately!
S... yes.
I do not understand, as soon as he smiles as soon as he gets annoyed again.
That gentleman is a lunatic.
But the voice of the answering machine...
Yes... It sounded like Mr. Koda's voice.
-Huh?
Mr. Koda?
-At Mogra the alien?
I have no doubt.
In Koda wants to dig up the body while grandfather is in the hospital.
(He thinks) "But I wonder if there really is a corpse, here.
"And even if there were,
it is impossible to determine in less than two hours the place where he is buried.
"What's the matter?
What's on your head, Mr. Koda?"
Conan, what time is it now?
It's 7 minutes to 10 o'clock.
(Think) I have not been able to convince them...
Genta, you have door TNA shovel very big.
To help Mogra the alien to dig up the body.
And you, Conan, what do you plan to do?
I want to stop the feet of Mr. Koda.
To break into someone else's house like that is illegal.
(Open the gate)
Mitsuhiko, you will follow the master!
If he decides to come back halfway, you'll inform the Detective League.
Yes, okay...
In Mogra the alien is not coming.
Conan, what time is it now?
Ten past ten.
(Siren)
It's Inspector Megure!
Maybe something has happened.
I'm going to see!
Hey, Conan!
Conan!
Mr. Inspector, please come in.
Inspector Megure!
Ah, Mouri!
Please come in.
It's a holdup at gunpoint.
Yes.
The robbery took place 7 minutes ago.
Don't tell me you were present at the scene.
Well, not exactly, Inspector.
I just happened to be passing by.
Ah.
For a moment I thought you were also a witness.
Inspector!
The cameras have recorded the face of the robber.
It's a man you know.
What do you say?
We'll talk about it.
Now get inside!
Inspector, it's this man.
Ah!
This man...!
Who the hell is he, Mouri?
(Don Koda?!
I know him.
This man's name is Masao Koda!
But why should he rob a jewelry store?
How strange.
He has fled after stealing dozens of precious stones.
We found the robber's motorcycle near Beika station!
What?! What?!
The license plate number matches the witnesses' statements.
Inspector Megure!

This was found on the stairs of the station.
A precious stone?
It is obvious, the robber has fled along the circular line from the station.
Take emergency measures with the passengers.
The others continue to gather information from the surrounding area.
(Think) "Mr. Koda has deceived us,
just like the Ayumi in Mogra the alien said?
"But why?
"That story that his sister was murdered is a fabrication?
"Besides, how can it be understood that a person who had everything prepared?
commits a crime in the open
without worrying about putting on a ski mask?
"And why would he leave the getaway vehicle in plain sight?
"It's a leaf!
"And besides, it's a young leaf that has practically just fallen.
"If it's here, it means that someone has opened this trap door not long ago.
"Wait!
"In front of the back door of Watanuki Lime there's also one.
What if Mr. Koda's real target was...?"

DETECTIVE CONAN
-It's that gentleman! -It's in Mogra the alien!
In the first district of Beika, please come on!
Genta, he's going there by cab.
Sir, Mr. Watanuki will be here right away.
(Thinking) If my deductions are correct, Mr. Koda...
And the next chapter...
The Case of the Mystery of Mogra the Alien, Part Two
-The clue to the next Conan is: -A manhole cover!
In the next chapter: Inspector Takagi opens a hole!
(Man) I was in Mogra?
