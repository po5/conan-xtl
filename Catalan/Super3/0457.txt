Resplendent!
I will always be your partner!
A handkerchief causes quite a stir on a shoot.
He looks like a kid, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

Conan, be careful!
Don't do it if you can't!
Okay, okay, okay.
Hey, hey, hey!
Struçot of the glasses!
How do you have it?
(Think) "What a drag!"
"I can't find it. Are you sure it's this tree?"
You mean it could be? You can say it!
Do you think this estruçot will know how to look for it?
Woman, that's not what I meant.
"Come on... Is it really here?"
Conan, what, you find it?
Have you found... the Sonoko's handkerchief?
You have my handkerchief?
It's red!
A red one!
This red handkerchief is very important to me!
Look for it, will you?
"Well, you'd better hold on to it, bouquet!"
I don't see it!
Instead!
How strange... Mmmm...
Oh!
I had... it seemed to me that the air had carried it away
and that it had been caught in this tree...
Wow! Yes?
What have you got?
Did you find it?
No, I found it, but...
"A handkerchief that flies away doesn't tie itself to a branch."
Speak up!
Have you found it?
You haven't found it?
Make it clear at once! So-Sonoko...
Answer me, you glasses struçot!
Don't tell me that thing you're stepping on...
Eh?
Step on what?
What are you talking about?
Oh!
Ouch...!
Oh, mother...
Eh... Ran... He-he-he-he-he...
So-Sonoko...
Yeah, looks like we found her.
Ah... Co... Conan.
Conan Edogawa, handsome... Of it... Conan, handsome...
Sonoko'S RED HANDKERCHIEF, (PART ONE)
(Sonoko: croons) Girl!
Girl, answer me!
(Continues humming) Oysters!
Sonoko!
Please!
You could start explaining it to us, couldn't you?
Why did we come to this maple forest all of a sudden?
Come on!
"Heavy!"
Apa, look at this red handkerchief.
Don't you know what it is just by looking at it?
The scarf?
Red?
No, no idea...
Ran, then, at least you must know the title?
The title?
"The Winter of the Maples"!
The Winter of the Cherry Trees.
Ah, you mean the soap opera about lovers...
that was all the rage last year?
Yes, that's right!
Eh?
But..., you didn't see it?
Yes, you... you liked these series.
Ah...
It's just that on another channel they were showing Yoko Okino's music program
at the same time.
And the father taped it while watching it.
Your father... always obsessed with Yoko Okino.
So what's that?
What does that red scarf have to do with the TV series?
Eh?
Well, if I tell you, I'm sure you won't understand.
What do you think I'll explain it to you?
"Come on..."
It's a love story
between an heiress of a rich family and a young army officer.
And what a story!
"The first time they meet,
"the young officer grabs the girl's handkerchief
"From the tree where it had been snagged."
"Next, when the two of them have fallen in love with each other,
"A wicked high officer who envies them.
"Blames the young officer for something he had not done..."
"And becomes a fugitive who does not know where he has ended up."
"Later, when the war is about to end..."
"A telegram arrives from him in which he says:
" 'I will wait for you on the morning of the first day under the maple trees!"
Wait, by that the first day he meant New Year's Day, right?
In winter, the maples wither and become leafless.
Exactly...
That girl was also clear about where the mountain of maples was
where they met,

"But he didn't know exactly where they were to be seen.
"And he was searching alone in the middle of that snowy mountain."
"But, predictably, all that was there were withered trees."
"Just as it was impossible to see
"the reddish leaves of the maples on New Year's Eve,
"He thought it meant that they would never be seen again.
"And, therefore, that there was no need to wait for her."
"When she had given up and was about to return home...
"She found it!"
"Bound to the branch of a withered tree in that wintry landscape,
"There was a red handkerchief."
Yes, this red handkerchief!
"Then, under that tree, the couple were reunited,
"They ran away together..."
and lived happily ever after.
How nice!
And then, that young officer was a strong boy with dark skin,
and he had a sincere and manly way of speaking.
Did he remind you of your boyfriend? Yes, he did!
That's right!
The other day I bought the DVD and I was hooked!
This love story between the rich heiress
and the strong, dark-skinned young officer...
is very similar to the story we have in Makoto and me!
So I wanted to imitate that series
and I wanted to come to this mountain where the filming took place.
You know that!
I've also come to put my scarf on.
Of course you did!
This way, maybe you'll be able to meet Kyogoku again, right?
But if you put it up without asking for permission, someone might screw it up.
No problem!
I'll just put up a scarf, no one will notice.
I think so.
What's that for?
And why is that, kiddo?
Would you know, maybe?
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh... W-wait...
Don't smoke!
This is full of red handkerchiefs!
Sonoko, was this the place that they used
to film the scene in that series?
Well, at the last scene, there was the young officer waiting for her,
leaning against this huge stone.
Beautiful.
"I mean, a lot of people have had the same thought as you."
And now, what am I going to do?
I had already written an email to him, to in Makoto, about it!
I put:
"I'll wait for you under the reddish winter leaves.
"The night of nights."
What can I do?
Sonoko, you love to send cryptic messages like this.
But you can be found!
With all the handkerchiefs hanging there you can be sure.
If you wait here... Eh?
So-Sonoko.
If he doesn't meet me under my scarf it won't make any sense, you know?
Now that you mention it, I found another one earlier.
What did you see?
In the tree where I climbed before,
there was a red handkerchief tied to a branch.
Don't smoke!
But if it was superallunyat of this place!
It could be that on this mountain,
all the maples that are there have handkerchiefs tied to the branches!
Where is it supposed to...?
Where is it supposed to wait for me in Makoto?!
"Rather, the problem will be....
"That the guy who's into martial arts will come to understand
"That the winter of the maples refers to this place."
Very well, then!
Then, let's go!
Got it, glasses struçot.
Hold this!
Yes.
Okay, okay, okay.
Ran, ajuda'm.
Yes.
Untie all the red scarves
that are hanging on this mountain!
What?
But, Sonoko!
The fate we have in Makoto and I is totally at stake!
Sonoko... Sonoko.
"You mean you do well done?"
(Think) "Makoto..."
Sonoko, what will you take wrong!
Sonoko!
Please forgive me.
This happened because of me.
I was going to take out all those handkerchiefs
because they obstruct the view of the maple leaves, right?
Yes, well...
By the way, why do you say it's your fault?
Oh!
Don't tell me you're the author of "Winter of the Maples".
I'm a big fan!
No, I'm just part of the film crew.
I'm an assistant.
"Gee, he's not the author..."
Sorry I didn't live up to your expectations.
Oh, no!
And now!
Isn't it? Well...
But the scriptwriters asked if anyone knew of any mountains
where they could find some nice maple trees
that could be used for the series,
and I introduced them to this place.
I grew up in this region, in the middle of the countryside,

and when he was a little boy he often came to play in these woods.
"Then, while I was looking for a place to shoot,
"I found a red handkerchief tied to the branch of a maple tree."
"When I told the scriptwriters about it...,"
they decided to use it
and they rewrote it to the way it is now.
They did? Really?
So, it became a big hit,
and a lot of people started coming to this mountain.
Some to go free camping
and others to tie scarves on tree branches.
The owner is very angry.
He says to me, "What, are they going to leave me a mountain full of scarves?"
Poor guy.
How awful...
"What a face you have."
But, on the other hand, the number of visitors has grown,
and the owners of the stores in town...
and guesthouse owners are overjoyed.
Normally, people only came here for tourism...
when the maple season arrived.
That's why all the calls...
that come to the television network and the town halls close by...
end up falling on me and it's exhausting.
They ask me, "What's that mountain?"
Or, "Tell us how to get to the location of the last scene."
I even got a call from a fan today
to take him to the place where "The Winter of the Maples" originated,
who wanted to know which was the tree where he had seen that handkerchief tied.
And since the morning I've been looking for it....
It must be hard... And so much.
Hey, excuse me, can you leave a message for me at a place?
It's just that I forgot the phone number of that admirer.
Enough copying something
in the message book of the Akagi Guesthouse,
in front of the station, I'd appreciate it.
Put: "I have already found the tree you asked for;
"Meet me at the rock
"Which was used in the last scene, please."
Today I had arranged to meet that admirer at that boarding house,
but this thing of going down the mountain to meet a person...
and back up again to guide her, I think it would be too much for me.
Ah... no problem.
But then, maybe we should put his name in the message.
Yes, that's right!
My name is... Hotzumi.
If... you write it in katakana, I'm sure you'll understand.
Shall we write it in katakana?
Yes.
I've only spoken to this person on the phone,
but it seems that he is a big fan of the series
and he told me that he's been to this place a lot of times.
This morning he checked into the guesthouse
and told me he was looking forward to it,
so I'm sure he'll know right away.
I told him that if anything happened,
I'd leave him a note in that notebook at the boarding house.
If you can do me this favor...
Ah!
Yes... Ah!
Yes...
(Sonoko) About it...
"I have already found the tree... you asked me for;
"Meet me at the rock
"That was used in the last scene of the series, please."
"Hotzumi."
Yes, I don't see any problem.
Hey, Sonoko!
Let's get something to eat!
I'm really hungry.
Yes, let's go.
Conan, what do you want to eat? Yes!
What's that?
You're coming too?
"Naturally, silly."
What?
Again in Kitada?
But this is already harassment!
You see.
And he compliments you again?
What a pain in the ass?
If he tries to do anything to you, I'll make him pay!
Who is this Kitada?
So I gave pumpkin to Kitada.
Sonoko, what's wrong?
You've been petrified with your chopsticks in your hand for a while...
What's wrong with you?
Sonoko... Sonoko.
I knew it.
I will go.
Go, but where?
Instead of abans.
Eh?
To hang this handkerchief.
What? You want to go now?
You want to go now?
"Here we go with the little whims of the rich girl."
If it were you, wouldn't you care?
It's just an example,
but, Ran, let's say you were to meet Shinichi...
"And you told him you'd be dressed in a red suit,
"and a pretty girl who was also wearing red would fish..."
"And, then, you show up at the place you had agreed upon, you find him..."
"But it turns out that you had been careless
"That you had to wear a red suit."

"It would be terrible."
Now we find ourselves in a similar situation, don't you think?
"But what s'empatolla, this Sonoko?"
Come on, Sonoko!
Right now!
What?
Yes!
"Wow, she really let herself be dragged in a hurry."
But, Sonoko, if everyone wears a red scarf...
and hangs it everywhere on this mountain,
it will be very difficult for him to know which scarf is yours.
No problem!
Look!
I've made my name big
and I plan to put it as if it were a badge!
This way, he's sure to find it on Makoto!
"This isn't even close, not even close,
"In the romanticism of 'Winter of the Maples'."
Sonoko... Sonoko... Mm?
What's the matter?
Hey, it's getting... getting dark and we'll still get a ghost.
You mean? Yes.
So, let's hurry them up.
We'll be there soon.
"An agenda?"
"This diary..."
Excuse me, this here...
It was carried by that assistant we met earlier, wasn't it?
That's right.
He must have dropped it? Yes.
"There's a bloodstain on the calendar."
"It looks like they wanted to mark it with a bloodstained finger."
"But why does it mark April 1st?"
"And it also looks like... it's wet."
Nothing.
We take the diary and bring it to the police station when we come down later.
Yes, we will.
Let's go.
Conan.
Yes... I'm coming.
"Blood?"
"It hasn't dried yet!"
"It can't be!"
What are you doing?
Co-Conan!
This struçot with glasses has touched my ass!
Ah!
"Oh, what a pain!"
You see?
That's what you get for running like that, all of a sudden!
Oh!
Ran, what's wrong?
(At the same time: they call out)
This gentleman... he's the one from before, right? That's right.
He's the owner of the diary...
Who asked us to leave the note.
"The body is still warm."
"It hasn't even been half an hour since she was killed."
"Mmmm? There's dirt under the fingernails."
"Dirt under the fingernails? Why?"
It... listen...
Maybe we'd better call the police, huh?
Uh... Yes.
Hello?
Shall I talk to the police?
"Dirt under the fingernails..."
"The bloodstain on the calendar in the diary..."
"April 1st..."
"What did Mr. Hotzumi mean by all this?"
Eh?
Yes, a man has been stabbed...
with something that looks like a knife and he's on the ground.
(Wind: whistle)
"Here... Here is someone..."
"And, even more..."
"Not just one or two people..."
"What will happen?"
"Now I understand."
"Winter the maples 'what I was doing was pointing to this place!"
What else will happen to us?
Conan...
Estruçot of the glasses!
Who are all these people?
And the next Conan: "The red handkerchief of the Sonoko, (2nd part)."
