Have you seen this?
It's full of fantastic figurines!
And all these models are spectacular!
It's amazing!
Isn't it?
This is from Masahiro Kitajima.
He's the best model designer in the whole country.
Hm.
But it's all so small that I don't see the point.
Ah.
Well, that's too bad.
You just don't understand, Genta.
And you, Conan, do you like them?
The miniature of the train doesn't say much to me,
but all these trees are spectacular.
Yes, the truth is that this model is very well done.
Now I like you, Conan!
Masahiro considers you a genius at recreating the details of nature.
In addition, they have decided...
that the exhibition of this year's international tournament will be at...
Eh?
That's him!
That's him!
Isn't it Masahiro Kitajima?
How does he do it, to make all these impressive models?
The truth is that the first thing I do is to look for models.
This is the most important thing.
Having a good model is basic.
Of course, the important thing is to have the model.
(Woman) Hello, Masahiro.
Ah.
Reika.
You've come.
Yes.
I knew it was an important day for you.
(Kitajima) What are you doing?
Can't you see there are people watching?
(man) -Hey?
- (man) Hey, listen.
Don't you want to see my figurines?
Oysters!
Look at them!
And I find these colors beautiful.
He-he!
Thank you very much.
I guess you already know this,
but right now this robot is the most popular robot in the anime world.
Eh?
I haven't slept all night to make it.
Isn't it cool?
-Huh?
-How can you be so childish?
"Well, yes, you've seen it,
today, the convention hall is organizing the Model Festival."
"And, obviously, we couldn't miss it."
Kage wo mau col no kodou ga seijaku no umi wo saite

"The light of reason can pierce through the shadows
and also the deepest darkness."
"A crime in the convention hall. The secret of the models gets complicated."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"A model too perfect."
Come on, Mitsuhiko, let's go home, I'm starving.
Wait a minute.
Let's see what color would be best to paint the Kamen Yaiba...
-Aaah!
- (Woman) Aaaaah!
(Woman) Auxiiiili!
(Mitsuhiko) Conan!
Aah... aah...
Eh? (woman)
-Eh?!
-Eh?
Hey, Conan, what are you doing?
(Think, see Shinichi) "A single stab wound to the chest."
Isn't it...?
At Masahiro!
(Thinking, seeing Shinichi) -Hey?
Get out of the way!
Stop!
Ah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Aah!
Aah!
Are you all right, Ayumi?
Yes, nothing happened to me.
Thanks to Ay, he saved me.
Relax, man, you don't need to suffer so much.
Okay, understood.
She felt a woman calling,
he came running here and saw Kitajima dead on the ground.
With God it went like that, right?
Yes, we found her, we were the first ones.
The victim, then, is this Masahiro Kitajima.
That's right.
He's one of Japan's top model designers.
Of... of models?
And a professional plastic figurine maker.
Ah... Ah, very good, very good, perfect.
Thank you very much for everything.
You can go now.
We're not going anywhere, we're staying here.
-Yes, thanks to the Haibara. -Yes, thanks to the Haibara.
-We've caught the murderer.
Inspector Megure, we'll take Mr. Hiroto to you.
We'll take you Mr. Hiroto.
It's him!
It's him!
He's the one who died at Masahiro Kitajima!
-Ah!
Ouch!
-Hm!
(Takagi) It's Mr. Kenji Hiroto,
he says he's the editor of a model making magazine.
Yes, that's right.
Is that correct, Mr. Hiroto?
And I've already told the agents that...

I had only come to interview Masahiro Kitajima.
So, why did you run out of this room?
Because I got scared.
I got scared when I saw Masahiro Kitajima like that.
This... this man is not the perpetrator of the murder.
He's right.
And we didn't find the murder weapon on him either.
Eh?
By the way, Mr.
Agasa,
I don't find it very convenient for you to see all this, these children.
I'll take them.
Come on, let's go.
-Come on, come on, don't complain so much.
-There's no right.
-I'm so sorry, you scoundrel.
They should let us stay.
By the way, Inspector Takagi,
Have you been able to calculate how long he's been dead?
in Masahiro Kitajima, when we found her?
Yes, very recently, a few minutes ago.
And... do you know if he was killed with a knife?
Yes, yes, or with some knife-like object.
No.
But you haven't found him yet, have you?
In fact, we haven't finished looking for him yet.
The stewardess who came to bring you tea didn't have any?
No.
We searched him thoroughly and he wasn't carrying anything.
"The murder weapon hasn't turned up yet."
I'm convinced that the culprit is that man.
Is it?
No, it's not him.
It's only been a few minutes
between the time they died in Kitajima and the time we went in.
"If the murderer were him, he would have had the murder weapon on him..."
Or he would have hidden it somewhere in the room,
but it hasn't turned up in here.
I see what you mean.
So where is the weapon, then?
Inspector, I was told to come here.
What do you want?
Ah, yes, sorry.
The chief inspector wants to talk to you.
You don't mind waiting, do you?
Isn't it true that you're the one who makes those robots?
-Where were you, when it all happened? -Yes.
-Yes.
He's here, too, you?
W-well, it was... in the dressing room on the other side of the corridor.
Then I felt a lady calling,
and when I came out of the room, I saw the stewardess,
and then I found out what had happened to Masahiro Kitajima.
And then he stayed all the time with that stewardess?
Eh?
Yes, Conan, yes, then he stayed with the stewardess.
Did you check if there were any knives in the waiting room?
Yes.
We also inspected it and there was nothing.
"So, it wasn't him either."
Ah.
Hello, Mr. Morishita.
Mr. Hiroto, I'm sure it was you who died in Masahiro!
What?
What?
What? What?
What are you saying?
The interviews you do are outrageous.
He uses details of the designers' lives to discredit them.
Masahiro had already done it to you once.
He was warning all of us not to accept interviews with you.
Of course, and this from the dead fly.
You are even more suspicious.
Do you think I don't know that you left him a lot of money in Kitajima?
He was returning them little by little.
How many years did he have left to pay off the debt?
(Morishita) Will you please shut up?!
Masahiro!
Is it true that Masahiro has been murdered?
You can't go in!
(Kameyama) Masahiro!
Masahiro!
But, how can it be!?
-Hm?
-Finally the culprit appears.
Ah, but they are Kenji Hiroto and Shunichi Morishita!
-Eh?
-I understand that you have murdered her.
You should watch what you say.
I know you were not well with Kitajima, because he wanted to separate from you.
And now!
On the contrary.
In fact, I don't know if you knew...
that Masahiro and I were about to get married.
Come on!
Isn't it true that you heard it too, what I said?
Eh?
Eh... Yes.
Doctor Agasa, please take the scoundrel away.
Understood.
Come on, come on, let's go.
Come on, don't complain so much and let's go home.
Now that things were starting to get interesting...
Surely we should find out who the culprit is.
And they make us leave.
Hey.
Where's Conan?
Hey...
What?
Miss Reika Kameyama,
where were you, exactly, at the time of the incident?
It was outside.
First we met in the living room,
but then Masahiro sent me a message...
telling me to wait for you on the esplanade by the river bank,
next to the salon.

I waited for him for a while, but when I saw that he wasn't coming, I went to his dressing room and I found him..,
I went to his dressing room and found him...
It's true.
Masahiro Kitajima sent a message from his cell phone to Miss Kameyama.
from his cell phone to Miss Kameyama.
It's from 11:25.
That is, 10 minutes before the murder.
Therefore, it means that En Masahiro Kitajima was murdered...
shortly after he sent this message.
Eh?
Hey, Conan...
What do you say they do?
I don't know, but there's all these agents looking for something.
-Yeah, but I can't reach it. -Yeah, but I can't reach it.
-Do you see it or not?
What's going on?
What? What?
What's happened?
What are you looking for?
Nothing, just that a while ago we saw that there's something
between the drinks machine and the wall, but we didn't get there.
I'm much smaller than you.
Maybe I'll get there.
Let me try.
Aix... Iiih....
"But if it's..."
Pass me a handkerchief, Genta.
You have one.
Ah... Come on.
I've got it, Genta.
Stretch it out.
All right.
Ooh!
This is...
a bloodstain.
Miss Kameyama,
could you tell us if this jewel rings any bells?
Ah!
Of course it does.
It's mine.
There are traces of blood
and the scientists have analyzed it
and they say it's Masahiro Kitajima's blood.
Well, t-the truth is that I lost it yesterday.
I lost it and I hadn't seen it since.
In the evening.
What time did you lose her?
She brought you some flowers to congratulate you and I lost her.
Excuse me, ah... now I just remembered that...
that... last night I-I saw them.
(Kameyama) No.
You can't leave me.
But why?
Because I'll become more and more famous as a designer
and I'll have to go around the world.
And you'll just be an obstacle.
What a nerve!
And you thought that from the beginning?
-You're so cruel...
He-he-he!
I'll never forgive you.
I'm going to kill you.
Miss Kameyama, is this true?
Yes..., yes it's true,
but I haven't killed Masahiro.
Ha-ha-ha!
So it was you in the end.
Let me guess how it went?
Before, when you received the message,
she got angry because she thought I wanted to tell her that I wanted to leave her,
he went to see her and they started arguing again.
Then he left the convention hall immediately,
he threw the gun into the river and went around for a while pretending to wait for her.
It is possible.
Miss Kameyama, after all this we have just heard,
if you want, you still have time to modify your statement.
No, I already told you that it wasn't me.
Eh?
Oh!
So, the murderer is that girl?
I didn't expect that at all.
Neither did I.
Why do they always have to treat us like we're little children?
What a drag!
I think I've had enough because I'm so angry.
"The jewel... The bloodstain..."
(Hiroto) "There's something wrong."
(Hiroto) Hey, guys.
You're the one who stopped me, aren't you?
You're really fast.
Ah, thank you very much.
You mustn't come to make him pay for what he's done to you, now, must you?
-No, I'm not angry.
-Hey, do me a favor.
I know it may not look like it,
but I'm sad because I missed some news.
News?
Something related to Masahiro Kitajima?
Can you explain to us what this news is about?
Sorry, but you guys don't do anything.
Apa, bye!
Oooh...
Alright, alright, alright.
Wait, don't go.
What's the matter?
Think of Masahiro Kitajima as a hero, because of this scoundrel.
If he had any hidden secrets and he's in the know,
I'd be doing you a big favor if you'd explain them to him.
Hmmm... Sometimes it's better to keep the secret.
Maybe so, but in this particular case,
I think it would do them a lot better to know the truth.
He's right, what the hell.
Anyway, he's already dead.
There are rumors that Masahiro Kitajima,
to create his works, he used an anonymous designer.
-Really?
-What?
Yes, we all know that his imitations of nature...
are considered true masterpieces.
But, in fact,
at the beginning of his career he wasn't exactly like that.
It was a few years ago that he took a radical turn.
Besides, the truth is that no one has ever seen Masahiro Kitajima...
making one of his models.
Of course.
And you've been hiding in his dressing room.

to confirm whether this rumor was true or not, right?
Hm.
Exactly.
"Right."
"There's something that has caught my attention
since we entered the living room."
Oh...
What is it, Conan?
What are you up to?
I've got it.
Mitsuhiko, is this the same color...
that's on Masahiro Kitajima's model?
Is it?
It's the color of Kamen Yaiba.
It's the color I use to paint the Kamen Yaiba I'm making.
Let's see these roofs...
Yes, I have no doubt.
It's the same color.
"Ah... Now I get it, then."
But you're still around, you guys?
Au, go home.
Dr. Agasa... what's the meaning of all this?
Why did you make us all come here?
I'm sorry, I know it's all very sudden,
but there's a lot of things about this case
that I don't see very clearly.
First of all, this thing about Miss Kameyama's jewel...
that they found in the hallway.
They found Masahiro Kitajima's blood on it,
but if you look closely at the jacket she's wearing,
you'll notice that there's no blood visible on her.
Do you think it's possible that only the joy could have been stained by blood
and that nothing ended up on the jacket?
What are you suggesting?
That someone has left the jewel stained with blood on the ground there
with the intention of incriminating Miss Kameyama?
I don't know, I don't see it at all clear.
What is it?
There's something else that's strange.
And it has to do with Shunichi Morishita.
A-with me?
Yes.
Before, when we've met for the first time...
...he's the most popular in the anime world.
"...he told us that he had worked all night to finish the robots...
...and he was wearing the paint-stained sweater."
Yes, that's the one he's wearing.
Hm?
On the other hand...
Take a good look at these robots, please.
They're his, and they're painted in very bright colors,
very different colors from the stains on the sweater.
In Shunichi Morishita's paint box, on the other hand...
there were paint pots in the colors of the stains.
Like this one.
(Agasa voice) A color that, coincidentally, or maybe not,
Masahiro Kitajima had used on his model.
Rumor has it that in Masahiro had an anonymous designer
who made his works for him.
Shunichi, weren't you,
the designer who worked anonymously for Kitajima?
Yes, I confess it was me.
In Masahiro he forced me!
My mother is sick,
I needed money and he had left me.
But he asked me for such a high interest rate that the debt kept growing and I could not pay it.
and I couldn't pay it;
until one day he told me...
From now on, Shunichi, you will have to make all the models for me, okay?
Besides, Masahiro Kitajima was planning to...
to enter this year's international tournament with his work.
I understand that this did not amuse you at all.
And that's why you decided to kill him, right?
No.
No, it's not true.
I had nothing to do with his death.
But the way things have been going, no one would say that,
that you had nothing to do with it.
"Last night, by chance,
you saw Masahiro Kitajima and Miss Kameyama arguing."
"And he took the opportunity to pick up the jewel that fell to her
when she ran away."
"Today he died at Masahiro, he stained the jewel with blood....
"And threw it between the drink machine and the wall...
with the intention of framing Miss Kameyama."
He then entangled her by writing her that message...
and, by the way, he made sure he had a good alibi.
Hehehehehehe!
Hehehehehehehe!
Will you stop talking nonsense?
I guess you don't believe this ridiculous story, do you?
I didn't kill him.
Oh, and the murder weapon?
Where is the murder weapon?
I remind you that I have been searched and found nothing.
Masahiro Kitajima was considered a genius...
when it came to imitating all kinds of nature's details.
But, in fact, it turns out that the genius was you,
who was your anonymous designer.
Earlier we went through your paint box
and found this color.
It's natural green.
I know it because it is used by Kamen Yaiba.
In this room there is something that is exactly this color.
-To that thing over there!
-Does anyone know what I mean?
Aaah...
(Kameyama) I won't ever forgive you.
I'm going to kill you.

Masahiro Kitajima has told us before that the most important thing?
when making a model is to have a good model.
And you have found the perfect model when you have seen these flowers
that Miss Kameyama had brought.
Eh?
(metallic sound)
Eh? (metallic sound)
Now I understand.
She painted the gun green in order to commit the crime.
It was Masahiro's fault.
Because he forced me to make all his models.
That's why I did it.
It's not my fault.
(Cries)

And, on top of that, they gave us a lot of models.
Yes, isn't that nice?
But what will I do?
Ah.
What?
Here, Conan, for you.
(Mitsuhiko) I already have this one.
Here, you can make it for me.
I'm hungry.
Let's eat.
Hey.
Why don't I make them for you, the models?
As I see that no longer it comes to you of one, I also give you my.
It has.
How hungry!
Ay, ay!
But you guys, what did you think!?
Yes, man!
Now you're not coming at once, are you?

I ask you not to open it... until I have all seven of them.

A dead person?
It's obvious to me that this is a suicide.
No.
It could be a homicide.
