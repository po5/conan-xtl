It can't be!
But it's...
It's... it's a bomb!
This is Kurata, calling the Wakasa Coast Guard!
It's an emergency!
I've just found a ship full of explosive devices
hidden near sector 4!
(TV: male) "The following news brings us to the coast:
"Today the coast guard
discovered a suspicious ship near Maizuru Bay."
"It appears to contain devices..."
Yes.
Maizuru Bay is here, isn't it?
-Why do you say that?
That nothing happened?
Because a suspicious boat was found this morning.
- (Sonoko) Come on, guys.
-Suspicious about what?
Don't stay enchanted.
Move forward, the queue is moving.
Yes.
(Sonoko) Mm?
Let's see, father.
You're the adult of the group, you should be in charge of watching the children.
Don't be a pain, huh?
I only came along because you said you needed an adult.
You're going on an Aegis destroyer!
It doesn't happen every day, that!
And the odds of winning were one in ten.
If it were up to me, I'd be betting on the horses.
"Oh, Mother."
Oh!
"In Kogoro it's Kogoro, it's hopeless."
But, hey, what is it, an Aegis destroyer?
(Mitsuhiko) I know what it is!
Well, it's...
A warship with a weapons system
developed by the U.S. Navy.
(Mitsuhiko) -Yes.
That is, a super-strong ship.
A clear and simple explanation.
Ayumi, but you already like these ships?
But I do like the sea, and since it's our turn...
Very well said.
It's something that doesn't happen every day.
"This signal..."
(Clock: acoustic signal)
Leave the horses alone for a day, father.
Conan, where are you going?
All right, all right.
But hurry up, eh?
I'm going to the washroom for a moment.
They may call us at any moment.
(Shinichi voice) All right!
(Shinichi voice) What's wrong, doctor?
Nothing, I just wanted to see how it works...
the new satellite phone I've invented.
"But I'm not the sea; we haven't even boarded the ship yet."
Wow.
Well, gosh-darn it, they sure are slow, aren't they?
"Yes, with all the commotion this morning,
they must be doing a more thorough check of the passengers."
Oh, right.
"I know you made me the phone for the trip,
but maybe it's better if I don't use it."
By the way, did the Osaka meeting go well or what, doctor?
Yes.
Thanks to Ay, who helped me a lot.
We played a fantastic role.
That's good.
Well, when the maneuvers are over, we can get together, can't we?
Ah.
"By the way..."
I turn back to the queue.
"If you have to wait that long, the kids must be bored out of their minds, right?"
No, not really...
"Very well, then tell them this riddle!"
Now I understand the reason for the call.
Here we are..."
You must know by now that the name Aegis comes from the shield "aegis"
which, according to Greek mythology,
"Zeus gave to his daughter Athena so that she could fight evil."
"For it is said that, when Zeus fights the evil hydra, the monster will bite him for everything,
the monster grinds him all over his body with its sharp teeth."
"Now there is one place, just one, where he could not bite."
"Let's see if you can guess what."
One, the neck.
Two, the chest.
Three, the stomach.
Four, the waist.
Which of these four?
The doctor asked me to tell you this riddle,
to see if he gets it right.
But you can tell when you talked to the doctor, Conan?
Eh?
Ah, now, when I was going to the bathroom.
- (Mitsuhiko) I give up.
- (Ayumi) Oh, Conan, I don't know.
What's the answer?
What's the answer?
Four, the waist.
Because the waist "does stop".
Ah, another one of your bad jokes.
(Man) Next.
Present the participation postcard to enter.
-(Man) Hurray!
-Ah, finally it's our turn!
I've had enough of waiting!
(Sonoko) Hey, guys, no mail!
(Man) We kindly ask all passengers carrying bags or backpacks...
Please leave them open on top of the counters so that they can be checked.
Please be advised that cell phones are not allowed on board.
Please leave them stored here.
- (Mitsuhiko) How cool!
- (Genta) Wow!
It's huge!
Yes, it's huge!
(PA: male) "Dear passengers,

thank you for participating in the exhibition of these special maneuvers."
"My name is Inoue. I am in charge of guiding you through the destroyer today."
"My pleasure."
"Afterwards
I will tell you the details of what we will do during the maneuvers."
"First of all, please observe the plans on the screen."
"The parts marked in red
are the areas you are free to visit."
"The rest of the corridors and rooms are restricted access."
"You will find more information in the brochure we have given you."
"I will now tell you the schedule of the planned activities."
Sonoko, what time is it?
And your watch, Ran?
Well... let's see...
It broke and I had to have it fixed.
Until now I've been using my cell phone to tell the time, but...
Of course, since it's been requisitioned...
If you want, you can use my.
My digital camera has a clock.
What's that?
And how will you do it?
No problem.
"And that's because punctuality is vital, on a ship."
Come on, woman.
You've already felt it.
I really appreciate it, Mitsuhiko.
I really do.
You're welcome.
It's waterproof, so don't worry if it gets wet on deck.
And since it's a radiorellotge, it tells the time very accurately.
-Ah... You don't know what it is?
-A radiorellotge?
It's a watch that receives a radio signal
that tells it the correct time several times a day.
It receives signals at 5 o'clock in the morning and 5 o'clock in the evening.
-Huh?
I don't know this.
-And where do these signals come from?
Here it must be from Fukushima station.
How many things you know, Conan.
Oh, is that so?
It's... Shinichi told me.
-Hey?
What's the matter?
- (noise)
What's that?
It makes my hair stand on end...
- "Calm down, please. It's all right."
-What's wrong?
What happened?
"They just felt the drainage system."
"It makes this noise when it picks up large amounts of seawater."
"Calm down and follow up, please."
Do me a favor!
"Oh, by the way... I see that the mouth drainage system is not doing well for you."
"Be careful."
He-he-he-he... Gee, thanks.
He-he-he...
Father.
See once and for all, go!
"It's always the same."
"But... is the drainage system really making this noise?"
"...we must be about to leave Maizuru harbor."

DETECTIVE CONAN.
THE DETECTIVE TO THE DISTANT SEA
"I am teenage detective Shinichi Kudo."
"One day, I went to the amusement park with Ran Mouri.
"my best friend and classmate,
"And I witnessed a suspicious exchange
between two men dressed in black."
"I was so focused on watching those two men,
that I didn't realize there was another one behind me."
"He made me swallow a poison
"And, when I woke up....
(Conan voice)... my body had shrunk!"
"If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
they would want to kill me and the lives of those around me would be in danger."
"That's why Dr. Agasa
recommended that I hide my identity."
"When the Ran asked me what my name was,
I randomly told him I called myself Conan Edogawa."
"Since Ran's father is a detective,
"I decided to go live with them
to try to get information about the Men in Black."
"These are now my classmates:
Genta, Mitsuhiko and Ayumi."
"The three of them formed the Junior Detective League.
and, whether you like it or not, they got me in too."
"And then we got you in it, in Kogoro Mouri."
"I guess I don't even need to explain, do I?"
"These two devices are Dr. Agasa's inventions."
"The doctor made all kinds of incredible inventions for me
to help me after I became small."
"The belt that ejects footballs."
"All you have to do is push the button on the buckle
because it inflates a ball and ejects it on the spot."
"But this time the star invention is my watch.
"And the new features that are built in:
satellite phone and a USB stick."
"Now it's much more elaborate and much more impressive."
"By the way, there is someone...
who knows my real identity besides the doctor."
"It's the Ai Haibara. Her name is actually Shiho Miyano."
"At first she was just another companion of the Men in Black.
"But she took the same poison as me.

"In an attempt to run away from the organization
and her body also shrank."
"Thus, the Haibara stayed to live with the doctor....
"And now we both pass ourselves off
for ordinary first-graders."
Soc small, but I have the brain of an adult.
A detective who solves all mysteries!
The truth always ends up knowing!
"Ready for the anti-aircraft alarm!"
(Alarm)
Preparations ready.
"We are about to start the air combat drill."
"Have all the crew go to their places at once!"
(Inoue) Have people with small children stand in the front rows.
There is not much room, so they will have to be cramped.
Move forward to here.
This is the heart of an Aegis destroyer.
The combat information center, CIC.
(Spy radar has detected a target.
-Says it's coming this way?
-What?
-Of course...
-Just make it look.
Geez, kid, it doesn't scare me like that.
It's true.
They take it very seriously, don't they?
-It's supposed to be realistic.
-It doesn't look like they're acting, no.
30 degrees, 40 miles.
Target two coming right at us.
"We consider target two a threat."
"Prepare to engage immediately."
"Initiate anti-aircraft measures."
"Target set by CIC. Commence attack."
-MK45 Mod4 ready to fire.
Prepare the turret!
Remote targeting target two.
-Target has entered firing range.
-Turret ready to fire!
Turret ready and in position!
Fire!
-Time to touch target: 30 seconds.
Don't be like that.
Geez, we'll only see screens?
(Inoue) Just seeing it on the screens is already a lot.
We are in the most secret area of the ship,
and this is the first time civilians have entered.
Oh, yes.
Yes, it feels like it's top secret.
Huh?
Impact to target two.
(Ayumi) Looks like a video game, doesn't it?
Destruction of target two confirmed.
-(Ayumi) Of course not.
What are you crazy?
-Do you think they'll let us try it?
"You guys too...? Come on, man."
-And fire!
-Preparats to fire.
-Signal intercepted!
-Automatic mode.
Time to reach target: two, one...
Target one losing altitude.
-What happened? -What happened?
Has it been hit?
-Target one hit!
Yes.
All threats destroyed.
Yes.
Ah!
That was impressive!
-I didn't quite understand what happened.
-Is it over?
- (beep: pip flashing)
-Well, then ani...
Sonar detects an unknown signal!
-Following the trajectory of target Alpha.
-Alpha target.
-S'acosta us!
Direction: 5 degrees.
Distance: 8,000!
This is CIC.
Alpha target detected at 5 degrees.
Range: 8,000.
- (woman) Captain.
- "Target Alpha," you say?
This is Captain Tateishi.
Initiate enemy search on all radars.
-I'm with you.
-I'm going to CIC.
I'm going to CIC.
I'm leaving bridge command to the lieutenant.
Target Alpha maintains trajectory and speed.
-I'm receiving.
-He's coming right at us!
Watch for any change in trajectory.
Watch for any sign of attack!
Ruled out to be a natural being or object.
Friend-or-foe identifier.
No response.
Oh... It's a non-allied undersea vessel.
Prepare the Nixies!
Stop engines now!
VIRE astern full ahead!
Face the bow to the target.
-Receiving!
VIRE astern full ahead!
Turn the rudder 90 degrees!
"Have we really stopped?"
Wow, suddenly it's a lot more realistic.
That's impressive...
Anti-submarine measures!
Light signals!
Roger that.
Preparing signals.
Light signals.
Fire!
We show it to the third main monitor.
-Yes!
-That's great!
That's awesome!
You think the light is real?
No, woman.
Prepare anti-submarine actions!
Red alert!
Yes, sir!
It is likely that from now on the ship will shake,
so keep an eye on the children and be alert.
It's a drill, isn't it?
I hope nothing happens.
And of course, woman.
Finally they put some excitement in.
"No... It seems to me that this..."
-Situation.
-The response is weak.
The image is not clear.

Detection is complicated.
Close the Spy.
Proceed to confirm the target with the SH60K.
Prepare the SH60K.
-She's still closing.
Range: 3,200 meters.
We'll enter the target's firing range.
-Are there any response from the target?
-How?!
-Target approaching!
-So far, nothing.
Range: 3,100 meters!
100 meters to get within firing range!
Captain.
What do you want us to do?
(Tateishi) Everyone prepare to counterattack.
(Tateishi) Hold on, Captain.
If we open fire, we could trigger a war.
Target speed: 10. Range: 3,000!
We're within firing range of the target!
Maintain distance to target.
Engage engines.
Full speed ahead!
Roger that!
Starting engines.
Full speed ahead!
We're avoiding the target!
All ahead starboard!
All ahead full!
-Oh, boy, that's exciting, huh?
-Oh! -Oh!
This is much more impressive than a video game.
It's... a little scary.
"No wonder, it's scary."
"This destroyer is really taking a hit."
Still no response.
Coming in at 40 degrees port!
I want to see the enemy.
Light torpedoes.
Ready light torpedoes!
Port engines full ahead!
-Bridge, this is CIC.
-Prepare light torpedoes!
Port full ahead!
Port full ahead!
Port full ahead!
Port launcher.
(Radio: male) "Anti-submarine light torpedo loaded!"
-Fire the light torpedo!
(Radio: man) -All right.
Fire!
Soon we will have a clear view.
Displayed on monitor 3.
-Shock wave imminent!
- (alarm)
Now the ship will shake a little.
Watch the children.
(Shouting)
Yes.
Hey, guys, are you all right?
-That was incredible!
-That moved a lot.
"Oops. Where are that kid's parents?"
-No, I wouldn't say no.
-What's this?
A submarine?
A fishing boat?
A shipwreck?
This is...
There's no chance it contains explosives.
Looks like it's been washed up.
It's empty.
End of anti-submarine actions.
End of anti-submarine actions.
We are back to the planned routine for maneuvers.
I repeat: we are back to the scheduled maneuver routine.
Notice to all Maritime Force personnel.
Is it over?
Yes.
With this you have seen, we end the air-raid drill.
Very well done!
It was impressive!
For a moment I thought it was the real thing!
I didn't even remember I was hungry.
(Inoue) "They managed to pass it off as a drill."
(Inoue) I hope you enjoy the tour of the deck.
(Boy) Come on!
Look, look, here we go!
(Inoue) Wow, look!
-Conan, hurry, hurry, hurry!
-It's great!
-How many meters will he make in total? -How many meters will he make in total?
-It's a big destroyer, huh?
It's bigger than I thought.
This is the one that looked like the one that was shot in the video before, right?
(Ayumi) Come, Conan, let's take a picture together!
(Ayumi) Come, come.
I'm coming.
Come on, Yuki.
Come on, Yuki, give me your hand.
"Isn't this child...?"
Yes.
Is he?
Yes...
Listen up!
Your name is Yuki, right?
That's nice, huh?
I see you've found your father.
Why do you say so, this, handsome?
It's just that before, when the boat was rocked, you weren't with him, were you?
I saw you and I got worried.
Eh?
Ah.
It's just that I had gone to the bathroom.
Oh, I see.
Of course, now I understand.
That's why you were alone, then.
Let's go see the other side, Yuki.
Yes.
"No matter how much I went to the bathroom, I would have noticed it, the shaking."
"But, on the other hand, this man,
I haven't seen him either at the drill or afterwards."
"He has not appeared until now, the free time to visit the deck."
"I find it very strange."
Hey, you!
Don't go wandering around by yourself!
What case.
I lose sight of you for a second and you disappear!
I'm... I'm so sorry.
What's that?
"It's not usual to see women in the Maritime Force..."
Doesn't taste the least bit serious to you, does it, lad?
Mm?
Ah!
What a rod!
Eh ?!
A military woman!
It's quite a sight to see.
Let's take a picture together!
- (Mitsuhiko) She's very elegant!
- (Ayumi) It's true!
(Ayumi) Excuse me...
(Genta) Yes, yes, let's take a picture!

Madam, can we take a picture with you?
- (Kogoro) How precious!
-A... photo?
A great detective and a military woman.
I see the future.
Miss...
I mean, Navy officer,
I wouldn't want the children to disturb you.
Do not t'embalis, father!
What have I done, now?
I just wanted to ask you to take a picture of us.
You can do it perfectly well without getting so close.
Yes.
Mitsuhiko, may I borrow your camera?
Thank you. Thank you.
All right, everybody look this way.
Oh!
Photos, better not...
Why not?
They can be taken, can't they?
It's just that... look.
-L'estic doing well, the greeting?
-I want a picture too!
- (Ayumi) Hurray!
(Ayumi) -Yes... (Ayumi) Sure.
-No, I want to put me!
-I'll stand next to you!
You don't mind not being in the picture?
I want to be in the picture too!
No.
But you'll have to come a little closer, Ran.
Ah.
Yes.
That's perfect!
I do, huh?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll make another one.
What? (Laughs)
Hey, hey, hey!
I hope you know how to take pictures properly!
Yes, but it was set to an option that I didn't have to.
Now, perfect.
Now comes the good one.
Say: "Aegis"!
Aegis!
Yes, now it's perfect.
And now?
Is it good?
Let's see, let's see.
It has.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Excuse me, I must go...
Say.
Hey, hey, lady!
I wanted to know what kind of work you do, you, the boat?
Well, I... I make everybody's food.
"Bullshit."
(Kogoro) How interesting.
By the way...
"He wears a naval captain's insignia."
"That is, he has the same rank as the captain of this ship."
I'm sorry, but I have work to do.
If you'll excuse me...
Yes.
Thank you very much!
Ah!
At least take my card.
Excuse me, don't mind him.
We don't want to bother you anymore.
Ah!
Oh!
"And these flashy cards?"
Well done, uncle!
Wait a minute, pretty lady!
Oh, what an embarrassment you put me through.
Sonoko, would you hold them for a moment?
But how can you have such bad taste?!
She said she'd stand out more in the cases.
That's why she had these cards made.
But it seems to me that he doesn't use them very well.
Mitsuhiko.
Can I have the camera?
And give the cards to Ran.
Yes, of course.
Here you go.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Ah, okay.
-Conan!
-What?! -What?!
You want to take a picture in the bathroom?
By the way, Ouch...
Hello.
Do you think it would have cost them, solve the riddle, the children?
If the answer was not 4, maybe yes.
(Phone)
Yes, tell me?
"Doctor, I want you to investigate something for me."
- (mobile: message tone)
-Ah, Shinichi, it's you.
On Ai's cell phone?
You sent her a picture?
Ah.
Yes, okay, we'll check it right away.
(Agasa) "How come you're calling? That nothing happened?"
No.
But there is something that does not add up.
Has the photo arrived?
"Yes, he received it without any problems."
She looks like a Navy officer.
You only sent us one?
"Yes. I want you to investigate which section the woman in the photo belongs to."
"In the Maritime Force there are only 4% women,
"And very often they're in a public-facing role,
so they shouldn't be hard to find."
Understood.
So I don't think it will cost us much.
- (phone: hang up)
-By the way, the riddle that I have you....
-You don't know how bad it tastes.
-He hung up.
A satellite communication?
Where, from the deck?
It came from the starboard side.
This is near where the visitors are.
-Yes.
-Have it investigated.
This is the CIC in all sections.
-Mm?
-Captain, excuse me.
Is it possible that X is among the visitors?
We can't rule out
that the wrecked ship from earlier is also related to the X.
Mmm... The X, huh?
(Inoue) This radar could be said to be the eyes of the Aegis.
It doesn't look like it at first glance,
but this radar can cover an area of more than 450 kilometers
and is capable of detecting more than 200 objects at a time.
-(visitors) Ooh!
- (visitors) Ooh!
It's a bit like a sea detective!
What a rod!
"There... that's where I contacted Dr. Agasa just now."

"Have they discovered the satellite call? Or else...?"
The Aegis system, it was developed in the U.S.,
and it's only available to allied countries.
All right, you guys.
We'd better report it, just in case.
Will you do it?
I'll check the deck.
(Inoue) Moving on.
The next thing I'll show you
is the helicopter we have parked at the stern: the SH60K.
- (Mitsuhiko) How exciting!
- (Genta) We'll see a helicopter!
What's wrong with you, Conan?
What's wrong?!
Again?!
I have to go to the bathroom.
You have to go to the bathroom.
Wait a minute, Conan.
What?
I can do it alone.
I'll go with you this time.
No way.
If I let you out of my sight, you disappear.
Oh, no?
Haven't you done it before?
No, I haven't.
I'll do it.
Come on, let's go.
Let's both go.
Don't think,
when I've been there before, I've also been on the verge of getting lost.
"At your age, aren't you ashamed?"
"Come to think of it, he's never had much sense of direction."
(Children: shouts of enthusiasm)
Finally.
Where the hell did you go to buy them?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just got lost on the way back.
So I said the two of us should go together.
Yeah, but...
Please don't go alone.
Maybe someday you won't come back.
What?
I'm not worried.
Even if I get lost, I know you'll find me.
Won't you?
Ah...
Sure, man, 'cause you're a great detective.
Oh!
Oh!
What a brake...!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Donkey!
Eh?
Don't you worry.
Because no matter how lost you get, no matter where you are,
I'll know where to find you.
Oops...
"Have no doubt about it."
I could have sworn the toilets were this way.
Sorry, Conan.
I think we got lost.
"Are you serious? We can fold now, you."
What was that scream?
Conan!
(Man: call)
Sawamura!
The ship has swallowed something terrible!
What thing?
Oh!
Wow!
But it's...!
"It can't be! It's a human arm...?"
I'm sorry.
We're lost...
We can't get in here!
What do we do now?
Today, what you need to do is to report all this to the captain.
Hey, we should explain this to Kogoro.
Yes, you're right.
Excuse me.
Maybe I could help my father in this case.
That's a human arm on that table, isn't it?
Ah.
Well...
It's just that my father is Kogoro Mouri.
What's that?
Don't you know him?
He's a famous detective, Sleeping Kogoro.
(Mobile: vibrates)
Hey, hey, hey!
What's up, Kudo?
What?!
A body?!
They found a corpse in the Aegis destroyer?!
(Shinichi voice) No, well, they only found the left arm...
But the thing is...
That the arm was wearing the uniform of the Maritime Self-Defense Force.
"A member of the Maritime Self-Defense Force has been murdered!"
We still don't know if it's murder or accident.
Now then...
"The deceased was a naval lieutenant."
How strange.
All right, no problem.
I'll be right back.
We'll talk again.
I finally got you!
Come on, man, training has already started.
Never mind, that, now.
I'm going to Maizuru.
You're what?
To Maizuru?
Why are you...?
Heiji!
There's no one there.
No trace of the source of the satellite communication.
"I was afraid of it."
(Radio: male) "Continue searching..."
"They've detected my calls."
"The X?"
"The X could be hiding around here."
-Have you felt, this noise?
- (watch: acoustic signal)
Gee, boy, Shinichi just hung up on me.
Maybe something's wrong with him.
Too bad, now that we were about to tell him what he wanted to know.
-Yes.
We must have gotten confused.
False alarm.
We keep looking.
"Phew! I'm out of my mind! You can tell we're on a destroyer."
"They've got a tight surveillance."
"I can see I'll have to find another means of communication."
"Because if I use this, I'm sure they'll spot me right away."
"That signal indicates that a magnetic field is being generated here."
This will do.
I'm Captain Tateishi.
You are Mr. Mouri?
That's right.
The great detective Kogoro Mouri.
Naval Lieutenant Sekiguchi
told me about you.
Sekiguchi of the Military Police.

Ah, you mean the internal police of the Self-Defense Force, right?
-Okay.
-That's right.
Well, and this must be the body fragment they found, right?
Yes.
This one you see.
Well, well, well, well.
Doesn't look like any sharp
any sharp object to separate it from the body.
And judging by the wound, there were no vital signs when it was made.
So, you mean it was removed when he was already dead?
Yes.
Can you tell me where you found it, the arm?
Ah...
The filter in the drainage system.
Wasn't the drainage system...?
They just felt the drainage system.
It makes this noise when it picks up large amounts of seawater.
Is that why it made such a strange noise?
When we sailed from Maizuru harbor,
sometimes the system swallows up large debris
that comes with the sea current.
This arm would get caught in the filter at that time.
(Kogoro) And what does it look like, the filter?
Like a net that is in the mouth of the drainage mechanism
to prevent debris, fish or other marine debris
fish or other marine debris when the ship sucks in seawater.
And how did they find it, then?
When the trapped debris
interferes with the operation of the filter,
we sometimes pick them up and examine them.
They are usually accumulations of algae or plastic bags.
By the way, can you think of who it might belong to, the arm?
-Ah...
-I can see that it does.
Can you tell me whose it is, Captain Tateishi?
For the insignia on the sleeve and the wristwatch,
it must be Lt. Sasaura's, from Wakasa base.
I have already checked with the base
and they told me that they can't locate Lt. Sasaura.
So, I don't think they are wrong.
I see your watch stopped at 5:30 a.m. at 6:00 a.m. I'm sorry to hear that.
How do you know it was in the morning?
(Kogoro) You can tell by the position of the calendar on the watch.
Although you can see part of yesterday.
This means that it stopped in the early morning hours.
Lieutenant Sasaura was a member of the crew of the destroyer Aegis?
Sometimes yes, but he was not a regular member.
It was not his turn today.
They activated the drainage system
when we left Maizuru harbor, right?
Yes, I suppose at that time...
the system's valve must have cut off his left arm.
That makes sense.
In other words, then his corpse...
was already drifting in the harbor waters.
By the time the drainage system has kicked in,
the seawater dragged the body towards the ship,
but it got caught in the mouth of the system...
and only the arm reached the filter.
-Yes.
That's what we assume.
-That's your theory, isn't it?
Let's see, and what time is it, that we go back to the port?
Half past five, six o'clock this afternoon, sir.
"We're not going well."
"From the state the arm is in, if they don't do the autopsy right away..."
(Kogoro)... to have the autopsy done.
"Come to think of it, there's a helicopter on this ship!"
Wow, that's great!
From here they take the boat?
Get out of here!
Conan!
You can't go in without permission!
I heard your voice while I was looking for the helicopter, Mr. Mouri.
The helicopter?
Sure, so we can take them right away!
But if we use it, people will know something's up.
-Mr. Mouri.
-That lightning, it doesn't matter now.
If the passengers get to know what's happened,
there's a risk of panic on the ship.
Well, I'd like to see the helicopter fly!
Just like before, when they fired that cannon!
You could fly the helicopter as if it were also a demonstration.
That's a good idea!
Then I don't think people will suspect anything.
-Huh?
-Captain Tateishi.
We can't waste a minute.
Understood.
We'll get the chopper ready right away.
What do you mean?!
The Aegis destroyer?!
All right, very well.
We'll contact the Kyoto Police right away.
And as soon as we're cleared to board the ship, we'll come here.
Okay, I'm counting on you.
It's possible that the culprit is already aboard the destroyer.
I'll do that.
First, we'll have to investigate the arm.
Yes, thank you very much.
Next, you'll see a demonstration
of how a helicopter takes off from the ship.
(Visitors: exclamations of delight)
We must keep a safe distance.

Please do not leave the cordoned-off area.
Yes.
Good, we got here in time.
Ah, you're...
What's the matter with you?
You've lost your father again?
You're alone again, like before.
Is everything all right, handsome?
Where are the father and mother?
I've seen him with his father before, but they must have separated.
Oh, my...
If I'm not mistaken, your name was Yuki, right?
Yes.
Well then, can you stay with him, Conan?
I'll explain what happened to Yuki to someone on the boat.
No, wait!
If you do this...
What will happen if I do this?
Don't worry... I'm fine.
Where are you going?
Yuki!
I'm fine!
I'm fine! Thank you.
Here, you've dropped them.
What are they for?
For hives and so on.
They make me not itch so much.
I can't drink milk or milk products.
You're allergic?
Ah, you have a food allergy.
Wait, Yuki.
Father told me...
He wanted me to be a strong child.
He did?
And that's why I'm called Yuki, which means "courage".
- (man) Yuki.
-I'm fine, there's nothing wrong with me!
Ah, you're his father?
I've been looking for you everywhere.
That's good.
Yes.
Well, I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
I've seen it alone and it's made me suffer.
You see?
That's what you get for going out on your own.
Hey, hey, hey!
We must have reached Maizuru by now, right?
Yes, but first we'll gather information from the surrounding area.
Hm?
What are they doing, those people over there?
Who knew this could happen on an Aegis.
"I wouldn't have guessed it either."
There's a lot of interference.
What's going on?
Ah, I had to hide to avoid them detecting the call.
"Well, I'll adjust it so you can't be traced."
So, what did you find out from the woman?
(Ai) "We haven't found anyone in the Navy with this face."
(Ai) -Wait a minute.
-But what's wrong, Heiji?
-But Heiji!
-You wait for me here!
(He's missing his left arm!
-I'll do it right away!
-Have you already called the police?
"A corpse without a left arm?"
"These stripes are those of a lieutenant."
"I have no doubt: it's the corpse of Lieutenant Sasaura I was saying in Kudo."
"Mm? Is it blood?"
"No, it isn't. But then, what is it?"
-What's the matter with you, man?
-Hey, hey, don't touch it!
The body can't be touched or moved until the police arrive!
I am Inspector Megure, from the Metropolitan Police!
I'm accompanied by two members of the Wakasa Coast Guard!
Thank you for coming.
I'm Captain Tateishi.
-Me, Takagi.
-My name is Sato.
-Munekawa, research.
-I'm Kurata, security.
And so on.
We discussed the details inside.
What do you mean?
At the Wakasa shipyard?
Yes, I know that for sure.
Both the rank and the missing limb match.
That is, Lieutenant Sasaura's arm...
was swallowed up by the destroyer in Maizuru harbor
and his body has drifted here.
Drifting, you say?
How can that be?
"I guess some ocean current must have swept him away, right?"
You mean there are such strong currents?
I don't know, I'll have to investigate.
This and a strange substance I found on the lieutenant's corpse.
What substance?
"Well, I don't know what it is, but his neck was filled with a red substance."
Red, you say?
Hattori, see about meeting with Dr. Agasa.
(Genta) Bon appetit, everyone!
Wow, that's good!
They do make good curry, the Navy!
I have never tasted a curry as good as this one!
Wow, it's true, it's really good!
In Yuki...
"I've seen trouble where there is none."
I wish it came out this good when I use it myself.
Sugar?
Where?
Oops, yes.
I can feel the sugar already.
Why don't you call him and say, "I made a great curry just for you.
Don't be long in coming back, eh?"
Donkey.
He wouldn't come back for a curry.
"He-he... If only it were that easy..."
Now I like you!
I'm going to make a call.
No, that's not why!
It's just that I want to explain something.
Of course, of course.
That goes well!
"Oops, what do you want to explain to me? Wait, he'll call me now!"
In the bathroom for a moment.
What?
Where are you going now, Conan?
Yes, I'll be right back.
Again?
So much for my analysis

of the information we have at the moment.
Very good.
So you still haven't been able to do a thorough investigation...
among the ship's crew?
-Where are the passengers now?
-Correct.
(Sekiguchi) They are eating in the ship's dining room.
Well, now would be the best time
to investigate the areas open to the public.
Also, I have been informed...
that Lieutenant Sasaura's body has been found in the Wakasa shipyard.
-Well, just in case.
-In this case, should we investigate?
There is also the possibility
that she was sucked into the hydrant before leaving port.
Understood.
Come, I will guide you.
How did you know, that it was me?
"Is it you, Ran?"
It doesn't matter.
What did you want?
"What do you mean it doesn't matter? You know what, Shinichi? I'm now..."
On an Aegis destroyer?
Huh?
"How fortunate! I'd like to see one too."
"I told you that once, didn't I?"
Wait a minute.
But how do you know?
"That wherever you are, I'll know where to find you."
Shinichi...
Ah, I got it!
He told you in Conan, didn't he?
"That's right."
I'm sure he told you on the phone!
Come on, don't worry.
I'm sure it'll be sorted out soon.
"Yeah, sure..."
"Since you're in the boondocks, you don't see gravity."
Look at you...
"You don't feel safe, if I'm not?"
But what do you think, you, eh?
I didn't say that, neither now nor ever!
"Now, I like it better. Ha-ha! Goodbye! Go well!"
Hey, wait!
"And that I am. And very close."
Idiot.
(Sekiguchi) Megure's group has found something on deck.
- (Sekiguchi) I don't know this anymore.
- (Kurata) Where on the deck?
(Sato) Anyway, let's go see.
"What did they find, on the deck?"
-(Sato) Yes, here.
-Here, here!
Between the covers of the missile battery.
There was Lieutenant Sasaura's cell phone.
-In this slit.
-Where exactly?
-What's the last thing he has on record?
-Let me see it.
Of messages, yesterday after 9 pm.
And calls... this morning at half past five past six.
Two quarters past 6 a.m.?
That's the time his watch stopped.
And it's also the estimated time of death.
What's the time of death?
The autopsy report puts the time of death
to be between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.
This means that until then
Lieutenant Sasaura would be on this destroyer.
(Kogoro) And the cause of death, you have determined?
Yes, by drowning.
So, can we assume that at half past one o'clock on 6...
Lieutenant Sasaura has fallen from this ship?
-Of course!
I'm already a headhunter!
-Yes, probably.
"This morning, about half past five of 6,
"Lieutenant Sasaura had a fight with someone right here.
and that's when he dropped his cell phone."
"Afterwards, the lieutenant tried to flee,
the opponent must have harassed him here and made him fall into the sea."
So, it would be a murder.
So, the lieutenant's body...
was sucked into the destroyer's drainage system
before it left the harbor,
and it got stuck in one piece.
Once the ship has sailed,
it has re-activated the drainage system
when it moved away from the port of Maizuru
and then tore the arm away from the rest of the body.
The lieutenant's body was left in the sea and the current carried it out to sea.
and the current carried it into Wakasa Bay.
That's how it must have gone.
If that's how it went, the fact that we found the cell phone on deck....
This cell phone has the micro-SD cover open.
Well, I don't think I opened it.
-No, it's empty.
-Is that it, the card?
Maybe the killer took it?
So, the target of the lieutenant's murderer...
would be this memory card!
"Shit, I can't see it from here, the phone."
"I can't do anything but get out..."
"You won't get away."
Ah, no, nothing.
What's wrong, Mouri?
"Is it upstairs?"
Oh.
It can't be... It doesn't work?
"What's wrong?"
Here?
In the captain's cabin?
"Oh! It's the micro-SD!"
"Come on!"
I knew it.
It's been from here...
(I'll be in my cabin.
If you find out anything, let me know right away.

Ah, captain, can I take a picture with you?
You can't be here, boy.
We'd better take it somewhere else.
I'll do it somewhere else.
"I thought so, he took the card with him."
"But he can't have had time
to erase all the files that were on the computer."
(Tateishi) And where is it now, the phone, then?
-And what are the police doing?
(Tateishi) -In the meeting room.
- "What are you doing here, Captain?"
-He's investigating...
"Gee, no! Those voices were...!"
"Have you noticed?"
(Footsteps: approaching currents)
"Come on, it's almost there...!"
Don't move!
I'm late.
"Damn, I couldn't copy everything."
Why does the X want this data again?
I have to leave it as it was.
"The X?"
"Come to think of it..."
(Radio: man) "The X could be hiding around here."
"Let's see, now I have to get out of here...
and send the data I have to the doctor."
"No, wait..."
"If I broadcast satellite signals from here,
maybe I'll find out who he really is."
I'm picking up satellite signals again!
-What?!
-They're coming from the captain's cabin.
The captain is in a meeting!
Is it possible it's the X?
Confirm right now the location of the captain!
Yes!
What a problem.
In his cabin he has important information.
It's already downloaded.
Gee, boy... And what did he send us this time?
I don't know.
But, knowing him, it must be something he wants us to investigate again.
(Agasa) Look, we've reached Kyoto.
(Agasa) Don't move!
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?
- (Tateishi) Captain Fujii.
-You guys don't do anything.
So it was you...
Captain, I'll tell you all about it later.
-Mm?
Who is it?
-Ah...! -Ah...!
You are...
Don't worry about her.
-Sir.
-You may go.
Ep, wait a minute!
Didn't we come here because we detected a suspicious transmission?
(Sato) This.
And now we find her here.
I'm sorry, but I think we have the right to ask you to identify yourself.
(Sato) We are very sorry,
but we must not disclose this information to unauthorized people.
Unauthorized?
Are you kidding me or what?!
That's right.
The police and the coast guard
are here to help you solve this case.
Ah!
It's the woman from the Maritime Force!
You're back on your own again?!
A friend of mine told me that it's not at all normal
for there to be female officers on an Aegis destroyer.
So much for that!
You, out!
Ouch!
It's true, isn't it?
Have female officers been allowed to board a destroyer?
Have they?
Yes...
We've been working recently
for women to be part of the destroyer crews as well.
I understand that, so that's what that was about.
And we have her as a guide for the civilians...
Oh, that's strange,
but you told us earlier that she was in charge of food preparation.
We demand an explanation.
Yes, it's true that she told us.
I'm sorry, but...
(Kogoro) Seeing this behavior,
we have no choice but to consider the option
that one of you is the murderer of Lieutenant Sasaura.
Please wait.
We are willing to cooperate, to the extent that we can...
Captain.
At this point, I think we'll have to explain.
Soc of the... Security and Intelligence Corps.
The Security and Intelligence Corps...?
The one that works for the Minister of Defense?
That's right.
I'm in charge of the Navy's information management
and monitoring the ideology of its members.
But can you tell me what you do here,
someone from the Security and Intelligence Corps?
Ah!
That it's about a suspicious ship we found today?
Yes.
We think it might be a spy ship from another country.
That's right.
That ship...
"...had a radio communications antenna...
and explosives rigged to self-destruct."
You are well informed.
It's just that I found the ship myself.
Ah...
That's why I participated in the investigation.
When I found the suspicious ship near Maizuru harbor,
which is where the Aegis destroyer is located,
we considered the option
that a spy had infiltrated this ship.
-Yes.
-A spy?
We refer to the spy by the name of X.

We are looking into it.
"X..."
(Kurata) And what could be the objective of this spy?
(Sekiguchi) We believe that he intends to obtain classified information
about the Aegis destroyers.
Information, you say?
And what could happen if it were to leak out?
We could lose the entire trust of the United States,
the creator of the Aegis system.
Yes, but that would not be the most serious thing.
If the navigation data of the Aegis destroyers were leaked,
Japan's line of defense would be exposed.
so that Japan would be defenseless
against military attacks from other countries.
In short,
it could very well provoke an internal crisis in the country.
We must assume that the victim, Lieutenant Sasaura,
knew of the spy's existence, right?
Naturally, it was his job.
-Yes.
-Ah...
- (Kogoro) What?
As you say?
What was it, Lieutenant Sasaura's job?
He was a lieutenant, wasn't he?
I mean, an officer.
He was from the Intelligence Service
from the Wakasa base of the Self-Defense Forces.
Intelligence?
He protected the information of the Aegis destroyers.
Ah!
That's why the X killed her, so they could steal the information!
Then it must also have been the X
that took the memory card from her cell phone.
"No."
(Kogoro) Yes, I have no doubt.
"It's her, the one who took the card."
"But why doesn't she say anything, about that?"
(Kogoro) Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Thank you very much.
We will inspect the cabin with the communications detector.
"Gee, no!"
Hey, Mr. Mouri!
And check your belongings...
Hm?
What do you want?
I just remembered that I had ordered another plate of curry.
Another plate?
I can't believe it!
Besides, you shouldn't even be here!
Go away, go!
I agree!
"Thank you, Kogoro."
Thank you for coming!
Hattori, can you hear me?
Yes.
I've met with Dr. Agasa without any problems.
"Do you know anything about the red substance?"
They're investigating it right now, you'll have to wait a bit.
Which, by the way, it's amazing that they do this kind of analysis in a car.
It is that, in short, the Ai is scientific.
Scientific?
You're kidding, right?
But she's just a kid.
Yes, fine, but don't be fooled by her age.
That's it.
That's it.
TBT...
It's antifouling paint.
One of those special boat paints.
Boat paint?
Do you have any way of knowing if it came from this destroyer?
"I'll ask the miniature girl to look into it."
Miniature girl?
"Oh, and I looked into the ocean currents."
No currents that could have carried the lieutenant's body
from Maizuru Harbor to Wakasa Bay.
Well, how did it get there, all the way to the bay?
Oh, by the way, and the data I sent?
Ah, it.
En Kudo wants to ask you what that data was.
Shinichi, that was a piece of information...
about the Aegis destroyers.
I knew it!
"I have also found indications
that it was copied from a company's cloud."
You mean an internet data storage service?
Yes, if we decode the username and password,
we could access the original files in the cloud, but...
"Wow..."
"This means that Lieutenant Sasaura first save the data?
"About the Aegis destroyers in the cloud,
and then copied them to the memory card of the cell phone."
"But I don't understand why he should want to upload this information
to a cloud that civilians use."
"What should he have been pushing him to do something like that?"
"Doctor, see if you can use the lieutenant's user?
to send the files from the cloud on the captain's computer."
You mean...?
"Don't suffer, I've used it before and I remember the email address."
Thank you.
I'm sorry to have to ask you this now that you've just arrived,
but I need to know everything you've discovered.
Of course you do.
Captain.
Before coming all this way...
we investigated Lieutenant Sasaura's last movements before he died.
"Today at 5:30 a.m., 6:00 a.m., the last movements of Lieutenant Sasaura..,
"The lieutenant was on top of a cliff in Maizuru harbor...
and was flying a flag of Japan."

"It was seen by a cruise ship worker."
And why would he have made it, something like that?
We don't know this yet,
but what intrigues us most is what he did yesterday.
It seems that you interrogated him
at the Wakasa Self-Defense Force base,
didn't you, Lieutenant Sekiguchi?
"Could you explain to us why you interrogated him?"
Well... It's just that this is...
(Kogoro) Already withholding information from us again?
Captain Fujii!
Can't even we know?
We're partners!
First I need authorization from the Minister.
Enough, no?!
That Lieutenant Sasaura has been murdered!
If they don't tell us, we won't be able to help them either.
(Computer: acoustic signal)
That he wasn't your partner, perhaps?
-That man doesn't deserve anything!
-He deserves that...
What?
You'll have to explain that to us.
Oh, man... Why did you send me the data on the destroyers?
Mm-hm.
Inspector.
If they won't cooperate, we'll have to do it by force.
How can that be?!
These files were sent from a cloud
with Lieutenant Sasaura's user name.
(Kogoro) "Which cloud?"
(Kogoro) "Very timely, doctor."
(Takagi) "They may have been sent here for X to see?"
(Takagi) "No packing!
Uploading this information on the internet is a serious breach of protocol!
Now I understand.
And that's why Lieutenant Sasaura was investigating, right?
And this SDF officer knew all about it.
Where does she think she's going?
Wait, we're not done yet.
Let me go!
Unlike you, I work for the good of my country.
If you don't change your chip, not only will you not be protecting your country,
but you won't even be able to capture the X.
Come on, why don't we collaborate?
At least let's do it for Japan's sake.
The information about the destroyers
is being leaked from our base in Wakasa.
Don't continue, Lieutenant Sekiguchi.
The investigation was ordered to me by Captain Fujii.
"I knew it..."
The culprit of the information leak
was Lieutenant Sasaura, then?
That's right.
And where the hell did he send it, this information?
Yes!
To a detective agency that went out of business a few years ago.
-Are you saying it's a shell company?
-It was represented by one Takekawa.
Mm-hm.
Someone bought the company
and used Takekawa's name to act as a spy.
It's a technique widely used in our country.
And Lieutenant Sasaura was sending the information
to this man who calls himself Takekawa.
Yes.
The day after he found out...
Right?
"The coast guard alerted us
that they had found a suspicious ship near the port of Maizuru."
(Fujii) "A suspicious ship near the port where this destroyer was..."
"It couldn't be a coincidence."
And the ship was found to be components of a foreign country.
Yes, and from that we deduce...
that a spy from the same country as this Takekawa had entered Japan.
We're talking about the X, aren't we?
You mean...?!
We thought that probably the X
could infiltrate the ship with the help of Lieutenant Sasaura.
(Fujii) And he had to do it today,
when we're open to the public and there's less security.
May I know why they didn't tell us from the beginning, this?
A member of the Maritime Force
may have leaked information to a foreign spy.
Don't you see, that for us is an embarrassment?
which is not easy to explain?
We decided to investigate the incident ourselves
until we could clarify the truth.
That's why, when I found his cell phone on the deck?
He must have lost a passenger?
Oh!
But what's this doing here?!
It's Lieutenant Sasaura's cell phone!
Well then, we started by checking the deck.
Wow, so he had found it before me?
It's true, then.
Lieutenant Sasaura was on board this ship.
And this is where the X killed her.
Excuse me, I must inform the Minister of Defense of all this.
It was you, the source of the satellite transmissions?
I apologize.
After the commotion,
I tried to go to the degaussing room, but...
"Wow! What a danger. Lucky we didn't run into each other."
Fujii here.

Sir, I wanted to report that both the police and the coast guard...
have discovered the case we were investigating.
How?
In Takekawa?!
About two hours ago?
Understood.
And they have confirmed that you have entered Kyoto?
"Have they found in Takekawa?"
If he went from Tokyo to Kyoto in Takekawa, it means...
That he will surely want to meet with the X, which is on board the ship.
So what?
Where is he now in Takekawa?
The Security and Intelligence Corps is in Kyoto and is looking for her.
Well then.
And where is it that they have seen it, two hours ago?
"At a hotel in Kyoto."
"He has recorded a security camera."
So, they must have... an image of him, right?
Yes.
We use the N system,
the Orbis and the security cameras to find him.
So you have the full support of the Kyoto police.
You also have the support of the Coast Guard.
Send all the recordings you have on the ship, please.
Ah, of course!
The destroyer Hotaka will be able to analyze the images right away!
Perfect!
It's about time it started working, that's it!
(Man) These are images from two hours ago from the Kyoto cameras.
We have made them start from the cameras
that were near the hotel where it was seen in Takekawa.
A message from Maizuru.
They have recovered the wrecked ship and have been investigating her.
They have found artifacts of foreign origin.
You can see them on the screen.
They are from the same country as those on the ship I found....
But it is unthinkable
that a foreign ship would be wrecked like this in Japanese waters.
This can only mean one thing: that it was no coincidence...
that the wrecked ship came close to the Hotaka.
"Wait..."
(Sekiguchi) "What if they've used the ocean currents
to perpetrate a terrorist attack?"
No, it's not possible.
This morning, before we set sail,
we calculated all the currents and ship routes in the area.
and diverted the planned route to the west.
(Kogoro) This just this morning?
(Kogoro) "A last minute change..."
"In this case, the route..."
(Ayanokoli) "Today at half past five 6 o'clock in the morning,
"The lieutenant was on top of a cliff of Maizuru harbor
and was waving a flag of Japan."
"Maybe what he was doing is... I have to make sure!"
(Inoue) The change of route has been decided in the morning.
Without knowing it, it is impossible to send us....
a wrecked ship with such precision.
Who was informed of the route change?
Only the people at the Wakasa base.
Of course, so he couldn't know, the spy.
-(man) Huh?
- (man) Ah, wait, man!
-Ah!
Here we are!
You again?!
-Stop it!
Is that it?
You can't come in here!
-Stop!
-Sorry, the nano has slipped in and...
Here we are, eh?
You're such a lead!
Oops!
But this is not mine.
Of course not, donkey!
This time you'll feel me...!
(Fujii) Wait a minute.
You had only informed the Wakasa base personnel of the change of route?
(Fujii) -Okay.
(Fujii) -Yes.
So, Lieutenant Sasaura knew about it.
Look at this signal flag.
"The witness saw it while it was still dark."
"I wouldn't be surprised if he had mistaken this flag for the Japanese flag."
-Of course!
-It's true.
Lieutenant Sasaura must have sent him a signal with this flag on the X!
A signal, you say?
Can you explain to us what this flag means?
It is to indicate a change of course to port.
-Yes.
-Then...!
The X knew perfectly well that we were changing course.
Well, it looks like what I was looking for isn't here.
Well, I'm going back to the mess hall.
-Not so fast.
-How did you want it to be here?!
"Oh, no..."
- (man 2) Are you sure?
- (man) Target located!
Yes.
It's a 93% match.
It's in Takekawa, no doubt.
-Kyoto's Pontocho Park.
-Position?
It was 3 minutes past noon.
It's wide!
"Yes, hurry up!"
Pontocho Park, huh?
If you don't hurry, there won't be anything left.
"Don't be heavy. Let us do it."
Oh, and you have to get a picture of Takekawa.
"Just do it!"
A photo?
Why is this...?
He hung up on me.
- (Agasa) Full speed ahead!
- (Heiji) Eagerness, please!
"Càsom!"
(Ayumi) Ah!
I've already found you, Conan!

But where have you been, man?
The treasure hunt is about to begin.
Ah, right...
Target located!
12:10 noon,
Keihan Line Gion-Shijo Station platform.
-Ah!
He's getting on the train!
-It's the line that goes to Osaka, isn't it?
-Then it must make only a few stops.
-It's an express!
Mm-hm!
I'll call the Osaka police for help.
Where's he gone to, the kid?
From Gion-Shijo Station
to Yodoyabashi Station on the Keihan Line.
Images will be collected
from the cameras at the stations where the train stops and send them here.
-Counting on you, Otaki.
-To the CIC of the destroyer Hotaka?
-Yes!
-(Inoue) It's important.
(Inoue) The treasure-hunting game
is to find 5 different objects
hidden in the mess hall and on the foredeck.
Let's see if you can find them all.
(Inoue) -Oh, what a cane!
-Here!
Look, I found one!
You're a crack!
With this one we already have 3!
Two more and that's it.
Let's get to the deck.
Yes.
Ah...
I'm coming!
Ran, help me look over here!
"A suspicious ship..."
"An unexpected attack..."
"And the death of Lt. Sasaura."
"If it's all X's doing, this foreign spy..."
We believe he intends to obtain
classified information about Aegis destroyers.
Maco.
Hey, you got a moment?
-Yeah.
-I don't know what they've burned. -I don't know what they've burned.
That must be it, what it said in Kudo.
(Mobile)
(Ouch) "The police are coming."
(Man) I see it!
That's it!
Report immediately!
(Man 2) Right away!
And Conan...?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
A good discovery, the one before.
May I know who the hell you are?
What's the kind of information
that could only be obtained on this boat?
For example, the one that would allow you to counter a submarine attack?
I wasn't wrong.
How do you know that?
Perhaps you think that the X launched that wrecked boat
to get this information?
If so, where can he get it from?
From the CIC, where we were just now, and from the captain's cabin.
"That's it!"
During the drill,
"... due to the sudden emergency, the captain had to come to the CIC."
So, his cabin must have been empty.
Of course!
He took advantage of that time
to break in and steal the information he was looking for!
So, the X can only be...!
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Conan.
Again?
He's a pain in the ass...
I'm leaving, I'm not calm.
Espe... Just a moment, Ran!
- (man) Captain Fujii!
-Hey!
Wait! (man)
-To Osaka?
-In Takekawa has arrived in Osaka!
Yes, at Yodoyabashi Station.
Is that you, Kudo?
It seems that in Takekawa you've got rid of some kind of notes.
"Yes."
Of notes, you say?
"But it's practically all burned up."
"It'll be quite a puzzle to figure it out."
"Well, this Takekawa looks like he's been to Osaka,
at Yodoyabashi Station."
Understood.
"Follow the clue!"
Yuki.
Yuki!
Mr. Amemiya.
Mr. Amemiya!
Mr. Amemiya!
You are...
Excuse me, you're not feeling well in Yuki?
Ah... Now that you mention it, I don't know where he stops.
She told me that her eczema itched and she was going to the toilet.
Mm-hm.
Ah, eczema...
In these cases, you should wash your hands and put the ointment on, right?
Ah..., yes.
So it's the washroom...
Of course it worries me.
What are you worried about, Yuki?
Then why wasn't I at your side
when the ship shook like that?
No, I was in the captain's cabin.
I've already explained it to you.
It was the washroom.
When I called Amemiya's name, it took him a while to turn around.
Besides, it turns out that what he uses on Yuki is pills, not ointment.
And he has no eczema, but a food allergy.
A parent knows these things.
In other words, you are not Yuki's father.
Am I right, Mr. spy from I don't know where?
Who the hell are you?
In Conan Edogawa..., a detective.
He-he-he... You're just a brat.
You can't do anything.
Ah!
Ah! (man)
(Man) Did you hurt yourself, handsome?
Let it go!
Wait, wait, wait!
Do not do it!
Or they'll kill my father!
(Man) "Shit. Coi de Kogoro..."

This is the only thing you can more or less read.
(Heiji) "Senshu".
And what is that at the end?
If it is related to the destroyer Aegis,
maybe it indicates the front of the ship, the bow.
And if not, maybe it's an anchor.
No, no.
That an anchor has a much longer bottom.
Actually, it looks more like an arrow.
(Kazuha) An arrow?
Well, like this...
Maybe it's telling us to look up to the sky.
The sky?
Ah, right!
Kazuha!
You're the best!
That's a good idea!
Soc... the best?
-What do you mean?
-I know where we're going!
At the Senshu airport!
This is neither an anchor nor an arrow,
but an airplane!
An airplane?
Is there an airport called Senshu?
It is Kansai International Airport,
but for a while it was called "Senshu Airport".
He told me that, before leaving,
his father disappeared in Maizuru harbor.
and boarded the ship with a man he did not know.
He told me that if I didn't obey him, he would kill my father.
(Fujii) Can you confirm that he was not the CIC during the drill?
Mm-hm.
He must have gone to steal the data from the maneuvers
in the captain's cabin.
That is, this man is the X.
-Mm-hm.
-And would you recognize this man?
(Sekiguchi) Would you help us, please?
I can do it myself.
I remember perfectly well what he looks like.
Then you'll have to look at the CIC camera images, okay?
Well then, let's go.
Yes!
Let's go, man.
From a... All right, man.
Remember what your father told you.
That your name means "courage."
And now you have to be brave.
Yes...
In Takekawa and the X... although they haven't found them, neither one nor the other.
-At the airport!
-Wow.
What do you mean?
In Takekawa may be at the airport in Kansai!
-And how did you find this?
-At the airport?!
He told me in Hei... I mean, his son.
-And him?
-At Heiji?
I tried to stop her, but it looks like she's already on her way there.
Toyama!
Deploy all units to the airport!
Otaki, you meet the agents there!
Don't let him get away!
Ah!
Ha-ha-ha!
It's here.
(Fujii) Do you know what he's done, in Takekawa, next?
The last confirmed place is Nanba Station.
-As with the testimony of the X?
(Fujii) -All right.
In the end, it will be Conan who will help us locate him.
What?
Come, you his here and watch the monitor.
Why the hell does he know the X?
All right, all right, all right!
If you see the man in any of the images on the monitor, you have to tell me.
It's not going well!
The images are lost!
-Where are they coming from?
-What's wrong?
They're stored on the ship's server.
- (man) We've been screwed.
- (Fujii) What happened?
(man) "Shit... He beat us to it?"
We don't have any image left?
The live images from the cameras, maybe.
(Fujii) -Yes.
-Put it up right away. -Yeah.
Yes.
You wait a minute, huh?
"At this point,
I doubt the X is such an idiot that she'll let herself be seen on camera."
"The only thing I can do is to ask the Yuki
the places where the X usually passes by."
A message from the Osaka police!
They say that in Takekawa he may have headed for Kansai airport!
What do you mean?
Does he intend to flee by plane, just like that?
(PA: man) "I regret to inform you that we have to cancel the
that we must cancel the treasure hunt game on the deck."
"We ask that you please return indoors. We will follow the mess hall."
Excuse me.
This Conan... Where has he gone now?
The swell is expected to increase.
You must go inside.
You must not have seen a kid with glasses around here?
Well, no... Not exactly...
What are you lost?
Then please go inside, please.
All right, we'll close off access to the deck.
We'll close access to the deck.
In Takekawa is going to Kansai Airport!
We ask the airport coast guard to help us, then.
-Mr. Inoue, I'll leave for a moment. -Yes.
-Yes.
Okay. -Okay.
Very well, then.
Now we just have to find the X.
Remember what your father told you.
That your name means "courage."
And now you have to be brave.
-Huh?
-I also...
I also want to help you capture that spy!
-I've located her at the airport!
- (beep)

It is an 89% match.
It's the north wing of the terminal, to the camera facing gate 3.
You are entering the airport!
Come on, Yuki.
Relax, it's right here.
-Ah!
-Excuse me, would you have a moment?
Ah, yes... No... It can't be!
You're the X!
What's wrong with you, Yuki?
Did you really think I'd let you do it,
you who know so well what I've been doing here?
Get up!
Get up right now!
I've had enough of Conan.
When I find him, I forbid him to go anywhere alone.
What?
On Yuki and her father?
Maybe they don't know that we've been banned from the deck.
Are you sure you want me to leave you here?
Yes.
In Takekawa it must be here, for sure.
-Okay. -Okay.
Let's go through.
-Well, we're going to park. -Well, we're going to park.
Oh... Don't run so fast, Heiji!
But why here?
The airport staff will know what kind of face this Takekawa makes.
-Where did you get it, the picture?
-He can't get on a normal plane.
I asked the Otaki to send it to me.
And in which planes can't they see your face?
Cargo planes.
That is to say, you will have to hide...
among goods being shipped overseas.
Hey, guys!
Play two, this is dangerous!
(Heiji) We're off!
We're staying here until the next patrol passes.
Do you understand me?
If you behave yourself, you'll be able to see your father.
Excuse me, what have you seen in Conan?
I mean the boy with glasses that you saw before, what goes with me.
Well, no.
I haven't seen him yet.
Well... And you, Yuki, don't you know where he is?
He's been with me the whole time, so he must not have seen him either.
These kids do nothing but make us suffer, huh?
You can say that.
Bye, Yuki, see you later!
Geez, boy, he always disappears and no one can find him.
Oh, what a head.
I wanted to tell you that they've closed the access to the deck!
Ah, I didn't know that.
We'll be back as soon as Yuki's seasickness passes.
What?
Help me, please!
-Yuki!
-This man is a spy!
Are you sure, you're aware of what you're doing?
What's wrong, Yuki?
Is everything all right?
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just that we were playing spies...
I can see you've taken it too seriously.
It's not true!
This man is not my father!
He's not your father?
Well then, can you keep him, Conan?
I'll explain what happened to Yuki to someone on the boat.
What will happen if I do?
No, wait!
If you do this...
Don't worry... I'm fine.
You say he's not your real father?
-That's enough, Yuki.
-No!
He's not!
Help me, please!
Yes!
Yuki, come here.
You're so short.
If you'd mind your own business, you wouldn't have to die now.
He's right.
You're a real spy.
Yes, that's right.
And I'm sorry.
It's too late to back out now.
Eh?
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What?!
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Yes!
Go tell everyone, Yuki!
You little brat...
You won't get out!
It's good... But...
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Located.
Zone G of the international cargo terminal.
It's sure, it's him?
Very good!
Yes.
Female 97% match.
"I trust you, Hattori."
Here in Megure, from the Met.
"We've located Takekawa in Zone G."
-Zone G is no here!
-Okay!
In Takekawa is in zone G!
-Let go of me!
-Hey, you can't pass!
-Let me go!
-No, you can't come in here.
(Yuki) I said let me go!
(Yuki) Mm?
(The spy!
At Yuki?
-I've seen the spy!
-How?!
(Kazuha) This man has a very ordinary face.
- (car: horn)
-How do you want me to find him, like this?
Hey, be careful!
(Kazuha) -Yes... Yes.
Thank you very much.
-Are you all right? -You okay?
You're really absent-minded, aren't you?
You really are.
It's dangerous for you to fly around here.
Why is it dangerous?
-You'd better wait for me.
Okay? -Yeah...
-But... Heiji!
-I'll be right back!
Wow!
Now I'm going to find Takekawa before you, you'll see!
In... In Takekawa?!
Don't run, Takekawa!
I won't let you escape!
What's wrong, Kazuha?!
Kazuha!
Where are you?!

Don't smoke that has followed her alone...
(Yuki) There!
It's him!
(Yuki) Police!
(Yuki) Don't move!
Get out of the way!
(Yuki) Stop!
Mrs. Nanami, wait!
What's that?
Let's go on deck.
Now we know who he is.
I don't think he'll stay on the ship until he gets to port.
Good point.
But you two...
Wait, Conan!
Yuki, you go back with the others!
But... it's just that... What about that girl...?
Stop it!
Ah!
Ah!
Don't come any closer!
(X) Don't take another step!
-You have no escape!
-Rent-te!
Are you sure about that?
(Kurata) Don't do anything foolish!
There are masses of obstacles in the way...
"It's almost vertical. I can't shoot from this angle."
(Kurata) "I've got it!"
Can you rotate the cannon
counterclockwise?!
If you can, do it right away, please!
The cannon?
It's important!
-Goodbye.
-Kazuhaaa!
Hei... hei...
To the ground!
Is he alright?
Heiji!
(Kurata) Stop!
"You won't run away!"
(Sato) Don't do it!
Vingaaaa!
But how...?!
Stop him!
Surrender, Takekawa!
(Sato) Very well!
I'll leave it to you!
Heiji!
Are you hurt?!
Hurry up!
Call an ambulance, hurry!
-Heiji!
-How exaggerated you are.
Don't worry, it just grazed me.
-Yes.
-Are you really all right, Heiji? -Yes, I am.
Mm?
What's wrong, Kazuha?
What's wrong, Kazuha?
But don't cry!
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
I just got shot!
Ouch!
Ouch!
De-de... Let go of me!
Kazuha, don't be like that!
Ay, ay, ay...!
AAAI... Way to make me suffer, coi.
-Inspector, you should see this.
-But, well, now the case is already....
The police at Kansai airport
have found a hyperbaric chamber disguised as a medical chamber
on one of the international cargo flights.
Did he intend to flee into it?
Moreover, when they stopped at Takekawa airport,
it seems he had a suspicious voice mail mobile he was carrying,
and I have asked you to send it to us.
We'd better listen to it immediately.
It could be a message from Lieutenant Sasaura.
(Ayanokoli) Okay, we'll prepare it right away.
(Ayanokoli) That's good!
-What's the matter, handsome?
Did you get lost?
(Ayanokoli) -Sorry...
Where's the girl who was with you?
-Well, now that you mention it... -Where is she? Where is she?
-Ah, you mean Ran?
(Sonoko) She's gone to look at Conan and hasn't come back yet.
(Man) "The user name is a-e-ge-y-sa zero-nine-zero-two."
"The password, zero and five-five-zero-five informer."
I'm sure.
It's Lieutenant Sasaura.
(Female voice) "Message received on April 20 at 5:30 a.m."
Right around the time of his death.
This voice message was Takekawa's cell phone.
It is the irrefutable proof that he has delivered to him
the information about the destroyers to en Takekawa.
You could feel the waves.
Maybe it's because he was near the sea then.
Waves?
Yes, and you can also feel someone else's voice.
Yes.
Let's listen again.
"I have uploaded the Aegis destroyer information into the Kry cloud."
"The user name is a-e-ge-y-sa zero and nine-zero-two."
"What is that metallic sound?"
"The password..."
Can we feel that last part again?
Yes, sure.
- (man 2) Ti!
And... here...?"
- "... zero-five-zero-five informer."
-Looks like a man.
-It's true.
There is someone else.
Yes, but I don't understand what he's saying.
I'll have it analyzed right away.
I'm sorry, but...
"I don't know why, but I don't see it clearly..."
"There's something that doesn't quite add up..."
Let's continue the bridge, if you like.
(Agasa) Shinichi, the TBT we found on Lieutenant Sasaura's body...
did not come from the destroyer Hotaka!
But isn't it ship paint?
We compared it to that of the ships
moving through the ports of Maizuru and Wakasa,
and we discovered that one of the cruise ships
"... sailing around the former naval bases
has left the port of Maizuru and passed through the Wakasa shipyards."
"Just as we thought,
the TBT of the lieutenant's body matches the painting of this cruiser."
So, Lieutenant Sasaura's corpse?
has become attached to this cruiser

And that's how it went from Maizuru to Wakasa?
Yes, that must be it, by force.
A cruise ship that sailed from the port of Maizuru?
(Ayanokoli) "Today at half past five at 6 o'clock in the morning,
"The lieutenant was on top of a cliff of Maizuru harbor
and was waving a Japanese flag."
"It was seen by a cruise ship worker."
- "The password, zero-five-zero-five..."
- "Message received on April 20 at 5:30 a.m."
- "I see that the clock stopped at five-thirty-five six in the morning."
- "And calls... this morning at half past one 6."
"Two quarters to 6 a.m.?"
(Kogoro) "That's the time his watch stopped."
(Takagi) "And it's also the estimated time of death."
(Takagi) "The time when they have seen the lieutenant..."
"The time when he left the message..."
"The moment he died..."
"It all happened at the same time, two quarters of six."
Of course!
I've been wrong from the beginning!
(Ayanokoli) After arresting at Takekawa airport,
they have sent it to Public Security, Osaka Police.
We also plan to send the X
when we arrive at Maizuru Port.
You don't mind if we don't investigate it?
It doesn't matter whether we, the police or the coast guard do it.
Takekawa and the X are to be investigated jointly.
I completely agree.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-Good.
Now we've solved the case.
Well, this time...
we haven't needed any of your deductions to close it.
-Oh... Watch out!
-Ah!
Aaaaaaaah... Ayyy...
Mr. Mouri?
Excuse me.
This is the captain's seat.
You're not feeling well?
(Kogoro voice) Don't worry, I just rolled my head a little.
Did you get seasick?
On such a big ship?
No, my head rolled because of the brilliant deduction I just made.
What are you coming up with now, Mouri?
Yes, that's it.
I've figured it out.
I know who killed Lieutenant Sasaura.
Isn't it obvious, who did it?
It was X, that's why we just arrested her.
There is no doubt that the X has infiltrated the Hotaka
to steal information about the Aegis destroyers.
That's right.
And he murdered her to steal her cell phone card.
No, because the one who took the cell phone card...
was Captain Fujii, not the X.
-Wait...
-I confirm it.
So, why was he killed, Lieutenant Sasaura?
(Kogoro voice) Good question.
The X had no reason to do it.
In other words, it was not the X who killed him.
Well, who did?
What did you say?!
Think back.
Early this morning the lieutenant was spotted
on a cliff in the port of Maizuru.
-Correct.
-Yes.
He was signaling to the X.
Well, shortly after, he fell into the sea and died.
That means that today Lieutenant Sasaura...
has not set foot on board this destroyer.
We found his cell phone on board!
What are you saying?!
This was just a strategy of the murderer,
because it would appear that he had indeed gone aboard.
Reflect for a moment on how it went, Captain Fujii.
Think about what time and where you found it, the cell phone.
(Fujii) "Now that you mention it, it was quite a while since we had sailed,
and I found it in a very visible place."
(Fujii) Strange that no one had seen it before.
(Kogoro voice) Strange, isn't it?
Why is that?
Well, because it's a fake piece of evidence that they left there after they set sail.
In other words,
the murderer is someone who came aboard the destroyer later.
Am I right, Mr. Kurata?
But... What are you saying?
But I didn't even know him, Lieutenant Sasaura!
What the hell are you talking about?!
It's true, Mouri.
He also had no reason to want to kill...
I know that.
And I don't think he had any intention to kill him.
Conan.
What's that?
Play the voice mail
Lieutenant Sasaura left on Takeda's cell phone.
"I've uploaded the Aegis destroyers' information into the Kry cloud."
Well, yes.
Can't you hear a metallic sound in the background?
(Takagi) It sounds familiar...
(Tateishi) What is it, that noise?
It's what a metal baton and a gun cause
(Takagi) when they collide with each other while carrying the belt.
You recognize it, don't you, Mr. Kurata?
Stop the car.

All the Coast Guard security guys carry truncheons and guns.
I don't deny that.
The problem, however, is that this message...
has been left at five and a half minutes to 6 a.m.
-Two quarters to 6!
-And the estimated time of death is... -And the estimated time of death is...
That means she didn't have time to get up to the destroyer with the cellphone
and leave it here.
Also, the person who found the suspicious boat in Maizuru...
Wasn't it you, Mr. Kurata?
From this we can deduce
that you were patrolling Maizuru harbor at that time.
But you deny it, though?
Don't move!
I didn't expect...
I didn't expect it to end like this.
I couldn't know!
Who could it be at this hour?
How strange...
Hey, you!
What are you doing here?!
Eh?
Shit!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Coast Guard!
Quiet!
Don't run!
(Kurata) "He was extremely suspicious."
Let go of me!
(Kurata) Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Kogoro voice) "I guess he must have been scared.
"When you discovered that man leaking information
and that's why he ran away, right?"
(Kurata) "No, I didn't know anything."
"I went down streams from the cliff.
"Searching for the man who had fallen into the sea,
but then I found the abandoned boat."
"After that, I got in touch with the headquarters...
"And to alert the Maritime Self-Defense Force...
and I didn't have time to do anything else."
It wasn't until later,
when the Kyoto police informed me
that Lieutenant Sasaura's arm had been found on this destroyer,
that I inspected the man's personal belongings.
"And that is when I discovered
that the suspicious man this morning was Lieutenant Sasaura."
"He had been negligent,
but what scared me the most was that he had killed someone in the Maritime Force.
That's why I asked my boss
to let me participate in the investigation.
And why did he do that?
So that they would consider the possibility
that he had died on board the destroyer.
"If I made them believe that it was here,
I would avoid having to take responsibility for the death."
"Hence, he left the cell phone on the deck, visible,
while pretending to investigate."
And the rest you know how it went.
I know my actions have hindered the investigation.
I'm very, very sorry for everything I've done.
-No.
-Mr. Mouri!
You've seen the Ran?
We've searched everywhere and he's not part of it!
It must be lost again.
-We have looked for it very well!
-It is not that!
After he fought the spy, we haven't seen him anymore!
- (Sato) Inspector.
-How do you say?!
We have a disturbing statement.
What is it, Sato?
Yes.
What do you mean?
From X, you mean?
She says that before the capturéssim
"...a girl from among the passengers had already discovered her
and that, to prevent him from talking, she threw him into the sea."
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
It says that the girl was old enough to go to high school and that she knew karate.
No way!
Karate...?
-No!
-Ran!
What are you saying?!
-It can't be!
La Ran has...?!
"It can't be. Ran!"
(Coughs)
(Call)
(Overhead: man) "All adults are requested
to hold the creatures tightly."
What's going on
(Sekiguchi) According to the statements of the X,
we believe the Ran Mouri has fallen in this area.
-One... Wait a minute, nanos!
We've gone far enough away.
It's all the same.
Leave and prepare the helicopter.
Right now!
Make room for me!
We have made calculations from the currents.
It should be in this area.
-Yes?
Well, the current is four times stronger than normal!
-Due to the low pressures coming from the southwest,
the speed of the currents has increased a lot.
The waves are getting higher and higher.
She won't be able to hold on much longer.
We have to find her as soon as possible.
The patrol helicopter is ready!
-Yes, sir!
-All right.
Send it up right now!
Don't talk nonsense.
I'm coming too!
It's just that...
Can't you see that a child will be in the way?
"Shit..."
He won't be able to hold on much longer.
Every second counts.
We must do our best to find her before the sun sets!
-As every second counts ?!
-Receiving.
La Ran... Ran is right, isn't she?!

What can happen to a person who falls from the deck?
In principle, he wears a life jacket, but of course.... It's from very high up.
-Why...?
-If he fell badly...
- (Sonoko: crying inconsolably)
-We can't give up hope.
No, Ran!
I'm sorry, Ran!
It's all my fault!
We have no way of knowing what condition he's in?
The only thing we can do now is wait for the helicopter.
"Even though we've narrowed down the search area,
it's almost impossible to search the entire area before sunset."
"Besides, the Ran may be swept away by the currents."
"Help me... Shinichi..."
We have arrived at the indicated area.
We are about to start the search!
(Man) "We'll call it over the loudspeakers. Connect to it."
Received.
(Speaker: man) "Miss Mouri! Ran Mouri! We have come to save you!"
We will rescue her!
Be strong!
Hang in there!
Ran, where are you?!
Ran!
Raaan!
-Don't give up!
-We're coming!
-We'll save you soon!
-I don't want you to die, Ran!
"Calm down. There must be some way to find Ran."
"The swell is getting more and more violent."
"Maybe we should widen the search area."
It's getting close to sunset.
Limit the search to the alpha-bravo-foxtrot area
and continue searching!
"We are heading for alpha-bravo-foxtrot."
Miss Ran Mouri!
We've come to save you!
Hold on a little longer!
-It's gotten dark enough.
-Don't give up!
There's not even 15 minutes before sunset.
For the sun to set?
Who cares if the sun goes down?!
We won't stop looking for her!
We have to look until we find it!
I assure you that we would like to do it....
The problem is that, at this time of the year,
at 5 o'clock the sea temperature drops drastically.
So even if we find her after 5 o'clock...
"No! The sea temperature has already started to drop ?!"
"Shit, we're running out of time!"
"There's no quick fix?!"
"The clock..."
"Come to think of it, in Mitsuhiko has left it to the Ran!"
Why do they want to stop looking for it?
-They can't give up!
-We must find her at all costs!
(Mitsuhiko) It's not so unbelievable, this boat?!
- (Genta) Wasn't it a sea detective?
- (Ayumi) This!
Do something!
"A sea detective?"
"Sure! With the Aegis destroyer's radars...!"
(Ayumi) At 17.00 hours,
this ship will leave the rescue work to the specialists
and return to the port of Maizuru...
The radiorellotge!
The Ran is carrying a radiorellotge!
The Aegis system must be able to detect the signals!
Mitsuhiko!
The watch is fully submersible, isn't it?!
Yes!
It receives a signal at 5 o'clock in the morning and 5 o'clock in the afternoon!
Captain, we're running out of time!
Prepare the radiolocation equipment!
Now!
One minute 40 to 5 o'clock. We can do it, can't we?
We can do it, can't we?
Sound the alert on the bridge and on deck.
Prepare the radiolocation equipment!
This is no drill!
I repeat.
This is not a drill!
(PA: male) "Everybody take cover! This is an emergency! I repeat."
-Take cover!
- "Everyone take cover!"
"Please! We have to get there in time!"
-Start SE search!
-Radiolocation equipment ready!
-Time: 16:59.
-Search begins!
Ten seconds to 5 PM.
Nine, eight, seven, six...
five, four, three...
two..., one...
Now!
Does it detect anything?
The equipment doesn't detect... any signal.
But... how can this be?
It's possible that the watch that can receive the signals
has already sunk into the water and that's why we can't detect it.
"Ran..."
"No... It can't be. I refuse to accept it."
"I know you'll find me."
So I said let's go together.
Yes, but...
Please don't go alone, do you hear me?
I'm not worried.
That someday you may not come back!
No matter how much I get lost, I know you'll find me.
Won't you?
Right?
Sure, man, because you're a great detective.
"I'm not a great detective or anything
if I can't even find you, Ran."
"Ran... Ran..."
Ran... Ran...
Raaaaaaaaaaan!
"I just heard Conan's voice."

"I told you once before, didn't I?"
"That wherever you are, I'll know where to find you."
"But you took so long..."
"Shinichi..."
Oh!
No.
It's picking up a very weak signal!
It's getting stronger!
"It's the Ran!"
The Ran is there!
Send the helicopter!
Send there the helicopter immediately!
Roger that!
Coordinates: 4 kilometers from the ship.
Latitude: 36 degrees, 4 minutes, north.
Longitude: 135 degrees, east.
SH, go immediately to the indicated point!
"Roger. We are heading for the coordinates."
We will arrive at the indicated point shortly.
"We're right on top of it, but we have poor visibility."
"Besides, the sun's reflections on the waves are intense."
"The reflections?"
The reflections... There are several spots brighter than the others?
"Like...? Well..."
- "Yes, yes."
-Yes or no?
Answer!
"There is an area of the sea with a few points that glow
and reflect the light from the helicopter."
This is it!
Let him follow the lights!
The Ran is at the end of this trail!
Listen to the child.
Ask the helicopter to do it.
-Mm-hm.
-Please, Captain!
Follow these shiny objects.
"We believe the target may be the end of the trail."
Roger that!
We are now at the point where the glow is concentrated.
"We're beginning our descent."
"There's something below us!"
"Something other than the glowing objects."
"We've found it! Target located!"
"I confirm it is still alive. Initiating rescue."
Yes!
Alive!
-Live!
They made it!
-Yes!
Viva!
Ah... Well done.
I congratulate you.
(Tateishi) "So you have her, take her to the hospital immediately."
(Tateishi) Roger.
The victim seems to be conscious.
But we'll take him just in case.
His body temperature is low, but his pulse is stable.
Shi... Nichi...
"Kogoro..."
"Thank you."

Oh, no, don't...
Don't cry!

What's wrong with them, in this pair?
Just a moment.
Conan... That's your name, isn't it?
Ah.
That's you.
Thank you very much for everything you've done.
That's what I should be saying to you.
Mm-hm.
Good-bye. Bye-bye.
Thank you. (chuckles)
Huh? (Chuckles)
Hey, Conan.
Conan, say... Who are you really?
I'm Conan Edogawa, an ordinary first grader.
