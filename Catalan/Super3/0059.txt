DETECTIVE CONAN
The case of the murder of the first purchase
(Fuss)
How happy I am!
Have you seen what a beautiful day?
I'm dead sleepy...
All right, the first group has just left Beika's park.
Let's see in which position it will be classified
which will watch over the Junior Detective league.
Hey guys!
Good luck to you!
Thank you.
-Make sure the camera works!
-And you too, Genta.
Conan, hurry up, the others are leaving.
Now!
(Thinking) "What a bore, to participate in these things..."
Au, children, have a good time.
Be a little nicer.
The owners of these commercial galleries
are very important customers.
Eh?
Hello, Mr...
May I ask why you took this job?
What do you think, Conan?
For everyone to esteem the Junior Detective League.
That's why he begged to let us do it.
So it's not a job, but you're doing us a favor?
What's the matter?
Do you have a problem?
(Thinking) "My God, what a bunch of detectives..."
He just walked past the vegetable store.
Where will he buy radishes from, if he doesn't stop?
"What you're witnessing live
is like some kind of popular contest."
"We have to keep track of the events and film them,
so that the jury can decide which child has won."
"The rules of the game are simple."
"The children leave the park alone and go to the shopping arcades."
"They understand the things on the list and come back."
"No one can help them or talk to them."
"We can only watch."
"But this is not so easy."
"Some of them keep going to their mother for advice,
and others get lost and cry."
"There are also children who throw away the list,
and buy themselves toys and candy."
"And there are those who go into an arcade."
Oh lord, these kids today....
-(Adult voice) Yes.
(Adult voice) Oh sir, you're children too.
-Come on, children!
-Let's go shopping!
Do well!
All the best! -Let's go shopping!
Who is this child?
-He lives near home, in Hiroshi. He doesn't want to move?
Come on, Jocker, get ready, I'll beat you!
Wow!
He plays alone.
What the hell will happen to him?
He must buy a toothbrush, cottage cheese and a congratulatori envelope.
-What does congratulatori mean? -I don't know, Genta.
-I don't know, Genta.
Isn't it an envelope to put the money you give away at a funeral?
Yes, that's right!
(He thinks) "They don't understand anything! What detectives."
"Today will be a very hard day."
-Oh, look at him.
-Empaitem-lo.
-Where is he, at Hiroshi's? -Wow, I don't see him anywhere. -Well, I don't see him anywhere.
It can't be very far.
You live near here, don't you, Ayumi? Yes.
Why is that?
This means that in Hiroshi I also live around this neighborhood.
-Could it be... That he went to your house?
Tell me something... isn't he an only child in Hiroshi?
I think so, Conan.
(He thinks) "I am also an only child, and I also played alone."
"I stayed at home to play, or I went out in the street."
The culprit is you!
What a great deduction.
Ayumi, have you ever noticed if Hiroshi plays alone around here?
Yes I have noticed, Conan, he plays alone in that lot over there.
Let's have a look.
Look at it.
It's over there.
(Mitsuhiko) Let's pass!
Wow, again!
Hiroshi has disappeared again.
(Think) "Those are bike ruts. They're recent, though."
"The groove is deeper from here."
"Because the bike must have weighed more."
"It could be that in Hiroshi it would have gone up behind."

-What's wrong with you, now!
-Where are you going?
Come back!
Wait!
Where do you want me to drop you off, Hiroshi?
Uh... Over there!
-Goodbye! -Bye!
Hello, good morning!
Look at him! It's in Hiroshi!
Gee, what a bar, he waved and ran away.
Maybe he's pulling our leg.
Is he sure?
I don't think he has malice.
(Think) "An abandoned building. What has he come here to do?"
"He must have come to play?"
-Finally he's arrived. We've got ourselves a very difficult child.
He has finally arrived at the shopping malls.
Will he be able to buy everything?
First, the toothbrush.
Oh, no!
He had to buy the toothbrush here.
Maybe he'll buy the cottage cheese first.
It's hopeless...
Come on, come on Hiroshi.
(He thinks) "This rope...
has been cut with a knife!"
But what are you doing, Conan?
Come on, let's go!
Ah... all right...
And now.
A stationery shop?
(Mitsuhiko) What will you buy here?
-Will you give me a congratulatory envelope? (Mitsuhiko) -So pretty, right now.
Here's the envelope.
200 yen, please.
Ah, that's it, a congratulatory envelope.
-Mira-te, that espavilat. -It must be right by chance.
You have two things left.
What will you do?
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
Hey, Hiroshi!
Watch out, Hiroshi! Aah!
-Altoooo! -We won't make it in time!
Wait a minute!
Now you'll see!
It's gone by a hair!
It can't be!
I had put the handbrake on.
(Think) "The rope cut and now the car. What happens?"
Eh?
Where is it, in Hiroshi?
-Oh, no! -Caramba.
We've lost it again?
-That's because you don't film it! -And what are you doing, Genta?
(Thinking) "What if someone wanted to kill in Hiroshi?"
-Eh, Conan?
-What happens now?
We must find in Hiroshi!
-Isn't it the dummy of Hiroshi? -But where is it?
I had already started shopping.
Mireu.
It's Hiroshi's playmate.
That it is strange, that he has left it here.
And where did he go?
I don't know, Genta.
But surely she didn't leave of her own free will.
She has been kidnapped.
-Are you sure?
-But who did it?! -I don't know.
I don't know.
But someone wanted to kill Hiroshi
in such a way that it looked like an accident.
And both attempts failed.
-That's very serious. -It would only be necessary to kill him.
Let's tell the police.
But it's just a guess.
Maybe he won't believe it, the police.
What shall we do then?
First we'll look for Hiroshi.
Then we'll call the police.
I hope it's just my imagination.
-Nothing at all, Conan. -We haven't seen him anywhere.
We'd have to explain it to the police.
(Thinking) "Wait a minute. Who would want to kill in Hiroshi?"
"Maybe this could help us track him down."
Can you rewind the tape and show me what you've filmed?
What is it, now, Conan?
Have you seen anything suspicious?
-I haven't seen anything strange. Neither have I, guys.
Not here, a little earlier.
No, a little earlier.
Can you play this bit back to me and pause it?
Yeah, I got it.
What do you got?
What'd you find out?
Here, fixeu's-well.
In Genta's camera it looks like Hiroshi's camera is waving at us,
but at Mitsuhiko's chamber...
-What is this? -Is it a mirror?
This means that in Hiroshi greeted the mirror?
Exactly, Ayumi.
More precisely,
it was waving at some person being reflected.
-The window! -In Hiroshi I had seen someone, there!
In Hiroshi waved at someone who was at the window, right?
That's right.
In Hiroshi did not come to play.
I don't think he lost either.
He came to do something.
What must be the connection between this and his abduction?
That's what we'll have to find out right away.
I think I've got it right.
-Hiroshi's cap! -So, it's here.
(Thinks) "They'll tear down this building today."
"We don't have much time left."
"I'll have to solve it alone."
Long live the Junior Detective League!
Yes! Yes!
Keep an eye out, these floors don't look very safe.
There doesn't seem to be anything suspicious here.
We're going upstairs.
We can't get past here.
Well, there won't be anyone upstairs.
But we can go downstairs.
A basement.

-We'll find it here. W-What are you here, Hiroshi?
It's so dark, I can't see anything.
Hiroshi!
-A, a corpse? -Maybe Hiroshi is dead too.
It's okay. It's alive.
It's alive.
It smells of anesthesia!
The murderer must have kidnapped him and brought him here.
But... what's a corpse doing here?
And Hiroshi?
What's it doing here?
The murderer wanted to make the murder look like an accident.
You've already seen that the building is to be demolished today.
The murderer wanted this man to be buried under the rubble.
The floor of the second floor is already in bad shape.
When the rubble from the demolition would have fallen,
this basement would have collapsed, too.
That's what the killer intended,
but then, by chance, he came in Hiroshi.
For such as he has behaved in Hiroshi when he has come out again,
I'm sure he hadn't seen any murder.
But the murderer was not sure.
And he has chased him to the galleries and has waited.
But he has failed to kill him.
And now he wants to make Hiroshi's death look accidental.
You are right.
I find you guys are pretty smart, for being so small.
But the game is over.
Shit!
He wants to kill us too.
-Oh, no! It can't be!
Noooooooooooooo!
They do take time, on Conan and company.
Hiroshi hasn't come back either.
Where should they be, now?
They must have been entertained on the way.
You know how they are, children.
(Man) You can start the demolition.
(Heavy blows)
It's no use.
Nothing moves!
I don't want to die in a place like this.
Father, Father!
Calm down, Ayumi.
All this happened because you didn't call the police, Conan!
What the hell are you talking about?
It was you who made us come in here.
But if I... (rumbling)
An earthquake!
No.
This is not an earthquake.
They're tearing down the building.
(Ayumi) -We're lost! (Mitsuhiko) We're going to die.
(Mitsuhiko) Mom!
(Rushing water)
(Ayumi) There's a sound of water.
What if it was...?
Come on, guys, maybe we'll still be saved!
(At the same time) Like ?!
(Kogoro) No need to suffer.
Sooner or later they will appear.
What if they don't show up?
What if something had happened to them?
Ouch!
I don't lie down so hard, I'm not a doll.
(rumbling)
What was it, this noise?
What is it?
Damn kids!
-What a surprise, right? -You shouldn't have underestimated us.
We're the Junior Detective League.
I'm sorry, I wanted to see us buried under the rubble,
he wanted to see us buried under the rubble, but it didn't work out.
When you started the demolition,
you caved in the basement wall
and exposed the sewer.
Hello, sir, you're opening another store, aren't you?
I'm glad to hear it.
Can I have a cottage cheese and a toothbrush, please?
-Eh?
-Huh?
What are you doing?
But what's going on, here, Conan?
Sure, now I understand everything:
you were the owner of a store.
That's right.
A stockbroker cheated me and got me deep in debt.
Besides, my wife and son left me.
The man I murdered was the stockbroker.
He had taken my store as collateral for the loan,
and he was ruining me.
I thought that soon no one would remember me....
You were wrong, because in Hiroshi has remembered.
He wanted to come to your store to make his first purchase.
What?
Hello, good morning.
That's... that's what he wanted.
And you have unscrupulously tried to murder him.
I'm sorry, son, I'm a wretched...
Conan! What are you guys doing here?
(At the same time) The Junior Detective League is back in action!

Oh, wow, guys, what a surprise.
All this happened to you?
Well, congratulations.
Ha!
Creatures.
How burdensome they are!
I'm going home, to bathe, have a drink and sleep!
Eh!
Father!

-Oh, where is it, in Hiroshi, now? -Wow, has it disappeared again?
No, it's there.
Two more things.
What were they?
-A cottage cheese and a... -A toothbrush!
The Junior Detective League is back in action!
(At the same time) Yes!
(Thinking) "Geez, what the hell am I doing?"
"I'm having a good time and everything."
What are you looking at, Conan?
I was looking at the balcony of that house.
(Thinking) "He jumped! It's a murder!"
"The main suspect is...
the person who wanted to stop him from committing suicide!"
"But... How could he have done it, from so far away?"
