What?
What has been cancelled?
The farewell concert?
(Phone: male) "Yes."
"He no longer has the capacity to fill the hall.
"And given the circumstances it's better this way for your sake."
Mr. Director!
Wait, Mr. Director!
You know that this farewell concert is very special for me!
"I'm sorry, but I have to look after the business."
"I can't afford to continue in the red."
But... how will I be able to say goodbye to my fans?
"Write something on their website."
"Or would you prefer I do it?"
"Either way, you're guaranteed work...
"At least for another half year."
"Although they'll want to invite you
"On talk shows and entertainment programs."
Who did you take me for?
If I can't organize a farewell concert,
I don't want to continue working for you.
"Understood... As you wish."
"But keep in mind that, if you decide to terminate the contract,
"You'll have to pay me a substantial severance package."
"Well, I think we've said it all."
(Phone: tut-tut)
We take a determined step towards a glorious future.
We are totally psyched!
Today's stage is a television studio.
Danger cannot hide its true face in this world of spectacular masks.
in this world of spectacular masks.
He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!
Seaside moon, seaside sky,

Glorious mind!
Sound give me the reason why
leave me here alone.
The reason why
I do not know how I feel.
Sonido must be the truth, baby,
shall we end then it 's up to me?
Tomorrow is a different day, yeah.
And I know when I'M ready.
Glorious mind, glorious sky!
Omoikiri naitara.
Kinou made no koto ha zenbu wasureyou!
Seaside moon, seaside sky!
Itsumademo kawanaru
kokoro wo mueve ichido kimi ni todoketai...
Glorious mind!

"The demon of the television studios."
(At the same time) What?
Is it true that the filming at the TV studios
has been cancelled?
I can't believe it!
-(Ayumi) I'm so sorry! - (Ayumi) What a disappointment!
You can say it!
I was really looking forward to seeing the new joker...
The truth is that we were running out of time and...
I wanted to get one of those snacks that they give!
I invited you to the shooting
taking advantage of the fact that I work in television,
and now I'm very sorry I can't attend you.
-I'm very sorry I can't comply. And now, it doesn't matter.
Ha-ha-ha... Excuse me, guys.
Don't worry, it's no big deal.
I was thinking, since we've come all this way,
you could give us a tour
and show us around the TV studios.
Of course we could!
Yes, why not?
I'm sure we'll see lots of famous people!
I... would really like to meet the weather woman!
-I want to see the news one! -And me, the sports one!
(At the same time) Yes, how nice!
What a thrill!
(Think) "Haven't they realized yet that they have in front of their noses
"The famous singer Yoko Okino?"
(Girl) Good morning, Yoko!
(Girl) Eh?
Ah.
Good morning, Yoko Okino!
If it isn't Waka Inoue!
Look at her!
-It's true! -It's the famous presenter!
I hope today... give me some fish today, Yoko.
I could say the same to you, couldn't I, Waka?
I didn't know she had a fishmonger's shop.
Maybe they make eels with rice.
You have no idea, Genta!
Let's see;
Waka Inoue's birthday is May 13,
and it's 1.66 meters high.
"So much information!"
(Girl) Good morning everyone!
Good morning! (Girl) - Hello, good morning!
Good morning, girls.
Wow, boy!
Look, Genta, if it isn't Azusa Yamamoto!
You're right!
So many celebrities, so many celebrities!
It's so cool!
(Mitsuhiko) Yoko Okino, Waka Inoue and Azusa Yamamoto!
(Mitsuhiko) "What a shame." Wow!
I'd love to say hello to them!
I'd love to.
They're fantastic!
Ahem...
How lucky we've been to meet them, right, guys?
(At the same time) Yes!
I think we've met somewhere before.
I feel like we've met before, too.
Yes, you may have seen us in a photograph in the newspaper.

Because we are...
(At the same time) The Junior Detectives League!
(At the same time) The Junior Detectives?
Yes!
We are the Junior Detective League!
We always find out and catch the bad guys!
Yes!
-We do?
We do? -You're very good! -You're very good!
(At the same time) He-he-he... It's no big deal!
By the way, this guy, in Conan...
is also a famous detective who helps Mr. Mouri.
He-he-he?
Mr. Mouri?
You mean...?
Yes!
Kogoro Mouri!
He's an admirer of mine, he's always given me his support.
I'm impressed, Yoko,
what famous fans you have, right?
We'd better let
Yoko answer all the questions of problems and deductions.
She can't do that to me, that! What questions are you talking about?
Well, we're here today to record a quiz show.
The management has asked us to participate as contestants.
Of course, of course!
That's why you told him to give you some fish, right, Azusa?
Listen Yoko...
When it comes to competition, I'm not going to be a quibbler,
and I intend to win the contest!
What?
How can you be so ruthless?
You're a witch!
-A witch? -He called her a witch!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What's wrong with you, Ayumi?
What did you see?
-Help! -It's a demon!
(Shouting)
Who the hell are you?!
You must be the new mysterious character from "Yaiba the Masked"!
What!
More than a mysterious character from a movie,
you look like the new leader of an evil gangster organization!
Yes, I'm sure this... is their new leader!
What's wrong with him, you bunch of brats?
(They call out)
Eh?
You really haven't heard of me?
-Yes. -Yes.
Yes.
(sighs)
I'm completely sunk, then.
(At once) What?
At this rate, I may soon be...
the new... mysterious character from "Yaiba the Masked".
(At the same time) Hey!
Good morning to you!
Who was that?
-I've never seen her before.
I-I haven't seen him either.
The guy you just met
is the singer of a rock band called Sanzo Three.
He calls himself Satan Onizuka.
I heard he's going to perform on an entertainment program today.
Ah.
A rock singer on an entertainment show?
Life in hell must be really hard.
Eh... Onizuka?
Satan?
Satan?
Onizuka Satan?
Satan Onizuka?
What's wrong with you, Mitsuhiko?
Nothing, nothing.
Satan Onizuka, you said?
This name rings a bell and I don't know why.
Aaaah!
I got it!
My older sister is a fan of this singer,
in Satan Onizuka!
She told me to ask him for an autograph if I met him on TV!
Aaaah!
We have to look for an autograph!
It's just that now... he's gone, and who knows where!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
-You mean you're not exaggerating? - (cries)
Yes...
Calm down, kid!
We'll ask Yoko where is this singer's dressing room
and we'll go look for her, won't we, Yoko?
Oh, boy!
Where has this girl gone?
Yuki, Yuki, Yuki, Yuki, Yuki.
Bye, bye, bye!
How strange!
But Yoko was here a moment ago!
Yes, but a boy came,
he told her that the recording was about to begin
and took her away.
The other two contestants have gone too.
But, guys, we don't need any help to find him.
Yes.
You're right!
After all, we know it must be somewhere in the studios.
Yes!
Will you guys help me look for it?
Come on, let's go!
Eh?
O-ostras!
Sa... Satan!
I see you're early.
The program recording doesn't start until this afternoon.
I know that.
It's just that I had some free time and I came much earlier.
By the way, manager, could you go get me something to eat?
I haven't eaten yet.
Yes, no problem.
Tell me, what do you want?
Well... bring me some Tenpukutei noodles.
Some noodles from Tenpukutei...
One three-delicious rice from Janjanken.
One three-delicious rice from the Janjanken...
And something else, too!
I'd like some Eirinan crests.
Some Eirinan crests, please...
Oysters!
You want me to go to 3 different places
to order the noodles, the rice and the crests?
It's all Chinese, isn't it okay if I order it from the same place?
No way, kid!

Each restaurant has its own specialty.
Besides, they are restaurants where I go to eat often.
I don't think they will give you a bad face if you order just one dish.
E... connoisseurs.
By the way, did you find... the mirror I asked for?
Yes, I did.
A friend of mine saw one that looked very much like it.
Now I'll stop by the store to buy it.
All right, perfect.
Thank you very much.
If I don't have that mirror,
I'm not inspired enough when it comes to makeup.
All right, you guys.
I'll be right back.
Oh, before you go...
When I'm done eating, I'm going to take a nap,
so don't wake me up until it's time for the performance.
All right, you guys.
Yesterday I had an argument with the director,
and I was so into it that I spent the night in a blank.
Come to think of it, the director has to come to the studios, right?
I think so.
It will be in the reception room, two floors up.
I'm off.
I'll see you later.
After the recording... I'll go and apologize to him.
That's a very good idea.
I never imagined that a television studio...
would always be so crowded.
There's no way to find anything in here!
I hope no one needs to go to the bathroom, eh?
-It's a maze!
I think we'd be done sooner if we asked someone.
Yes, we'll have to ask.
(People: murmur of voices)
(Door: knock)
Come in.
I didn't expect you so early!
I thought we were supposed to meet from two o'clock...
I didn't expect to see you.
I wanted to apologize.
(CLEC)
Have you come to meet someone, Mr. Director?
Yes.
A person they need to collaborate with a new program.
By the way, didn't you have to perform...
in an entertainment program starting at two o'clock?
What, you haven't prepared yet?
No.
I have plenty of time to get ready in half an hour.
By the way, about... yesterday, it was me who refused.
I know you're a little upset, but it's for your own good.
Look, we'd better let the matter drop.
By the way, Mr. Director, what do you think of this raincoat?
It's light and doesn't let water through.
Besides, it's cheap.
Yes..., it's very nice.
But the best of all and what I like the most is...
I can cover my head with the hood.
It's an extraordinary piece... to avoid blood splashes.
Eh?
Aaaaaaah!
Ah.
It's this one!
Mr. Satan Onizuka.
It's his dressing room for sure.
We found it, Mitsuhiko!
Yes!
But, now I don't know if we should go in without telling him.
I can't even imagine the face he makes when he's angry.
Don't worry about it!
The hallway is full of people going up and down.
If things go wrong, we can call for help.
"Ha-ha. They're overreacting."
I'll knock on the door, okay?
-Yeah. Hm.
(Ep, boy!
Don't knock!
Mr. Satan is napping and doesn't want to be woken up.
He can't be!
He sleeps too?
(Satan) Yes.
I also sleep.
If I didn't sleep, I wouldn't have the strength to do misdeeds.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Please, Mr. Satan.
Could you sign an autograph for me?
My... my sister is a big fan of yours.
Oh, my goodness!
What's her name?
A... Asami.
It's spelled A-S-A-M-I.
"To the Asami, with affection."
It has.
Thank you very much, Satan!
From now on, you and your sister are members of the demon clan.
(sinister laughter)
Oh!
Little paper figures!
Don't touch anything, children!
- (Ayumi) There are many cranes! - (genta) Yes!
(genta) It's true!
Mr. Satan, all these figures are made by you?
(Ayumi) Yes, boy.
Sometimes, when I have free time,
I amuse myself with some typical human hobbies.
But today, unfortunately, I only had time to make 5 cranes.
-Oh, what a strange ruler!
If I use a ruler, I get straighter folds.
-Ah... -Ah...
A demon who does origami...
Don't you find this spoils your image?
Yes... That's why none of my admirers should know about it.
Is that clear enough, guys?
If you let it slip... I'll put a death curse on you!
Eeee... en-entesooos.
Have you woken up yet, Satan?
I brought you the mirror you asked for.
Let's see... It was this one, wasn't it?
It is.
Yes!

It was this one.
With this mirror, I'll be able to make up even in the dressing room.
-Thanks, noi. -You're welcome.
Ooh...
Mm?
What's... what's wrong with you?
Yes, my contact lenses are bothering me... a little bit.
Don't stand in the corridor, please come in.
Ah... Thank you very much.
-Is everything all right, Mitsuhiko? -You seem a little nervous. -You seem a little nervous.
No..., don't worry, I'm fine.
Come to think of it, I have something else.
I also bought you some eye drops.
You'd run out.
-Yes. -Yes.
Let-let-me-get 'em over here. O-Okay.
Hey, how come these three takeout plates here...
are all from different restaurants?
It's just that Mr. Satan's a little fickle about food.
Yes.
Turns out the food that humans cook for themselves...
isn't always suitable enough for my delicate and refined palate.
(Sirens: approaching)
The police!
There are also ambulances!
(Sirens)
Something must have happened near here.
They have stopped at the entrance of the television studios!
What could have happened, in here?
(Door: knock)
Oh, man!
What a scare!
Yes.
I'm coming!
We don't have much time, we have to go to the set right away.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
It's, it's the production manager...
Something creepy has happened to him!
Please come with me, it's very important!
Let me through!
Out of the way!
Satan?
Satan Onizuka?
Excuse me!
Oh!
Satan Onizuka!
(Man) Satan!
Long time no see!
Excuse me!
It's here, Satan!
Mr... Mr. Director!
My God!
Who the fuck... could have done... something like that?
