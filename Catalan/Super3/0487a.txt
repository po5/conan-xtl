(People: whispers)
(Exclamations of surprise)
Is it true, what, what you told me before?
Oh.
(murmurs)
I thought we were friends.
(murmurs)
I told you that...
It has already arrived.
(Murmurs)
Suwa, Yoshioka and Asai, 3 suspects.
Is it possible that they have an accomplice?
(murmurs)
Oh.
What's wrong? (All) Oooh...
(All) Oooh...
Am I wearing something stuck to my face or what?
(All) Eh...
So, what the hell is wrong with you, everybody?
Yes..., excuse me, boy.
I hear you.
Everybody whispers when I turn around.
Talk about me?
What's going on?
I want to know what's going on!
No... Oh... No..., nothing's wrong.
Is it?
N... no.... It's no big deal.
It's, it's nothing.
It's nothing.
Isn't it?
Ha-ha!
It's your imagination.
(laughs)
Of... right?
-Oh, yes, of course!
-And so much!
-It's all right.
It's c-c-calm.
You can relax now, really.
I'm done!
I've interrogated the suspect in Ainocho's case.
Well... Yes... Yes...
Regarding this matter...
Phew!
I'm exhausted!
(Takagi: laughing)
I'm the best!
I'm serious.
When I questioned him, he started singing like he was going to the opera!
(laughs) Yes.
It sounded like a TV crime series,
as if he had swallowed the talking potion!
(At the same time) Takagi!
What... what's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
You know it all too well, you!
Do I?
Anyway,
you should have explained it to us first of all.
-That's right, Takagi! -What?
Look, Takagi,
we need time to get our heads together, too, okay?
What do you mean?
Mentalize session, you say?
And why do you have to mentalize, if I may ask?
Ta... Takagi!
Calm down...
OK, OK, OK.
Tell me, Takagi.
What?
It was... you, wasn't it?
(Takagi) What's wrong, Inspector Megure's phone?
(Mobile)
Oh, Takagi, man... Don't be clueless!
We're talking about Inspector Sato.
- (Mobile) -What?
Yes?
Look at this.
She's wearing something shiny on her finger.
What's that?
Ran!
Hello.
What's happened?
It's a ring.
A ring!
Oooh... A ring?
Yes.
(Takagi) A ring...
Yes.
(Takagi) Oh!
(Takagi) Oh!
(Takagi) It's true!
Ah... (Takagi) It's a ring!
(Takagi) What?
A... a ring?
"I've never seen it before, this ring!"
"Besides, she wears it on the ring finger of her left hand..."
"Who... who must have given it to her?"
j "Calm down, boy, calm down!"
"You have to calm down."
"You have to keep your blood cool, it's very important!"
"I'll ask Inspector Sato."
Caram, Inspector Sato, what a beautiful ring!
I'm sorry!
It's just that I'm engaged.
Miwako...
Sato mi...
Miwa...
He-he-he-he-he... What's the matter?
If she wears it on the ring finger of her left hand, it means...
...she's engaged.
But you have to explain this to us.
Come on!
I wish I could tell you something like that.
What? You're not the one...
It's not you who... gave her the ring she's wearing?
No, and now!
I didn't buy it for her, I've never even seen her before.
Then, who gave it to her?
(They speak at the same time)
-I have no idea. She must be seeing someone.
I have no idea.
(Talks at the same time)
Who could it be, who gave it to her?
Inspector Tosawa, maybe?
At Taniguchi's, traffic!
Excuse me one second.
You guys!
Stop it!
Shut up at once!
Please, Ran...
Tell me, Ran.
Yes, sorry... What else?
Yes.
Yes... What's that?
Are you serious?
Has someone died?
Got it.
I'll be right back, okay?
Don't worry about anything, Ran.
Takagi!
Let's go, let's go!
Something's happened at the Okutama mansion.
-Endavant. -Eh... Yes!
Can you hold that for me, partner?
Mm?
And what do you want me to make, from your coffee?
"Why me?"
"Now that's... that's..."
"Now that's a well-wrapped case!"
We make a determined step towards a glorious future.
We are totally psyched!
Inspector Sato is wearing a ring on her left hand.
Did you finally ask her for it, Inspector Takagi?
Always find out the only truth!

He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

"The love story between the inspectors

(Kogoro) Wow!
What a beautiful ring!
What a lot of precious stones!
It's all diamonds...?
It's the first time I've seen such a ring.
Ha-ha-ha.
Yes, sir.
I had it made to commemorate the success of my 100th novel.
There's a number 100 engraved on the back. Look.
In fact, I had the jeweler make me a ring with 100 diamonds in it,
but they told me it would be bigger than a sewing thimble.
and they didn't recommend it at all.
(CLEC) It's true...
- (CLEC) MM?
Hello... Excuse me, I have to change the tape.
It's a funny thing,
nowadays there are not many people left who use tape recorders that work with cassette tapes.
that work with cassette tapes.
Yes, it is now more common to use digital recorders.
But I prefer to watch the tape spinning on cassette
to make sure it's recording well.
Actually, digital recorders scare me a little bit.
Oh... Maybe you're right.
(Boy) It's the same for me.
All my colleagues in the profession
use the current digital cameras,
but I still use an analog camera like this one,
of the... of all the life.
I can't separate myself from it.
Although it makes me a little angry
I can't check on the spot if a photo has turned out well or not.
Listen, guys!
I'm sorry to interrupt this conversation about analog cameras,
but Mr. Moroguchi has a lot of work to do.
and the deadline is getting closer and closer.
So, let's stop with the anecdotal conversations...
and let's get what we came here to do over with.
-It's no big deal, Anabuki.
We must practice a lot before we finally record...
my conversation tomorrow with detective Mouri.
I'd like you to stay for dinner at my place tonight.
Tomorrow morning, when we have rested,
we'll continue recording as much as you want.
What do you think, Mr. Editor?
That's fine.
In fact, this has been a preliminary meeting, a kind of rehearsal.
This month's issue already announces the colloquium.
Look.
"The writer Masataka Moroguchi and the famous detective Kogoro Mouri
"They will talk about a new awakening of mystery."
You can see they've made a big deal out of it.
-Would you like to take a look? MM?
Let's see...
What's the matter with you today, Conan?
You seem very worried.
Eh... No, not at all.
I was just thinking that he's not exactly how I imagined him, this man.
Who are you talking about?
Don Moroguchi, maybe?
Hm.
His mystery novels take into account all the details,
even the most insignificant,
and that's precisely why I thought
that he would be an irritable and high-strung person.
Mm?
Anabuki!
Eh?
Yes?
Do you have a ruler?
Eh... Yes.
Can you use a tape measure, sir?
I thought so.
The letters of my name in the diary
are a millimeter smaller than those of the other writers!
Are you kidding me?!
But... What nonsense!
They must have had to reduce the size of the letters to fit.
Then why didn't they also reduce the names of the other writers?
You're a bunch of useless people!
Ah!
I'm very sorry, sir.
I assure you it won't happen again.
No, of course it won't.
(Thinking) "I knew it. He's a cranky, grumpy person."
The Akiba, the editor I had before, on all my other books,
was a thousand times better than you.
He satisfied all my desires, whatever they were.
Wow!
Well, he would make a fantastic editor, wouldn't he?
Yes.
He would find me the photographic material
and I would research and gather expertise

on different... topics.
When he worked for me,
he did it without sparing any effort.
Until he... he died.
He says... you say he died, the publisher?
Yes, one fine day, in the spring of this year,
they found him dead in his house... in a locked room.
What? He died in a locked room?
He died in a locked room?
That he committed suicide?
Yes, of course he did.
This isn't one of my mystery novels,
although, honestly,
I wanted to write a book based on his death.
Until the Anabuki stopped me.
And what did he want me to do?
The whole publishing world took notice of the Akiba's sudden death.
If we had published a novel based on those events,
it would have become a hot topic in the gossip magazines...
I couldn't allow it.
Gossip is only hearsay.
They are not the truth.
Besides, if I had dedicated my novel...
to the late publisher Akiba,
I'm sure it would have been a bestseller.
But that's not...
Wow!
What a drag!
Now I've run out of mine.
You want to use my pencil?
I prefer to use this type of pencil.
These pencils... they're analog.
Thank you. Thank you.
That's very kind of you.
For the moment, we should start...
to prepare for tomorrow's colloquium, gentlemen.
Tomorrow morning we'll make the final recording.
We can't go improvising.
That would be a waste of rollers.
"The preparations for the next day's recording took two hours,
"with dinner in between."
"Then we didn't know that that work would be for nothing,
"Because... it just so happened that...
"One of the protagonists of the colloquium..."
Mr. Moroguchi!
It's already 5 o'clock in the morning, sir.
Sir?
Sir? Sir!
Is there a problem?
-Mr. Mouri! -She's still sleeping?
Yes.
I'd say so.
But tonight he must have been working late.
Then open the door with a copy of the key.
It's just that... Mr. Moroguchi can't stand...
entering his room for any reason.
There are no copies of the key.
He doesn't want the material stolen.
Conan!
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
"I have a bad feeling."
"I feel something choking me and barely letting me breathe."
"When this happens to me, it can only mean one thing."
"He's been dead for an hour or so."
"The smell of almonds! She's been poisoned with cyanide."
"Around the mouth she has traces of coffee."
"The poison was mixed with the coffee."
"I had already locked the door."
"The only thing that's open...
"is the ventilation window through which I entered,
"But this opening is barely big enough for a child to fit through."
"And I imagine that the key in his hand is the key to the room."
"Has he committed suicide?"
"No. It's... murder."
(Takagi) The victim is the mystery novel writer
Masataka Moroguchi, age 52.
The cause of death was asphyxiation caused by ingested
cyanide ingestion.
Looking at him, from the coffee coming out of his mouth, I can imagine that....
...he put cyanide in his coffee and swallowed the poison.
But there is also the possibility that she has been poisoned.
This man could not have been poisoned.
Both the door and the window of this room were closed when we were able to enter.
when we were able to enter.
Furthermore, you see that Mr. Moroguchi has the room key in his hand....
and there is no duplicate.
Therefore, it can only have been a suicide.
What?
Why are you so sure, you?
If someone had put poison in his coffee before he locked himself in the room,
the murder could still have been committed
without anyone opening the door.
In any case, the murderer would have to be someone...
who knew that Mr. Moroguchi always drank coffee when he got up in the morning.
when he got up in the morning.
And what else!
Do you know anyone who drinks coffee with the key in his hand?
Besides, it is absolutely impossible...
that he had time to take the key to the room
when he realized that the coffee was poisoned.
It's more likely that he took the key
and had it in her hand before she drank the coffee.
Maybe he wanted to leave us a message.

But this morning, Mr. Moroguchi had planned...
to record a television colloquium with you, Mr. Mouri.
Eh... Yes.
There's also the possibility that he fell asleep,
grabbed the key out of the blue
and had a coffee to wake you up
just before leaving the room, in a hurry.
Please take a good look at yourself, man!
The coffee cup has fallen right next to the bed.
-Yes, that's right.
That's right.
If you look, the coffee pot is in the kitchen.
If he had been in a hurry, he would have made the coffee...
and he would have drunk it in the kitchen itself.
It would have been a waste of time to put the cup on a saucer...
and take the coffee to bed with him.
Something else may also have happened, Mouri.
This morning, someone came to wake up Mr. Moroguchi,
brought him a freshly brewed coffee poisoned with cyanide,
left it on his bedside table, told him to hurry...
and gave him the key before he left the room.
This doesn't make any sense.
If that were the case, the person who came to wake him up...
should have left the room
before Mr. Moroguchi drank the coffee,
so Mr. Moroguchi himself...
should have locked the door.
Some people drink their coffee right away and others wait,
but if he had been in a hurry, he would have drunk it right away, of course.
But maybe Mr. Moroguchi had a very sensitive tongue and had to let it cool down a bit.
and had to let the coffee cool a little before drinking it.
This is not true.
Mr. Moroguchi was a great coffee lover.
He drank it whether it was cold or hot,
and he liked it anyway.
Isn't that right, Dejima?
Yes...
At the publishing house, everyone knew that.
Ahem... Let's see, who are you 3?
Yes, I'm Mr. Moroguchi's editor-in-chief,
my name is Anabuki, sir.
The guy on my left is Taruma, the photographer,
and the one on the right is the content editor, in Dejima.
So, you arrived at Mr. Moroguchi's mansion this morning...
to make preparations for the colloquium you were to hold today, right?
No, sir, all 3 of us stayed overnight in this house.
We were too lazy to have to get up early
to get here before 5 o'clock in the morning.
There's something strange.
If someone broke in here,
they should have forced the door or broken the window to get in,
but there's nothing to suggest that's how they got in.
How did the murderer get in, then?
It's very simple.
Come here, boy!
Conan came in through that ventilation window,
and then opened the door from the inside.
"That's why we were able to enter too.
"And we found Mr. Moroguchi's body just as it is."
So, this window was open.
Yes, it was open.
But you can see that the opening is barely wide enough
for a child to pass through.
With all that being said
and assuming that Mr. Moroguchi has committed suicide,
it's hard to understand why he's holding the room key in his hand.
Perhaps he suspected...
that one of the guests staying over at his house would try to kill him at some point.
would try to kill him at some point.
As I have said before, if this had been a homicide,
the killer should have said to him:
"Lock the door, keep the key in your hand and drink your coffee".....
to provoke this situation.
What about you?
Does it seem to you that the gentleman had the intention of committing suicide?
Well... I would say no.
-The truth is that he didn't seem to have any motive to commit suicide.
No.
You're absolutely right.
Well, maybe he had personal problems that he couldn't tell anyone else.
He himself told us that this year in the spring a certain Akiba,
his former publisher, committed suicide.
Maybe he felt responsible for that poor man's death.
For the time being, you will all have to wait...
for the forensic police to arrive.
If it was indeed a homicide,
the killer's fingerprints could be
anywhere in the room.
Mr. Moroguchi would have been suspicious right away..,
if someone had come in to bring him coffee with gloves on.
Besides, once the room was locked,
the murderer no longer had the opportunity
to come in and wipe off the fingerprints.

I imagine... that none of you haven't touched anything
when we hadn't arrived yet, right?
No!
Detective Mouri has warned us not to touch anything in there
until the police arrived.
It's a clear-cut suicide.
There's no need to call the forensic police.
Hey, Takagi.
Haven't you noticed? How?
How?
The ring.
Ah!
What are you talking about now, Conan?
I'd be fooling you if I told you I didn't notice this ring coi,
but now is not the time to talk.
Mm?
What?
You didn't understand me, boy!
No?
What ring are you looking at?
It's that one!
The writer's ring!
The number 100 engraved on the bottom is upside down.
You're right, Conan!
But maybe he put it on backwards without realizing it.
Maybe he did, but... we know this man was very meticulous,
I don't think he put the ring on backwards unintentionally.
Besides, this ring he's wearing...
Look at the diamonds.
Look closely at the diamonds.
It's true!
I knew it was a murder!
The motive for the murder was the writer's diamond ring.
After killing Mr. Moroguchi,
the murderer stole the ring and put on a fake one,
but he was in such a hurry,
he didn't realize he had put it on backwards.
Do you remember if Mr. Moroguchi always wore the ring?
Ah... Yes.
This ring was his treasure, and he said he never took it off,
neither to take a bath... nor to go to sleep.
So, maybe Inspector Takagi is right,
and we still can't rule out the murder theory.
In this case, we have a new mystery we have to solve.
"Yes."
"The murderer has put the fake ring on Mr. Moroguchi.
"After killing him."
"This means that, when he died, the murderer was inside the room."
"How could he have gotten out, the person who did it,
"From a locked room?"
"How could he have fled if Mr. Moroguchi had the key in his hand?"
"It could also be that he took the key.
"After committing the murder, he would have left the room...
"And, in some way that we don't yet know,
"He would have put the key back in Mr. Moroguchi's hand."
"The only opening is the ventilation window."
"From the window to the corpse's hand must be about 4 meters."
"Can something like that be done... from that far away?"
