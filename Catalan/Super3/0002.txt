"I still go to high school, but I've solved many crimes."
"The murder on the roller coasters was easily solved,
but I was given an unknown poison and now I have a very serious problem."

DETECTIVE CONAN
The famous detective who shrank
Are you all right, creature?
(Think) "Breed?"
"But what s'empatolla? Already in high school!"
How did you get this bump on the head?
'Once?'
'Sure!
The man dressed in black gave it to me! '
'What happened?'
We found a child.
He's wounded.
He's tiny.
'Who's tiny?'
'What do these say?'
I don't trust them.
He's got a head wound, maybe he's had an accident.
Eh?
Where is the child?
What if he's had an accident?
Look for him!
Yes, yes!
I'm here!
Ah, it's you, Ran!
Father, what's all this mess?!
It's normal for you to lose customers!
That's precisely why your mother left you!
I choose my customers.
By the way, where is your detective-like friend?
We were going together until we left the amusement park,
but on the way back...
I'm sorry.
Go ahead, I'll be right back!
What happened to him?
(He thinks) "It seems impossible that he is so tired
having run so little."
I've shrunk!
But how?
It could be that this man...
We will use the poison that the organization has discovered.
It could be that it was the poison they gave me.
(Telephone)
(Answering machine) "Hello, this is Shinishi. I am not here right now.
Leave your name and phone number..."
He's not in.
How strange.
He must have gone to dinner with his famous writer father.
His parents went to America!
Now I live alone! What do you say now?
I'm sure... something's happened to him.
I'm going home!
That we don't owe dinner?
'Gee, I can't even go into my house.'
Aaaaaaaa!
Professor Adasa!
Who are you?
It's me, at Shinishi.
Ah, you're a relative of en Shinishi!
Look, he lives next door.
I am in Shinishi!
I'll prove it to you right now!
You are Professor Adasa.
He is 52 years old.
His inventions are a failure.
You have a mole on your ass with a hair.
I only knew it in Shinishi, that!
That jerk explained my secret.
It's me, in Shinishi!
They gave me a strange potion that made me shrink!
A potion that makes you shrink? Yes.
Aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!
If this concoction exists, show me.
You're a very suspicious boy, I'll call the police.
You came running from the Columbo restaurant, didn't you?
How do you know?
For the clothes, professor.
It's got a spring in the front and no spring in the back.
This proves he ran home in the rain.
And his pants are muddy.
There's only mud on the construction site in front of the Columbo.
And he has Columbo "special sauce" in his beard.
How do you know that?
(Two voices) Ah, ah, ah.... Elementary, dear Adasa.
Shi... Shinishi!
I get it!
The poison was not perfected and has an unusual side effect,
it shrinks the one who takes it.
That's right.
I'll have to wear the clothes I wore when I was little.
Please, Professor, you're a genius, aren't you?
Prepare a potion to make me normal again.
I'll have to find out what they gave you first.
I have to find their hiding place and take poison, right?
Man, this would go well.
If those men know you're still alive,
they'll hunt you to death.
This will be our secret.
Don't tell anyone.
Not even the Ran.
Shinishi! It's the Ran!
Oh, my lord!
Hide!
You're not at home.
Oh!
Professor Adasa!
You're not in Shinishi?
'Father's glasses!'
'I already have a disguise.
Oops, what a prescription! '
Eeeh? Anybody here?
Aw, don't be shy.
Come on, be there to thank him!
Oh!
And now, what a boy!
He's gorgeous!
What tits!

Who is he, this child? Well, look, a distant relative.
What's your name?
My name is Shin... I mean...
What?
Well, my name is...
Conan!
My name is Conan Edogawa!
Conan?
What a weird name!
It's just that my father was a Conan Doyle fan.
You remind me a bit of...
It seems like an imposition, but can he stay with you for a few days?
Are you kidding?
His parents had an accident and are in the hospital.
And he can't stay here to...
Okay, but I'll have to ask my father.
Sure, you'll ask him, won't you?
Are you happy, Conan?
But, hey, what if they find out who I am?
To be the same as before, you'll have to find those men.
Ran's father is a private detective.
Maybe he'll know something! That's right.
Hey, Conan.
Ah, yes...
'I've gotten used to this name.'
Do you have a girlfriend? What?
A girl you like, maybe from school.
Ah... Of course you don't.
Well, I do, I'm crazy about a boy.
Well... Isn't that what you came looking for, in Shinishi?
That's right.
As a child, he was already a cheeky, confident and passionate about mysteries.
But he was always supportive and helpful.
He's brave and very handsome.
I like him a lot!
Hey, don't tell him anything at all, huh?
Don't worry.
I live here, Conan.
It's like I've gained a little brother, I can talk to you about everything.
Ran...
I'll introduce you to my father.
Follow me.
Ah, listen, Ran...
The truth is...
Mmm?
The truth is...
At last!
Finally!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
A man dressed in black has kidnapped the daughter of a very rich man!
A man dressed in black?
Cab!
Conan, where are you going?
Duty calls.
They need the favors of the famous Kogoro Mouri!
What are you doing here?!
He went up first!
I'm going by car!
Who the fuck is he?! A relative of Professor Adasa.
You'll be in my way.
Unload!
It's impossible, we're already on the highway!
They've kidnapped my daughter, Masako Tani.
She's only 10 years old.
My butler has witnessed the events.
(He thinks) "Poca-sueltas, I don't see her. How many inconveniences, being small!"
Describe the kidnapping, Mr. Azao.
-But who is he, this child? -Quiet, it's an acquaintance.
Ran, take care of this one!
And now, explain to me how it went.
Miss Masako had just come home from school
and was playing in the garden.
"Suddenly, a man dressed in black came in and said to me:
'Tell Mr. Tami that if he wants to get her back
he must close the company for a month.
If you tell the police, the girl will die.'"
By this pine, he has jumped into the street with the girl.
Describe the kidnapper.
Sorry, my eyesight is bad.
What a pity.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Conan, you mustn't interfere with the father's work.
Has anyone else felt the kidnapper's voice
or something strange?
No, everything was quiet
until Mr. Azao called that the girl had been kidnapped.
Only Mr. Azao saw her, the kidnapper.
The perpetrator is someone who works for a rival company of yours.
Damn it!
Besides, they want me to pay a ransom!
-A ransom? -They just called me.
They want 3 million in used bills.
-There's been some mistake. (Tani) -Azao, stay out of it!
(They argue)
(Thinking) "There's something wrong.
(Tani) "Why did she go into the garden?
"It would have been easier to catch her going to school or coming back.
"And it's unwise to let herself be seen.
But if he's asked for used tickets, he could be a pro."
In you must know a lot, play soccer!
A little bit.
In Shinishi did it a lot, this, while thinking.
It helped her think clearly.
'Sure, it's just that I'm in Shinishi.'
Ay!
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
Conan!
Oooh!
It's rare in Jumper to accept strangers!
'The kidnapper must have gone through this pine tree. '
'This dog beam must have embroidered, for sure.'
'I've got it!'
'I've solved the case!'
This dog will bark at any stranger, won't he?
Yes, he does.
In Jumbo he's a fantastic guardian.
(Thinks) "The servants said that everything was quiet
until Mr. Azao called."
Mr. Azao, where ?!
'Now you've understood.'
There's something wrong.
He said the kidnapper came in and took her away.

He has climbed the tree, but the dog has not embroidered!
Ah... it's...
There are many inconsistencies in your statement.
There was no man dressed in black, was there?
Confess!
Mr. kidnapper.
Azao, it's youuuu!
Oh, forgive me, sir!
Forgive me!
Why did you do it?
Were you in cahoots with someone?
No!
I came up with it all by myself!
-And... where is the girl now? -In a hotel nearby.
Gentlemen, tancaaaat case!
The great detective Kogoro Mouri always solves every case!
'Not this.'
'No.'
'This case is not everything.'
The phone, sir, the phone!
Not now.
Tell him I'll call him back.
But it's...
Yes, tell him...
(Man) Do you have the money, Mr. Tani?
Aaaaaaaaah!
Who are you?!
This, I've said it before.
I am the one who has kidnapped your daughter.
(Man) Impossible!
The kidnapper is the...
I had an accomplice!
No, I did it all alone!
Believe me, please!
He's telling the truth.
'What must have happened is that after the first kidnapping,'
'Someone must have kidnapped the girl again.'
'And it could be someone dangerous.'
(Girl) Father, help me!
Masakoooo!
I have such a bad temper.
If the 3 million doesn't reach me soon, I'm not responsible for your safety.
Please, I will prepare the money for you.
Don't hurt my daughter.
Make him talk, see if he'll give us clues to the hideout.
The hideout?
(Man) Who's he talking to?
It won't be the police.
No.
I'm in a school warehouse!
I see a big chimney!
Masako!
I'll call you in an hour.
Bring the money.
You pussy of a wench!
You talk too much!
We know it's in a school warehouse with a fireplace.
It doesn't give us much of a clue.
We'll need more time.
You go get the money ready.
Oh, sir, yes.
The kidnapper must be nervous, now that we know more. '
'If we don't find her soon...'
What are you doing with this, Conan?
Ran, it's not long since the kidnapping.
Where could the warehouse be, if they're not far away?
Of course, this man couldn't have gone far.
So, the number of schools is reduced.
Conan, where are you going?
Ran, follow the dog!
'It could be the chimney of a factory or a public bath.'
'There are 5 schools, in this area.'
No.
Not here.
Not here either.
'I didn't get it right.'
'There's no other school where you can see a chimney.'
'It may not be in this area.'
Wait a minute.
Maybe it is.
It's here!
He's seen the building and thought it was a chimney.
'The school from where you can see this is...'
Futatsubashi High School!
Leave the money at the bank in Yacushi Park.
When I get them, I'll let you go.
(Father) -Let me hear your voice! -Later.
We've already closed the deal.
This means I don't need you anymore.
Quiet!
Who's there?!
Where are you?!
I'm right here!
Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Help!
It's already solved.
But who are you?
Shinishi Kudo.
I mean...
In Conan Edogawa.
I'm a detective.
Detective?
You won't beat me that easily!
'I'm so small I don't have enough strength.'
'I can't even hit the ball!'
Ah!
Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaah!
'Now that I'm so small,'
'Even if I find the criminal, I can't stop him or fight me.'
No more games.
Now you will die!
No, Conan!
I will die!
What's the matter?
La Ran! '
'Gee, what strength!'
You're already saved.
How did you find us, Ran?
I followed you and saw Jumbo.
Oooh, Jumbo!
You're the kidnapper, eh?
He has!
He has!
And he has!
The famous detective Kogoro Mouri has captured the kidnapper!
What a fool!
Father, I planned it myself, the kidnapping.
You?
You're always too busy with business to play games with me.
I asked the Azao to help me pretend to do it.
I thought if the company shut down for a while, you'd be with me!
So the first kidnapping was a comedy.
I don't care if she planned it, what you've done is unforgivable.
-Do you realize that, Azao? -Yes, sir.
You will organize a week's vacation in Australia!
At Masako's, she's really looking forward to it!

But... but sir!
It will be for two, Masako and me.
Oh, Father!
It was a great idea to let the dog loose to track her down.
Aaaaah!
That's years of experience, sir!
'Show-off!
I've found out where it was!
I'll be by to see him to settle the score.
I'll be waiting for you, sir!
Thank you, Mr. Detective.
Mr. Detective?
No, he wasn't saying it to me!
I was telling your father.
Father, listen to something.
Professor Adasa has asked me to stay with us for a few days.
Father, is that all right with you?
Of course it is!
Since he's arrived, I've got a job and I've solved the case!
I have decided: you will be my son.

(Everyone) mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?
I am a new student.
My name is Conan Edogawa.
Hello everyone!
(Thinking) "Gee, I'll have to repeat all of elementary school."
I know.
You're the murderer!
If my dear Shinishi were here, he'd solve the case in no time.
Who knows where he was supposed to go...
...obsessed detective.
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Mouri, you were right, I had underestimated you.
You are a great detective.
I'm a mess, I don't have Yoko's strength.
We invite you to watch the next episode:
"Beware of idols".
We are waiting for you!
