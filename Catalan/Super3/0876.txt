"The mechanical witness"
Sorry, it's a self-defense robot designed for women.
He-he-he!
He-he-he-he!
Here we have the laboratory.
Oh!
Hm?
Oh!
Oysters.
A mouse.
Ah!
Huh? (Laughs)
It's very fast.
AAAH!
Oh!
No, please don't!
Eh?
It's the... it's my robot, poor thing.
Eh?
Uh... I'm sorry about that.
But, uh... why... why is this useful?
Yeah, that's more like it.
No one quite understands what it's for.
I wouldn't be surprised if he designed it to scare girls away.
-Oh! -Oh!
-Hm.
What's the matter with you?
Why do we have to use the cutting-edge technology we have at our disposal
to manufacture disgusting products?
It's a bad joke.
You're right.
Excuse me, Mr. Kusumi.
I'd like to talk to you about a very urgent matter.
Yes, right away.
- (mobile)
-Excuse me, Mr. Mouri.
- (Kogoro) No, and now!
-I'll be right back, if you don't mind.
- (Kogoro) I'll be right back.
-Tell me?
(Ah.
(Kogoro) This afternoon?
Tonight doesn't suit me.
Can't it be another day?
Ah.
Impossible?
You've laughed at me enough.
Now you'll see.
(sinister laughter)
(sinister laughter) Impossible.
Please, please.
I warned you.
I told you to stop the Internet auctions.
I can't advance you any more of your salary.
(Door, open)
Who does he think he is?
I just hope... the company goes under.
Forgive me for asking you all to come.
If Mr. Mouri had come alone, he would have alerted the employees.
Well, what do you think?
Do not suffer.
After all you've seen, who do you think is the most suspicious?
I think... it's Mr. Tanizaki.
Takeshi Tanizaki, huh?
Before coming here, I went to keep an eye on Myōjin Technics,
which is where he suspects they're leaking information.
And I saw this.
Oh!
Oh!
(thump)
Unbelievable!
I'm going to commiserate because I'd lost the job
and now he thanks me like this?
He should denounce right now.
Even if he denounces, he will deny everything.
Eh?
So, what do I do?
The best way is to catch him red-handed.
He stole some new original parts from you, right?
That's right.
But I don't understand how he got them off the premises.
There's a metal detector at the entrance
and, being precision devices,
if he threw them out the window, he'd smash them.
-There are no windows on the second floor.
-From the second floor, too?
Direct light is very harmful to precision devices.
Mr. Mouri, what are you disguised as now?
As the saying goes, if you want to hide a leaf, hide it in the forest.
From here I can keep a good lookout both at the entrance and the stairs.
Yeah, but why tonight?
Because the other company is having an important presentation tomorrow.
And the robberies usually take place the night before.
-Oh!
- (object: falls, metallic sound)
What was that?
What was that?
Hm.
Something must have fallen.
Well, we're pulling for home.
Wow. (Chuckles)
All right. (Sniffs)
Don't you smell gas?
What is it now?
(gasps) Oh!
(Alarm)
(Kogoro) There's a leak!

(Alarm: continued)
-Aah...
- (Kogoro) It won't open?
No, because it's locked from the inside.
-Do you have a spare key?
-Mr. Mouri...
A key?
The rooms are locked from the inside.
We'll have to call a locksmith.
No, I don't think he'll make it in time.
-Run, help him open the door. -Run, help him open the door.
-What are you doing here? -What are you doing here?
What's going on? What's going on?
Oh.
(knocking) Sure.
(knocking)
(coughs)
Kazuomi, turn off the gas tap.
Fumika, call an ambulance.
-Right away.
(Coughs) -Yes.
The pipe is broken.
I'll turn off the main tap.
How is it?
You can call the police now.
Understood.
Oh... (Radio: woman)
(Radio: female) "Central unit 324. Give me your position, please."
We've determined that the victim, Mr. Tanizaki,
has died of strangulation.
What do you say, now?
It wasn't gas inhalation?
No.
He has strangulation marks on his neck.
He must have put up a fight.
He also has rope marks on the palms of his hands.
Also, the bushes below the window,
we have found a rope of about 30 meters, approximately.
We are awaiting the results from Forensics,
but it could be the murder weapon.
And, in addition, she had a gap in the back of her head that was bleeding.
Does all this mean that she was murdered, then?
Yes, it does;
I heard something falling...
shortly before the alarm was triggered by the gas leak.
-Yes.
-You heard it too, didn't you?
Yes, I heard it too.
The footprint marks on the floor and the broken pipe
indicate that there's been a very violent struggle.
Hm.
We found this among Mr. Tanizaki's things.
Does anyone know what it is?
Have you seen it?
Eh?
It's one of the parts for a new robot
we're developing right now.
Did he want to steal it?
No, I'd say he was helping someone else... steal it.
What's that supposed to mean?
That door was locked from the inside
so no one could enter the room.
And he let someone from outside the company in.
But then something happened
and Mr. Tanizaki ended up murdered.
He's a traitor, he got what he deserved.
And who would that outsider be?
Ah.
A man by the name of Makita.
He's a worker at Myōjin Technics.
Yes.
Check it out.
In the meantime, could you explain to me where you were at the time of the crime?
I was in the management office, on the third floor.
I was in the research lab, on this floor.
I went home when it was time to fold,
but I realized I had left something behind and I had to go back.
And you didn't see... any suspicious person coming here?
No, no one, really.
Oh.
You mean the killer came in from the outside?
The door was locked from the inside.
The door was, but the window was open.
I think we'll...
we'll solve the case faster than we thought.
I had no doubt.
Eh?
(Thinks, sees Shinichi) "I hope you're right."
"The crime scene..."
"The president's office."
Oh.
What's this?
This stain isn't normal.
This is...
Come to think of it, when we came in...
Oh...
It's the... it's my poor robot, poor thing.
You've laughed at me enough.
Now you'll see.
"(sinister laughter)"
Oh!
Oh!
"Robot mouse."
Yeah, right.
Now I get it all.
Huh?
"Prototype spare parts."
Hm.
That what?
That Makita is innocent?
According to Inspector Takagi's report,
Mr. Makita works in General Affairs
and has nothing to do with technology development.
But General Affairs may also be interested in the information.
But he also has a solid alibi.
What?
This alibi thing, I don't know if...
Aaah... aaah...
Kogoro... Kogoro, are we there yet?
(Kogoro voice) Inspector, I've solved the mystery.
Eh?
Please have everyone come.
But... Yes, all right.
Mr. Mouri... Is it true that you've already identified the culprit?
Yes.
When you say guilty, you mean the murderer, right?
Because a while ago you said
that the person who leaked the information was Takeshi.
-What?
-But no..., in fact, it wasn't like that.

Rather the opposite:
he was trying to catch the person who leaked the information.
But what does it say, now!
Mr. Tanizaki's mouse robot
was actually a security device.
-What?
-It can't be!
What's it doing?
What does it do?
This device is very well designed, I recognize it.
It is able to identify the culprit with the sensor.
This is impossible.
No artificial intelligence can recognize a criminal.
You're right.
This is no time for this kind of jokes.
Well, this one can.
(Pip-pip)
(Pip-pip)
There's Takeshi's killer.
Mr. Kazuomi Isshiki.
Don't talk nonsense!
It's obvious that you led her, the mouse.
No, and now!
You're wrong.
The robot's sensor has reacted to something
that's stuck to its shoe.
What is it?
What's that on my shoe?
(Kogoro voice) An ink stain... on the toe.
I'm here!
But what's wrong?
Ouch...
Mr. Isshiki, haven't you noticed?
The exact same thing happened to you
when you sneaked into this room.
I... I got stained when I was at home.
At home you have the special ink that makes this sensor react?
Eh?
Mr. Tanizaki designed this robot
so that the spy couldn't carry out his plans.
All right, okay, I confess.
I'm the person who stole the information.
The person I passed the information to is Mr. Makita,
from the General Affairs department of Myōjin Technics?
No, it's not him.
He was giving it to a guy named Hiraguchi from Research.
I was only doing it for money;
He was doing it to get a promotion.
So why did you contact them at Takeshi, then?
According to Mr. Makita,
he asked him when the next presentation would be.
He wanted to know because he intended to catch the spy who was leaking the information.
who was leaking the information.
That's why I asked him... to make it another day.
But he said no.
Damn!
But I didn't kill him.
We had a fight and he hit his head, but I didn't strangle him.
Then who did?
You must believe me!
It must have been one of these two.
-I had gone out.
-Eh?
If the killer was someone from outside who had come in,
I would have seen her leave.
-She hated it, at Takeshi.
-That doesn't make us murderers.
Just because I didn't like him doesn't mean he wanted to kill.
-Huh?
Then it was you.
Takeshi was thought to be the person who leaked the information,
he felt betrayed and that's why he killed her.
I would never do that!
Go ahead, Mr. Mouri, you tell us, who is the murderer.
Very well, all right.
I'll tell you... in chronological order.
Mr. Isshiki, before leaving, has hidden the piece in this room.
And he has chosen this one because it is not usually used by anyone.
In order to enter from outside, he left the window open.
And then he has prepared the rope that would hang outside.
But where has he tied it, this rope?
Outside the window there is no point where it can be attached.
He tied it to the inside of the room.
On the gas pipe.
"Yes, he has tied it to the gas pipe,
"He's run the two ends of the string
through the vent and dropped them outside."
That's why he needed such a long rope, 30 meters.
When he'd finished the job, he could retrieve the rope
the rope with all the ease in the world by stretching it from the outside.
That way he would leave no trace
and he could steal more pieces on other occasions.
"Once...the preparations are finished,
Mr. Isshiki left the building."
"Later he returned.
"And, after entering the compound unseen,
he hid under the window and waited."
"When the time came,
he climbed up the wall and entered through the window."
"Mr. Isshiki didn't see the robot.
"Because something surprised him:
Mr. Tanizaki's presence in the room."
Mr. Tanizaki, who knew that the thief to steal...
because tomorrow was the presentation,
found the hidden piece and hid to wait for the thief.
And he locked the room from the inside
so that the thief could not escape.
Then, Mr. Tanizaki and Mr. Isshiki had a fight.

"Mr. Tanizaki, who has received a blow to the back of the head,
has started to bleed."
"Mr. Isshiki became nervous and ran away."
"At that moment, the gas pipe,
which had withstood the weight of the rope so many times, finally gave way."
"Mr. Isshiki was on the verge of falling,
but, miraculously, he managed to get down without injury."
"Once on the ground, he stretched the rope to make it fall....
and hid it in the bushes."
But then he decided to return
because he was worried about Mr. Tanizaki after the blow to his head.
That's right, but at the time he had no idea...
that there was a murderer in the company.
What strategy did he use?
That he's dead?
What do you want?
-What do you want?
-Mr. Isshiki...
Did it ever occur to you to think about what prevented him from falling apart?
What... What do you mean?
If in the end it didn't fall
it's because Mr. Tanizaki caught the rope.
-Oh!
- (rumor: metallic sound)
"But he couldn't hold the weight...
"And finally the rope got stuck to his neck...
and he was suspended in the air."
L-lie!
I'm sorry, but it's the truth.
The water heater,
the yolk found on Mr. Tanizaki's back...
and the blood on the ventilation grille prove it.
Oh!
Mr. Isshiki,
Mr. Tanizaki has lost his life
because of the series of crimes you have committed.
(Crying)
Forgive me...., please.
Forgive me.
(Continues crying)

Eh?
So... what is it, in my head?
What is it?
Touchy!
Aaaaah!
Who are you saying that to, that toad thing?
I'm the famous detective Kogoro Mouri, me!
Aaaah!
"Then why didn't you notice the difference?"
(Ayumi) That's right, you've got quite a bump.
I'll do whatever it takes to find that man and turn her in to the police.
We'll help you.
Ouch... Oh... that's too bad!
Damn, I don't even know where I am.
I don't know how I got here.
Geez, kid.
You don't even know your name?
No, I don't.
Not a clue.
Oh, but he just happens to be the thief they're looking for!
