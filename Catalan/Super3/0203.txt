The water that flows has no form.
The wind that blows is unseen.
Today's setting is a mountain hotel.
A shabby client attracts an unwanted case.
The truth always comes out in the end.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and is Detective Conan!

Excuse me, we are looking for the Arimori Hotel.
Ah, then cross the bridge and go straight ahead.
Thank you very much!
Father, where did you get it, this hotel lost in the mountains?
I know it because it is famous for the beer they make in the area!
(He thinks) "It's always the alcohol that motivates him."
Ah.
It's there!
Here we are at last!
THE DARK WINGS of Icarus, (PART ONE)
(Door bell: tinkling)
-Good morning tinguin.-I'm in Mouri, I have a reservation.
Kogoro Mouri, right?
We were expecting you, Mr. Mouri.
My name is Arimori, I am the hotel manager.
-I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Arimori, if you'd be so kind as to fill in the form.
(At the same time) Good morning!
Gee, if it isn't you...
...the girls from the case of the cursed mask!
(At the same time) We thank you very much for what you did for us.
Y... what are you doing here?
A mutual acquaintance introduced us a few months ago.
They really wanted to see you, Mr. Mouri.
(Think) "I hope there are no curses, around here."
(Door bell: tinkling)
My name is Shiromoto, I have a reservation.
Welcome, sir.
Hidehiko Shiromoto.
A reservation for two people.
Is your wife coming with you?
Yes.
She's gone to park the car.
I don't think she'll be long.
I don't know what he's been thinking, this producer!
He can't ask me to give up a role!
What?!
You're coming here?!
You don't need to come, sit me down?!
It's actress Chizuru Bizen!
Y-yes.
Hey, Hidehiko, what's the meaning of this?
You promised me a nice hotel, and not a filthy, vulgar shack!
It's a very nice and quiet place.
I can't stand the thought of having to spend five whole days with you!
Listen to me, boy!
I want a separate room.
Come on, snap out of it.
But, madam, the reservation...
Let her keep the suite we have reserved
and find something else for me.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
You!
Send my luggage up!
Oh.
No elevator, they don't have one!
Nothing like the way it looks on TV or in the movies.
Minaho, Honami!
Accompany the gentleman!
-Right away!
-Right away!
Go ahead, it's this way!
Aaaa...
Mr. Mouri, if you like, you can sit for a while in the restaurant.
In the restaurant?
We could make you a special herbal tea from the region.
Good idea!
Come on, father, let's have one of these teas.
Eh... As you wish.
Although I, more than a tea... (laughs)
Oh!
What a nice restaurant!
Welcome, gentlemen!
-May I introduce our boss. -Oh!
My name is Shinobu Shimon.
Welcome to the restaurant, gentlemen!
The kitchen is unique, and she designed everything herself,
even the layout of the dining room.
I hope our guests will enjoy meals
in a calm and relaxed atmosphere
where we serve dishes made with local ingredients.
I am looking forward to dinner time.
I hear they have a very good beer.
Yes, sir, and so true.
Shinobu, serve them a special tea, our guests, please.
Yes.
Uh... I'd prefer beer.
Wait for the night!
How wonderful!
He-he-he-he.
Father, maybe you can stop drinking and eat a little, man!
The soup is very good.
It goes in very well.
(Chizuru) It's the most disgusting soup I've ever tasted!
-And you call yourself a chef, girl!?
-Stop it, Chizuru.
You shut up, flights!
If you'd be so kind as to tell me what you don't like,
I will do my best to remedy it.
Oh, look at the girl... I tell you she's disgusting, you feel me?

You could apologize, at the very least.
I'm very sorry.
We'll bring you another plate right away.
Shinobu, please!
Arimori!
All right, we understand.
That's the way I like it, that you listen!
Mm?
Oh.
Hello, good evening.
My husband tells me that you are the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
It's an honor to meet you.
The... the... the... the honor is mine, ma'am!
I love your great ability to solve mysteries.
Oooooh... Aiiiiiiiiiiii...
I am her husband.
How do you do?
I had to supervise the works of an amusement park
and we took advantage of it to take a few days of vacation.
So you are a businessman!
So, the rumors about the park were true?
In these mountains there are butterflies that are unique in the world
and alpine plants that are hard to find.
What will you do to preserve the flora and fauna?
Well, first of all,
we were thinking of having a meeting with the local representatives.
Everywhere there are people obsessed with preserving nature!
Give them money and they'll shut up!
What a thing to say, Chizuru.
Oh, what did I say wrong?
If you want a divorce, you can have it anytime, chato.
Mind you, I doubt you can afford my allowance.
Chizuru!
Chizuru, please forget about the paper, I won't ask for more!
Again with this story?!
Tell me why, huh?!?
It's just... I can't tell you, this... Not here.
Go ahead, let it go!
The sponsor doesn't want you.
He wants someone younger...
I mean... he wants Reika, who debuted last year,
because now everybody's talking about her...
If not, they don't want to pay...
We represent her too, so....
If the film doesn't go ahead we have a real problem....
You have to understand, Chizuru...
What's the matter?
What's with the looks, huh?
You want me to leave, don't you!?
That's fine!
I'll just kill myself!
Chizuru!
He's indomitable.
Don't worry, he'll get over it.
Is that you, Mr. Arimori?
Look, it's here, in the photograph.
You're the one in the middle, and the one on the right is Shinobu, right?
Yes, that's right.
We've been wanting to hang glide together for years.
Hang gliding?
Several years ago,
we used to jump from the highest mountains in the mountains.
Now we can't do it, because they build everywhere.
I'm sorry, really.
I used to hang glide, too, when I was young.
Who is he, this handsome man on the left of the photo?
Ah.
That's my little brother.
Years ago, we used to fly together.
We haven't wanted to for about 5 years...
The hang gliders are stored in a warehouse on the roof.
Aaaaah.
Let's go to the mountain tomorrow?
You'll be great for drawing exercises.
Hmm! (snoring)
(snoring)
(Thinks) "Ayyy! With this snoring it's impossible to fall asleep!"
"I'm going to get some juice out of the machine."
No... I can't reach!
(Chizuru) I've felt enough!
May I know what I've done?!
Do not wrap me, to me!
(Thinking) "Where did it come from... that rage?"
Mr. Shiromoto... How are you, your wife?
I'm sorry about last night.
She's like that.
I'll thank you not to hold it against her.
She'll be here soon.
Mm?
Uh... Chizuru... Good morning to you.
Look, I... Listen, um...
Hey, ma'am, last night...
How dare you call him "ma'am"!?
Don't listen to him, he's rude.
Hell, no...
-Aaaaah!
And now I what faaaig!? - Now you will not convince her.
What if we go fishing while she gets over her anger?
I don't start working until tomorrow,
and today I was planning to spend the whole day fishing.
I can lend you one of my rods.
Look, you know what? I'll take you up on that offer.
Father, we're going to the mountain!
To the highest one!
You two go, eh?
I have an important mission, here!
A mission?
Yes.
First, I have to see Yoko Okino's new video clip.
Then, I'll watch the concert that has been waiting for me for days!
And finally, I'll get hooked on the TV series she's starring in!
Did you come here to the hotel to do this?
Yes, because the revival is only in this area.
Ah!
Now I understand why we are here...!

If you don't mind, I can be your guide.
You don't know how much I would appreciate it!
Decided, then.
Why don't you all go?
The Shinobu too.
-I'll take care of the hotel. Huh?
But I have to have the meals ready by the time you get back.
If everyone leaves,
the food can be four sandwiches or a lunch box!
We're going hiking, too.
The lunch box is fine.
But then, in the evening, you have to have dinner.
What if we have a barbecue in the garden?
Then you won't have so much work in the kitchen.
My wife was very unpleasant with you;
go out and distract yourself for a while, it will do you good to get some air.
(At the same time) We will prepare the barbecue while you are out.
Besides, we don't have any customers today.
Accept everyone's kindness and come, woman.
Yes, woman, cheer up!
All right, thank you all very much.
Up to the lake there is a room.
-Do you know the way? -Yes, thank you.
They say there's better fishing at sunset.
All right, until then we'll take it easy.
Have a good time!
I'll follow you with the van
when I've checked that everything is closed.
Id passant.-But don't be long, eh?
No!
The Chizuru would feel better if she would come with us
instead of locking herself in the room.
Mission number one!
Watch Yoko's latest music video
and learn the new song by heart!
-Yoookooko!
Yoooko! -Mr. Mouri.
Ah.
Y... yes!
Here are the hotel keys.
I entrust them to you.
Ah... No problem!
Ah.
The father is hopeless, listen! Even if he doesn't come, the Arimori?
Eh?
Look, he's already here.
How breezy it is up here!
Oh!
It's so cool!
It's beautiful!
Wow!
See if it's blue, the mountain sky, eh?
It's so beautiful!
If I had wings, right now I'd soar into the sun.
Yes.
Just like Icarus did, right?
Eh?
Icarus?
It's from Greek mythology.
Icarus, the winged one.
One day, he forgot his father's warnings,
who always told him not to fly too high,
and soared and soared, thinking he could reach the sun.
But lo and behold, to fly too close to the sun,
the wings could not stand the heat.
And Icarus, his wings burned, fell back to earth.
A very sad story.
Oh!
(River) How beautiful!
It's the Miyama white butterfly;
it's only found in these mountains.
Oh. (laughs)
Oysters!
But it's delicate, and without clear water... it dies.
- (Kogoro) Yoko!
Yoko!
Yokoooooo! - (pop music)
How I like you, Yoko!
IEEE!
(Bell: jingle)
How absent-minded of me, I left my food.
Although it's in the room, my wife?
(At the same time) Yes, she hasn't come down at any time, sir.
I'll go and see what she's doing.

I hope... she's cheered up a bit...

(At the same time) What?
How are you, your mistress?
She's... I guess she must be asleep..,
because I've been knocking for a long time and you haven't opened the door.
Poor us, with women so cheeky, aren't we?
You can say that again.
Well, I'm going back to fishing, me.
I'll see you later.
I'll see you later.
He's got it!
Go!
Ah!
Out you go!
Winning point for Conan!
-How about we start eating?
-Òndia, yes!
Look what time it is!
I'll get the bags.
Hey, this one is fat!
Ha-ha-ha!
Not a bad catch, eh?
Not bad at all!
Ah!
No, Yoko!
Don't go that way.
Watch out!
What a set!
It's beautiful.
The sunset from up here is always a marvel.
That building at the foot of the mountain is the Arimori Hotel.
Wow... It's really far!
What do you think, if we go back?
Yes.
(Engine: won't start)
What's the matter?
It seems to be hard to start.
Go on without me.
(engine starts) All right.
Here we are!
You should have come, father!
You don't know what you've missed, what a setting!
We have also seen a butterfly!
There are very few left and they don't go near people.
But this one has stopped on the shoulder...
Okay, you guys!
-Hello everybody (bell: tinkling).
Here we bring the teak!
Good evening.
How is she, my wife?
I don't know, she hasn't been down all day.
(thinks) "All day?"
Well, that's a pity.

Mr. Mouri, can I have the master key, please?
Of course, here you go.
Thank you.
-Do you have, today's fishing... (phone)
Hotel Arimori, tell me?
Ah, hello, say.
(Arimori) "There's no way to start. Will you come and pick me up?"
(Arimori) All right.
I'm coming.
(Knock-knock)
I hope I won't disturb you.
May I come with you?
You bet.
Au, get in.
Mr. Mouri!
There's something wrong with the Chizuru!
I opened it with the key, but there's a knocker on.
And no matter how much I call her, she doesn't answer me.
What do you say?
Mrs. Chizuru!
Mrs. Chizuru!
-Smoke the door down! -Yes...
Now!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Eh?!
-Chizuru! -Chizuru!
Is... Mr. Mouri, are you...?
I'm sorry to tell you,
but your wife is long dead, Shiromoto.
Oh!
Oooooh!
Oh, nooooo!
(Cries)
God meeeu...!
(Thinks) "Here's the knocker."
"Scratches!?"
"You mean...!?"
"I knew it!"
"The Chizuru..."
"The Chizuru didn't commit suicide."
"She was murdered!"
It's just that there are scratches here on the door.
Look!
Scratches?
Yes, around the hole in the metal plate!
(thinks) "The air conditioning!"
"When we found the body, it wasn't running!"
You mean it wasn't a suicide?
That she was murdered? -That the criminal is one of us?
(Kogoro voice) Yes.
And the murderer... without a doubt, is you!
And the next Conan: "The Dark Wings of Icarus (part two)".
