(Blows)
Stop!
Quiet!
No, don't come closer.
(thudding) Ow!
You won't get away!
Oh.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

"The weak point of the great detective."
(Kogoro) What?
That the gun is missing?
What-what do you mean, inspector?
That you haven't found it?
I mean that at the time we apprehended the robber
he was carrying neither a firearm nor a knife.
But... but... But how can that be?
Well, what we can confirm is that he robbed the bank...
and that he fired the gun he was carrying.
And you, Mr. Mouri,
you've also confirmed that when you tracked down the robber,
he shot him and then ran away.
And this makes us think that...
...that he either got rid of the gun or hid it.
Strange, isn't it?
He couldn't have done anything else.
And I imagine that in the place where they have arrested him,
he didn't find it either, the gun, did he?
-And you, Ran?
-What are you doing here, Conan? -What are you doing here, Conan?
Father, I came to grieve for you.
Nothing happened to me.
It's just a scratch.
Aaah!
Uh... Uh... Oooh...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Takagi) "He has always been afraid of heights,
but this experience she just had"
(Takagi) "She's always been afraid of heights, but this experience she's just had" is seen to have sent her into a kind of shock.
The doctor says she will recover,
that she should try to stay away for a few days without going out too much
and, above all, that she should rest.
What a drag.
It's been two days now and I haven't improved at all.
Soc Kogoro Mouri,
and a great detective like me can't afford it, that's what.
What?
What?
What are you doing with that?
The doctor also told you not to drink any alcohol.
Of course I remember.
Or don't you remember anymore?
Let me be.
I've had to pay a very high bail.
Soc innocent.
What has committed fraud is the court of justice.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Just kidding.
Mr. Taiz Sakaki has just been released from jail on bail.
He will soon have to face trial
on the fraud charges against him in the case....
- (TV: features)
-Huh?
It's the...
He... he shot him.
(Journalist) Mr. Sakaki has just been shot.
How scary!
How strong!
I've seen this gun before...
Hello?
Oh, hello, Kogoro.
I'm sorry, but I have to go to the scene now.
What is it?
That the gun you used is the same one that disappeared?
The bullets match.
Yes.
It's been confirmed to me.
It's the same gun.
Yes.
He's in critical condition and should be in the hospital for a month,
but since they were small bullets, .22 caliber,
they say he's out of danger now.
Are you sure he's all right now, Mr. Mouri?
Because the Ran is very worried.
Yes, man.
As long as I don't climb any part that is too high, nothing will happen to me.
Besides, this case is mine,
and I'm going to find her, this gun, at all costs.
Sounds perfect to me.
Well, for starters...
No, don't come any closer.
"The robber, who was carrying the gun...
...and the person who was shot,
do we know if they were related?
What nonsense!
Why should they have?
Most likely the gun ended up in the hands of the person who shot him...
into the hands of whoever shot him by chance.
And I think I know when.
And... you don't remember if you saw...
anyone around on the street while you were chasing the robber?
Why do you think I decided to come to the scene, huh?
To see if I remember anything.
Ep.
Come to think of it...
Stop!
-Ah!
-Excuse me.
You won't escape!
But I don't think she took it, the gun.

Do you remember the look on her face?
Or how she was dressed, what she was wearing?
No...
I think... she was carrying a cloth bag...
And a bag from a supermarket.
Eh?
Here's one.
Do you know who it is?
Are you for real?
Of course I do.
He comes here often, to shop here.
-I don't know that anymore.
-What's his name?
But... I see he always comes out of that building over there, the last one.
What's that?
Look, Mr. Mouri.
Look at this license plate.
It's... the bike from before.
And this must be the corresponding floor.
403.
We've got it.
Let's go get it.
Shouldn't you warn Inspector Megure first?
That's right.
By the way, what are you doing here, boy?
This is dangerous, go home.
Go home.
Inspector, it's Kogoro.
I'm here because I'm worried about...
You just realized now, you were?
Hey.
I told you to leave.
It's dangerous.
It doesn't matter now.
Hurry up.
Let's see, where's 403?
Hey, you!
Don't run away!
Aaaaaaaah...!
Aaaaaaaah...
Hey, you!
What are you doing?
"This smell..."
A-this is...
(Chiba)... (Chiba)... from the attacker.
"It was her!"
(Takagi) "We already know who the attacker is."
In fact, it's a girl, her name is Izumi Onda,
she's 25 years old and works in a printing shop near where I live.
From what I see, she practices Olympic shooting and has a few medals.
(Chiba) "The motive that prompted her to take action.
"Is that his father invested a very large amount of money..."
...through Mr. Sakaki's investment group,
he lost them and the business he owned went bankrupt."
"Six months ago he committed suicide."
"As a result of this, his mother became ill and also died."
"In addition..."
What?
What are you saying?
That he has discovered that he has other goals?
Ah!
AAAA!
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Yes.
Can you get up or what?
Ya... are we there yet?
(Kogoro) Will you let me go?
Let me go!
(Let me go!
Let me go!
You're Mr. Shibazaki and Miss Kadota, right?
They're Mr. Sakaki's trusted people.
They'll probably soon be arrested
on the same fraud charges as your head.
-What are they doing here?
-Who-who the fuck are you?
I'm sorry for just dropping in on you like this, but...
Do you know if anyone has called asking about the engagements you had scheduled for today
they had scheduled for today and the times they'd be doing?
Yes, a while ago they asked my secretary.
I imagined it was some media outlet.
And do you know if it was a man or a woman?
It seems to me that she said that, from the voice, it was a young girl.
That they are offering to protect us
because someone wants to attack us?
There is no need.
We have it all planned, as you can see.
- (Kogoro and Conan: groan)
- (thump)
-Conan.
Are you all right?
-Mr. Mouri?
But what happened?
Ti!
Come here!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....
Are we there?
Are you all right or what?
Gee, kid.
And you, I hope he found the aggressor.
Not yet.
We're looking all over for her.
You mean you shouldn't get some rest?
We'll stay here and stand guard.
If the girl shows up, this time she won't get away from us.
"There's something I'm not sure about."
"But I'm not sure what it is."
(Kogoro) We've been here for more than two hours.
What should that girl do?
Come on, come at once.
I still don't understand
why you didn't decide to attack this pair as your first target.
What?
The assailant actually had the gun two days before...
Mr. Taiz Sakaki was released from jail on bail.
And the police, at the time, didn't even know it,
that he intended to attack these two people, right?
No, but surely they wanted to get rid of the big fish first.
But it was also not known at the time that he would get out of jail on bail.
It's all very strange.
Man, theoretically he hasn't gotten rid of the big fish yet.
He fired a very accurate shot first.
(Shot)
And, on the other hand, he missed his target.
Maybe he missed because he was on a motorcycle.
"A champion of Olympic shooting like her
she surely didn't expect it, she missed that shot."

No, but it has caused a very serious injury,
even if it wasn't lethal.
I don't know if he expected it or not,
but I think there are still more things that will happen that we can't imagine.
Ah... I see what you mean!
I'm convinced that the Izumi Onda
has asked for the schedule of those two to throw us off the scent.
Yes, I also think that's why she did it.
Now she wants to distract us
and, in the meantime, to be able to finish her main objective.
Now Mr. Sakaki's life is in danger.
Where... where is Mr. Sakaki?
That is why it is so important that we buy now.
Don't suffer, we will soon be selling again.
(Footsteps: approaching)
It's you!
Sure, it's you, the one with the motorcycle.
Sorry, I have to get rid of you.
If I don't, nothing will start and nothing will end.
Damn.
It never arrives, this elevator?
What's that?
Mr. Mouri...
You're joking, right?
What floor are we on, let's see?
Aaaaah...
AAAAAAAAA...!
Mr. Mouri, what's wrong with you?
Nothing, nothing, nothing's wrong with me.
Me going up, eh?
Wait, kid, wait.
Can't you see it could be dangerous?
Damn.
Come on, don't look.
What I have to do is not to look.
(knocks)
Mr. Mouri, you can't go out through this door.
What do you say now?
Ah... You could have hurried more to go up.
This is...
(Shot)
Naive.
You think I'm such an idiot to come here alone?
It'll be considered self-defense.
You'll rot in hell!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Kogoro) I'll prove it.
I'm able to go up even if I'm scared.
Because... I am...
the great... Kogoro Mouri.
Mr. Mouri!
Ah!
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
"All right, Kogoro!"
Don't do it.
Don't do it!
Get out of the way.
If you don't, I'll kill you.
(Police: sirens)
Let it go, Izumi.
Turn the page.
It's nonsense.
Don't do it!
If I can't avenge their deaths, I'd rather die,
because my life has no meaning anymore.
I've finally understood.
Now I know why you didn't go to kill the other two.
You weren't sure.
"Oysters..."
(Kogoro voice) Inspector, I have a very big favor to ask of you.
Hurry up and come.
I know that, when you were arrested,
some time ago... you had decided that you would take revenge...
for the death of your parents.
Maybe it's just a detective's hunch,
but the other day, when you found the gun..,
you had just come out of the supermarket.
This means you were getting back to normal life,
that you were starting to get over the rage and pain you were feeling.
Am I right or wrong?
You weren't so sure either,
if you wanted to take revenge on Sakaki for what he had done to you.
And then, by chance,
you found the gun that fell on that robber.
But even so, it was not clear to you.
That's why you didn't go to attack the other two.
But when you saw that Sakaki had been released from jail on bail, you felt a thirst for revenge again,
the thirst for revenge returned.
Anyway, what would be the point, now, of you committing suicide?
You say your life has no meaning?
You are wrong.
Because I had another feeling:
you and this man had something.
(Voice Kogoro) Go back to him to go.
Search well, you'll find it.
I've got it!
(Mobile: message tone)
(Kogoro) A message from Takagi?
But....
He's a great detective and... he's absolutely right.
My parents trusted him completely
because he was their daughter's boyfriend.
And now the father... and the mother... are dead.
I can never, ever, ever forgive myself!
But think that if you had not found this gun,
if I had been able to take it from that robber,
which was my duty, all this would not have happened.
Therefore, it is my fault.
If you have to kill someone, you have to kill me.
"Kogoro..."
Thank you for everything,
but now... it's too late.
Don't do it!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Kogoro!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ah... You've arrived in time.
"The Izumi was lucky that Eri Kisaki agreed to represent her."
"On the other hand, they turned up...
"More evidence of the investment group's fraud
investigation was reopened."

Maybe I'm still a little short.
Or maybe he's just got a little too much beer.

Yes, on the top floor.
It's number 901, isn't it?
Oh! (Laughs)
You snuck back into my car, kiddo?

I killed her.
(man) Ah!
It's Mr. Takarada, isn't it?
Yeah, you asked for it.
