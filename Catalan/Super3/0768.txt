"The Ai, held against her will."
Geez, where will the Ai be?
It took so long, didn't it?
He should have been back from shopping long ago.
Maybe something happened to him?
Well, if something happened to her,
it must have been on the way back.
-Don't say that.
-What if she was hit by a car?
The Ai always keeps a watchful eye and is very careful.
(Alarm)
What if she crossed the tracks without looking?
(Alarm) - Eh?
-To talk nonsense!
What?
XXT!
(Cat: meows)
(meows)
-That tiny!
-What is it?
A scarf?
But it's not the one from Ay, is it, Conan?
Eh?
No.
It's from that kitty who's always trailing him.
Mèèèèu...
Mèèèèu...
You're a beautiful kitten.
(PA: man) "Attention, attention."
"Watch the gap between the platform and the door of the carriages..."
-It's a terrarium.
-What, kitty?
What are you looking at?
How cute!
And what's in it?
Meee...
-Wow.
It's a star tortoise.
- (Ai) Look, it's coming out.
What a beautiful shell!
It's strange, because I thought it was forbidden to import them.
(Woman) Don't worry about that.
I bought it in an authorized store.
(Woman) Look!
What a surprise!
I see that you like you very much, to Chiro, eh?
Mèèèèu!
Hehehe...
Hey.
Where did you go, kitty?
I've already found him.
Chiro, where are you hiding?
Come here.
Mèèèèu!
-Thank goodness we found her safe and sound.
-Pobret, it has fallen in here. -I'm sorry.
(doorbell)
I'd say there's no one here.
We came all the way here to bring her the cat and it turns out she's not here.
And I would say that the Ai is not here either.
Besides, look.
The curtains are closed.
Mèèèèu...
What's the matter with you?
The way she's meowing, she must be hungry.
(Agasa) And it represents that all we have is a kitten?
It is very strange.
We don't know where it could be.
And if they have kidnapped it and they call and say:
"We have the girl, if you want to see her again, bring the dough?"
(Mitsuhiko) This would mean
that the kidnappers think that in this house I'm rich.
(Mitsuhiko) Yes, okay.
(Mitsuhiko) Understood.
Thank you, Agent Chiba.
Good-bye.
The police have no record of any accidents this morning.
Hm... If something has happened to him,
I'm sure he'll try to contact us.
Hey, Ay, we're all very worried about you.
Say something.
Hmm...
(thinks) "But what... what happened?"
"Where am I?"
"Eh? So late, is it?"
"This means I've slept for 5 hours."
"Eh?"
"The star tortoise."
"I'm at Mrs. Higaki's house."
"That's right. I was coming back from..."
(Chiro) Mèèèèèu... mèèèèu...
Mèèèèu... mèèèèu...
Mèèèèu... mèèèèu...
Eh?
Chiro!
Your scarf has stuck to you, hasn't it?
Wait a minute, I'll help you.
Come here.
Be still.
Eh?
Meeus... Meeûs...
Hmmm!!!
"Mrs. Higaki..."
(PA: male) "Attention, attention."
"This train will make a 5 minute stop until the live one passes."
"Mr. Higaki? Murder?"
"I have to keep calm."

"I have to free myself by any means."
(Mitsuhiko) Thank you very much for the food.
Ah... It's so good!
I'm sick of it.
Mèèèèu...
Listen, why don't we go back to the Higaki's to take the kitten?
-But maybe they're back now, aren't they?
-But there was no one there before!
That's true.
It's better than waiting here.
Yes.
Let's go, then, come on.
Mèèèèu...
Hmm... hmmm... hmm...
That's it.
Help, help!
There's a thief!
(ringing) Hmm!
(doorbell)
- (doorbell)
(doorbell) -Come on...
(doorbell rings) Eh?
(doorbell rings) What's wrong?
Nobody here?
No.
I've called 6 times, but boy, there's no way they'll open up.
And now I don't know what to do.
Because Mrs. Higaki told me to come by at that time.
I can't wait any longer.
You'll tell her I'll come back later, won't you, Chiro?
Goodbye, Chiro!
He tells the cat to give him the order and leaves.
(Mobile)
It's agent Chiba.
They've just delivered something to the lost and found office
at the airport avenue police station.
A Junior Detective League pin?
That's right.
Looks like it was found by a trucker while changing a flat tire
and then took her to the station.
"We're all very worried."
Eh?
"Say something."
(Genta) Come on, it's far!
We've been driving for an hour.
(Mitsuhiko) Not exactly.
To be exact, 50 minutes.
It's the police station at the intersection
(Mitsuhiko)
We'll be there in two or three minutes.
And you think the Ai has come all this way alone?
I find... it's unlikely, it's too far.
Have you seen it?
It looks like they're building a whole new neighborhood next to the airport.
I guess it's houses that have good soundproofing.
Good, the police station is there.
(Genta) What a piece of billboard!
(Mitsuhiko) And they've practically sold all the houses already.
(Chiba) Look at the pin.
It's Ay's, no doubt about it.
I'm sure someone has kidnapped her and she's thrown the pin along the way
to give us a clue as to where it might be.
But the thing is, no one has contacted us.
So, it's too early to say it's a kidnapping.
Ooh... ooh...
(thinks) "What? The key to the handcuffs?"
Mrs. Higaki, the thief is this way?
Maybe this is the key to the handcuffs.
Can you bend down for a moment?
Don't move.
I'll try to get it.
I'm very grateful to you, Ai.
Don't worry, I'll untie you now.
(Door: doorbell)
(Doorbell)
We're from the police.
Anybody here?
Come in!
We want to speak to Mrs. Mitsuru Higaki.
What happened to her?
What happened to her?
Ah...
Actually, we've come home to question her...
...at the request of the Hokkaido police.
As if you haven't suffered enough today...
What happened to me was nothing.
But in Naoshi... Has my husband's murderer been arrested yet?
Unfortunately, not yet.
But soon an inspector from Hokkaido will arrive to take over the case.
I don't know what could have happened, really.
I've been tied up indoors for hours.
Of course you have.
But it would do us a lot of good to find out who Mr. Higaki was associating with.
I'll be able to tell you that.
That I'll be able to tell you.
Boy, is she unlucky, poor girl.
-Yes.
-What about you, Ai?
Are you better now?
I'm sorry for the hard time I put you through.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry.
The most important thing is that you're fine.
Yes, but what a scare you've had.
What a coincidence, isn't it?
That's a coincidence.
What a terrible coincidence, poor woman.
Her man is murdered
while a thief is luring her into the house to steal.
(Mrs. Higaki) Yes.
I saw it on the TV news.
But I couldn't do anything, I couldn't even move.
I was tied and gagged, just like Ay.
Say.
Hey, Ay...
You said "what a terrible coincidence", didn't you?
But do you really think so?
Do you think it was just a coincidence?
Eh?
If the thief had let you go,
people might have thought that Mrs. Higaki wasn't at home.
Don't you find it strange that the thief caught you?
And, besides, why did he have to anesthetize you twice?
And, above all,
why did the thief stay in the house so long?

Because it looks like she couldn't open the safe at all.
This is what Mrs. Higaki told you, right?
Yes, she told me.
The second time you were anesthetized, can you tell me what she was doing?
Well....
Have you ever seen the thief and Mrs. Higaki together?
Help, help!
Hm!
Hm!
Hm!
There's a thief!
No, I couldn't see him.
He covered my mouth with a kind of cloth behind me
and I immediately lost consciousness.
I was nervous and didn't notice anything else.
Ep.
You must not think that she is the...?
XXT!
I see you suspect her, don't you, Conan?
You think she played both the thief and the victim.
-Come on, what an outrage!
-Eh?
And why should she do something like that?
Maybe what she wanted was to have an alibi
so as not to look like a murder suspect.
Robbery and murder.
And the Ai had been unwittingly implicated.
Maybe it wasn't a coincidence,
but a well thought-out plan.
So you mean she used the Chiro as bait
so that I could corroborate her alibi?
So, if she had gone all the way to Hokkaido after anesthetizing you,
there would be no one to suspect her.
What if it turns out that this was her plan?
(Alas) It can't be, Conan.
It's impossible that she could have committed the murder of her husband.
With a direct flight, it's an hour and a half to Hokkaido airport.
And then, from here to the airport,
how long can it take?
From here it is one hour by car.
So, in total it would have taken only 2.5 hours at the most.
So, the round trip would be...uh....
-Oh.
-5 hours.
But we should also take into account
the time it would take for the victim to get to the airport
and the time to kill him.
So it would have taken at least 5.5 hours.
Yes, at least.
I remember when I woke up,
I saw Mrs. Higaki and it was a few minutes past two o'clock.
That means that, at the most,
I must have been unconscious for about 5 hours.
Another thing that doesn't quite add up
is that they found your pin near the airport.
Oh!
Right, I got it.
The doorbell.
I heard someone ring the doorbell...
around 2:30.
Hm!
Hm!
Hm!
That's it.
Of course it is.
He's back.
The beverage delivery man.
(doorbell)
- (doorbell)
-Come on...
(doorbell) Eh?
(doorbell) What's up?
There's nobody here?
I've rung 6 times, but boy, there's no way they'll open up.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You said 6 times?
As far as I remember, I've only felt it twice.
And they haven't been in a row.
-Huh? -First one and then the other.
-First one and then the other. -First one and then the other.
I'm not surprised at all, I thought so.
What do you mean, Conan?
I don't understand you.
The doorbell and the loudspeaker message were recordings that Mrs. Higaki had prepared earlier.
that Mrs. Higaki had prepared beforehand.
So it all adds up.
I think I'm beginning to see where you're going with everything.
I bet you think the Higaki's have two houses, don't you?
-I've been lost for a while now.
-Well, I don't understand you.
I understand.
It's impossible to go to Hokkaido and back;
I wouldn't have enough time.
But if the place where the Woe was awakened
was a house near the airport, then perhaps...
Like... the ones on the billboard?
(Genta) The ones in the housing development near the airport?
(Ayumi) Sure.
Ay may have been held in one of those houses.
(Ayumi) And then he would have gained the time to and from the airport.
He would have gained exactly two hours.
And the key to give the feeling that it was the same house is the turtle.
Because he's moved the terrarium, he's moved it from one place to another.
And at exactly the same time as the delivery man had to make the delivery,
the recording of the doorbell rang in the second house.
And so he anesthetized me twice,
so that he could move me and the tortoise quietly.
But one thing:
How can we prove that there are two identical houses, let's see?
Because it is a very big house.
I think we are missing something.
Let's see if you can remember some details.
-Mèèu...
Keep watch, Chiro.
Mèèèèu...
Wow, Chiro.
Good thing I already drank it all.
Eh?
There's something I don't quite understand.
"The can, when it was rolling, changed direction."

Instead, when I woke up for the second time, the can hadn't moved from where it was,
the can hadn't moved from where it was.
I think I've figured it out.
That must be it.
Genta, lift the end of the board a little, please.
Yes, sure.
Yes.
That's it?
That's it?
Look carefully.
See?
The can has changed direction, right?
Yes, that's true, but what does it have to do with what the Ai is saying?
I don't get it.
I know what you're getting at.
I know what you're getting at.
The floor of the house is tilted.
Oh!
Yes, so much so, we've already contacted the developer.
I'll send you the photos of the house right away.
It is true that misfortune follows her.
They buy a brand new house
and it turns out that it has a lot of construction defects.
Excuse me, has Agent Takagi been to the new airport development?
Yes.
There are a lot of construction defects,
in that new housing development.
Agent Takagi is investigating it.
He did a very good job.
I congratulate you all.
Ueeeh !!!!

"The motive for murder is a usual one:
The wife taking revenge on the unfaithful husband."
He's already right.
It is very usual.
And that's why Mrs.
Higaki noticed Ouch from the beginning.
Yes, it seems so.
So that Ai is smart and determined.
I'm sure she's seen him scold him many times
and must have thought he'd be a very convincing witness.
Why do you say that?
It doesn't seem that way to me, that Ay would scold me so much.
Anyway, doctor.
What are you going to tell the boys at the Junior Detective League
that the case is closed and well closed?
Goodbye.
"Yes, of course."
-Huh?
- (Genta) Hey, Ay.
Why are you so happy?
Come on, tell us.
I don't know if I can...
-Well...
(Genta) - Eh?
What is it?
Tell me, come on.
(whispers)
-Oh, good!
-What?
Did you work it out?
-Mm-hm.
-What, come on?
Yes.
Snort.
I don't understand why they're so scared and so mysterious, these?
Hey.
Wait for me.
Explain it to me too.
-It's a secret.
Ha-ha-ha!
-Wait for me!
They found a foster family for Chiro and the turtle.
"The owner was a murderer,
but the pets are not to blame."
-Ah!
-Ah!
-Come on, calm down.
-Enrere.
Don't come near me.
-Don't hurt her.
-Ayumi!
"Oysters."
Oh!
They're a very strong acceleration.
And that's...
I thought so.
