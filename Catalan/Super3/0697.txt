(Girl) Please, Mr.
Mouri,
re-investigate my sister's suicide.
Wait a minute, let's not be hasty.
You haven't even told me your name yet.
I haven't even told you my name yet.
Look, my name is Misaki Yanai.
I went to class with Ran and Sonoko until junior high school.
And then she dropped out of high school and entered Yanai Seibo Academy.
Her mother is the headmistress.
Ah, Yanai Seibo Academy!
And... you doubt that your sister committed suicide?
Yes.
The Nagisa... I know my older sister would never have committed suicide!
But if the police considered it a suicide,
they had to find some evidence to prove it.
-Of course.
Witnesses...
-There were two witnesses.
And one of the witnesses was myself.
Yes, of course... What?!
But I'm sure she didn't do it!
B-but, but...
Please, you must prove that my sister did not commit suicide!
No matter how much you ask me, I don't know if I can...
"To find the perfect solution,
you have to decipher all the mysteries and codes."
"The client is a high school student."
"There is a shocking truth hidden on campus!"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

Answer!
"The window of the girls' academy."
Yes, forensic scientists are also sure.
There is no doubt that Nagisa Yanai committed suicide.
(Kogoro) "I thought so. Much obliged, inspector."
Well, Inspector Megure has confirmed it.
I know what they think, they.
That's precisely why I came to see you.
Father!
Misaki!
Somebody help me, please!
Mr. Mouri, why don't you at least ask him...
to explain what you saw that day?
You're right, you're right.
Come on, don't cry anymore.
Explain to Mr. Mouri what you saw.
-I'm all ears, young lady. -I'm all ears, young lady.
-Hmm.
I'll do it.
"It happened 5 days ago, in the afternoon."
"It was almost 6 o'clock."
"Miss Kodama told me she wanted to talk to me
and we sat on a bench."
Miss Kodama?
Yes, she's the advisory teacher...
of the high school and college drama club.
Nagisa and I were from the drama club.
My sister was supposed to play the lead role in a play
to be performed on the day of the academy festival.
I know we're running very short of time,
but I haven't decided on the program yet.
The dilemma I have is that I don't know whether to do a comedy or a tragedy.
Yes, Nagisa explained it to me.
She thinks it should have a happy ending
or it should move the audience with a good performance.
Nagisa is not sure about that either, is she?
That's why I also wanted to ask you what you think.
It's strange that I'm so late,
Nagisa asked me to wait for her here.
Oh!
Isn't that the window of the model club room?
I thought everyone had already folded up.
(Misaki) The advisory teacher is Mr. Shibagaki, right?
Mr. Shibagaki had a meeting with the principal at 5:30 on 6th.
(Misaki) The Nagisa.
(Misaki) The Nagisa.
Yes, that's her, but...
-Nagisa!
-What do you intend to do?
(Sonoko) "Where did she hang the rope, your sister?"
(Misaki) "The beams in that classroom are all exposed."
-She won't feel you, it's soundproofed.
-Nagisa!
Nagisa!
(Misaki) -Ah!
(Misaki) -Ah!
No!
-Just today!
-It's locked!
Wait, call the principal's office!
Yes, of course!
The headmistress' office is near there?
Yes.
It was much faster than going all the way around to the front door.
And that's where your mother was, right?
And it's on the same floor.
With the other teacher, Mr. Shibagaki.
(Phone)
Hello?
What's that?
What do you say now?

My sister is in danger!
In the classroom of the model club!
Hurry, eagerness!
Nagisa!
Nagisa!
May I know why you did that?
(Misaki) "Professor Shibagaki was your sister's boyfriend?"
(Misaki) "He's the treasurer of the academy,
they were planning to get married when she finished her studies."
Why did you leave me alone?
It doesn't make sense!
I can't believe it!
Tell me, Misaki.
If you saw it yourself, why do you think she didn't commit suicide?
What makes you suspicious?
She was about to marry her fiancé,
she was in the prime of her life;
wasn't she?
That's true.
She had no reason to commit suicide.
Nagisa had problems with her fiancé.
What kind?
What kind?
Mr.
Shibagaki had studied at the university with Miss.
Kodama
and they had a relationship.
That's the teacher you were with, right?
What?!
You mean he was giving her the jump?
And they confessed that they were together?
(Misaki) Yes.
He ended up admitting it reluctantly
when the investigation began.
What about her?
What did she say, Miss Kodama?
You're very curious, you.
Eh...
He's a precocious child, don't listen to him.
"Only sometimes?"
Sometimes he gets it right, though.
Tell me, what did Miss Kodama say?
She admitted that they had a relationship years ago,
but she claimed they were no longer together.
Hmm... Woman, I don't know what to tell you.
Besides, they work together at the same academy.
Maybe the Nagisa couldn't stand to see them together and would.... hang up.
Mm-hm.
She wasn't one to hide her head under her wing.
She would have thrown the promise ring at his feet sooner.
Nagisa had a lot of personality.
Do you have any suspicions?
Yeah, but...
The scandal was uncovered when the investigation began, wasn't it?
How come your sister already knew about it?
I don't know.
Yes!
That's true.
Wait a minute, come to think of it, I got something from my sister.
See?
It has her name engraved on it.
She asked me to take it to the store to adjust the width.
The day she died.
When was that?
Eh?
So the Nagisa didn't know yet
that her fiancé was cheating on her with another.
She said she wanted to continue wearing this bracelet
even after she got married.
Your sister was a very happy girl.
That's why I refuse to believe that what I saw was a suicide!
But you yourself saw your sister hang herself....
(Misaki) Nooo!
(Takagi) The rope was used to pack the models.
And the stool that she climbed on was knocked over
and rolled to the screen.
It was a stool with wheels,
it must have rolled when she kicked it to hang on.
Wow, look at this one!
It's a model of the academy, isn't it?
They were all made by the students?
They are made as a group, with the teacher's help.
-Yes.
-Ah, Mr. Shibagaki.
He's a model collector and war buff.
He gave his entire collection for display in the showcases.
How cool!
It's a remote-controlled model of the Elephant war tank
from World War II.
He-he!
Not so many.
How many things you know!
Boy stuff, I mean.
We girls are more into this kind of figurines.
Hmm...
Ah, Mr. Mouri!
Hello.
You mean you can show us these pictures, Takagi?
Won't he get mad, in Megure?
Well, since it's not a homicide, there's no problem.
Turns out these creatures insist it wasn't a suicide.
-What do you mean it's normal?
-Yeah, sure, it's normal.
Look, the thing would be suspicious...
if the victim's death had benefited anyone.
"In this case, therefore, everyone involved has lost out."
"Miss Kodama and Mr. Shibagaki are suspected of scandal.
"And the headmistress is so upset by her daughter's death
that she wants to close the academy."
If we had to look for a culprit, we wouldn't know who to accuse.
-Yes, yes.
-We wouldn't find anyone with motive.
You look thoughtful, Conan. Have you found anything suspicious?
Have you found anything suspicious?
Ran, the photos alone aren't enough for me.
We have to go to the academy.
What do you mean?
At the academy?
Yes.
Maybe we'll find out more there.
Can we go take a look around, Inspector Takagi?
Eh?
Yes.

There is no ongoing investigation, so they will let you pass.
Well, we'll explain when we get back.
I'm not coming.
It's over there.
It's almost time.
"Some people are hopeless."
Come on, this is no time for jokes!
Say.
Just a moment!
My sister's whole face was showing.
I'm going to call Sonoko.
Keep an eye on your cell phone.
Understood.
The door was locked that day, wasn't it?
Hmm.
Shall we try it from here?
Yeah, let's try it.
Climb-te.
Better now?
"All right."
Ah... Yeah, it was right there.
Hm.
Hm?
"Those are the marks of a caterpillar. It must have taken quite a beating."
Hmm?
(Sonoko) Conan.
I just played the suicide from here?
(Sonoko) Come on.
Yes, do.
Aaah!
Aaah!
(thump)
Oops, sorry, are you okay?
Aah...
S-sorry.
I think I am.
Can you move out of the way?
(Kogoro) Detective Mouri's agency, tell me?
Hello, Misaki.
Look, if you're calling me about the case, I already told you yesterday at the office...
(Misaki voice) Yes, I know.
But I'd like you to come and explain it to us at the academy.
Mother and I are still not completely convinced.
Yeah, but anyway...
"Please come. We just need an explanation."
Ah...
-Thank you very much!
- "All right."
"But you won't have to settle for what I tell you."
So far, then.
-Yes, we'll be waiting for her. -Yes, we'll be waiting for her.
I'll have to do it to convince that girl
and try to get her to let it go.
It's part of my job.
I don't know what one in ten to take head on, in Mouri.
No.
You don't know anything, do you?
He just told me we'd know if we came.
We're very busy with the closing of the academy and we don't have much time.
-(Kogoro) Huh?
- (Kogoro) Sorry for the delay.
-(Kogoro) Huh?
(Kogoro) -Huh?
W-what are you doing here, inspector?
Aaah... aaah... aaah... aaah... aaah...
Father!
This time you haven't been late at all!
(Kogoro voice) Thank you all for coming.
I'm here because Miss Misaki Yanai asked me to....
Eh?
The case is already solved, Mouri.
Of course, I'm fully aware.
Everything pointed to the victim having committed suicide.
But it turns out that doing so on the day she had asked her sister
to have a bracelet repaired.
Don't you find that curious, at least?
I'm convinced she did it because of me.
The Nagisa found out that I had betrayed her and couldn't stand it.
Ah... How and when did she discover your infidelity, the Nagisa?
Well, now that she's gone, I guess...
We'll never know, of course.
By the way, the Ran,
Misaki and company came to reenact the suicide scene yesterday.
Sonoko, could you give us another demonstration?
What?
You want us to do it again?
I'm sorry, Professor Yanai.
I ask for a little more patience.
At first, Sonoko put the stool at this point in the classroom,
but its silhouette from the outside
did not look exactly the same as that of Nagisa,
so she had to move a little farther away from the window.
It was... about here.
Hmm.
All right, so what's the problem?
The problem, inspector, is that it's impossible for him to hang himself from here.
On the day and at the time he died,
at this particular spot was the model of the Seibo Academy.
-Huh?
-Huh?
I'll ask Misaki to confirm it.
What area of the room does it occupy, the model?
Ah, yes.
It goes up to here.
As you can see, there was no room for the stool.
And if we place the stool next to the model,
it doesn't match what the witnesses saw.
To get the same view from closer to the window, you have to use a lower stand.
you have to use a lower support.
Wait a minute!
In the classroom there was no support other than the stool.
What was that?
Not true, there was another one.
What?
Inspector Megure.
Do you know why we insisted so much on the exact location?
Because it seems to have been determined from the beginning.
Come to think of it,
we could see my sister from her head to below her hips,
as if she had measured it;
it didn't look like a coincidence.
(Kogoro voice) What if it wasn't a coincidence?
(Kogoro voice) Huh?
What if someone had told her where she had to put it
to make sure the witnesses could see her properly?
You mean the Nagisa wanted

that we could see everything from the courtyard?
That's right.
The Nagisa wanted Ms. Kodama
to see how she interpreted a suicide.
That's why she had to choose the best location.
And that's why she asked me to wait for her on the bench in the courtyard that day?
So she just wanted to play a role?
This is what I intended.
She wanted the audience of the academy festival to come and see her performance.
to come and see her performance.
But first she had to convince Miss Kodama.
Only then would he get the lead role
even if the play had a tragic ending.
(Cries) I believe it perfectly.
Nagisa would have played an extraordinary role.
Someone subtly convinced her to fake her own death.
The only person who could do it...
-You're welcome.
-E-ei, you!
What are you accusing me of?
I haven't said your name once yet.
Ah.
In the inner courtyard of the academy there are several benches,
but they were all freshly painted
taken from the bench where Misaki and Miss Kodama sat.
"An employee has confirmed to me that Mr. Shibagaki
gave instructions to paint all the others that day."
"Thus the special seat to attend the performance was reserved."
Also, for some reason that I can't explain,
"Just that day the door was locked."
And who was responsible for the keys?
It was you, wasn't it, Professor Shibagaki?
But listen, Mouri, if the suicide was a simulation,
how come he ended up dying for real?
So that the stand she was strung up on moved on its own.
What do you mean?
The stool was too high to use as a support,
and the culprit suggested she get on the battle tank.
The war tank?
Ah!
The Elephant we found in the corner of the classroom!
Can you bring it over here, Takagi, please?
It's a die-cast aluminum model made in Germany.
It's strong enough to hold the weight of a girl.
So, then, the victim climbed on top of the tank...
to make it look like she was hanging?
Oh!
Six o'clock in the evening.
That was the time they had both agreed to start the show.
If he used the remote control at 6 o'clock,
the culprit could move the tank even if he wasn't in the classroom.
Professor Shibagaki.
You used the calculator with your left hand that day, didn't you?
"And he had his right hand in his pocket."
"Because he had the remote control in his pocket."
Soc innocent!
When Misaki called me,
I was shocked to hear that Nagisa had hung herself!
-Bullshit!
-The victim is me!
I only asked her to run to the model classroom!
My sister is in danger!
In the model club room!
Hurry, eagerness!
How could I know she had committed suicide?
I-I didn't mean this, it was a....
When you arrived at the scene of the crime, was there any support?
Yes, I saw the stool between the frames of the screen.
Right.
So, while you were trying to help the girl, you noticed the stool.
T-that's absurd!
When I gave my collection,
I took the motor out of all the models.
I didn't want the girls to pick them up to play with and get damaged.
Yeah, it doesn't really look like there's any antennae.
Of course it doesn't!
The theory's not bad, but what doesn't move, doesn't move.
Eh?
Ah!
Oh!
It has moved!
I asked Conan to check it first.
The external antennas were replaced by integrated models.
If it is true that the motors were taken out some time ago,
they were reinstalled not long ago.
Could you tell us what this means?
Aaah!
Aaah!
I think Mr. Shibagaki has run out of arguments.
(Cries)

It is seen that Professor Shibagaki was stealing money from the academy
and asked Miss Kodama
not to say anything to anyone in exchange for a share of the loot.
She got scared and left him.
If only the academy had closed,

could have kept all the money.
So in the end it turns out that he did act for his own benefit.
(Bells: ringing)
It seems that the mother has decided to continue thanks to Misaki.
So the academy hasn't closed.
Don't tell me it's...?
(Mitsuhiko) Oh, of course it is.
It's an Adamsky-type UFO.
"Oni"?
Did you say "oni"?
Don't suffer, we'll pay your bill to the last yen tomorrow.
O... o...

I see you've already come up with an explanation.
Maybe you have.
