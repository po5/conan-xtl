DETECTIVE CONAN
The case of the mysterious disappearance
(Adult voice) Robbery, kidnapping, murder....
It never seems to end, that.
But your deductions help society.
But all the credit goes to Mouri.
(Adult voice) Perfect!
That's it!
My new invention: glasses to chase criminals!
And how does it work?
Press the button on the side.
Wow!
The signal from this transmitter is detected within a radius of 20 km,
on the screen of the glasses.
If you don't use it, leave it here, it's like a sticker.
Thank you very much, Dr. Agasa.
My name is Masami Hirota.
Please, sir!
Find my father!
Au... explain yourself!
My father came here to Tokyo to work as a cab driver.
He left and nobody's heard from him for a month.
That's why you came to see me.
Yes, today I had a party at school and I came all the way from Yamagata.
You are the only person who can help me, sir.
Okay, daughter, I accept the order.
Look, this is my father.
His name is Kenzo Hirota.
He's 5'7" and 48 years old.
Mmm... whose cat is it?
It's my father's.
He named him Kai.
But he likes them a lot and has 3 more: "Te", "Go" and "O".
(Think) "A missing person... I don't think I'll be needed."
"If in Kogoro carried the transmitter, it would be easy to locate him."
"I'll put it on Ran to see if it works."
Some tea?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaai!
Nano's pussy!
What are you doing?!
Sorry...
(Think) "Transmitter!"
"Oysters! He's got her!"
I lost my mother when I was little
and the father is the only person I have left.
If something had happened to him...
(Kogoro) Maybe it will take a while because we have few clues,
but I'll know something soon.
Masami again?
Yes, this is the third time she's called me today.
Mr. Hirota didn't relate to anyone,
He didn't explain anything personal.
It's been going on for a week already!
(TV)... in Gokaiteó is winning!
Go-kai-te-o?
It's my father's.
He named it Kai.
But he likes them a lot and he has 3 more: "Te", "Go" and "O".
(Think) "Kai, Te, Go, and O."
"If you change the order..."
"It looks like this!"
How come, I do it so well?
(TV) Gentlemen, in Gokaiteó you have no rivals!
Of course you do!
You are absolutely right!
Mr. Hirota likes horse racing!
Look at this, father!
Hey, hey!
I'm sure we'll find him, if we go to the racetrack!
(Shouts of enthusiasm)
It's a great thing!
Let's try!
We must find Masami's father!
(Thinking) "He thinks we'll find him so easily."
(Thinks) "You think it's easy, playing detective?"
Eh?
It's over there!
What?! What?!
I'm a great investigator too!
It can't be! It can't be!
I'll tell him...
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
He's missing.
We'll have a harder time finding him, though, if he gets away.
We'll follow him home.
Father, you don't know how long I've been looking for you!
Father!
Father, I've been looking for you for so long!
What a joy!
Yes, but this girl, don't you see her a little different, Ran?
She's dressed bigger, and she's got make-up on.
I haven't seen that for a long time.
She wanted to look pretty.
If she wears it in Kogoro Mouri, a case like that has no secrets!
What's that?
Who's this?
What?! Is it death?!
Last night, they found him hanging.
Everything is a big headache.
Hey, and your daughter?
What daughter?
Mr. Hirota's daughter.
Ah, sure, now I understand that man's attitude.
He was quite mysterious.
He said that if I didn't ask him any questions,
he'd pay me rent for the whole year early.
He paid me with new bills!
If the daughter was there, maybe they'll find her murdered....
Didn't she commit suicide, Mr. Hirota?
The police said it was murder.
What?! What?!
Ah, yes... it's a homicide.
According to the coroner,
he was strangled first and then hanged.
From the size of the marks, the killer must have been heavy-set.
What about his daughter?

We found this at the crime scene.
They are Masami's glasses!
Although the body was not found,
but maybe... it's also dead.
Come on, girl, don't get so depressed, come on.
Can't you see that Masami might have been murdered?
She had finally managed to find her father,
y... It's terrible!
We still don't know if she's been murdered!
Don't be discouraged, daughter.
(Think) "What can we do?"
"If we had a clue..."
"Sure!"
"Clock transmitter!"
"I've got it!"
Hey kid!
Where are you going?!
Come back!
"If it moves, it means the Masami might be alive."
"Hurry up! I've got to find her!"
A game room?
Masami, in a place like this?
(Alarm)
I'm running out of battery.
I have to find it quickly!
Get away, this place is not for a child.
Get away!
The battery has run out.
Conan!
What good did you do today?
Nothing important...
What's the matter, Ran?
She's been like this all day.
She must be worried sick about Masami.
He's very suspicious, that guy.
He's been looking this way for a while now.
This guy was hanging around Hirota's apartment.
The killer is a strong man, isn't he?
This guy must have killed Masami's father!
Ran, wait here!
I'll make him confess where Masami is!
Come on, where is Masami?
What have you done to him, you miserable bastard!
I'll get you!
I've got him, stop.
Ah!
Perfect!
What do you think you've done, you miserable murderer?!
-Why are you watching us?
-I'm not a murderer!
Sure man!
And what are you?!
-The same as you.
-What do you mean?
Well, I'm a private detective.
I was also commissioned to locate Mr. Hirota.
It was this man.
Wow, it's him!
Believe me!
I'm a private detective!
And why did you want to run away?
When I saw your daughter coming, I got scared.
I've always been a coward.
The glasses are to hide my weakness.
Do you think I'll get married?
No!
Don't joke about it!
Masami's life is in danger!
Oh... yes, I know.
So you say you've been hired to find Mr. Kenzo Hirota?
Yes...
But there's something that doesn't add up,
in Hirota's family.
This man hired me.
I was to locate his brother, who had left Kyushu,
and who was the only family member he had left.
The only relative?
Masami told us that her father only had her.
Also, the father Masami was looking for was from Yamagata.
It's all very strange.
There can't be two Hirota.
There is another strange thing.
At the cab company where I worked,
I was told that every afternoon I made the same route
without a passenger and running like a madman through the city.
This is a practice to release tension.
Many men do it.
What else do you know about your client?
Akira Hirota, 28 years old,
height over six feet, burly.
-A tall man, you say? -A tall man, you say?
He could be the man the inspector was talking about.
You talked about Mr. Hirota, with this stout man?
Yes, one day...
and right after Mr. Hirota was murdered...
And I decided to investigate on my own.
This man is the murderer.
And then he took the Masami, who was also there.
How can we get in touch with him?
-He contacts Mi. -You don't know how to find him?
(He thinks) "There is no doubt..."
"...it's him!"
"I ran into him in the game room."
"But why?"
"Clock transmitter led me to the arcade."
"If this guy was the killer,
and if he was wearing Masami's watch,
this means that surely...
...must already be dead!"
Come on, doctor, charge the battery!
Traqnuil.
You don't get good results in a hurry.
But, if you don't hurry...
Do you remember?
The hijacking of that vehicle that was carrying 10 billion yen?
Yes, that group of 3.Exacte.
One of the guards who wanted to reduce the robber died
because he underestimated his enemy.
Calm, knowledge and prudence?
Not what you like, from Sherlock Holmes?
Sure, he's right.
Are you sure it's in this hotel, that guy?
I've seen him on my way back from school.

(Thinks) "He hasn't moved for a while, the signal."
"Maybe he's taken off his watch."
Yes, this gentleman is in room 802.
"Hurry down. Hurry up!"
(Kogoro) I didn't believe it, that it was here.
(Think) "Things always happen, when you're in a hurry!"
(Kogoro) Thank you very much.
Come on, man, open up!
We know it's here!
Wow, it's open!
It's... it's dead!
This sweet smell is potassium cyanide.
He must have killed himself with remorse.
Now we have to call the police.
"It's Masami's watch. He had it, the watch."
"These are empty suitcases."
"Wait a minute!"
"Two clients ask two detectives
to track down a man."
"But their versions don't connect."
"And Hirota's habit of roaming the city."
"And these suitcases..."
"It could be that..."
Mr. Hirota was not married?!
No, nor does he have any daughters.
And he has always lived in Tokyo.
What?
This is unbelievable!
"Very well... Now I'm starting to connect the dots!"
"The key to solving the case is in these empty suitcases."
"The Masami, Kenzo Hirota and Akira Hirota are not related."
"But if their relationship was in that recent robbery....
the mystery could be solved."
"The theft of the 10 billion yen was committed by 3 people."
"So many suitcases, maybe they were used to store the money!"
"Mr. Hirota was driving alone at full speed
to practice the escape!"
"The plan went well, but..."
"In Hirota betrayed the others and fled with the money."
"And they made up a story
to commission detectives to locate en Hirota."
"The burly man goes to locate him and murdered him."
"And the burly man also killed her in this room!"
"It was the woman who said she was Hirota's daughter."
"That woman...
...who was probably...
...who was pulling the strings."
"Wait a minute!"
"The hairstyle and the air were different,
but the features and the suitcases she carried...!"
Conan, where are you going?
Follow me, I've found the Masami!
Come on, Ran, hurry up!
Do you want to pass us?
They've buried our father alive and chopped him up in a mountain!
Do, do, please.
Follow the cab here in front!
Weren't we going to the mountain?
(Thinking) "When we saw her again she was changed
because she was so happy that we had found in Hirota
that when she disguised herself she didn't disguise the details."
"And Hirota's surprised face was not that of a happy father."
"He was very afraid of his associates' revenge."
"Why hadn't I noticed?"
What shall we do?
We've lost the trail!
(He thinks) "Surely it's near here."
Conan, come!
And the money, Masami Hirota?
Or should I say Akemi Miyano?
Mr. Okita, what the hell is going on?
The pills you gave me to make the partner sleep...
After taking the picture, he hasn't moved anymore.
I want an explanation!
That man was violent, and he was also stupid.
He would have wasted all the money
and the police would not have been slow to suspect him.
Letting a man like him live would jeopardize my plan.
So I had planned to kill them all.
All right, pretty girl, give me all the money.
I don't have them on me, I've hidden them.
I'm sick of feeling used.
From now on I'll go to me.
If you do anything...
I'll tell you where they are when I'm in another country.
Can't you see it would spoil my plan if I left you alive?
Look, if he eliminates you now,
no one will be able to accuse me and that's what it's all about.
Of fools like you and in Hirota, they are found in handfuls.
It's against my rules to get your hands dirty,
but you made me do it.
He's a fool.
If you kill me, you'll never find the money!
I think I know where they are.
You've worked so well, I'll grant you a quick death.
(Think) "Masami..."
What hurt you?
Just a scratch...
Eh?
You're too young to be a detective.
How did you know I was here?
For a transmitter.
A transmitter?
The first day you came to the office,
the transmitter got hooked to your watch.
I followed the signal, until I ended up at the hotel.

And I figured you were leaving with the stolen millions.
But who the fuck are you?
Conan Edogawa, a detective.
I didn't even realize I was wearing this on my watch.
But the watch belonged to that beefy guy, right?
Don't get it wrong.
The watch was mine,
but I gave it to him
because his was broken when he strangled Hirota.
But this man wanted to kill everyone, right?
Yes, and in Hirota he realized it, and wanted to run away.
So, this man was the mastermind who planned the robbery!
That's right.
The Okita always decided everything and recruited gang members.
He had been forming gangs for some time now
to commit kidnappings and robberies all over the city.
Rumor had it that when the job was done, he'd kill them all
because they could not accuse him.
(Sirens)
You won't run away?
I am very tired.
The suitcases containing the 10 billion are in the...
At the hotel reception, right?
How did you know that?
If you'd gotten in the cab with the suitcases, they'd be here.
It's elementary.
You're very clever.
And the story is over.
What a chatterbox, this damn woman!
Masami, are you...?
Who, who is this?
The mastermind behind the 10 billion robbery.
"I had it right."
"The stolen money was found at the hotel reception desk."
"The serial numbers of the bills matched absolutely all of them,
and the robbery case was solved."
Thank you very much, little detective.

DETECTIVE CONAN
Look, there, on top of the building!
Such is the name of the target.
A road... number?
For example, road number 162, or...
Go look for the helicopter!
Stand by!
A very mysterious message
