"(Telephone)"
(Kogoro) Aaaaah.... Who's calling at this hour?
Tell me?
Mr. Hoso.
What happened?
Why are you calling me so early?
Yes.
As you say?
Okay, I'll be right back.
Any news?
Yes.
Was that Mr. Hoso, father?
It seems that his secretary has committed suicide.
Ah... Hello, Mouri.
I called to tell him to come.
How did he commit suicide, in Takahashi?
We don't know yet, if it was a suicide.
-Mr. Mouri.
-May I come in?
The inspector told me he's not sure it was suicide.
-That's why.
-What did you find?
(Kogoro) What's this string?
(Takagi) It's attached to the radiator fan.
-(Takagi) What else?
-(Takagi) As you can see, it's broken.
-(Takagi) At the neck?
-(Takagi) It's wrapped around his neck, too.
My goodness!
If the string hadn't broken, I would have...
From the fan, it goes behind the driver's headrest...
...and down Mr. Takahashi's neck..,
and the end of the string is attached to the steering wheel.
(Kogoro) I get it.
When the engine has started,
the fan started spinning and strangled it.
I would not have dared to press the start button.
Besides, she didn't die right after pressing the button.
(Takagi) How?
(Takagi) The electric radiator fan doesn't start to run
as soon as you start the engine.
(Kogoro) You're right,
it takes a while before the water temperature doesn't go up
and the sensor detects it.
Yes.
Especially when it's cold outside, like now.
(Kogoro) "It takes a while for the fan to turn on."
"Then why? Why did it do it this way?"
"Out of fear, maybe?"
"No, it's just that..."
-I agree.
-He was murdered.
To commit suicide you don't need to have this margin of time.
"Sometimes we even think the same thing."
We must start by investigating the cause of death.
In the worst case scenario,
maybe we'll find some substance in his stomach.
(Takagi) What do you mean, he wasn't strangled to death?
(Takagi) "That briefcase... Isn't that where the two-faced mask was?"
How long have you been here?
(Takagi) Huh?
Aah!
Oh, I don't know, to tell you the truth...
I don't know how to tell you anymore.
These things are not for children.
By the way, isn't that the case where the mask was?
Yes, that's right.
I didn't make myself clear?
"I'm sure I'm not wrong."
"That briefcase is what President Yabusaki took yesterday."
Very well.
I'll take the briefcase with the mask.
"It was the theater."
(Woman) I tell him that we are co-workers.
-It's just that...
-You can't come in now, I'm sorry.
Please, go.
You must understand.
(Woman) Eh?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Nothing wrong?
It's nothing, thank you.
Yukari...
Mr. Hoso...
Is it true... that in Takahashi...?
Yes, it is.
Hey, Shiratori.
Good morning, Shiratori.
Is the mask gone?
Good morning, sir.
Hello, Conan.
I see you're as well-informed as ever.
He-he-he-he-he!
What happened?
Well, they took my fingerprints.
I'm sure they suspect me.
That doesn't mean anything, man.
They need the fingerprints of everyone who has passed through here.
The nano is absolutely right.
If we find prints other than those of the workers,
we'll make a breakthrough in the investigation.

Do you really mean it, Inspector?
But this time we won't find anything.
No, not one.
No fingerprints?
The thief took the precaution of wearing vinyl gloves.
Mr. Tome says that, had they been leather,
the creases in the surface would have left marks.
"Vinyl gloves? You can find them everywhere, the same ones."
To President Yabusaki's locker.
The mask was in there?
This morning he found it like that.
Mr. Minowa, can I ask you a question?
Yes, say.
"From here to the staff entrance..."
Eh?
(EBiz) Hello, young detective.
EBiz!
Have you found out something?
Poor Takahashi.
Mr. Mouri suspects it wasn't suicide.
No.
It looked like a robbery and in the end it turned out to be a murder.
In fact, nothing has been decided yet.
But if he had committed suicide,
"... the mask of the two faces would not have disappeared from the briefcase."
"You're right."
"If he had stolen it from Takahashi, we would have found it next to him."
Clearly it must have been taken by someone else.
Maybe to sell it.
Or to keep it, I don't know.
In any case, it's someone who knew the value of it.
And who knew that the president had kept the briefcase in the locker.
That narrows it down a lot, doesn't it?
Yes.
Is there anything you don't see clearly?
To open the locker he had to pick the lock on the door,
"...but the other locks are intact."
"Yes."
"The other locks?"
"The watchman, Mr. Minowa,
left at five-thirty 12 o'clock at night."
"He will set off the alarms throughout the building
and locked the front door."
"There are many people who have the access card,
"But only Mr. Minowa and the other receptionists
have the main keys."
"A professional espanyaportes?"
It's an explanation.
But if he could get in without even making a scratch on the modern locks,
"...how come he had to pick a simple lock like the one on the locker?"
Yes, the truth is that's strange.
So, it must be someone who has the keys to the building.
And who knows the location of the security cameras.
Eh?
Even this, you deduced?
Of course I have.
You're trying to retrace the thief's steps, right?
Yes.
The building is full of security cameras.
"The area where the artists' dressing rooms are is heavily guarded,
"But, if you don't take the elevator,
you can get in the lockers without being caught on camera."
Wow!
Funny, isn't it?
That's because the offices of the president and co.
there is nothing of value.
Do you recognize this?
What are those numbers?
Mr. Minowa gave it to me,
it's the code to open the front door.
"He found it this morning at the front desk."
"And why didn't he give it to the police?"
Can you ask Mr. Mouri to look into it, please?
Not the police, I'm sure they suspect me.
He is convinced.
And now, what an outrage!
Eh?
Let him turn?
Turn the page.
This is the text of a play?
It's the script of our last play.
He has a habit of using old scripts to write things down.
I mean the Iwami, the playwright.
Yes.
The belt.
"Dude?"
Come on, buddy.
Come clean, detective.
The Iwami's your prime suspect, so far?
He might be if he had an accomplice.
This case started when someone tampered
"...the brakes on Mr. Hoso's car
with the obvious intention of murdering him."
"Now it's his turn to receive his secretary,
who was also killed by tampering with the car."
"And the small bar which the culprit has used
"To force the door of the president's locker.
"It could be a fixed key
"of the kind used to change a tire."
I see where you're going.
The culprit is a car connoisseur, right?
That's why I consider it highly unlikely
that it was Mr. Iwami, who doesn't even have a driver's license.
How did you find out, that Iwami doesn't have a driver's license?
Ah, it wasn't me.
Mr. Mouri asked for an investigation.
Yes, of course.
Whatever you say, I'm sure it's you who solves the cases,
in the shadow of Mr. Mouri.

"It's not funny."
(Kogoro) You want me to be your bodyguard?
I tampered with the brakes on my car and almost died.
And then my secretary was murdered in Takahashi.
The police haven't ruled out the suicide theory yet.
Wow.
In Takahashi, he wasn't the type to commit suicide.
When I got angry with him and scolded him,
the next day he would treat me as if nothing had happened.
I'm afraid they'll try to kill me again.
Okay, then.
I accept the proposal.
- (door: knock)
-Oh, what a break!
(door: knock) Come in.
Excuse me.
Good morning, Mr. President.
I have two messages for you.
The president just hired me to be his bodyguard.
You must be Kogoro Mouri, right?
Yes, I'm a famous detective.
Can you leave us alone for a moment?
-What brand of shampoo do you use?
Excuse me, we'll be done in a moment.
I'll come and pick him up in the waiting room, okay?
We don't know where the next bullet might be fired from.
If you know a sniper with such marksmanship, introduce me.
-Oh, right.
Who are you?
-I was joking.
Yukari Shioji.
I'm in charge of accounting.
You recognized me right away, Kaori Shioji.
My God, she smells good!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(EBiz) This is where they took the Iwami.
We should talk in a place where we are not surrounded by people.
You know what I mean, everybody knows you.
(EBiz) What do you mean?
It won't work.
This way I'll go unnoticed.
Why not? (PA: woman) "Why not?
(PA: woman) "Dr. Terajima, Dr. Terajima."
"Come to the medical room, please."
"I repeat: Dr. Terajima, in the medical room, please."
"I guess charisma is impossible to disguise."
Room 11.
Is it this floor?
(Metallic objects: clattering)
(Woman) Don't do it, Mr. Iwami!
I said don't!
(Woman) Help!
Somebody help me!
Iwami!
What are you doing?
Stop it!
What the hell are you doing, Iwami?
E... eBiz!
(Weeping) I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Yes.
Is it wrong?
Is he all right?
It's just... he's a bit of a difficult patient, you know?
Dr. Kikuchi...
-Yes, doctor.
-We'll be right back?
(EBiz) I'm beginning to think it was my fault.
I chose Iwami because I trusted his talent.
But maybe in the end the pressure
has finally got the better of her.
EBiz.
From now on, I will continue on my own.
Why did you decide?
If you doubt the people you trust, investigating is hard.
You're just a kid,
but you understand perfectly well how others feel.
-Ah... Yes.
-I knew it was Mr. eBiz.
The doctor says he gave Mr. Iwami a painkiller.
-Thank you for everything.
-He's resting now, he's calmer.
You're welcome, by all means.
Ha-ha!
What do you want to do from now on?
Do you want a ride?
Thank you, but you don't need to come with me.
I'll continue on my own.
Understood.
I'll ask the others to tell you the truth
and to facilitate your investigation.
Courage, great little detective.
Yes.
Yesterday you also tried to jump, Mr. Iwami?
How do you know?
Because, when he entered the room,
the doctor said: "Here we are?"
Ah, yes, of course.
"Around 3 a.m. I came in to check the drop by drop."
(Iwami) Don't play games with me.
I'm telling you I've quit, you idiot.
-I'm not working on this construction site anymore.
-Mr. Iwami!
Stop it!
Let go of me!
I tell you to let me go!
-Ah!
-No way.
(Iwami: cries)
Have you tried to commit suicide?
Mm... I don't know if he was serious or just acting.
Sometimes there are patients like that.
Who interfere, kiddo?
And what are you doing here, if I may ask?
I'm a photographer, kid.
I've been commissioned to report on the next show.
That's my job.
But I have nothing to do with the show.
You're wrong.
You're in it up to your neck, too.
What did you think, I'd let you get away?
Hey... What are you, a photographer or a detective?
When you look at people through the viewfinder,
you get a clear idea of what they're really like.
And that's why we photographers are so well paid.
I've arrived before the police spread their blue cloths.

and I've taken these pictures from the building next door.
And also... these.
You have very pretty eyes, man.
Was there a suicide note?
If he ended up killing himself, there's nothing to investigate.
There are much easier ways to kill yourself.
You're very smart, you know that?
Be careful.
Thank you.
A mistake in choosing friends and enemies can cost you your life.
"Who is this photographer? And what does he know, really?"
- (Hoso) Sorry for the wait.
- "This is too much."
-My name is Yukari Shioji.
-Kaori Shioji.
I'd like to talk to you alone about Mr. Takahashi.
What?
Mr. Mouri, I have to go.
I have a meeting in Ginza.
Will you come with me?
Yes, of course I will.
-My name is Yukari.
-Come on, Kaori.
Let's go.
Miss Shioji will have to stay,
she has a lot of work in her department.
Mm... Too bad.
-Yes, I'm coming.
- (Hoso) Mr. Mouri.
I can't reach Mr. Kaneko.
Mr. Kaneko?
We have a problem...
Yes.
I guess you mean the photographer.
I met her recently at the hospital where Mr. Iwami is admitted.
-Thank you, Conan.
-Really?
Why are you looking for him, Mr. Kaneko?
We've heard a lot of rumors about him, and all of them bad.
Well...
(Mobile: vibrates)
"It's the Ran."
Where are you, may I ask?
Hello, Ran.
What's been going on?
I see you're doing much more fun things
than playing soccer with us.
Guys, please...
We know everything, Ran explained it all to us.
We know you went to a restaurant in Ichikawa.
This was Mr. Mouri's anecdote.
-L'Ebizo.
-There you went with Kanizo.
(They speak at the same time)
Give me back my cell phone, guys.
"(They continue talking at the same time)"
"Better not come by the house."
Eh?
Did you give it to Mr. Mouri?
What's up?
Do it now, I'm asking you please.
No, I'll do it now.
If I know he hasn't got it yet, I won't be able to sleep tonight.
Oh, by the way.
Do you have Mr. Kaneko's cell phone number?
It turns out that Mr. Mouri told me to ask for it.
(Kaneko) "How did you know, that it was me?"
(Kaneko) "Ha-ha-ha. I didn't know, I don't have your number."
"But intuition has told me it's you."
"The police are also trying to track you down."
"We detectives have a sixth sense, you know that."
"I'd like to ask you some questions as a detective."
"Like now?"
"I want to know why you have portrayed
Mr. Takahashi's lifeless body."
"Okay, detective."
(Think) "What are you doing, in this kind of place?"
"Who was it?"
"Shit!"

(EBiz) The two-faced mask that Mr. Hoso left us has disappeared.
has disappeared.
Someone has stolen it.
But I don't intend to throw in the towel.
I will carry this play on stage at all costs.
What seems to be the least suspected of having committed a crime
is usually the most suspicious, the guilty one.
Hey, Father, it's an emergency.
(Kogoro) What happened to him, the little boy with the glasses?
(Kogoro) What?
He's disappeared?
