I feel so all in Secret Life!
An assassination attempt 20 years ago
The case of the murders aboard the Symphony
I didn't think so, he likes dolphins.
Dolphins?
You didn't take this boat because you saw the propaganda?
No!
I took it because I received a letter full of intrigue.
Full of intrigue?
Yes, a week ago.
Someone wanted to entrust me with a case and to go find it in Oogasabara.
Inside was already 10,000 yen to pay for my services.
100,000 yen?
Yes.
But they were old 10,000 yen bills,
and there was no return address.
And the name? The name yes: Masaru Furukawa.
Furukawa? What is it?
Do you know him?
The gentleman who invited us on this cruise is called Furukawa!
Wow, really?
I didn't know that.
The letter said that if I showed those tickets, they'd let me come.
So, he invited you as a detective.
I thought that when I saw him
he'd exchange the old bills for new ones and explain the case to me.
And since all the cases are interesting...
But what a coincidence, that we met, right?
I called you when I arrived at Haneda.
I wanted you in Kud... oh, in Mouri to accompany me,
but no one answered me.
We should have just left.
The important thing is that we found each other.
Oi, guys?
The wolves, with the wolves, and the detectives, with the detectives.
Oi, kiddo?
So, you're the missing detective.
-Gee, you're so young!
-Not that young!
So, what?
Have you found her, this Saiz Kano?
No, they're still looking for him, Miss.
Eh...
You want a light?
-Ah, yes.
Thank you very much, master. Ask me whenever you want.
Don't you want to play a game of poker in the living room?
And the cards?
That's no problem.
I have a new fight.
And you do not cheer up?
You have nothing else to do, right?
(Samezaki) -Have you seen it? (Kogoro) -No.
Not a trace.
Casum all... Where the hell did he go?
(Kogoro) -Crap... We only have one hour left.
Mouri... I'm not giving up!
We have to try until the last second!
This case, we have to solve it!
(Kogoro) Inspector Samezaki!
We're looking for him again!
Yes.
(Kogoro) You're right.
We have to look for her everywhere, Mouri!
Tatxaaaaaaaan!
I have a ful!
(Heiji) Wow!
You've won again!
Very good!
Let's have another game.
The last one leaves the place to Mr. Kujirai.
Excuse me... Could you tell me the time, please?
It's 5 minutes to 12 o'clock.
He's been worried about the time for a while now.
Is there anything wrong?
Tomorrow is a very important day for me.
Double pair of aces and new ones!
I'm last.
-Now it's your turn, Mr. Kujirai. -Okay.
You'll have to give me some fish.
So you say that tomorrow is a very important day...
Did someone dear die?
You're having a Bloody Mary, aren't you?
Do you know what they call this drink?
It's named after a beautiful princess who died.
Oh, did she?
I didn't know that.
Hey, Father!
Have you found her?
No, daughter.
Not a trace!
And Inspector Samezaki, where is he?
He wants to use up the time we have to find him.
Excuse me, can I get you something to drink, sir?
-A water, please.
-Okay. -Okay.
Well, I'll start to retire.
Good night, sir.
-I'm retiring too.
-So am I.
We'll put the letters in the box and take them to the cabin.
Ah, that's very kind of you.
Thank you.
-What do I owe you, please? -What do I owe you? -Cobri'm me, please. -You do me a favor.
Eh?

Like the wallet?
Is this it, sir?
Ah, yes it is!
Here it is.
I found it in the hallway.
No need to look, I didn't take anything.
Ah, no, it's not for nothing... I was just checking.
Eh?
Are you retiring too, Mr. Kujirai?
No, I'm not... I'm going to the washroom for a moment.
I'll be right back, okay?
Time's up.
It's too late to solve this case.
Besides, since I've been retired for two years, I can't do anything about it.
Inspector...
-Is it still open, my friend? -Yes, of course, sir. -Yes, of course, sir.
-I'll have a beer. Very good.
You've done your best, Inspector.
Mouri...
(Come on, let's drink, Mouri! (Kogoro) - Just like old times!
Today it's on me!
Don't you think they take it too much to heart?
(Kogoro) Back then... (gunshot)
What was it, this noise?
On the upper deck!
(Thinks) A feature!?
-Mouri!
What time is it? -It's 8 past 12!
The flag!
It burns the flag!
-What was that? -It was a noise like a rocket.
What, Kudo?
Do you think it was a diversion?
No.
Look at that, Hattori.
Eh?
What is it?
A 10,000 yen bill with a message!
Don't touch the knife, kid!
You don't have to tell me, I'm not that dumb!
Can you bring us a plastic bag, please?
Caram.
Do you always wear a pair of gloves?
Professionally trained.
What do you think, Inspector?
"Poseidon, the god of the sea, has taken my life...
and has brought my shadow back to life."
What have you got, Mr. Kujirai?!
It was alive!
It was alive!
I thought so.
That guy was alive!
He was alive!
He was alive!
-What's the matter?
-What was it?! -This?!
-Captain!
There's been an explosion! -Cut the engines!
Put out the fire!
What happened? An explosion at the stern!
Something is burning!
It's a box to store an emergency ladder.
(Think) "What is this?
It's a man!
There's a man burning!"
Wow... He's been charred.
We can't establish either identity or time of death.
Yes, it's a contradiction.
This corpse could be anyone, even Kano.
Without further investigation, we can't make any progress.
You mean it's not Mr. Kanie?
Look at this.
The watch he's wearing is pretty good.
When I asked him for the time at the bar,
it looked to me like he was wearing a gold watch like this.
Now that you mention it, even though it's pretty burned out,
this sweater looks like what he wore in Kanie.
(Kogoro) And the pants also look like his.
But why did they kill him?
(Kogoro) Poor guy.
(Kogoro) This is ridiculous.
Ri... ridiculous?
Look at him, look at the state he's in.
He's curled up with his arms outstretched,
like he's showing us the clock.
Ah, he's right.
This stiffness is caused by heat.
When a bone is burned, the muscles contract
and solidify due to the high temperature,
and they stay in this stiff state.
There are more muscles that contract the limbs
than there are muscles that extend them.
Thus, the joints shrink.
In other words, when a body burns, it stays in this position.
Is that so?
I didn't know that...
The problem, however, is the watch band.
What's wrong with the strap?
Look carefully.
It's not fastened properly.
(Kogoro) You notice a few things...
There's a can at your feet, isn't there?
The explosion must have been provoked
because the gasoline inside has ignited.
The explosion may have undone the strap of the watch.
Surely...
The explosion also blew the cover off the case.
A case?
Yes.
When we were searching Kano with the inspector,
we passed by here and the cover was in place.
And you looked what was inside the box, detective?
Well, look, look...
As the case was bound,
I thought there couldn't be anyone hiding.
Anyway, I'm sure there was no one there,
because when I came back into the room, Mr. Kanie was still there.
Hey, Mouri, who is he, this smart young man?
His name is Heiji Hattori.
He is the son of the police chief of Osaka Prefecture.
Ah!
The son of Heiss!
That's why he knows so much.

Do you know him, the Osaka police chief?
Of course he does!
When we were young we had practiced kendo together a lot.
He was too good, for me.
Hey, Hattori!
Have you noticed?
Look what a strange thing he has on his face.
A strange thing?
Is this... is this silicone?
That's right.
This is polydimethylsiloxà, better known as silicone.
The fire has deformed everything,
but it looks like he'd had a rhinoplasty operation.
He had changed his face with a cosmetic surgery operation!
Yes.
Undoubtedly.
Of it... We took this plastic to cover it up.
(Heiji) That he had changed his face...
Yes... It means that maybe he was one of the 4 robbers who fled after the 400 million yen heist.
after the 400 million yen robbery.
If this corpse is that of Mr. Kanie...
It is possible that Mr. Kameda, with whom he got along very well..,
is one of the robbers.
They treated each other as if they were two friends meeting again after a long time.
Possibly, the other robber...
must be Mr. Kujirai, who hasn't stopped sweating.
Surely.
When Mr. Kanie offered him the matches..,
he had a strange reaction.
What intrigues me is what he shouted when we discovered the dead man.
It was alive!
It was alive!
I thought so.
That guy was viiiiiiiu!
Surely it is related to what he had written on the ticket.
(Adult voice) He had written:
"Poseidon, the god of the sea, has taken my life
and has brought my shadow back to life."
"The shadow" must refer to the "shadow brain," in Saiz Kano.
And if he says "resurrect" it is because he was to be killed....
Maybe he was killed by the 3 men
that Saiz Kano hired to do the robbery.
And now that old man with the name of Saiz Kano has appeared.
It is possible that the old man got on the boat and disappeared.
But why did he have to gather the accomplices
on the day the statute of limitations expires?
And why did he need to publish that advertisement?
He published it in the press.
And who should it be, Masaru Furukawa, who in theory published the advertisement?
Such is the name of one of the 3.
Anyway, who holds the key to everything is Kujirai.
If we shake it, a lot of dust will come out.
(Samezaki) You don't remember?!
You said it on the deck!
"I thought so, that he was alive."
Did I say that?
I don't remember.
Don't run away from studying!
Do not want to play the clueless, now!
"That guy" meant Saiz Kano, right?
No... I don't know... I don't know anything.
I don't know anything!
Leave me alone!
We won't go out...
(Kogoro) Mr. Inspector!
I've already taken a statement from the ship's crew.
What have you got?
Well, so far everyone has an alibi.
When the explosion occurred,
the captain and crew were working, in groups of two.
When we heard that rocket-like noise,
we all went up on deck, and that's when the explosion happened.
The only thing that could have caused the fire
was the passenger who was not on top.
I mean, the only thing that didn't see anyone... in Saiz Kano, right?
There's no other passenger?
Yes, man, Mr. Kameda,
who went to his cabin to say he wasn't feeling well.
Well, now that you mention it...
Go get him right away to his cabin!
I'm coming too! So am I!
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait for me!
I'm coming too!
Very well.
Understood.
We continue on the same course.
Very well.
We continue on course for Oogasabara.
We're not turning back, captain?
No.
A helicopter will be here first thing tomorrow morning.
It will take us everything we need to complete the journey.
The Ministry of Defense will also send us a boat.
Now, the only thing we can do is trust the investigators.
Start the engines!
Speed, 20 knots!
-Engage engines!
-Engage engines!
Mr. Kameda!
Mr. Kameda, open up, please!
It's strange... Can you go get the master key?
Gee, it's open.
Mr. Kameda!
You're not feeling well?
Eh?
It's not...
We must call Inspector Samezaki right away!
Hattori, what... Eh?
Hey, where did they go?
Hattori!
Conan!
You found nothing?
Yes.
In the lower engine room.

A trail of blood on the floor, an empty cartridge....,
and this letter.
I also found a suspicious piece of paper.
And where did you find it?
In the toilet of the restaurant, in the wastebasket.
In the wastebasket?
So what?
How about, in your mystery letter?
"I'll wait for you in the engine room. Masaru Furukawa."
This Masaru Furukawa again.
Traces of blood and an empty cartridge.
It may have been a powder shot.
Surely it is a bullet cartridge!
That burned man, he must have been summoned here with the letter,
he's gone, they shot him and put him in the box.
Yes, he must have gone like that.
And the paper you found?
What do you think?
It looks to me like it's made on the same computer as your letter.
"See you at the stern. Masaru Furukawa."
It's proof that someone called in Kujirai to bring him down.
Why was it for Kujirai?
Because two crewmen have seen her.
A few minutes after 12 o'clock, she was at the stern
and shouted: "Hey, I'm here!".
When the crew members spoke to her, she got really scared.
Don't tell anyone that you saw me here!
Then, in Kujirai, he went back to the restaurant, where we were.
The two crew members stayed in the stern for a while, thinking that maybe someone else would show up.
thinking that maybe someone else would show up, but they didn't see anyone.
As they were leaving, they heard the gunshot on the upper deck.
At that moment, the emergency ladder box....
It was still not burning.
And they didn't see any automatic ignition device either.
So the assassin fired the shot on the deck
and lit the flag for everyone to go up,
and took advantage of it to go below and burn the box.
In this case, Kujirai's behavior would have a reason.
According to how he could have killed us.
What a horror.
The problem is to know how it is possible
that, after shooting on the upper deck,
the assassin went down without anyone seeing him.
Well, we have now discovered the killer's intentions.
All that remains is the problem of time.
Have you found it yet? Oh, boy.
You too, right?
Well, let's compare our answers!
First of all, the mysterious old man who calls himself Saiz Kano.
After he left the ship, no one has seen him come back.
Therefore, he is surely gone.
It was all just...
A set-up invented by the murderer!
A hoax! A hoax!
There are only two people left who could have committed the murder.
That's right!
What we have to look closely at is the corpse.
Her elbows are at the level of her face and her knees are bent.
It's proof that when she was put in the box,
she's been pushed down and both arms have been pulled upwards.
This could only have been done by an evildoer like that one!
To throw us off the scent.
He made it look as if he had been killed in order to continue hiding.
What?
What are you saying now?
What we have to look at is this watch!
This is the trap that has stopped us the murderer!
It is very strange.
It's been a long time since our deductions have coincided.
Yes.
Since we've known each other it's never happened before.
In any case, we're still investigating to see who's right.
Come on, let's see who wins!
Hey, wait a minute!
Ah, yes!
Set the clock right!
Do you want me to make a scorched clock work again?
No!
Put it back in its place.
Mr. Kameda wasn't in his cabin?!
Ah... No.
We looked for him, but...
Shrike!
How can people disappear so easily?!
Run away!
I'm coming!
You know what?
I'm going to look for him too.
Don't move from here.
We'll be right back.
No, sir!
You're a private detective and the other one, a retired inspector, right?
You have no right to leave us here alone and locked up.
But it's just that...
I'm sorry, I'm going to rest in the cabin.
-Me too.
-Me too.
Just a moment!
Just a moment!
You can't go by boat alone!
Don't worry.
Everyone knows how to take care of themselves.
-Right... gentlemen? -Yes...
(thinks) "It should be this way.
"If my deductions are correct,
there should be a place around here where someone can hide.
That's it!"
A good hiding place?
Yes.

a place where it is forbidden to enter, that cannot be seen.
AAAI!
Casum ronda!
There's a killer on board, and you're all alone!
Oysters!
And where is Hattori?
That hasn't been found?
Well!
We were wrong.
Both Kudo and I were wrong!
Captain, Captain!
We have 30 kilometers of free ships ahead of us!
Increase speed to maximum.
30 knots!
Increase speed to 30 knots!
(Think) "If so, who could it be?
Who is it, the killer?"
Didn't you feel as if something fell into the water?
Something in the water?
It must have been a pretty one jumping.
