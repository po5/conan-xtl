I'm already here! (Kogoro) What?!
Hey, Ran!
What do you mean, you're staying over at the institute tonight?
(Kogoro) I'm sorry.
It's just that the karate championship is coming up soon and we're really excited.
Since there's no school tomorrow,
we've decided that we're going to sleep over here.
That way we can train.
The teacher just gave us permission.
Yes, man!
And what do you think we should have for dinner, us?
I'm about to faint from hunger!
"Unload the Poirot and have them make you something."
What? "And tomorrow for breakfast too."
Just a moment! "I'll be back tomorrow at noon."
"Take care of me at Conan, okay?"
(Tuuut)
-E-ei!
D-don't hang up!
Hm? - (tut, tut, tut)
La Ran won't come, she says we're going to the Poirot.
We'll end up buying convenience food at the supermarket, I can see it coming.
(tut, tut, tut) What?
It turns out that today the Poirot...
Ay, ay, ay!
Eeei!
Hm?
No!
No, no, no, no!
Oh, it's true,
the owner of the Poirot has gone on a trip to a health resort
with the neighborhood association.
Oh, gee...
Hey, hey, hey!
I got it!
We're going to the Iroha Zushi!
They're closed too, these?
I'm sure they're at the spa.
Almost all the restaurants are closed.
What?
Eeh?!
Oysters!
All the restaurants have the shutters down!
(Guts: rrrr)
And we won't be able to ask them to take it home either.
I have taken the advertisement left in the mailbox just in case.
They are food stalls.
Who wants to look at it?
Hmm?
Is there one that looks good?
Colosseo, this is a pizzeria.
Tsubo-uchi, pork in batter.
Kondo, Hiroshima-style omelets.
I don't feel like any of this.
Hmm...
Oh!
This one falls a bit far, but it might be good, right?
Which one?

"Noodles so good they kill (part one)."
It-it looks like a lifelong restaurant, doesn't it?
In the advertisement photo it looked much cooler.
Do you want us to look for another place?
You idiot!
These kind of late-night places are usually the best.
They're good and they're always full.
Besides, with the cold weather I could really use some warm noodles.
A-a-a-a-aaatxum!
Blow!
I've already caught a cold.
Yes, you have.
Hello, welcome.
Eh?
Brrr... It's cold!
-It's cold, eh? -Oh, so much!
(He thinks) "So they are always full..."
Excuse me, sir.
This stool is reserved.
Hm?
It's the place of a regular customer.
Oh, is it?
As a matter of fact,
"Was" one of our best customers until he died last month.
But I've decided to continue to reserve the stool for him
until the 49 days of mourning are over.
-Yeah, sure, no problem. -Sorry.
"And that's why there's a vase of flowers on the table, I imagine."
(Door, open) Hm?
Oops, a customer.
Two customers!
(Door, open) Ha!
I won the bet again, Sayo.
Wow!
Not much I collect, and I'm still losing money.
You could forgive me, couldn't you?
Come on, take the water to these gentlemen.
Yes.
What bet?
I'm very intrigued.
Yes, look,
I said we'd get to 10 clients today, and she said we wouldn't.
Ah.
He-he!
"You're about to close and you've only had 10 customers all day,
including us?"
-What would you like, gentlemen? -What do you recommend?
Good question!
Our signature dish is so good it kills.

The God of Death noodles!
And we also have miso soup noodles, cold noodles....
If you prefer something other than the....
God of Death noodles, we'll serve that too, of course!
He-he...
Well, I'll... I'll have the God of Death noodles.
Me... me too.
(Sayo) Two "Gods of Death"!
(Man) Right away!
"As... How cold! Mr. Mouri was right."
"Noodles are in the mood, now."
Hey, you!
What are you doing here?
Get out of here!
We've got nothing here for rats like you!
Well, well.
Do you think this is any way to talk to a customer?
Look how you have the restaurant, sad and empty as always.
I just came to try to cheer up your business a little.
If we don't have more customers it's because of you and your bouncers,
who always come looking for a fight to scare the customers!
I'm sorry, they are savages with the brains of mosquitoes.
But, I've already paid for the dishes my boys broke,
so you can't complain.
That's not the problem!
And, besides, I gave them a good slap on the wrist.
I told them that they should have
they should have beaten up the owner.
-What's wrong with you? -Ha!
Come on, man, it was a joke.
What are we having for dinner today? Ah... This stool...
Oh!
Wow, that's serious! Eh?
-It's been knocked over. -Oh!
Eixuga'm the table, you feel?
You have expressly knocked it over.
Dry it yourself.
Ha.
How unprofessional!
Who would think of putting a vase of half-wilted flowers on the table?
-What do you want for dinner? -What do you want for dinner?
Ah...
If you don't want anything, you'd better leave.
Right away!
Eh... Yes.
I want some of those noodles that are so good they kill.
So?
You haven't made any decisions yet, Chef Ogura?
Oh, of course I have.
I don't plan to sell the business.
The other day there was a meeting of the Haido Street merchants
and we agreed to stand together.
Ignorance is the mother of bliss.
Don't you realize that your own neighbors are making you a vacuum?
What?
Before coming to dinner,
I went to get a haircut at Taninaka, the barber shop next door,
the barber shop next door, and the owner also criticized you.
He says that your restaurant is too stale.
He says your restaurant is too stale
and out of place in such a commercial street.
-He would like you to n'anessis. -Really?
This is what he said?
- (door, open) - (man) I didn't say that, did I!
Hm?
I only said that, if you did a couple of reforms,
maybe the business would do a lot better.
This restaurant and my barbershop opened 20 years ago.
I've done renovations 3 times,
while this place is exactly the same.
Y-you're right.
The truth is that it would be time to do some work,
but we're always up to our necks in water.
I know what you mean.
This speculator just wants to spoil the good relationship
that exists between the merchants of the street, that we are very well agreed.
Prrf!
Oh, by the way.
Give me some God of Death.
Right away.
Here you are.
Bon appetit, gentlemen.
Some God of Death noodles.
Hum?
That's funny!
The bamboo shoots are piled up!
"I get it. It's a reference to the name of the dish."
Eh?
About it... And the sticks?
Excuse me, sir.
What about the canes?
Eh?
-Catch these. -Ah, thank you.
Okay.
Let's see what they tell me about the noodles.
Eh...?
Yes.
Let's go, then.
Bon appetit.
He-he...
Bon appetit.
Hm.
Hm.
Hm.
So good! So good!
They are the best I have ever eaten!
And me! I told you, me.
Especially the bamboo shoots, right? Yes, yes!
That's what gives them that delicious flavor.
The recipe is a professional secret, of course.
I assure you...
you could eat it every day without getting tired of it.
Thank you for your compliance.
Next time we'll invite Ran, the doctor and the others.
The restaurant is bland, but it has a star dish.
I see you won't be closing as soon as you'd like.
No.
Our motto is: "Cheap, fast and good".
We will continue to cope.
Ha!
I'm happy for you.
My company is falling apart all over the place.
Sometimes I just want to die.
And why don't you just pull down the shutters for good
and dedicate yourself to another more honest business?
Ha-ha!
Things are not so easy in this world.
That's funny!

Left-handed, sir?
Hm?
Yes.
It's just that you used to wipe the water off the table with your right hand, right?
My parents used to correct me when I was little, that's why I'm ambidextrous now.
Ah.
But I usually use my left hand to eat.
I have a hard time with my right hand.
Noodles so good they kill, right?
If it were true and this bowl of noodles could kill,
this business couldn't last two more days.
-Hm? -Hm?
Hm?
What if... I poisoned the noodles?
That's the end of it!
I'm tired of hearing it.
Enough ruminating nonsense!
Eh?
Grrrr!
Au!
We're going out on the street.
I'll tell you four things well said.
Please, sir!
Eh?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Didn't you hear me?
Eh!
Aaaagh!
E-ey...!
Aaah...!
Aaaahg...!
A-an ambulance!
Hurry, call an ambulance!
Eager s!
(Y-yes!
(Sayo) Oh!
We'll be right back.
You idiot!
Do you think we'll swallow it again?
(Sayo) What? W-Wait a minute, what are you talking about?
Ah... I know you guys, your traps.
You make it look like you've fainted
so they'll think you've had food poisoning.
What's that?
Give me a hand, Taninaka.
We'll take him outside and he'll wake up right away, you'll see.
Yes. Nobody touch him!
What? Try not to touch anything.
In fact, it's best if everyone stays where they were.
Hm?
And you, as well as the ambulance, call the police.
The police?
If I'm not mistaken this man is already dead.
-What?! - What?
What?
Noodles so good they kill, right?
So this man was eating a bowl of noodles,
passed out and died.
Yes.
Actually, the noodles were really good,
but I didn't know they really kill.
Don't be an ass!
Food doesn't kill just because it's too good.
He-he!
Of course it does.
So... what's the victim's name?
"Tokumori Saizu, 51 years old.
President and CEO of a real estate company in the Haido district."
It looks like he intended to buy the premises on this street.
Apparently,
He wanted to tear them down and build a big shopping mall.
The shopkeepers were fed up with his shoddy practices.
Hm... So they had a grudge against him.
Yes.
The neighbors say that, from time to time,
his employees would come looking for a fight to scare away the customers
and shake up the business.
(Ogura) Yes. Hm?
Every time they came,
they would provoke one of my customers and end up fighting.
I don't know how many bowls of noodles they must have broken.
They did the same thing to your place, didn't they, Taninaka?
Y-yes.
While I was shaving them,
they'd make a sudden motion for me to give them a cut
and they were screaming for me to pay the doctor's bill.
And what happened today?
Mr. Saizu said that, before coming to the restaurant, he had gone to get a haircut in the restaurant,
he had gone to get a haircut at your barbershop, right?
Yes.
Everything went well today.
Hm... So, he was a speculator.
Yes.
His practices were so extreme
that the traders had agreed to sue him,
but his lawyer died last month and it all came to nothing.
-He didn't die! -Hm?
He was murdered!
My father tried to stop a fight
that had started while he was eating noodles.
He had a chronic illness.
He had a seizure and died in the hospital.
Your father?
So, you're the lawyer's daughter?
Yes.
I've known her since she was a little girl
and her father took her to my restaurant to eat noodles.
He said that when she grew up, she wanted to open her own restaurant,
but I never imagined she'd want to work here
and would come and ask me for a job later on.
By the way, she said her father was sick?
He was hypertensive!
He had a brain hemorrhage.
According to the doctors,
he died because he got too excited when he tried to stop the fight.
B-but don't they say you can't eat noodles if you have high blood pressure?
The father took pills to keep his blood pressure in check,
and the doctor had told him he could eat noodles
as long as he didn't drink the broth.
Oh, right.
I get it.
The victim died of poisoning, right?
Y-yes.
The coroner's report says she ingested hydrogen cyanide,
probably while eating the noodles.

Therefore, we have 3 persons who were on the premises at the time of the facts?
who have sufficient motive to have committed the crime
and who have had the opportunity to kill the victim.
What a ?
-What are you getting at? -You can't be serious!
Are you insinuating that my noodles were poisoned?
This is what we have to investigate.
First, the three of you will have to submit to a search...
and, when we're done, you'll wait in the street while we figure out what happened.
B-but... why are the three of us the only suspects?
How? There's no one else, is there?
Just before his death,
this gentleman stapled Mr. Saizu by the neck and booed him!
-Who?
Me? -Yes, he's right.
Is this true?
Eh... Yes.
It's just that he kept talking nonsense, and I thought I'd give him a good hiding.
Well, you'll be slagged off, too, and you'll have to wait in the street!
(Kogoro) Y-yes, sir!
A-a-and... Gee, it's cold!
I don't understand why they sent us out in the street when it's so cold.
Mr. Mouri, do you know how to prepare noodles?
Do I?
You should ask the expert, he'll explain it to you.
Hum... It's that...
Yes, of course.
If he's the one who poisoned the noodles while cooking,
I doubt he'd want to explain it to you.
Let's see...
From what I've seen on TV,
what they do when the order arrives is to boil the noodles.
In the meantime, they add the sauce and other seasonings to the bowl.
And... and then, well....
(Ogura)... then we pour in the broth.
(Ogura) What? (Ogura) Oh.
Once the noodles are drained, we add them to the bowl and put in the pork,
the egg, bamboo and onion.
And we have the dish ready.
Well, in our case it's the Sayo who's in charge of the garnish, right?
What?
Y-yes.
If I understand correctly, this means that both you and her...
could have put the poison on the plate at any time.
Y-yes, we could put it that way.
But we didn't poison Mr. Saizu!
Really?
-Of course not! -Yes, we did.
Listen, listen, sir.
W-what?
You and Mr. Saizu often met at the restaurant?
Well... Yes.
Well, from time to time.
So, do you know if there was anything that you liked very much...
that you used to eat before you tried noodles?
Such as bamboo shoots or hard-boiled egg?
I don't know, I never really noticed.
And do you remember if you had any mania or habit when it came to eating?
"Mania"?
If I had the habit of touching something before eating,
it would have been very easy to put the poison in.
W-why are you asking me, all this?
I'm asking you because you are the only one who has not approached Mr. Saizu
or touched his plate at any time.
Y-you're right.
It was you who were sitting next to him.
Yes.
In fact, the closest you've ever been to the victim...
was when he passed us the can of canes,
but Mr. Saizu didn't use them.
N-no.
Gee, come to think of it,
why would the cane jar we had in front of us be empty?
(Sayo) So that a customer had knocked it over
and the canes had been scattered on the floor.
(Sayo) What?
And before I had time to refill the canister, there you are.
The customer was one of Saizu's henchmen, of course.
But we made him pay for all the canes.
Are you the one who's in charge of refilling the cane jar?
Is that so?
Yes, it's my job.
But the canes that man used, I didn't touch them.
That stool was reserved for us by the father.
and we didn't normally let anyone sit on it.
So the regular client who died last month was?
Yes, he was the lawyer who represented us.
Well, Mr. Saizu sat on the lawyer's stool.
Did he always do the same thing? Yes, every time he came.
He knew it was the lawyer's stool
and he did it expressly to annoy us.
"Therefore, the murderer could have foreseen...
that Mr. Saizu would sit on that stool."
"So..."
Aah...
"...the murderer is one of the three persons
who were in the restaurant at the time."
"But who?"

Hey, wait a minute! Eh?
Although I have to ask...
Oh!
(Kogoro voice) Mr. Saizu was manipulated.
He has impregnated his fingers with poison and put it in his mouth.
Just as expected by the killer hiding among us.
