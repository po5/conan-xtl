The truth of the car explosion case, part 1.
Here we are.
What are you looking at with such interest, Father?
I'm not.
I was just remembering old times.
You remember old times?
You may never have seen it because you were too young,
but there used to be a bulletin board on the benches.
There were ads of all kinds, to adopt animals or whatever.
Once there was one for tutoring.
I was tutoring, Kogoro?
Really?
Gee, I didn't know that! I really didn't.
When I married your mother, we were students,
and we had to do whatever it took to get by.
You didn't have it easy.
You mean it wasn't her students who had it worse?
Maybe they were.
What are you laughing at?
I was good, playing the teacher.
A student I had for 3 years
got his law degree with an excellent record!
By the way, he lived here in Beika!
Follow me!
I'll introduce you to Megumi!
Eh?
Megumi?
What's a girl?
This Megumi is a girl?
(Thinking) Ay, ay, ay...
(Kogoro) Ah, so many memories!
It's been a long time since I've been here, but hardly anything has changed.
It's been a long time since you've seen this girl?
Well... (Kogoro) Megumi's father was a lawyer.
At the end of class, he always invited me to drink beer.
(Think) That's why she lasted 3 years.
(Horns honking)
Where, this car?!
Hey, hey!
Watch out, Conan!
What's he think, going so fast through these streets?!
You animal!
It's just around the corner, just where the tobacconist is.
He didn't get married and no longer lives with his parents?
Maybe she does.
But she might also be single.
You seem to me to have some strange ideas...
You fool!
I'm coming with you!
Oh!
Oh!
It's her!
Megumi!
Professor Mouri!
Long time no see!
Ah!
Just a moment, Professor!
Very well, then.
Pull, pull...
Hiromi...
Watch out!
Aaah!
-Hiromi is inside! -What?
The Hiromi?
(Think) There!
Fire extinguisher!
Door!
I'll do it!
Hiromi!
I know that the accident has been a very hard blow for you,
but I should ask you some questions.
May I?
Yes.
It says Megumi Sakihara.
That's right, isn't it?
Yes.
That is correct.
The person inside the car that was blown up
was her sister, Hiromi Tanaka.
Is that correct?
Yes.
That is correct.
In the car were the remains of a powerful explosives charge.
Explosives?!
(Thinking) Wow.
The device and the explosives were stuck under the bodywork.
They must have been rigged to explode so the wheels would turn.
The car exploded after it started backing up.
Ma'am, I can imagine how you feel, but we should move on.
The house where the accident occurred was your parents' house?
Yes.
They died in a car accident six months ago.
They both died?
Yes.
My sister was living at home alone since the accident.
The car was your sister's?
No, it was my car.
It was her?
Today I had gone from Nishitama to Beika with the car.
(Sakihara) "As my sister had her garage,
the garage was empty and I parked.
As I'm afraid of backing out, she..."
she told me that she would take it out for me.
So, in the car, you should have gone, right, Mrs. Sakihara?
Ah... Yes.
So, the perpetrator of the crime has the wrong victim.
I don't know!
I don't understand what happened.
Megumi...

Ma'am, what time did you leave your home in Nishitama?
It would be... a little before two o'clock.
Did you notice anything strange in the car?
No.
What time did you arrive at the house? Around 5:30 at 3:30.
The explosion was almost 3 o'clock, inspector.
So, the explosives were placed under the car...
during this half hour.
Do you have any idea who it might have been?
Someone who had a grievance against you?
No, just...
Just?
About a week ago, in a supermarket near my house,
a stranger was following me all the time.
A stranger was following you?
I pretended not to notice, but it gave me a bad feeling.
Do you remember his face? Yes.
It was a special kind of face...
Very good.
Now we have an agent coming in who specializes in making portraits.
Please describe her as best you can.
Oh... Seeing us meet again under these circumstances...
It's a pity, girl.
Professor Mouri, I know you have become a famous detective.
I used to brag to my friends that I had become a professor.
Ah, well...
I assure you that I will find out who did this to poor Hiromi!
Thank you very much, professor.
Leave it to me!
So, this girl had been a student of yours.
You must have known the sister too, then.
Yes.
At that time she still went to school.
She often brought us tea and cakes for snacks.
(Mouri) "They were very different."
"Megumi was very quiet and sweet."
"Hiromi was very open."
She always joked and had many friends.
It seems they haven't changed.
After finishing her degree,
Megumi worked in an investment company
and soon married a co-worker.
They have no children and she is a housewife.
Hiromi, on the other hand, has only a bachelor's degree
and went to work in temporary jobs.
She was 30 years old and continued to depend on her parents.
Investigating Hiromi's life will take more work.
Inspector Megure, we already have the sketch.
Ah... Thank you very much.
Hey, I want to see it!
Eh?
This guy...
Don't you think he looks like him?
Yes, the one who was in that car we met before.
He was wearing sunglasses,
but the hair and the chin are the same.
Now that you mention it... He does look like him!
What time did you see him?
10 minutes before we arrived at Megumi's house.
About 500 meters from the house.
He may have fled after placing the explosives in the car.
Do you know the model and license plate number?
About it...
It was a red RV with Shinjuku plates.
Okay, we'll try to find it.
We'll try to find it.
Excuse me.
Megumi... my wife... How is she?
How is she? Excuse me, sir...
You must be at Kazuo Sakihara, right?
Yes.
The police told me my wife's car exploded.
How are you?
Don't worry.
Your wife is fine.
I'm sorry, sir.
Your wife's sister is dead.
Eh?
The Hiromi?!
Ah... this... How is it?
The explosive charge was your wife's car,
but he was carrying Miss Hiromi.
Mr. Sakihara, have you ever seen this sketch man?
You have, haven't you?
No, I haven't... I have never.
If you'll excuse me.
What strange behavior.
Inspector Megure!
Eh?
They've finished the inspection of the accident site.
How did it go, with the sketch?
That's him.
En Mouri saw him near the house driving a car.
This will help us!
Eh?
Wow, this guy...
What's up, Takagi?
I think I saw him in Inspector Sato's case data.
Inspector Sato works in Shinjuku, right?
Yes.
I saw the photograph in passing,
but he looks like the husband of the victim in that case.
Let's go!
Take the sketch and call Inspector Sato.
Okay, okay, okay!
Yes, it does look like him.
I'm sure it's the same person.
No doubt about it, Inspector.
It matches the description.
He's the husband of the woman who was stabbed yesterday afternoon.
His name is Hiromasa Takahashi, he's 33 years old,
and works for a chemical company.
This is his wife, the victim, Sachiko Takahashi, 27.
Preliminary findings of the investigation lead us to assume
that it was a murder committed in the middle of the street.
But she had taken out a very high life insurance policy.

The husband, who is in debt, is suspicious.
Well, well.
Takahashi's car is a red RV with Shinjuku plates?
Yes!
Why do you say so? What?
So, it's almost certain that the man we saw was in Takahashi.
Working at a chemical company,
he can easily obtain explosives.
A murder on the street and one with explosives are different.
How are they related?
In the Takahashi case, there is no common name with today's case.
But this can't be just coincidence.
(Think) There is another possibility.
Hey, Inspector Takagi!
What a nice sticker!
Will you exchange it for this one?
Ah, no, Conan.
This is no ordinary sticker.
Change-me!
Change-me!
Conan!
Stop it!
Didn't he tell you he can't change it?
Change?
I got it, Mr. Inspector!
It's an exchange of murders!
An exchange of murders?
Of course it's an exchange of murders!
If so, the two cases could be related!
It means that Kazuo Sakihara and Hiromasa Takahashi
made a pact to exchange the killed.
First, in Sakihara he killed Sachiko, Takahashi's wife,
and Takahashi has tried to kill Sakihara's wife Megumi.
Mmm... Well, well.
Remember when you have seen Takahashi's portrait in the hospital,
Sakihara stood still.
This shows that you knew that in Takahashi was the murderer.
But why in Sakihara did he want to kill Megumi?
We can imagine it from what he said
when he heard that his sister-in-law had died.
Hiromi?
The reaction shows that they were not just brothers-in-law.
Very good!
We should investigate along these lines!
OK!
It's Mr. Takahashi, isn't it?
Where, so fast, master?
Is someone waiting for you?
Wait!
You're under arrest in the name of the law!
Shit!
Inspector, there are explosives in the bag!
-All right, we've got it, Takagi!
We got him, Takagi!
After seeing the portrait,
Sakihara called Takahashi to tell him to run away,
but they made it easier for us.
Both of them finally confessed.
(Megure) "In Sakihara has admitted that he killed Takahashi's wife.
"It was he who proposed the plan of the murder exchange."
"They never saw each other again,
and only communicated by phone."
To avoid leaving evidence, they called from pay phones.
(Megure) In Sakihara has a personal line in his home office.
He received the calls on this line.
That's why the Megumi didn't suspect anything.
What was her motive to kill the Megumi, in Sakihara?
Just as you thought, she had a very close relationship
with Hiromi, the Megumi's sister.
(Megure) "The Hiromi wanted to open a clothing store
and he wanted to get money by killing the woman."
If the Megumi died,
he would keep the inheritance money
and the life insurance, which was a lot of money.
How strong!
Poor Megumi!
Does she know that, Inspector?
Yes.
At first she didn't want to believe it,
but when she saw it, she began to cry inconsolably.
She realized that, although she had taken no part in the crime,
her sister had betrayed her.
In a few days we'll go see him to cheer her up.
Good idea.
Well, be that as it may, the case is solved, my friends.
Your friendship goes back a long way.
Take him aside.
Yes, I will.
Don't suffer.
I'll come by another day. Goodbye, Ran.
Thanks for everything.
(Thinking) "I'm not so sure the case is solved."
"It seems to me...
I think we're missing something."
Father!
Father!
We're meeting Megumi at one o'clock!
Look at this!
It's still more than an hour away!
Why don't we stop for coffee?
(Think) It must be the supermarket where the Megumi saw Takahashi.
Conan!
Don't dawdle!
I'm coming!
Father, isn't that Megumi?
What's that?
The Megumi?
Eh!
Megumi!
Hey, Megumi!
EEEE!
She's gone.
Conan!
Where are you going?
(Thinking) "Backing out with little room and in such a hurry...?
"Surely the Megumi...
(Megumi) "Since I'm afraid of backing out, she...
My sister told me that she would take it out for me."
"The way she went out, it doesn't look like she can go in reverse." (Think)

"How come the Megumi made the Hiromi take the car away?"
"That the one who dies in the explosion was Hiromi?
maybe it wasn't a coincidence."
"If the Megumi had known everything...
"This case is not closed!"

What does the Megumi have to do with her sister's death?
You know the Megumi who went to high school,
but there is also the possibility that she has changed.
She hasn't changed!
She's the same as before!
Stop it!
This is what you want to think.
But you know I'm right.

In the next one we will understand adult relationships.
Get ready for love and for deductions!
