(Off) "What makes people find each other? It's an enigma.
"But in Osaka, the old Naniwa is more enigmatic.
"Today we have a special episode full of cases that happen to Naniwa.
He has the brain of an adult and he's...Detective Conan!"

DETECTIVE CONAN
(Male) This is the crime of Attoyunaka City.
Next, what happened in Hirakata.
We don't have any witnesses of these two murdered,
and the scene is dozens of kilometers away from each other.
We are now trying to clarify the relationship between the two victims.
Only one thing is clear to us...
the manner in which the crime was committed!
For both of them, the dagger goes through the wallet in their pockets
and into the heart.
Has it been disclosed to the media?
Nothing has been said about the detail of the wallet.
The second murder is not the work of a madman who wanted to imitate the first one.
who wanted to imitate the first one.
It is not a copycat murder.
They are the work of the same evildoer.
Serial murders.
If he murders indiscriminately, it will raise quite a ruckus.
Toyama, be careful not to make any false moves.
Yes, okay, sir.
The Naniwa Serial Murder Case
(Heiji) This is Tennoji Zoo!
That's the Osaka Dome!
Look!
Here we are!
Tsutenkaku Tower!
Do you like it?
Osaka is a great place!
Yes!
What a nice view!
You can count!
It's the same as Tokyo Tower!
Don't compare it with that lousy tower!
Tsutenkaku Tower makes it clear that Osaka people have better taste!
Blow, it's like Tokyo's popular neighborhoods!
-We could go by for food... They will soon come to pick us up.
What a remedy, I'll make a cigarette...
(Adult voice) Hattori...
Why did you ask me to come to Osaka?
You misguided person!
Did you imagine I was going this way?
At some doors on my head.
The real reason.
This time we're going to let ourselves be busy!
For once, I wanted you to come to show you what Osaka is like!
You never know when death will surprise us.
What's this all about?
I had a disturbing dream.
A dream?
Yes.
When I'm about to stop a murderer,
I dream that the murderer apunyala me.
I dreamed that the Palmar!
Apa!
Do not kill me before my time, man!
Well, you heard him.
We're going to have a great time in Osaka.
Heiji!
Heiji, excuse me!
Oh!
You've finally arrived!
I'm in Sakata, from Tojiri Police Station.
I've been entertained and...
What?
An inspector?
It's that the father said:
"Since Mr. Mouri is coming, we'll guide him properly!"
And the father, what's wrong with him?
He told me he's coming.
He's busy with the meeting for that case.
(He thinks) That case?
Was he able to get that piece of car?
Of course he did!
Just like you asked me to, I've sneaked the best car we have.
Hey.
Don't tell me we're going by limo.
Aw, come on.
This one will be top of the line!
What a great patrol car!
With this great car they'll give us a free ride!
Where do you gentlemen want to start?
Hey, kid...
Will you take us sightseeing in this damn car?!
You don't like it?
It's a new car!
Ah!
I get it!
Do you want us to sound the siren?
Do you want us to press harder on the accelerator?
Eh, no... I wasn't going that way.
It's as if we were being detained, I'm a little embarrassed...
Relax, he didn't do anything, and besides, it's great to be seen!
This is a great noodle restaurant!
The soup is smooth.
What do you think?
Wow!
It's true!
It tastes light!
Delicious!
(Think) It has no taste.
Hey, Heiji!
What are you doing with this one?
Is it the new one?
Ah, you think so?
She's confused!
I've come all the way from Tokyo, I'm just...
What's the matter? A shiver...
Come on, you want to go?
Let me think... After noodles, the most famous...
These pop fritters are great.
They're finger-licking good!
They don't usually put fat pieces of pop!

What's the matter?
It's just that... I've been feeling like someone's watching me for a while...
Don't think about these things and eat!
With you guys I can't neglect myself even for a moment!
You weren't on a diet, Ran?
(Heiji) You want okonomiyaki?
You could have told me that before!
I know a good restaurant that do, but it is north!
In Osaka there are a lot of one-way streets
and you can end up going around in circles!
I'll take you to a restaurant over there.
Great!
There was a restaurant nearby!
I'm going to call my mother.
Master, don't forget the rice!
You eat okonomiyaki with rice?
It's the most normal thing to do.
Okonomiyaki is a snack, right?
If you mix the sauce with the rice, it's even better!
Osaka is a lot of fun!
Isn't it?
Ah!
A friend of yours...
Your name is Kudo, right?
In Heiji he always tells me lots and lots of things... about you.
At... at Hattori?
Don't do comedy!
I know absolutely everything about you!
Ah... Wait, wait, wait!
So it's you!
You're the "Kudo", the shameless one who seduced Heiji!
I think you're wrong.
I have only one thing to tell you, beautiful!
In Heiji and I have long been bound together with steel handcuffs.
If you dare to tie yourself in Heiji,
you'll have to step over my corpse!
Geez, Kazuha!
What are you doing here?
You're having a laugh with this one!
I told you Kudo is a man!
An it me!
She's the girlfriend of that Kudo!
Girlfriend?
No.
That's not true!
-She says No. -Yes, look how red she gets!
Why didn't you ask Kudo to come?
Bleda.
In Kudo is... Xxxxxt!
I didn't have it good for coming.
Tell us what was that "steel handcuffs" thing back then!
Ah, when I was a kid, in the attic of my house...
(Off) "We found some old handcuffs that the father used to use.
We started playing and couldn't get them off."
What a mess.
It's a stupid story.
It's not a stupid story!
Because we had to bathe together.
You donkey!
You talk too much!
(Thinks) Bathe together?
(Think) A couple bonded by the stench.
I got a piece of chain from the handcuffs.
The duke in this amulet.
What bad taste!
Throw this filth away!
But, you two go out together?
No, I won't!
Heiji and I are just childhood friends!
I'm like a big sister to him.
And what else?
His father is the chief inspector of the Osaka police department.
He's my father's best friend since they were kids.
A bearded detective and a friend who's the daughter of an inspector...
A couple of bad averany.
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that?
Hey, how come you're here, you?
I play the role of big sister,
and I keep an eye on you to prevent some weird girl from Tokyo from seducing you.
You were watching us?
Since when?
Since Tsutenkaku Tower.
(Thinking) "Of course!
So that look from before, it was this girl's."
I was really worried!
Thank you for food!
Ah, I've had enough, like a bad beast!
Thank you for waiting for us.
Inspector, you could have come.
No, I'm in charge of doing the honors.
Where do you want to go now?
There's only Osaka Castle left.
Why the hell did you go up there, you?!
What's wrong with you?!
You'll take me, won't you?!
You're a pain in the ass.
What's the matter?
What happened to this man?
I have no idea!
He fell from the roof of this building.
Someone's here!
Mr. Sakata, call the police, please!
E... Wait!
Heiji!
Conan!
Start confessing!
Why did you drop a corpse on top of a police car?
No... no, you're wrong, I just...
(Kogoro) You were told to go on the rooftop?
Someone called this gentleman
and told him there was a strange man on the roof.
On the second floor, I have a tea tasting store.
How come at that time the corpse fell?
I think they tied the body with a rope,
covered it with plastic
and left the end of the rope attached to the rooftop door,
because when they opened it the rope would come loose!
The approximate time of death was 5pm yesterday afternoon.
Afterwards, he was left hanging.
But why on top of the patrol car?
It may have been a coincidence,

but if it was intentional,
it could be because someone wanted it to serve as a warning.
A warning, you say?
Yes.
Stabbed in the chest with his wallet stabbed through...
It's like the other crimes...
Hey, lady!
Wait, wait a second!
Ah... he got away from us!
(Adult voice) It doesn't matter, I got the license plate.
But first tell me about it, Hattori.
What are they, the "other crimes" you were telling us about now?
(Kogoro) Serial murders?!
The man who fell to us was the third victim?
That's right!
The knife had pierced through everyone's wallet by stabbing the chest.
And before stabbing them, he had strangled them.
He may be resentful over a question of money.
We cannot say that this is the reason.
The first murder was Hidetoshi Nagao, a shopkeeper.
Next, Tayo Nishiguchi, who owned a liquor store.
And finally, the man who has fallen, Kazuto Noyasu, and he was a cab driver.
They are not rich enough to arouse anyone's envy for this reason.
There is no link connecting these three.
They have no relationship?
Neither by birth, nor by attending the same school?
They worked in Osaka, but in very different places.
Heiji!
I've found a point linking the victims!
Did you really?
-Mr. Goshi, a comment! -Mr. Goshi! -Mr. Goshi!
Gee, this?
It's a filming 6 years ago,
when Sotar Goshi, head of the prefecture, was a suspect.
He took responsibility for everything and was dismissed.
In that case there were many obscure points.
The secretary's name was Nagao?
Uh, isn't Nagao...?
Yes.
The one who was killed first, Hidetoshi Nagao.
But, we hadn't consulted about this?
Why did you say it so late?
Well, I wanted you to look at the chauffeur.
The chauffeur?
Ah, but this one...
Isn't it in Noyasu, the third murder?
Until 4 years ago, he was Prefect Goshi's chauffeur.
The former secretary and the former chauffeur.
It's possible that this is related to the Goshi case.
My superiors have sent some agents
to the location of former Prefect Goshi.
This Goshi is known for his contempt for the police!
Just for the sake of meeting them, he won't give in.
Come on, Mr. Sakata, we'll go too, shall we?
This should be left to the police.
You think I'm going to let the murderer
who's killed your sightseeing tour?
Kazuha, call my house and tell them everything's fine!
Heiji, do you have the lucky charm?
Yes, I'm wearing it.
Don't worry about it!
I'll see you later!
The lucky charm?
Yes, the amulet I gave him.
So far it's always protected him from danger.
What an exaggeration.
It's not true!
One day when he wasn't wearing the amulet, he got hurt in a kendo tournament.
There are only two amulets like this one.
Two?
Yes, I explained it to you before.
The handcuffs that united us.
On the sly, I put another piece on Heiji's amulet.
Well... in fact, you don't have to do anything!
Yeah, you're right.
By the way, I haven't seen that little boy for a while.
Maybe he went to the toilet.
I thought so, we can't go with the patrol car.
I'm sorry, Mr. Sakata.
Now you'll have to write a report.
I'm used to it.
-What's this?
What a panxa. Ah, that.
This nano is most useful!
Yes!
Mr. Mouri will be worried.
It's all right, we'll call him back.
By the way, we have found out the address
and phone number of the suspect from the license plate.
Her name is Sumie Okazaki and she is 39 years old.
She got divorced last year.
She lives alone in an apartment in the Seito building.
Why don't we go?
Why don't we?
She seemed to know something.
I'll call her to see if she's home!
(TV) "Today, at one o'clock in the afternoon,
a corpse fell into the void at Shinsaibashi.
The deceased was Mr. Kazuto Noyasu, 41 years old..."
Forgive me... forgive me... forgive me...
(Telephone)
(Woman) Yes?
Is this Mrs. Okazaki's address?
This is Inspector Yusuke Sakata, Osaka Police Station.
Inspector!
Please come at once and protect me!
If you don't do something quickly, I'll be assassinated!
I will explain to everyone what happened!
Please calm down for now.
We'll be right back.

Lock the door!
No!
We have passed the building!
What do we do now?
What do we do now?
The street is full and it will take us a long time!
We'll get there faster!
Stop, please!
But what do you want?!
Imbeciles!
Ah!
Excuse me!
Hey, madam!
We come on behalf of the inspector who called you!
Open up, please!
The door... is open.
Answer it, madam.
Are you with us?
Madam, where are you?
(Cell phone rings)
Hello, this is Sakata!
Mrs. Okazaki is not at home?
(Heiji) The house is empty!
I told her not to go out!
Did Mrs. Okazaki call you to tell you something?
No.
I didn't give her my phone number.
That's also true.
Well, I'm anxious.
Something strange is going on!
I just left Midosuji Street.
I'll be here in 4 minutes.
(shouting)
It's coming from downstairs!
(Thinking) A public toilet?
No way!
There's nothing to do.
She's already dead.
How did it occur to her to leave the house?
The dagger stabs her chest through the wallet again.
(Thinking) Who the hell is doing it?
Why did she do it?
