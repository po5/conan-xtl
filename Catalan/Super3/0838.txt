Wow.
Did you see that bunch of balloons?
Of course you did.
They are very beautiful.
It's the most important hot air balloon competition in the country.
And the champion gets a cash prize of 10 million yen.
God-hay-do.
(Sonoko) Hello, Mr. Hasegawa.
Well... Hello, Sonoko.
Thank you so much for coming.
(Sonoko) Welcome.
This year I came with some friends.
-Of course not, of course not. -Of course not.
-I guess you don't mind, do you? -I don't mind, do you?
My name is Ayato Hasegawa
and I'm the chairman of the organizing committee for this contest.
Listen, one question:
How high can a hot air balloon go?
Well, it depends a bit on the size of the balloon,
but the bigger ones can go up to over 10,000 meters.
They can fly over Mount Fuji without any problem.
Oh, really?
I'd love to go up.
I'll take one now to record the test on video.
Of course you will!
How nice!
Would you like to come with me?
Ran, Sonoko, you should come too, eh?
Yes, it's not necessary.
Man, we just don't want to intrude...
I think I understand.
You're just scared, aren't you?
Hot air balloons are very safe.
You can be quite calm, really.
Some are as tall as a seven-story building
and they have a lot of light air inside.
Even if you blow a hole, if it's not too big, they never fall all at once.
You see?
You heard what the test organizer said.
Mr. Mizuguchi, what's wrong?
No.
I came here because I want to register another person.
My wife will accompany me, I want her to see the view from the sky.
Until now, whenever she asked me, I always said no.
But this time I'm determined to try it.
Do you see it?
It's an experience you have to live.
If you don't go up, he may not get another chance.
Hmm... Hmm...
"A black cloth splattered with crime
is filled with color with brilliant deduction."
"A gigantic brightly colored hot air balloon."
"And a flight with an unexpected twist."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The mystery of the hot air balloon."
The truth is that I've never been too interested in hot air balloons.
Oh no?
Then why did you say you wanted to go up?
Because my husband is convinced that he's going to win the competition
and he wants to give me the trophy.
Besides, he told me that with the prize money...
he will buy me a pearl necklace;
so I said yes.
Since he doesn't make much money,
and on top of that he spends all of it on this balloon hobby,
he practically doesn't give me anything.
Oh.
What's going to happen?
-We'll see about that.
-Let me be.
Don't get your hopes up.
No matter how hard you try, you won't beat me.
Who's to say I won't?
I'm the current champion, me.
-What are you saying?
-I don't give a damn!
What are you doing, king?
Let it go.
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!
Arisa.
It's... it's him.
That's not true.
It was you, who came looking for a fight.
I thought ballooning was...
...a very relaxing activity.
(Thinking) "Well, obviously not very."
I heard that Mr. Mizuguchi said he was the current champion.
That's true.
Actually, he's won the event two years in a row.
He always takes it very seriously.
Last night, when everyone left for the hotel,
he stayed behind to finish everything.
Look over there.
Oh, yeah?
See that blue balloon?
Well, that's Mr. Mizuguchi's balloon.
(Speaker: woman) "The test will begin in one minute."
Aaaah!
(Horn)
Aaaah!
Aah...
(Speaker: woman) Eh?
(horn honks) Oh!
Wha-what a treat!
It's beautiful.
Wow... Look, look, look, girls.
People are looking smaller and smaller.
(Sonoko) Yes, it's true.


Hey, it seems to me that we are the last ones.
Yes.
Shouldn't we catch the others?
If we go up a bit, the wind will blow stronger.
I have to light the burner now.
You get the camera.
What? What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Strange...
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's not important.
I see that all the participants are going very fast.
Isn't it dangerous to fly so close to each other?
It's a race.
Accuracy counts, but above all speed.
Participants earn points
not only for depositing the marker at the finish line,
but also to do it in the shortest possible time.
That's why everyone rushes to get to the finish line as quickly as possible.
Hey, don't you find this dangerous?
Look at the blue one, the one in front.
What do you mean?
What there are two going?
Isn't that Mr. Mizuguchi?
They're about to collide.
(Hasegawa) He's opened the exhaust valve.
He wants to descend by dodging it.
Oooh!
They're falling, aren't they?
Yes, but the hot air balloons are falling little by little.
Surely nothing will happen to them.
Oooh!
Oh!
Ooh!
(thud)
Where are you going, Conan?
Arisa... I don't know how this could have happened.
Mr. Hasegawa, call the police.
Yes, of course.
Hm.
Anyway, let's continue...
According to the information I have so far,
it appears to have been an accident.
Where is the pilot of the balloon that hit you?
He is Mr. Okuda, who has continued to compete in the race.
Right now, if all goes well, he should be about to reach the finish line.
Even if it is an accident,
I would like to know the exact circumstances of the woman's fall.
I am Lieutenant Kaneko from Ibaraki Prefecture.
You are in Shingo Mizuguchi, aren't you?
I'm sorry to ask you this at such a sad time,
but could you explain to me exactly
how your wife's fall went?
That balloon rammed us and tore the envelope.
The envelope?
It's the top fabric part of the hot air balloon.
We understand.
And then?
As the impact has torn the envelope
and a hole was made, the basket swayed.
I told him to hold on tight to the basket, but he ended up falling.
Excuse me, Lieutenant, we have finished.
Do you give us permission to take the corpse?
-L'Arisa?
-Go ahead.
Where do you want to take her, my wife?
As she may have to be autopsied,
we'll take her to the university hospital.
An autopsy?
No, please!
I don't want them to finish destroying her body.
She has suffered enough, poor thing.
Everything indicates that she died from the impact of the fall,
but, until the coroner examines him,
we can't be 100% sure.
Arisa!
May I come with you, please?
Yes, of course you can.
And have a doctor look at this wound he's got.
What a disgrace!
These things affect me very much.
How could he do this, something like this, in our test?
Even if it turns out to be an accident,
I won't forgive him, the Okuda.
"Well... It's the Arisa's cap."
"It looks like blood."
"Come to think of it, Shingo Mizuguchi had a cut on his face."
Is it vinyl?
Could it be from the balloon?
Conan.
Sonoko says we should go to the finish line.
Okay, I'm coming.
(chattering)
Is she dead?
Is she really?
Yes, really.
That's why we came here, the point of arrival.
So, you're saying you didn't know anything?
I had no idea.
I've been ahead for the whole race.
How could I have known, what was going on behind me?
But you admit to ramming Mr. Mizuguchi's balloon, right?
Yes, but it was a race.
All the participants wanted to reach the finish line as quickly as possible.
These are normal things that happen in any competition.
Maybe it was just an accident, that's what we think,
but a person died and you could be responsible.
What?
It can't be.
Excuse me, didn't you have it out with Mr. Mizuguchi before the race?
Mizuguchi before the race?
-What?
-What?
-What are you insinuating, kid?
-Is it true, what you say?
Don't get your hopes up.
No matter how hard you try, you won't win me!
Who says I won't?
I'm the current champion, me!
He-he started it.
He told me I was a fool

and that he had no chance of winning the race.
And you were hurt and decided to ram him expressly?
What are you talking about?
It was unintentional, I swear.
Listen, I see that your basket has a frayed part.
There are some wicker tips sticking out.
-Oh!
-Huh?
Well, it's true.
You expressly broke Mr. Mizuguchi's balloon.
Mizuguchi's balloon
to make it fall, right?
It wasn't an accident, it was murder.
Uh...
Therefore, we have a clear suspect, Mr. Okuda, and it's you.
What's that?
You-you mustn't really mean that, right?
Just yesterday I checked the balloon from top to bottom...
and I assure you that the wicker was not like that.
Besides, it turns out that if he hadn't come down,
they would have just bumped the nacelles and nothing would have happened.
"He's right in the end."
He wouldn't have opened the hole.
"Shortly before the collision...
Mizuguchi opened the exhaust valve and descended."
"But why?"
Ran, do you remember when you said "how strange" before the crash?
That you saw something that you suddenly saw?
Oh, right, well...
For a moment, I've only seen one person to the balloon of Mr.
Mizuguchi's balloon.
Eh?
But then, when I looked again, I saw both of them.
I guess the Arisa sat in the basket for a moment.
Oh!
Mr. Hasegawa, may I borrow your camera?
Yes, indeed.
Thank you very much.
"Gee... Could it be what I think it is?"
In any case, Mr. Okuda, you'll have to accompany us to the police station.
Just a moment.
I just won the test.
It could wait until the awards ceremony, that would be nice.
Oh.
And that's all forensics told me.
Understood.
If there's any news, let me know right away.
Right away.
Oh, Mr. Mizuguchi.
-Mm... Yes.
-What, are you feeling better?
I'm sorry to have caused so much inconvenience to the test organization.
Don't worry, man.
It's not your fault.
Mr. Okuda, after talking to the judges,
we have decided to disqualify you
for deliberately hindering another participant.
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
This is not fair.
I have only done my best to win the race.
You must go back to talk to the judges right now.
No matter how much we talk, the result will be the same.
Well, you've already felt it: disqualified.
Now you'll really have to come to the station with us.
But-but it's just that...
Ah!
Aaah... aaah... aaah... aaah...
What's wrong, Sonoko?
Are you not feeling well?
(Sonoko's voice) Please wait a moment, Lieutenant Kaneko.
-Why is that?
-Don't take him away, yet.
So that the person you should arrest is not him.
It's someone else.
Oh, is it?
Who do you mean, then?
I mean... the poor victim's husband.
Eh?
-Hmm?
-Don't you, Mr. Mizuguchi? -Yes.
What?
But can you tell me what's wrong with this girl?
Mr. Hasegawa says that last night,
when everyone went to the hotel,
you stayed here finishing up your balloon.
Oh.
"And you took advantage of it to cut the wicker
"from the basket of Mr. Okuda's balloon,
because the ends were sticking out."
And today, before the race,
he deliberately provoked it so that later, during the race,
to come and ram it.
If he hadn't done it, I suppose you were planning to ram him.
Nonsense!
What interest would I have in doing something like that?
Today, during the race, Ran looked at your balloon...
and was surprised because it turned out that she only saw one person.
Then, when she looked again, she saw that no, there were two.
Of course, that's normal.
There were two of us in the balloon.
That's true.
There were two people.
But it turns out that the person we saw was not the Arisa.
The Arisa, at that moment, was sitting at the bottom of the basket.
When I looked at the balloon, near the river," he said,
"There was the bag with the rope that is thrown at the time of landing
so that, from the ground, the balloon can be pulled."
"But, instead, another bag was missing...
which contains an indispensable element."
"Besides, inside the basket there were blood stains."
"At first I thought it was yours, from when you cut your face."

But it was certainly his wife's, that blood.
It is true.
According to forensics, the blood belonged to the victim.
Therefore, this means that the Arisa started to bleed...
a while before it fell from the balloon.
When Mr. Okuda's balloon hit your..,
you ran to catch the Arisa with your arm, didn't you?
I grabbed it to protect it,
because the basket started to sway and I didn't want it to fall.
You know what?
It's not true.
Look, they are about to collide.
(Sonoko) "When he opened the exhaust valve to descend,
"He grabbed the Arisa, but not so that it wouldn't fall,
but so that it wouldn't fly away."
"Because it was not really the Arisa,
but an inflatable doll that weighed practically nothing."
When it landed,
he rushed to destroy the evidence and burned the doll,
along with the balloon envelope.
If she doesn't shut up right now, I swear I will sue her for slander.
Everyone has seen that it was an accident.
And, in any case, if it wasn't, the responsibility is yours.
Well, I see you're a sore loser.
Okay, let's talk about the most important part.
"After descending,
"Taking advantage of the fact that no one could see him from the other balloons,
he threw the Arisa out of the basket, who was unconscious."
Aaah!
Oh!
Ooh!
And that's how you murdered your wife,
who trusted you completely.
-Who knew.
-Yikes.
You murdered her?
That's a lie.
You're making it all up.
Let's see, where's the proof of all this?
Oooh...
Now, please.
Go ahead.
Oooh...
Please take a look at the half-burnt balloon wrapper.
If you look closely, there are some traces of vinyl...
in the shape of a doll's hands.
But how...?
And look at this, too.
We found it on the ground,
about 300 meters or so from the starting line.
Inside this bag is a fire extinguisher...
Which I'm sure matches the wound Arisa had on his head.
(Cries) I had no choice.
The shares I bought with a client's money
had plummeted.
I had to get them back by any means necessary before next month's audit.
And he decided to get them
by cashing in his wife's life insurance.
I don't understand how you can be so stupid.
How could he be able to end a person's life just for money?
I'm sure that in jail he will have plenty of time to reflect on what he has done.
to reflect on what he has done.
But he is a bastard.
Mr. Mizuguchi, you will have to accompany us to the police station.
Hm.

Uaaah...
You are the queen of detectives.
Sonoko, I have to admit that you've really excelled yourself this time.
Eh... Well, yeah, sure.
You have great deduction skills.
But, if you're so smart, how come you don't usually show it?
Look, you don't have to do anything, okay?
And, when you count your deductions,
how come you fall asleep like my dad?
Huh?
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
If it was a genetic thing, you should fall asleep yourself.
"It's just not genetic."
"Both she and the other one just sleep. Of deductions, they don't make a single one."
This is the voice of the Tengu.
Oh!
It's beautiful!
Hm?
"How come it was swaying? Surely it was because of the wind."
(Kogoro voice) He heard it from the Tengu's voice.
"Don't miss the next episode: 'Tengu's voice is heard'."
