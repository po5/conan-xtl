"The handle of a spinning clock, a shooting star..."
"My deductions are your medicine."
"Today's case has a lot to do with music."
"His brain of an adult and he's... Detective Conan!"

DETECTIVE CONAN
karaoke
(Desafina) A hundred years from now... our century will end.
You told me to cry and I started to laugh.
Uuuuuuh!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah!
In a few days..., our century will end.
The abduction of the famous singers, part one.
(Genta) Come on!
(Genta) -All right!
Let's hide! -Yes, yes!
(Think) "Genta's Coi..."
"He's thrown as far as he likes."
"I'm a high school student
and I have to play hide-and-seek like a creature."
"What are you doing here, these people?"
Why, it's Conan!
What are you doing here?
And what are you two doing? We're going to a concert!
The concert that takes place at the Budokan! And these flowers?
The concert is at 6 o'clock, but we're coming so we can see you both.
Musicians usually come in before 6 o'clock, to rehearse!
Both of them?
Apa, let's be clear: the Two-Mix are two!
The Two-mix?
Who are they?
Eh?
But you don't know them?!
The group is formed by Minami Takayama and Shiina Nagano.
So they're those dance music freaks.
You hurt me!
You haven't heard them, so don't bother them.
So much is, in Conan is a creature...
Do you remember what happened, when we brought the karaoke?
Now that you mention it...
he was out of tune like what do you want me to tell you?
There are people who are not interested in music,
there's no need to worry.
Can't understand how they get to be good at it.
(thinks) "I'm sorry."
-What's the matter, Conan?
-What are you doing?
Take what we do seriously!
Excuse me!
I'll see you around.
Don't go with strangers.
No problem!
I'm with them!
(Think) "I'm worried about you, you knucklehead."
Goodbye.
-What are they doing here, these people? -Where are they going, these two? -Where are they going, these two?
To a Two-Mix concert.
They wanted to give them flowers.
-Really?
-Get on TV!
They were singing the Yaiba cartoon song!
(Think) "Caram. These too?"
-Come on, let's see them too.-Yes, let's do it!
I'll get an autograph.
(Think) "Come on..."
-The demon and Yaiba were great, and the magic sword.
AAAI!
Excuse me, guys.
Watch where you're going!
You look blind!
You are...
Minami Takayama of the Two-Mix!!!
-What?
-It's the Minami Takayama?
-The Minami Takayama? -Come on!
(People) An autograph!
An autograph!
Please!
An autograph!
(imitates man's voice) Ha-ha-ha!
Hi, guys!
Aren't you hungry?
Come with me, I'll treat you to a little something to eat!
Don't you want to?
Let's go then!
Ha-ha-ha!
Come on, you scoundrel!
This looks like a mistake.
(All) It looks good.
Bon appetit!
(Think) "We didn't have to go with any strangers."
(Think) They have chosen the most expensive things.
(All) Eh?
Don't you eat anything, Minami?
Ha-ha-ha!
No, I'm not.
I'm not hungry at all.
(Thinking) "If I had brought more money..."
Before a concert you should check the acoustics and stuff, right?
Hmm.
Now we should be checking everything,
but Shiina didn't come.
And he wasn't answering calls either.
I thought what to go look for.
That's why I went out.
Call him again from here.
I left my cell phone in the office.
And that man has been calling on this phone for a long time.
-What a bad luck. So bad.
Yes, strange things have been happening to us lately.
Strange things?
Someone's gutting the cupboards in the office.
And on the lock of Shiina's apartment there were marks of forced entry.
Every day we get anonymous phone calls.
A man's voice that just says...
Don't sing!
Maybe he's a fanatic, dangerous.
-It's a case of threats! -A case, you say?

Trust us, we are the Junior Detectives!
Ah, thank you...
Your fee will be the cost of this meal.
Remember when they started threatening you?
Sunday of last week.
After the show we did on the radio.
-I heard it! I heard it too!
They played the demo with the chorus of the new song!
(Think) "A demo?"
Now you can listen to the whole song.
Yes?
Can we?
Yes!
No copy of this demo!
-How did you like it? -Great!
It's a blast!
And you, boy?
Nothing special.
Nothing to squeak about.
Of course there isn't!
You're too much!
(Think) "Threats are not for the demo."
What do you think, the song?
Aaaa... Not bad.
You see?
I knew it!
Have you already solved the riddle, Mitsuhiko?
No, not that!
I was talking about the voice!
It's been pending for a while.
Minami's voice and Conan's voice are identical!
This is ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.
-It's true!
-Their voices are doubled!
You mean "their voices are dubbed"!
Well, when it's cooled down I'll call you to replace me.
And now!
No!
Conan has no ear at all, with the music.
(He thinks) "Today it was my turn to receive."
Wow.
That man is still talking on the phone.
Then I'll leave this for you.
Thank you.
What's this?
That's an eye-catching pendant.
It's a cell phone pendant.
It was made for me by Dr. Agasa, a scientist.
I get it.
This is worn like an earring.
Before you put it on, you have to dial the number.
(Girl) Miss Takayama?
Is one of our customers named Takayama?
Yes.
That's me.
You have a call from Mr. Shiina Nagano.
Yes, I see.
Hey, where are you?
The sound check has already started.
I'm sorry, I've been stumbling.
I came by car, I'm in front of the door.
What are you doing in this car?
I want you to see something.
Would you mind coming?
(Minami) Let him come?
Uh, yes.
Don't come, Minami!
Don't come!
(Minami) Eh?
(Minami) What's wrong?
Can you feel me?
Geez!
What the fuck is wrong with him?
(Think) "Wait a minute, that man..."
Hey, Shiina, can you hear me?
You could at least answer me.
Don't move!
Shiina!
That's right.
Go inside!
It's terrible!
Co... Conan!
The Minami!
The Minami!
They've taken him away!
(Thinking) "Shit. They've kidnapped her right in front of my eyes."
(Phone)
Yes, hello?
This is the Budokan.
(Telephone) Eh?
Can you repeat that?
(Man) I have kidnapped the Two-Mix.
If you want to help them, call the police.
Enough with the no-nonsense calls!
What's going on? What's going on?
Some guy claiming to have kidnapped the Two-Mix!
These kids say someone has taken Minami by force.
What's he saying?!
-It's true! -They made him get into a van!
Save Minami!
-So, that call... -We must call the police!
It looks like it's going to rain.
If they don't open the palace, we'll get soaked.
(Sirens)
Maybe something has happened.
Inspector, it's this way.
Start distributing the work and interrogate the people around.
Come on, let's go! Yes.
You, her manager,
you say that Miss Minami Takayama has gone out alone?
As she did not contact Shiina, she went out to look for him.
Then, when she was having lunch with you,
she was called on the phone and kidnapped.
Hmm.
When she left the restaurant,
the kidnapper who was following her pushed her into the van.
So you saw what the kidnapper looked like?!
Yes.
He was about the height of Mouri.
He was wearing a scarf and a knitted hat.
Round sunglasses!
He had long hair with curls and a mustache.
Maybe it was a disguise.
Besides, they must be two kidnappers.
And how can you tell?
After pushing the Minami towards the back seats,
the hijacker climbed into the passenger seat.
Another one was already behind the wheel.
And then the call came in to this office.
We were told that they had been kidnapped and to call the police.
What do they want to achieve?
The most natural thing to do would be to tell them not to call the police.
They trust themselves too much.
Yes.
Or that they don't want to release the hostages in the first place.
But then...
(Phone)
Inspector!
The call!

(Riiiing!)
Be prepared to locate your source.
(Riiiing!)
Come and answer yourself, please! Yes.
(Riiiing!)
Everything will be all right.
Calm down.
(Riiiing!)
Try not to make the kidnapper nervous.
(Riiiing!)
And try to extend the conversation.
We'll try to locate her.
Okay? (Riiiing!)
(Riiiing!)
(Riiiing!) All right.
(Riiiing!)
(Riiiing!) Go ahead.
(Riiiing!)
Yes, yes?
Yes... Yes...
He wants the policeman in charge of the case to get on.
All right, I'll put him on.
Turn on the speakers.
Yes?
Will you sit down?
I'm Inspector Megure.
Oh, what a surprise!
I'm talking to the head of the investigation department!
What an honor...
How are you, the two of them?
(Loudspeaker) "Don't worry about anything. They do nothing together.
What are your demands?
Money?
Or rather...?
"Money? I'm not interested in anything, money.
I am what you would call a fanatic.
I want to have everything related to them,
like the bag she left in the restaurant.
A bag, you say?!
(thinks) "This one."
So I'll say to one of my men.... "Ha-ha-ha!
"Don't take me for a fool!"
I want a child to take it to me.
I can't send you a child.
"I mean the ones who ate with the Minami."
But still...
"You don't have time to start hesitating. Just think, I have two hostages."
And give me one of them to leave this world.
"Have that bag taken away! And let the little kids do it."
I can't allow children to go through such a dangerous trance!
It is the only request I will refuse!
Is that your answer?
What do you know...
The musical group Two Mix will have to start saying One-Mix.
We'll talk again.
No, wait!
Perfect!
Shall we bring him the bag?
-We do what it says in Conan! -We do what it says in Conan! -We can't just stand by and do nothing.
We'll do it!
But guys, it's dangerous!
(Loud speaker) "It's already decided." Don't run so fast...
"In 10 minutes, I'll call the Kudansaka subway booth."
Wait!
If any of them are late, I'll get rid of a hostage."
He has located it ?!
He did it from the Haido district,
but she was talking on a cell phone while moving by car.
Very good.
Check which suspects in recent cases are at large.
Yes... But why?
The kidnapper knew how he was telling me and his voice was distorted.
Also, his respectful tone was forced.
He must know from some interrogation.
Conan... Yes!
Promise me one thing: don't do anything to put him in danger.
Yes.
If they go wrong, fugiu.
Entesos!
Did you also understand?
Excuse me... What should we do, with the concert?
Cancel it, man! We won't have to!
We'll save them before the concert starts!
Wait selected.
(Phone)
Yes?
Hello? (Male) Go to Yamanote Station.
(Man) Go to Yamanote Station.
You have one quarter to get to booth 13.
We dropped the bag in a manhole.
-In a manhole? -But the tape is okay?
We'll be better off if the tape shatters!
(Copilot) No.
(Copilot) You're right.
(Think) "Your target is the model?"
So much is, be there in 15 minutes!
Why do you want some kids to take it?
The ten accompany an agent.
They would have come with a policeman, anyway.
Besides, even the policeman controlling them will be careless.
We can catch them off guard.
What do you write down, here, Conan?
I write the lyrics of the song.
(Think) "The kidnappers want this tape."
"Since there is nothing strange, this is the crux of the matter."
"In the lyrics there must be some key word."
Inspector, they have found the kidnappers' car
abandoned near the Teimuzu River.
Shit, they've changed cars.
So, we can only rely on what these kids say and do.
AAAAAAAAA... I'm knackered!
We keep going round and round the Yamanote line.
He's pulling our leg.
(Think) "No. They're looking for an opportunity to act."
"They're hoping the police will let us out of their sight for a moment."
That I'm no good for you to take the tape?
(Man) That's right.
I will call you here 3 minutes.
You will go to the toilets, and then you will give it to me.
This is very strange.

-Who wants me to take the tape to him? -Go, Conan.
When the Two-Mix played this tape on the radio,
did they say anything special?
No, they didn't.
That they had come up with the lyrics
when they were passing by the shōen temple.
Temple shōen ?!
(Think) "shōen is very close to where a murder was."
"A strange man armed with a gun attacked another man."
"The gun went off, and one of the two of them died."
"The survivor argued that he had defended himself
and was released."
"I know why they want the tape!"
-We have to make the drop. -If you don't...
Wait!
I have a good idea.
The children answer the call. (Phone)
(Man) Here's the plan.
Now we can throw the police off the scent.
Let's be clear, I don't want any mistakes.
(Loudspeaker) "In a few moments the doors will close."
"Be careful."
Ayumi!
Didn't you get it wrong, kiddo? Is anyone inside the carriage?!
It's just us.
We'll do what we can.
What about the hijacker? We don't see anyone who... Eh?!
Children throw the bag out the window!
I knew he invents something like that!
Worry children!
We'll go get the bag!
Oh, come on!
Come on, let's go!
Eh?
Where is she, that child?
Come on children, your work is done.
Don't run away!
Quiet, little boy!
(Girl's scream)
A little girl?
Has anyone approached, to the bag? No, no one.
(phone ringing)
(Girl's voice) Hello?
All right, girl.
I'm glad you've arrived.
There must not be any police.
No, there don't seem to be any.
From now on, you'll do everything I tell you to do, understood?
Yes... I'll do everything I can!
That Conan and Ayumi have switched roles?
What's on his head?
(Kimi ga INAI Natsu)

DETECTIVE CONAN
The glasses in question are these?
Conan...
But you... what are you doing here?
Why didn't you give my glasses to the police?
It's that....
I'll have a great time, with your friends...
by sending them to the other neighborhood.
The kidnapping of the famous singers, part two.
