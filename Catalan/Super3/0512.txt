Waiting does not get things started sooner.
We take a step into the future.
The countdown of love and deductions begins!
Today we will find the truth in a case
that not even a psychic could solve.
He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

"The Broken Horoscope"
(Kogoro) We detectives are necessary...
to be able to understand cases objectively
and to be able to make logical deductions
without getting carried away by feelings, I think.
Well, well, well!
If I understand correctly, you don't believe...
in the science of divination based on astrology, do you?
Now, I didn't say that.
I may not believe in divination,
but I won't deny that it's imperative to have a sixth sense
to solve some cases,
a flash of intuition that helps you to understand... what has happened.
So, you are also interested in divination, Mouri?
Yes, from time to time I go to see a fortune-teller... (laughs)
"An inspired editor came up with the idea
"To arrange an informal interview
"between Reika Shijo, the most fashionable fortune-teller of the present day,
"and the famous detective Kogoro Mouri."
"That's why we went to Reika Shijo's mansion."
Admittedly, I have an innate talent for playing the detective,
sometimes I even...
I solve cases without being fully aware of it.
(laughing outrageously)
(Reika) What a joker you are!
Miss, you have a call from Mr. Nakame,
from Tokyo TV.
He says he needs to talk to you urgently.
I'm very busy right now, come back later.
Okay.
(Birds: twittering)
(Man) One o'clock, two o'clock already...!
Mr. Mouri, you don't have to smile so much.
What a beautiful house!
It was the residence of a multimillionaire,
the Reika bought it for him.
The Reika?
I mean... Miss Reika, of course.
Oh... Are those stained glass windows?
Yes.
They were made according to the drawings Miss Reika had designed.
They're everywhere in the mansion.
The drawings show her face in profile and a scorpion,
symbolizing the constellation that protects her.
Ah... (doorbell rings)
I'll get it.
(doorbell rings) Uh.
How bitter!
If you make coffee so concentrated, it spoils the aroma and it's worthless!
It tastes really bad to me!
I'll make another one right away.
Oh!
Well, if it isn't... actress Kurara Midorikawa!
Do you have guests today?
It's the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
We're being interviewed for a magazine.
How do you do?
And now, it's an honor for me to meet you in person!
Excuse me, Reika... Can I talk to you for a moment?
Mm?
Hm.
When do you plan to let it go?
I've already paid you enough money!
Be careful what you say.
If I tell anyone even a small part of what I know about you, I'll have your head.
But if this keeps up, I'll have no choice but to hang myself!
If you want me to leave you alone, find me a substitute.
-A substitute? -Yes.
Someone to replace you.
I don't care who it is,
as long as it's a rich person with professional prestige.
If you introduce him to me, I'll leave you alone.
Who is this handsome man here?
Don't be conceited!
Mr. Mouri, how about if I tell your fortune?
I'll need an hour or so.
In the meantime, how about a glass of wine?
Kurara, at 5 o'clock in my room.
Yes.
Miss Reika!
Ah, hello, Ran.
How can I help you?
May I ask you to tell me the future?
There's something I want to know.
I had a hard time convincing my father to let me come here.
It's something I need to know.
It must be something very important.
Okay, I'll t'endevini the future.
Promise me, then?

Yes.
But I'm very busy right now.
Ah...
I have a long waiting list of clients that never ends.
I'll take care of it.
But in exchange, I'll give you this. What?
It's a charm.
I can't accept such a valuable gift.
Then keep me... until the day I read your future.
Yes?
Okay, okay, okay!
I'll find a time as soon as I can.
Thank you so much!
(Girl) What a face!
It's not right.
I had promised me that next time I would write the horoscope me!
This was also my intention.
But Reika said it couldn't be.
But even if your predictions
are different from her
doesn't mean that you are no good as a seer.
This is what she says,
but the truth is that Miss Reika hates me.
Mmm!
"Tr√®s bien!
(Door, open)
Yuka, what's wrong with you?
Miss Reika is still mad at you?
Poor girl, the fortune teller is always giving her a hard time.
Yuka is Miss Reika's niece and her apprentice,
but she treats her as if she were her maid.
Maybe that's part of the apprenticeship too.
Excellent!
Very good!
Yes, it's me.
I'm calling to talk about the magazine.
Where's the washroom?
-It's on the left, down the hall.
-Thank you very much.
To the left, to the left...
Aah... What a bore!
I would have had to go play soccer with Genta and the others.
Eh?
A blue-breasted one!
They don't usually get that close.
Funny, isn't it?
Miss Reika, I'm told that dinner is ready.
Miss Reika?
(Kogoro) What?
I've called many times and you haven't answered.
(Kogoro) Maybe she's sleeping.
Miss Reika is not one of those hostesses
who keeps her guests waiting.
I'll go look for her.
Mr. Mouri, would you care to join me?
-And now, with pleasure.
Miss!
Miss!
Reika!
You're not feeling well?
It's locked.
It's so strange!
What happened to her?
-We'll take a look around the balcony. -Yes.
Reika!
What happened, Reika?
It won't open!
Wait, maybe we can get in through the skylight.
I'll go myself!
Tamura, please hold the door!
(Kogoro) When you get inside, open it for us right away!
Hold on, Reika!
Reika!
Reika!
Say something, Reika!
(Think) "The only door in the room was locked,
"and the windows won't open."
"It's a murder... in a locked room!"
The victim is Miss Reika Shijo, astrologer and psychic.
-I estimate that she has been dead for about 3 hours or 3.5 hours ago.
So, the time of death is around 5 pm.
I'm guessing she had to have broken the skylight
because the door and windows were locked.
Where did the key to the room fall, Mouri?
It was there, with the others.
Mr. Katsuragi picked it up and opened the door for us.
No copies of the key?
Maybe Yuka, his apprentice, has a duplicate.
Look at this!
Here is a bird feather!
It's the feather of a blue-breasted bird.
At about half past five o'clock at 6 o'clock I saw one
flying over the roof of this room.
If the feather of this bird entered the room
when Mr. Katsuragi broke the skylight,
how did it get under the glass?
Come here!
Flights stop removing the scene of the crime?!
Miss Shiraishi,
do you have a duplicate key to Miss Reika's room?
No.
Miss Reika only had one key and she always carried it with her.
Hey, Yuka, you were always by your aunt's side.
You mean you won't be able to take advantage of a moment of distraction
to order a copy of the key?
-And now! -For God's sake, Yuka!
Were you that angry,
because Reika wouldn't let you write the horoscope for the magazine?
It's not that!
Now that Reika is dead,
you'll become the sole heir to her estate
because you are her next of kin.
It's clear to me now.
Yes, Yuka, you are the murderer!
I am?
-You're going to order a copy of the key on the sly by...
Inspector, we've checked the key issue.
All right, tell us about it.
Yes.
It's a special security key.

The only one authorized to make a copy is the original manufacturer,
and to do so,
needs the credit card number as a guarantee.
Therefore, it is unlikely that...
that someone other than the victim could order a duplicate.
I asked the manufacturer,
and he told me that he had not made any copies.
Ah!
Wow!
This is more complicated than it seemed at first.
Yes.
If the only key was in here, it's a crime...
...in a locked room.
I've got it!
When Mr. Katsuragi opened the door,
he could have substituted the real key
with one he had hidden!
-What are you talking about?
No, I was here too, and I didn't see him make any strange moves.
(Thinking) "It's true, I saw everything too."
Miss Shiraishi, when did you last see Miss Reika?
When she left the living room
and went to work in her room.
And what did you do after that?
I talked to Katsuragi for about 2 or 3 minutes.
and then I locked myself in the kitchen.
It's true, Inspector, I was in the kitchen with her the whole time...
helping her prepare dinner.
And you, Tamura, what did you do?
Just like Yuka, Inspector.
After that, I've been in the living room with Mr. Mouri all the time.
Mr. Katsuragi? Me too, Inspector.
I made a couple of work-related calls...
and I stayed here talking to Tamura and Mr. Mouri
until 5 o'clock.
Miss Midorikawa.
Well, I... I did the same as everyone else.
By the way, when I left to go to the bathroom at around 5 o'clock,
I saw that you were coming down from upstairs.
Because I had an appointment at 5 o'clock with Miss Reika.
because you told me the future.
Well, there could be death then, don't you think?
This has no logic!
Why should it have been me?
Well, because...
Last month I came here for work and I also saw her.
(Tamura) "You were coming out of Miss Reika's room."
Someday I'm going to kill this evil witch!
I wanted to kill her?
What had she done to her?
The Reika was a bad witch.
On the first day, she received me very kindly...
and, with the excuse of the predictions, she began to ask me questions.
When I had already confessed my weaknesses to her..,
she turned into a monster,
and demanded a fortune to pay her "fees".
When I tried to get away from her,
she threatened that she would sell everything she knew about me to the press.
I get it.
She was blackmailing you.
And since you were between a rock and a hard place...
Wait a minute!
I've gone to your room, but...
(Reika) I'm busy now, come back later.
I had to come back without seeing her.
Can you prove that you haven't seen her?
No, I've already said it!
Ah, it's you, Conan.
What's the matter with you?
I thought I was a good person, but I was blackmailing.
I wanted to ask Miss Reika something,
but as she was very busy, she gave me this.
It's the keychain, where she had the key to her room.
What is it?
When did she give it to you?
Before she went into the room to tell the father's fortune.
(thinks) "Wow!"
"I'm busy now, come back later."
"What does that sound like to me, this sentence?"
"The skylight must have been painted with the same picture."
"Ooh! But yes...!"
"Sure, I get it!"
I apologize to all of you,
but you will have to accompany us to the police station
so that we can question you more thoroughly.
Understood.
Aaaah... Must be the wine's fault...
Aaaaaaaaaaah...
(Kogoro voice) Not so fast, Inspector Megure.
It will only be necessary to take away the culprit of the crime.
What are you saying, now!
You mean you already know who the murderer is?
Of course you do!
The trick the murderer used is not very complicated.
The person who killed Miss Reika...
left the room quietly,
and was able to lock the door.
"Then, he climbed up on the roof,
"cut a hole in the glass of the skylight...
"and threw the key into the room."
The feather of the bird that Conan saw pass around half past five o'clock in 6

has fallen into the room
through the hole the killer had made in the skylight.
"That's why she's been trapped under a shard of glass."
"This is shown by the fact that there is no red-colored shard
"Among the shards of broken glass."
"There should be the red glass
"From the star Antares in the constellation Scorpius."
But why did he want to turn the crime scene
in a closed room?
To direct all suspicion toward Miss Yuka.
The culprit thought
that Miss Yuka had a copy of the key.
But since there was no duplicate key,
the crime scene has become a locked room.
Yes.
I understand.
This means the murderer is Miss Midorikawa.
How dare you...?!
(Kogoro voice) No.
When Miss Kurara has gone to the room,
Miss Reika was already dead.
How could that be?
But... but I heard her voice, Kogoro!
Tamura, you recorded my conversation...
with Miss Reika, didn't you?
Yes.
Halfway through the interview, the phone rang.
Could we listen to this portion of the recording?
No problem.
(Yuka) "She says she needs to talk to you urgently."
(Reika) "I'm busy now, come back later."
"(Door: call)"
(Yuka) "Reika, it's me, the Midorikawa."
"(Door: call)"
(Reika) "I'm busy now, come back later."
You mean the culprit is Mr. Tamura because he has a tape recorder?
I-I haven't done anything!
Any one of us could have a tape recorder in our pocket.
Isn't that right, Mr. Katsuragi?
What a thing to say!
The man who killed Miss Reika...
is you, Katsuragi!
-Huh? -Huh?
What nonsense!
Earlier, you implied...
that Miss Yuka might have a copy of the room key.
If you were so convinced,
why didn't you go and warn her...
when we were trying to enter the locked room?
Because... I was in a hurry to get in
and I couldn't think of any other solution.
No.
We had to break the glass of the skylight
to prevent us from discovering the hole I had made earlier
to throw the key into the room.
And now!
Answer me a question.
"When he broke the glass and jumped into the room,
"On the floor there was more than one key,
"But you picked up the right one
"Without a moment's hesitation."
"How did you know that key was the one for the room?"
I knew the key ring!
Miss Reika always carried
her room key on a key ring with a blue stone.
What?
It turns out that, oddly enough, the psychic changed the key ring,
just before the murder.
"My daughter has asked her to tell her fortune.
"And she said she couldn't,
"But in return she gave her the keychain as if it were a charm."
What? Didn't she, Ran?
Yes.
Since she's given her usual keychain to Ran,
Miss Reika had to exchange it
for the blue stone keychain when she entered the room.
How could she have known, you, if, as she assures you,
you have neither seen the victim nor spoken to her
since she left the living room?
Apart from Miss Reika, the only person who could have known...
that the key to the room was the one on the blue key ring
is the man who had used it to lock the door to the room,
that is, you!
He was a leech!
Suddenly, one day, he demanded...
to give him back all the money he had left me
and told me that, if I couldn't, he would publish in a magazine...
that I was dealing in insider trading...
that he obtained from the printing house.
(Cries)
Listen to something, Ran.
What did you want to ask her, the psychic?
What was it?
I just wanted her to tell me where Shinichi was.
"It's very close to you."
As a matter of fact...
I don't even know how he is...
Instead of worrying so much about Shinichi,
maybe we should start thinking
about how we're going to manage to get your father home.
(Snores)
"It's one of his fits of inspiration..."
24 hours with Kogoro Mouri?
I'll gladly accept it!

You have entered this locked room before anyone else
to get rid of some evidence that you had not been able to eliminate!
(Think) "No. This is not a simple murderer..."
"It's an impossible crime!"
Don't miss the next episode!
