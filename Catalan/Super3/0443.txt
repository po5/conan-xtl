A giant wall blocks our way.
If we look at it with different eyes we will see it as a giant door!
Let's go with the Junior Detective League to catch clams.
That famous inspector, parenthesis, little brother, parenthesis,
also appears.
He looks like a kid, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

(People: rumor of voices)
- (boy) Still not come in? - (man) Be more patient.
(People: talking at the same time)
- (boy) I want to swim. (boy) Come and play with me.
(thinks) "It's so hot."
Come on...
Surprise!
We've already finished it!
(At the same time) That's it!
Doctor, what do you think?
Isn't it nice?
Yes!
You have made a magnificent sand castle!
Haven't you?
Isn't it?
I also think it has turned out very well!
Yes.
I have also made the castle!
I do not have much trace, but I have also made you!
Very good!
It's all thanks to your teamwork.
Let's see, guys.
I hope you have not forgotten that we have come to harvest clams.
Enough fooling around.
It's just that...
I'll tell you straight: we've had it up to here.
We keep digging, but all we find is sand.
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that?
They'll have to do something if they're looking for it and can't find it.
Besides, there don't seem to be many clams here...
Are you sure about that?
I don't agree.
(Ayumi) Oh!
He's carrying a pile of clams!
Yes, that's right... She's carrying 20 or 30.
Don't tell me you went to buy them at the fish market.
A lot of people cheat with these things.
Piece of ass.
I wouldn't dream of doing this!
I have a secret to find!
A secret!
Yes?
You have a trick?
Show me, please.
Watch closely.
First, what I do is soften the sand with the rake carefully...
and after a while, when the waves come...
You see?
The clams are lighter than the sand and come to the surface.
It's amazing!
Conan, you're great!
Where did you learn how to do that?
It's like magic.
So, does this mean there are only clams when the waves come?
No, that's not it;
when the clams release the waste water with the organism.
they make little holes called clam eyes.
And if you dig 10 to 15 centimeters below the holes,
under the hardened sand, being careful not to damage the clams...
You see?
You find a few!
(At the same time) Ooooh!
THE MAN WHO SIGHED SEARCHING FOR CLAMS, (PART ONE)
See?
Eh?
Where... where have they gone?
That group... it's over there.
Wow!
It's unbelievable!
Now they keep coming out!
-People!
Catch a load! -Look, clam eyes!
If we had a bigger rake,
we could catch so many that we could sell them and everything!
He-he-he-he-he-he-he...!
Maybe we could open a fish market!
Yeah, we'll make a fortune!
Come on, boys, come on!
You'd be doing the wrong thing.
Just think, according to the rules,
you can only use rakes of 15 centimeters maximum,
and you're only allowed to carry 2 kilos per person.
Of clams, few, not all.
He-he-he-he-he!
But, hey!
Are you sure that everyone complies with these rules?
What matters is that everyone has the good will to comply with them.
Now do you understand, children?
If you take too many eels, there will be less and less left...
and the day would come when you would no longer be able to eat eels with rice.
-And you wouldn't like that, would you? -Huh?
That's true.
How awful!
This must never ever happen!
Genta...
You see?
Nobody is anxious to take an exaggerated amount of clams.
The real purpose of coming here to catch clams is to have fun
looking for them in the middle of all this sand.
-Of course! -It seems so.

We got it!
Good!
(Sighs)
It seems that there are also people who do not have a good time.
See.
(Mitsuhiko) I'm sure the poor thing can't find clams.
(Ayumi) Shall we show him how to find them?
(Genta) Yes, let's do it.
-(Ayumi) Excuse me, sir! -(Ayumi) Do you know what clam eyes are?
Yes.
You must dig under those holes.
You'll find a lot of clams!
I've already caught clams.
See?
So why was he sighing?
Why was I sighing? -Hm.
It's just that I have... my problems...
(Boy) Hey!
Ushigome!
-We've already bought the food! -And the snack, too!
(Boy) Okay.
-Mmmm?
Who are these kids? You know them?
I just met them now.
Same to you: who are you?
Ah... we are...
...from a club at our university.
The Mollusk Amateurs Club.
What group of trobaporucs fans are you talking about?
And all four of you wear the same tracksuit?
Let's see, what do you want, to become a comedy troupe, perhaps?
No.
On the back of the tracksuit is written the name of our club.
The Mollusk Amateurs Club.
(At the same time) Mollusc fans?
That is to say, we love to go looking for clams and eat pictures.
-And the fact is that there are 4 of us.
These tracksuits are brand-new and, in fact....,
today's the first day we've worn them.
"Now I get it."
"What it says can mean "clam" and "encounter" at the same time.
In any case, we start eating now, Ushigome!
Yes, we eat.
What do you see?
I bought you this that you like so much, look....
(Boy) Hey, Ushigome!
Green tea.
For you.
Ah, thank you very much.
Let's see...
(Boy) Hey!
It's got, rice rolls with fish, cod eggs and plum.
Take it!
(Boy) Thank you.
And the potatoes... for after lunch.
Got it. Take it.
Ah, thank you, really.
Tell me, how was the campaign?
Ah, I've gained strength.
Wow!
It's incredible!
Let me see, let me look?
Ushigome, you're a phenomenon!
(Guts: snoring)
Now I'm hungry...
What?
Are you starting?
Genta, you ate your lunch box a moment ago!
I'll go to the supermarket... He-he-he!
To buy something for a snack.
Great! I'll go buy it myself!
I'll go buy it myself!
Quiet here, Mitsuhiko!
You want to buy a Yaiba the Masked's chocolate bar on the sly?
How could you say that?
I wasn't planning on it, this...
-I'll come too! -Confess it!
You were going to do it!
(Ai) Got it.
Now all 3 of you go in good company.
And try not to buy more stuff than you have to, is that clear?
(At the same time) Eh... Yes...
And you should also be careful with cars.
Yes!
I'm telling you for real, kids!
Not long ago a person was hit by a car near here
and the driver ran away.
-Yes, doctor! -Yes, doctor!
We'll buy eels with rice and fries!
You mean it's a good idea?
Do you think we're going?
Yes, it's true.
Besides, we've already caught enough clams.
Shall we have a clam party at the Ushigome's house?
Ushigome, we do something.
We'll stay here and collect all this stuff.
You take the clams to the car and start removing the sand from them.
Ushigome, what have you got?
Oh, I forgot!
The other day I found a delicious restaurant
that specializes in cooking clams.
Do you want to go together to try it?
-Yes, I'm in! -Very well.
Let's go for a drink tonight!
Yes, and we can spend the night at the Ushigome's house...
Today's clams we can eat with tomorrow's miso soup
with tomorrow's miso soup at noon.
Au, shall we do this?
Ushigome?
Ushigome, what's wrong with you?
Yes..., let's stay like this.
Excuse me..., what's wrong with him?
He looks very discouraged, doesn't he?
-Huh?
Ha-ha-ha! -It's nothing.
-No big deal.
En-Au, let's start packing up.
Let's see...
Remember we have to separate the garbage.
I know that.
Here, we'll put the plastic bottles.
(Kudo voice) Hey.
What do you want?
Before...
The atmosphere has changed suddenly.
Yes.
(Ai) Yaiba chocolates.
Yes, that.
(Ai) Yaiba jelly beans.
(Ai) And then, "snacks" Yaiba.
What does this nonsense mean?
Just bought Yaiba candy with prizes as gifts.
What's wrong with that?

Genta said we had to buy them any way we could.
Mitsuhiko, you betrayed me.
But they're really good candy.
Come to think of it, I don't see the four guys who were here.
Have they left already?
Yes, a moment ago.
After separating the garbage they had to throw away.
Considering how young people are these days, it's admirable.
But... they seem to have neglected something, the rake.
The rake?
Wait a minute, Conan, how do you know this here is yours?
There's no name on it, is there?
Here it is,
there's a fresh black stain on the wooden handle of the rake.
It's probably a bloodstain.
(At once) Blood?
Now I get it.
When we have seen it for the first time,
the sighing boy licked his index finger.
It is likely that while he was pulling some clam out of the sand
he cut himself on a broken shell.
This means that some blood must have been left on the handle, right, Conan?
Yes..., probably.
So, they must be looking for it now.
-Dr. Agasa, how long ago did the four of you leave?
I told you, a moment ago, nothing.
That means it's possible that they're still in the parking lot.
-Let's go, let's take them away. Yes, let's do it!
-Let's all go together! - (time) Yes!
Conan, give it to me!
Hey, hey, hey!
Apa!
When they say a moment of nothing, they mean about 4 or 5 minutes ago;
they must be gone by now!
(Mitsuhiko) Wow, how big is the parking lot!
- (Ayumi) I'm sure they're still here! -Where are they?
(Ayumi) Where are they?
(Ayumi) Look!
We found them!
They're over there!
They have left this!
(At the same time) Guys!
(At the same time) Eh?
-What? -Aaah...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Mite'ls... Some clam diggers.
What do they have to tell me about this find?
They finished looking for clams.
And while you 3 were collecting and storing the debris,
Mr. Ushigome has returned to the car
with the buckets in which he was carrying the shells they had collected.
And then, when you went back to the car you found it in this state.
Yes, sir.
That's right.
His mouth smells like almonds.
The body was lying on the seat of the car...
And if we look at this plastic bottle of green tea...
we can come to the conclusion...
that Mr. Ushigome has died
from having ingested a poison of the hydrocyanic acid family
that has been mixed with this tea.
-Lla... then... -I knew it...
-She committed suicide? -Huh?
You knew?
Can you think of anything that could have caused it?
No, it's not that.
He seemed preoccupied with something lately, that's all I know.
He didn't seem to be in any mood...
The truth is, I don't know what he was so intent on.
Shoko, did you know anything?
I didn't know anything.
But the way he always seemed...
It's possible that he committed suicide.
Yes, you're right.
Or maybe...
Seeing that Mr. Ushigome was looking so sad,
that would make anyone think that he must have wanted to commit suicide,
one of you put a poison in this bottle of green tea.
I can't say which version is more convincing.
- (at the same time) What? -But what are you saying?
We would not be able to!
And then?
Which of you has bought this bottle of green tea?
The 3 of us went to buy it at the supermarket.
-He told us he hadn't eaten anything all morning.
-We bought him some rice rolls and sweets.
So, Mr. Ushigome took the bottle out of the bag personally?
- (girl) No. Huh?
No... I gave him the bottle.
But at that time he has been drinking with a lot of desire
and he was feeling fine.
What's the problem?
Did any of you touch her after he drank from the bottle?
No, only when we bought it.
The Ushigome has had it the whole time,
so it's impossible for any of us to touch it.
I just passed the rice rolls to the Ushigome on the fly.
"It's got, rice rolls with fish, cod eggs and plum. Take it!"
"Thank you."
I opened the bag of potato chips and set it aside for him,
but... I didn't touch the bottle.
-Here, agafa'n.-Ah... thank you, really.

But, maybe... they touched it when the victim was distracted.
(At the same time) It's not true!
What these guys are telling you is true.
It's just that I've been looking at myself
and none of them touched the bottle
after Mr. Ushigome opened it.
I can assure you, I have seen it.
Marrec, are you that boy who was with Kogoro Fument?
(Think) "Fument? Fument, it was Fument!"
This means that that detective with the puny mustache is here, right?
Where is he? He's not here.
Mm.
Is he really?
But instead, today I'm with my friends.
Eh? (Ayumi) Conan!
(Ayumi) Conan!
The doctor is coming!
Do you feel?
Au, you tell him, too.
Mr. Ushigome has had the bottle in his hands
the whole time, right?
Eh?
Yes, understood.
It seems that while he was drinking his tea
he didn't pass the bottle to any of his colleagues...
Are you absolutely sure you've seen what he's saying?
I assure you.
Today he and the children met on the beach by chance.
They had never met before,
but he made an anguished sigh and we were worried about him.
-What sigh? - (man) Inspector!
Yes!
We found this vial at the feet of the corpse!
Yes.
(man) Really?
Let's see.
Mmmmm... There are no pills inside, but some kind of powder.
It looks like it contains some kind of poison
of the hydrocyanic acid family.
This is the bottle
in which the Ushigome carries his dietary supplement pills.
Eh?
Miss, are you telling me the truth?
Yes, I'm quite sure.
We've always seen you use the same one.
I can see it!
Forensic!
Yes!
Examine this jar and the tea bottle and the bottle cap, please!
(Children: whispers)
Take care of it, all of it.
What the heck is going on, kids?
Have you remembered anything that doesn't fit?
No, it's just that... You see... Could you smile for a moment, please?
Eh?
How do you say?
What do you mean?!
It's just that... you and that gentleman are identical.
He looks like an inspector we know
who has curly hair.
"Hello, children...! Are you all right? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
It's only natural that they look alike!
This gentleman is the younger brother of the inspector Yokomizo you know.
- (at the same time) What? (at the same time) -Really?
Sure, my brother told me something....
That with the Kogoro Fument...
"Sleeper, man!"
...there was a boy with glasses...
"A boy with glasses?"
...and a group of kids who thought they were detectives, playing the butterfly.
What do you mean?
It's not that we believe it, it's that we are!
We're the Junior Detective League.
That's right!
(Ai) They have the same face and voice...
But the way of speaking and the character are different.
Yes, it seems so.
But, I'm sorry.
Your intervention as the Junior Detective League has ended here.
-What do you mean by that? -What do you mean by that?
No one's touched the plastic bottle in question...
and we found inside the car a vial
containing the alleged poison that was used on this occasion.
And if the man was suffering to the point of worrying for a long time....,
it is clear that this is suicide!
So you heard me.
Go away!
I don't want any kids here!
Just disturb!
Spread the fog!
Wait a minute: we do no harm here!
You don't need to be so selfish!
Excuse me, is that stopper really the stopper of this very bottle?
Yes.
In fact, that's the only thing we found in the car.
And what you have deposited inside the stopper is not yet dry.
Moreover, the brand is the same! But don't you think it's strange?
Although there is blood adhering to the neck of the plastic bottle,
there's no blood on the stopper.
Mm?
It's true.
What?
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Why the hell is there blood on the bottle?
I don't know...
(Mitsuhiko) Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
(Girl) The Ushigome.
But didn't the Ushigome get a cut on her finger?
A cut?
I guess, while picking clams,
he must have cut himself on a broken shell or something else.
He must have been thinking about anything when he was harvesting them.
Surely it is true that he had cut himself.

The first time we have seen the Ushigome he was sucking his thumb.
That's how we knew that the rake with the blood-stained handle
that had been left on the beach belonged to that chubby man.
(And when we came to give it back to him...
...we have found this scene.
(Genta) Indeed.
He really has a cut in the index of the right hand.
The blood is already very dry.
That is to say, the first time he opened the stopper of the bottle,
the wound had not yet closed and he left it stained with blood...
But when he came to the car and when he was going to open the bottle again, he saw that the blood was still there,
he saw that the blood was there
and wiped it off the stopper before refilling the bottle.
But... I doubt that a person who wanted to commit suicide would wipe it off.
He didn't want to get in the way of the bird's flight....
I guess he wanted to end it in a polished way.
We'll wait for the coroner's results.
Until then, you guys will wait here in case we need you!
-Yeah..., you guys. -What a relief.
Yes...
This is a suicide.
A suicide!
"But what that person said doesn't fit me."
"Was it really a suicide?"
Indeed, that's quite a deduction.
Who, when and how is supposed to have given him the poison?
Let's see, who?
Now we can be sure.
One person is responsible for the facts.
And the next Conan:
