(Man) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for waiting!
We are proud to introduce you to Kevin Brown,
the candidate for the next vice-presidency of our city.
We welcome with a big applause!
(People: standing ovation)
(People) Viva!
Bravo!
You are the best!
Brown, vice president!
(cheering) Kevin!
(cheering) Kevin!
Kevin! Kevin!
(Pip) Kevin!

(Woman: call)
(Think) "Impeccable!"
500 yards... passed!
Now it's your turn!
(Pip, pip)
(Gunshot)
That's impressive.
600 yards passed!
Kevin Brown dies 3 times, huh?
4.
As you can see, they are very good.
(Pip, pip)
Ha-ha-ha!
Too bad, kid!
If I get over this distance..., I will have won!
(Pip, pip)
It's already mine!
They've missed!
It seems that their limit is 600 yards.
-That's enough. (woman) Gin!
(woman) Hold on!
Let me try again.
It won't be necessary.
The next hunt will only require 200 or 300 yards.
(woman) Eh?
So...
(Gin) Chianti... Korn...
You have work to do.
What parsimony!
This is for today!
Forgive me!
Victory, sincerity, tests for truth.
An inexhaustible drive to try to be the best!
I finally get in touch with the Men in Black Organization.
Moments of tension.
Finally, a terrifying target is revealed!
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

(1ST PART)
(Woman) What do you think?
Did you like "Four minutes in the kitchen with Yoko Okino"?
Our guest today is the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
See you soon!
See you at the same time next week!
Here we are!
All right, we're done for the day!
We're done for the day!
- (man) You've done a good job! Thank you, likewise.
You've done very well, Father!
(man) It's true!
The program was live, but he kept his cool.
-It was fantastic! -No, it was a failure.
Yoko, you're so pretty...
the noodles got a little too hot...
and Yoko's soy sauce noodle soup I made..,
as you can see, I got hatched and sticky.
I'm a bit of a mess.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha....
(Think) "Here the only one hatched and sticky, is you."
But we got lucky!
As this "Ma√±anas en directo 7" coincided with a holiday,
we were able to come and watch the program live!
Uh... Yes.
(Guts: snoring)
Oh...
By the way, we haven't had any breakfast yet.
What can I say?
Would you like breakfast at the chain restaurant?
Yes!
What a good idea!
Then go over there and wait for him!
Mr. Mouri, there's someone I want you to meet.
-I'll do a trick for you right now. Huh?
Yes...
Hello.
Good morning, I'm Okino.
You were sleeping?
Hey, what's wrong?
What's wrong?
No... It's nothing, really...
"I'm ringing."
"Every time I see someone using a cell phone,
"I'm reminded again of the incidents with the Vermott
"And the number on the head of the Men in Black
"Who dwarfed my body with a drug..."
"That tune of the 'Seven Little Crows'..."
(They type in a cell phone: melody)
Listen to me carefully.
You shouldn't answer that number anymore.
It's a Pandora's box.
Yes, yes, yes... I know. I know. Vols say?
I should have ordered an omelet with rice.
(Yoko) Mr. Mouri!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Mmmm?
(Yoko) Ah.
He-he... Hello.
If I'm not mistaken,
you're on TV on Sunday night news, right?
Yes!
She's the anchorwoman.
It's Queen Mizunashi!
Oh... It's nice to meet you.
Ahem... I'm the famous detective Kogoro Mouri, miss.
I am her daughter.

This is in Conan.
Hello, how are you?
Nice to meet you!
-Let's go! -Hey? -Yeah...
Ya...
He-he-he-he-he-he-he...
But, Yoko,
you want me to talk to a famous detective like him about something like that?
Don't worry about it!
I'm sure Mr. Mouri will want to give you a hand!
-But, girl... -Is there something bothering you, Miss?
-Yes. -Oh!
Yoko, what are you thinking?
Ring the bell and run away?
You're asking me to take the person who bothers you itching the doorbell?
You see?
It's silly to have explained it to her!
But I have already told you that to me it does not seem to me a bad joke and quite a lot.
Let's see, what does it mean?
Eh... Look.
It happens that the person who rings the doorbell only does it...
on Saturday mornings.
Today I've been waiting for you
with the intention of catching him "in fraganti",
"But when I felt the doorbell ring, I opened the door and then..."
"There was no one anywhere."
No...
Since then I've been afraid to open the door at home.
And all this you explain happened in your house?
Yes, that's right.
It's an apartment in Haido.
Do something about it,
Why don't you let Mr. Mouri go to your house
and check that everything is okay?
I can't go because I have work to do, but...
Mr. Mouri, what do you say?
Yes...?
At first sight,
there doesn't seem to be any feasible hiding place near the door, right?
No.
Just a moment!
Why don't we try ringing the bell, see what happens?
Are you ready?
Attention!
Now ring it!
(Dong-dong)
(Door: CLEC)
Ah! Father?
Oh! (Door: CLEC)
Are you all right?
Yes.
I'll survive...
But now we know for sure I wouldn't have enough time to find a hiding place.
Yeah... Now we can talk in more detail at your house.
-Of course.
Please, passi. Thank you very much.
Here's some sabatilles.
Don't bother, it's not necessary.
There are no slippers for children!
Ah, thank you very much!
Please follow me.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
That's nothing, I find it has a pile of locks.
That's right... It has 4!
Let's see, a woman who lives alone must protect herself.
Sure..., you're right about that.
What would you like to drink? -A coffee, if you'd be so kind.
I'll help you prepare it!
(thinks) "Let's go!"
"I think I'll put a microphone
"To pick up the sound outside the door when the doorbell rings."
"I'll place it outside the wall, on the other side of the door."
"If I place it here, I can easily retrieve it later."
"And I will also put a transmitter with a piece of gum on it.
"lest it come unstuck and get lost."
"All right, all set!"
Eh?
"Now... Now I've noticed as if someone was watching me."
Conan?
Flies a fruit juice?
Hm.
What's wrong? No, it's going great.
Understood.
So I'll get you a fruit juice!
"It was just... my imagination?"
Mmm... So, someone's been knocking on your door for two months.
Yes, it always knocks at half past one, 7 o'clock on Saturday morning, exactly.
Did something happen 2 months ago?
The only thing I remember is
that I switched from "Mornings Live 7"
to Sunday night news.
I'm not the main anchor though.
So, you met Yoko at "Mornings Live 7"?
Yes... At that time, we were both doing our program...
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
This means that, indeed,
this practical joke would have started two months ago.
Yes, because on the Saturdays that "Mornings Live 7" was on the air,
he left home at 4 am.
Throughout these 2 months, have you been continually made this joke?
Exactly, every Saturday without fail.
Oh, but one day there was an exception.
I had been abroad.
Not last week, but the other week,
I went abroad from Monday to Friday to cover some news.
And on Saturday, the day after I came home, nothing happened.
I guess I was so tired I didn't feel the doorbell ring.
Oh, and on a Tuesday...
that was after the three-day holiday in October,
they did the same thing to me.
That was the only time
I got that practical joke on a Tuesday.
And once I found something strange outside the door.
A strange thing?
There I found a bottle with some kind of pills in it!

I asked an acquaintance of mine who is a doctor to look them over
and he told me they were sleeping pills.
So-somniferous?
This is the stuff of a stalker.
It's probably a warning
to let her know he's planning to put her to sleep and do nasty things to her.
Oh, no!
Did you notice anything unusual?
Other than the sleeping pills at the door?
Apart from that...
-Ah! -Is there anything?
The day before yesterday, it seems that there was someone in the apartment next door,
which is theoretically empty.
Co-how do you say?
If it was the day before yesterday, it means it was Tuesday.
Yes... I noticed before midnight.
I had just finished bathing and was in bed relaxing when...
(Pip-pip)
"Convinced that the apartment next door was empty,
"I went out onto the terrace to see what was going on."
"The apartment next door was dark,
"so I thought the noise had come from outside."
So I called the company that manages the block in the morning,
but I swore and swore I'd dreamt it.
Mm... It's quite likely that the man you saw was the stalker.
That man had the master key to the apartment next door,
and not only would it be the day before yesterday,
"but especially on Friday nights."
"He was to spend the night in the apartment next door.
"And the next day, he was to ring the doorbell at home."
Of course, if he gets into the apartment next door,
he can hide right after ringing the doorbell.
This would explain perfectly why the suspect was not found.
Excuse me, how long ago did the apartment next door become vacant?
Well... more or less, I think it's been... about 6 months ago...
I see the door is securely locked.
Maybe we'll find some clues about that man if we go inside...
and look around the apartment a little bit.
Why don't we call the manager and ask him to open the door?
(Queen) I don't know, the last time I spoke to him..,
he didn't seem very cooperative.
"It won't open."
("Thank you for everything")
