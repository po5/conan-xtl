Today we are all in grave danger.
Our tent is mistaken for another tent
and the Ran is in an unexpected crisis.
He looks like a child but has the brain of an adult and is Detective Conan!

(Genta) We make a turn, we make a turn!
He-he-he-he!
Hard to believe it was pouring rain yesterday!
It's true... now you can't see a single cloud.
Ah... we could say it was a passing typhoon.
(Mitsuhiko) Let's go camping!
Let's go camping!
What fun!
Are you finished reading it?
Yes, I found it so interesting that I spent the whole night reading it.
"Sleeping Beauty in danger?
What a dream I have.
Yes...
It's a story about some men who try to awaken a princess
who has been asleep for many years.
And the one who succeeds will be able to marry her.
(Ayumi) How romantic.
(Mitsuhiko) But if she's been sleeping for so many years, she must not be alive anymore.
If she is given nutrients intravenously, she can resist!
I'm sure she was just pretending to be asleep
because no suitor appeared to weigh her down...
Hey, Conan, have you read the book?
- (laughs)
-You're spoiling my sleep.
(Mitsuhiko) "Time limit: 15 hours."
- (Mitsuhiko) Yes!
- (Genta) We'll take the best place!
They've taken the place under the tree.
This is the only place where there's shade...
(Mitsuhiko) All set.
Hey, Misa, can you pass me that pickaxe?
Eh?
A pickaxe?
What's that?
They're like nails.
They're to put them in the ground.
Look, they're there.
You should have said so in the beginning.
After all, it's my first time camping.
Ah, sorry, sorry.
Don't worry, I'll get them.
Why the hell do I have to stay in a crappy tent!
Couldn't you get one like that?
They don't rent those kind of tents.
That's why I'm asking you why ours is a rental.
Why haven't you gone to buy one?
Do me a favor!
If you wanted to bring me camping, it was common sense...
Go buy one right now!
"That one's touched by the mushroom..."
-Then, let's go to a boarding house.
-You know I can't do that.
I hate this store, do you hear me?
What's that?
I took you camping...
because I wanted to show you how much fun it could be.
Looks like someone's been here before.
Yes.
We could put it somewhere around here.
Yeah, we rush them!
We take the tents and plant-them!
Yes.
We're done!
Now let's put the girls' tent on that side!
(Horikoshi) Hey, wait a minute!
-Come on, Misa, don't be like that.
(Horikoshi) -No!
I can't take it anymore.
-Misa!
-I'm going home right now!
Great, it looks like they've left the place free!
Lucky you!
Hurry up!
Come on, Conan!
"Wow, what vitality..."
This time he's ridden it really fast.
Yes.
The second time is always easier.
You shouldn't exert yourself too much and go to sleep right away.
I'm all right, girl.
I'll be in the breach until I finish making the curry rice.
Because I guess you must be hungry...
Eh?
What's the meaning of this?
Why did they put the tent here?
This is our place!
But, Miss, you said you were leaving, don't you remember?
Well, it's also true but...
Is it true that you said so?
Have you changed your mind?
Eh?.... What is this?
It can't be!
This is our place!
But we have already put up our tent!
We've only gone to change the tent so that the one before had a hole!
Come on, come on!
Remove your damn tent here!
Okay, I get it.
- (all) What?
-Come on, let's get the tent out.

Let's see, it is true that these young people had arrived first, right?
Very well, then take the tent out of the way, come on.
You can leave it where it is.
But Misa, what are you saying?
They said they would take it out right away.
We can put the tent anywhere.
But this is the best place there is!
Right under this tree.
Excuse me, selected.
(Misa) Shit!
(Misa) You should cut them into smaller pieces.
(Misa) Eh?
When you make curry at home
you can take all the time in the world to boil the garnish.
-You know a lot.
-But here, this can't be done, right?
Let me just a moment.
Maybe it doesn't look like it, but I'm very good at home cooking.
How well you've done it!
That's good!
-I don't mind.
-What happened with your boyfriend? -What happened with your boyfriend?
Because we've already broken up.
- (Ai) Eh?
Women... we sense this kind of thing...
-I'd say so, wouldn't you?
-That's enough...
These camping facilities are fantastic.
Yes.
Now there's everything.
Eh?
Maybe he's woken up by now.
Help us!
Please, someone help us, hurry!
-The Ran, they've kidnapped the Ran!
-What's happened?
Madonna!
-Ran, where are you?
-Ran!
What a mess.
Where did he go?
They are not here!
"Coi! Why did he take the Ran?!"
(Engine: starts up)
Ran!
Conan!
"Who the hell could it be?"
Inside he smells like some kind of drug....
Looks like he's been put to sleep with some kind of sleeping pill.
The car he fled in was stolen.
I'm sure we'll be able to find it right away with a check.
Yes, I hope so...
"The question is why they hijacked the Ran."
"There are supposed to be many other people at this campsite."
How can you talk like that?
You're irresponsible!
You're the one who said to go spend the night in a guesthouse,
so... we hurry them up and leave.
They've kidnapped a friend of the people we met today!
(Horikoshi) Misa, this has nothing to do with us.
(Misa) Yes it does!
You're such an asshole!
He's still breathing!
(Agasa) This is the footwear worn by the man who hijacked the Ran?
There is no doubt.
It's the same thing that man was wearing.
This means that they have caught the kidnapper?
Let's see, the car fell down a cliff near here.
These are the shoes worn by the driver of the car.
He's now unconscious in the hospital.
Eh?
And the Ran?
What happened to the Ran?!
We don't know anything...
The car was a normal utility car and they haven't found the Ran anywhere.
From what we've seen on the driver's license,
the driver was Masayuki Takada, 25 years old.
(Agasa) There seems to be a half-written message that has not been sent.
The police have concluded that the cause of the accident is that he was typing the message while he was driving.
is that he was writing the message while driving.
What then?
What is known about this message?
Mmm... It looks like he has an accomplice.
I guess in Takada
is the person who committed the crime on behalf of someone else.
Mmm... There seems to be another file...
Doctor, let-let me have a moment.
"Sports shoes..."
They're rubber boots for fishing.
What's this doing here?
(Agasa) Is it the Ran?
No, it doesn't look like it...
(Agasa) "Sure! The store, it's the store!"
(Misa) If you insist on leaving, I will never want to hear from you again.
Do as you please!
I will not spend my life putting up with an arrogant woman like you.
To you, I'm nothing but a slave to your moods.
I've had it up to here.
(Pip-pip-pip)
Why didn't you answer my call?
I've called you a bunch of times.
You've kidnapped the wrong girl...
Masayuki Takada is in the hospital because of the accident.
The police called you from his cell phone.
Speak up!
Where's the Ran?
Say!
I don't know... I really don't know.
I asked Takada
to take the girl from the tent under that tree.
But thanks to a ridiculous mistake,
other people have taken the place.
I tried to get in touch with him a few times,
but in Takada he had his phone disconnected...
This picture is quite blurry.

Depending on how you look at it, it may look like Ran.
How is she related to Takada?
One morning, at a train station, I saw in Takada?
a man was kicked onto the train tracks.
I followed him thoroughly and made sure
that I could get in touch with him.
A few days later,
I asked him to kill the Mass and he didn't refuse.
Because I told him I would pay him one million yen.
Why are you doing this to her, at Mass?
Because she is a hindrance to my life.
She is very selfish, extravagant,
and on top of that, she's like a woodworm, do you understand?
I couldn't tell her that we were leaving each other...
but I wasn't willing to throw my life away on her.
This is what the Mass should say.
You're... disgusting.
I'm so smoky, I'm detested,
but endangering the life of an unknown person is unforgivable.
Where is she?
To know... She must already be dead.
(All) Hey?!
La Ran is alive.
For sure.
Conan...
At least, until 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
I put it in the half-sent message.
It says the girl will die at 3 pm.
Let's go get her, come on.
(We only have half an hour!
(Genta) Hurry up!
Come on, let's go.
We'll hear her story at the station.
Why are we looking for her by the river?
In Takada, the perpetrator of the crime was wearing high fishing boots.
It's been about 40 minutes between Ran's abduction and the accident.
He couldn't have gone far.
Yes... In this period of time he changed vehicles.
And it was chest-high boots.
It must be close by.
There are 20 minutes left.
If he changed cars in Takada, it is likely that he left the Ran to...
Let's look for the 4x4, quick!
-So much.
-Yes.
Don't do anything crazy.
Notify me immediately that you find it!
"Ran, where the hell should you be? Coi."
"It's... it's the reservoir dam..."
Doctor, it's the intake!
We looked there!
Yes.
Okay, okay, okay!
But we can't dawdle!
I'm going over there!
Oh, no!
Now they'll open the shot!
(Siren)
So, Takada's 3 o'clock message was about this.
This is the place where they will release the water and the car will sink!
(Siren) Doctor!
(Siren) Doctor!
Don't get it!
Look at it!
There's moss.
This means that the water level will reach that point.
Even the cars would be submerged.
Really?
It's there!
Conan!
You guys, don't come!
Stay where I've been paid!
Ran... Thank God.
Damn it!
I can't!
We tried to break the glass with it.
It's really hard, huh?
(Man) Running the periodic discharge!
(Man) Understood!
What is this siren?
No!
Don't tell me that...!
(Man) Fantastic!
All right!
Ran, wake up!
Get up!
Get up!
-It has stopped.
-The alarm...
This looks bad, Conan!
Looks like the water level is rising!
But, Conan...
Come back, both of you!
Don't worry, let me take care of it.
Hurry up on it!
Hey, wait a minute!
Can you tell us what you're doing here?
Only authorized personnel may enter!
I know that.
There are some children...
There are some children in the river...
Please close the dam gates!
Hurry up!
What's that?
What's he saying?
Conan!
"I only have one chance to try to escape."
Look.
In Conan has serious problems.
We're in danger here too.
We climb up there!
-Conan!
-Conan!
Now!
Genta, catch!
Yes, trust me, Conan!
All right, let's all pull at the same time!
- (at the same time) Yes.
-Yes, of course we will help you!
I hope you're all right.
(at the same time) Conan...
Forgive me, please.
Everything happened because of me...
Forgive me!
I seem to have slept too much.
Oh, I'd also like to eat some curry rice.
What's wrong with everyone?
Nothing at all... We're just a little tired.
Hey, what about Conan?
He's exhausted and now he's sleeping in the boys' tent.
Apa, he always does the same thing.
He starts playing and moving around all the time
and then he gets so exhausted that he can't even move.
So much is... Eh?
Ah!
But... why am I in my pajamas?
How is it?
How embarrassing!
"Come on, let's go..."
