(Shinichi voice) "This time we have traveled to Kanazawa."
Uh-huh.
Look at this.
Have you seen it, Conan?
This is the Tsuzumi Gate!
It's called that because its shape is reminiscent of a tsuzumi drum.
Yes!
It's much bigger than I thought.
-Mm?
- (man) Mr. Mouri?
(Shinichi's voice) "Kogoro has been asked to help out
"in an event to revitalize the city...
called 'Mystery Itinerary in Kaga Hyakumangoku'."
How do you do?
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Yuzo Tanimoto and I work at the tourism office.
We hope you will have a nice day with us today.
And I am Moeko Miyazawa from the tourist office.
I am director Yuya Tadokoro from the organizing company.
Osamu Kuranishi, and I work for him.
I also work for him, my name is Harumi Akiyama.
Well, I am, as you may know..., the great detective Kogoro Mouri!
(Shinichi voice) "The lines of the hand are wicks,
the line of the heart lights the fire of deduction."
"To Kanagawa arranges an itinerary full of deductions."
"A mystery as big as Hyakumangoku!"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and is Detective Conan!"

(Conan's voice) "Mysterious itinerary in Kaga Hyakumangoku
(Part of Kanazawa)"
Well, this itinerary will take place in Kanazawa and Kaga.
The participants will have to decipher several riddles....
which, once solved, will lead them to several checkpoints.
They will also gather a series of clues
to solve a mystery and deduce who the culprit is.
-Yes.
-You say there will be checkpoints?
There will be different tourist spots in Kanazawa and Kaga
that will be checkpoints in the game.
Of course there will!
So we can go sightseeing while solving the proposed mystery.
Exactly, you will have to solve the mystery...
by deciphering the riddles that will be given to you at each checkpoint,
as you collect clues.
Isn't it?
It looks like a lot of fun!
That's why the Akiyama has already thought of all the riddles
that we will find in the clue game.
Mr. Mouri, we would like you to come up with a mystery...
that could serve as a backdrop to this difficult case.
We thought of calling it: "The challenge of the great detective Kogoro Mouri."
-I agree!
-It's brilliant, don't you think?
Now I understand my presence.
Count me in!
Because I, the great Kogoro Mouri, have successfully solved a lot of cases,
and many of them were hopeless.
I will prepare an exceptionally difficult case for you, you'll see!
If you don't mind, we have a proposal.
Today, to see how the itinerary works,
we would like you to do it yourself
and solve all the riddles.
This way we will go through all the checkpoints.
-Wow!
-What do you say?
Is that okay with you?
Apparently, they want to test the great detective Kogoro Mouri, eh?
Okay, then.
I accept the challenge with pleasure!
All the checkpoints
are located at iconic tourist sites listed in the guidebook.
Wow, that's nice, thank you very much.
This is the riddle of the first checkpoint you have to solve.
Ah!
We start right away, eh?
All right, let's see...
"You'll see him picking fleas off in front of a mirror."
What?
But... what does this mean?
"Removing" and "fleas" are in different handwriting.
Let's see?
"Remove" and "fleas".
Remove fleas, take out fleas...
Right on!
I got it, that's it!
We must remove the characters of the word "fleas" from the sentence!
If we do that, the sentence is...
"Before... the Kaga Hot Spring".
Mm-hm, you're right!

"Before the Kaga Hot Spring!"
"Kaga yu" means no more and no less than "Kaga Hot Springs"!
We'll see something before those hot springs, won't we?
But wait a minute, father.
Ha-ha-ha!
The Kaga hot springs include four different towns:
Yamanaka Village, Katayamazu Village,
Awazu village and Yamashiro village,
and all are hot spring villages.
But they are quite a distance from each other.
Also, the only word written with kanji characters is "mae".
I think this might be a clue.
Normally we read this character as "mae", but....
it could also be read as "zen".
"Zen", you say?
Then, we would read... "you will see it in Kaga Yuzen".
Of course!
The place must be the Kaga Yuzen!
Now that I think about it, Kaga Yuzen sounds very familiar, it could be...
It's here!
He says it's a center of traditional industries!
And he says it's a very touristy place that everyone can visit!
-Mm?
-Correct answer!
You are a great detective, but you have some very sharp assistants!
Gee, I guess they're right... Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Come on, Kogoro, you're having a hard time tying things up..."
Gee..., how a good dress can change us!
You look so pretty!
I find it suits you very well!
Yes?
Are you serious?
By the way, Miss Akiyama, this watch you're wearing...
it's big and looks like a man's.
They've become fashionable, haven't they?
Well, I don't make it to be fashionable.
It's a watch I inherited from my older brother.
I'd like to wear something a little more feminine,
but I can't afford it.
Really, thank you very much!
This is the riddle of the next checkpoint.
Well, at this precise moment in the game,
the participants in the itinerary would receive the first key to the case.
Okay, then.
That's very clear.
And the... the next riddle is... is...
Eh?
"Know" and four circles?
I'm sure I have to put four letters in the circles.
Let's see..., "know someone"?
"Know thing"?
Ah!
"Meet UFO", maybe?
Hey, I think I've already found it!
Father, stop talking nonsense!
"Four circles", in Japanese is called "Wa-shi",
and sometimes it also has the meaning of "candy"!
So, the place where we can get to know the local sweets is....
Got it!
Ishikawa Tourist Center!
-Very good deduction, nano!
-Correct answer!
It didn't take the great detective Kogoro Mouri to solve the riddle, eh?
Yes..., you can say that, right.
Listen, guys, be considerate, okay?
But father...
Be careful not to make me look bad!
Mmm...
Ouch...
Eh? (Woman) Aaah!
(Woman) Aaah!
A thief!
(Woman) -Ah!
Aaaah!
-Quiet!
Fuck!
I'll get you for this, you bastard!
You idiot...
Miss, who hurt you, that jerk?
I'm fine.
Thank you, you're an angel!
You are very kind.
I repeat, thank you very much!
-You didn't hurt yourself, Mr. Mouri?
-No, I'm perfectly fine.
What a man... most insolent and repellent.
The next time we see him we must catch him.
I don't think we'll have any more trouble, Kanazawa is a very safe place.
Look this way.
If you want, I'll take a picture of you later.
(Shinichi, think) "Is it my imagination or do I have the feeling that they're looking at me?"
Don't you want to try it?
-Ha-ha-ha!
Potato!
-Come on, smile.
(Shinichi voice) That couple again.
We keep finding them!
(Shinichi, thinks) "No way!"
Listen, now we'll take a break and go eat at Omicho market.
(Woman) "We are at the Komatsu Hikiyama Cultural Center,
also known as Miyossa,
which is located in the city of Komatsu."
What ?!
Mr. Kuranishi, are you engaged to Miss Akiyama?
Well, yes.
It's official, we plan to get married next spring.
Just when the new Hokuriku bullet train will start running.
Well, that's really good news.
Wow!
You were so quiet about it, that.
You're a very lucky boy.
The company doesn't prohibit romantic relationships between employees, does it?
(All) Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(All) Huh?
Yes, say.
By the way, Miss Miyazawa.

How does he carry this heavy bag?
You could have left it in the bus, couldn't you?
What?
Ah!
Well, look...
Are you carrying something very important?
Hey, Conan, will you shut up?
It's rude to ask a woman these things!
It's all right.
Yes, you're right... I apologize.
"Local news."
"On May 6, 2010, an elderly man living alone...
"suffered a brutal assault in Kanagawa City..,
"and was robbed of five million yen...
that he inexplicably kept in his home."
"Yesterday, several years after the incident,
the alleged assailant was arrested."
"A police spokesman said
that the suspect denies all charges."
How can that be?
From the photo he doesn't look like a bad person, does he?
Make no mistake: in my experience,
criminals almost always look innocent.
What if it's a wrongful accusation?
-That's true.
-It could have serious consequences.
It could even ruin the life of the accused.
Miss Akiyama, is something wrong?
Are you not feeling well?
What's wrong?
I'm...
Yes, it's nothing.
Don't worry about it.
Mm!
But it's delicious!
I'm sure this would go great with a glass of sake!
Eh?
You look worried.
What's wrong with you?
Gee, I was just thinking that there's a lot of good stuff here!
Yes, it's true.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Looks like that couple is gone."
-Yes, but I haven't found them anywhere.
-Have you looked for them yet?
I don't know, I must have left them somewhere.
Well..., what's wrong?
Yes, it seems that Miss Akiyama has lost the riddle cards.
Come to think of it, they still haven't had time...
to give us the riddle for the next checkpoint.
But I remember this one perfectly well.
I will make you the new card right away, don't worry.
Gee...
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Here, Mr. Mouri, I'm sorry it's handmade.
Here's the new riddle that will take you to the next checkpoint.
Take it.
Let's see...?
Ahem.
I assure you, I will not show you another one.
"U, zero, 1,050, 10..."
"10, 5, 6"..., aaa...
Hey, Ran, can you pass me the guide, please?
Mmm... Here, I got it!
"10, 5, 6, To-go-ro"!
Togores!
This ge will mean "gold", and the sword would be "Ken" to "Kenroku".
So, this makes reference in Kenroku's garden, right?
I congratulate you!
Correct answer.
He nailed it, Mr. Mouri.
Fantastic, father!
(Shinichi, think) "How strong! Kogoro's getting the hang of it."
It was as easy as pie!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Hey, but who is this Togores?
A long time ago, a man named Togores and he grew sweet potatoes,
he found alluvial gold
while washing sweet potatoes in this very creek.
That's why it was known as "the stream from which gold was taken",
which in Japanese is called "Kanazawa".
For this reason, to decipher the enigma....
I had to read "Togores and gold".
It's amazing that you knew that!
Any adult with two fingers in front would know that.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
So, let's go to Kenroku's garden.
Well, the Akiyama and I still have some things to prepare.
-You know?
I'm coming too.
We'll meet up later.
Kuranishi, you want to be with her so badly that you have to follow him?
That's not true!
I don't usually mix work and love!
All right, here's the next riddle.
Oh... What the fuck is this?
I have to decipher the images, right?
(Shinichi, thinks) "I guess it won't come out this time."
It's a rhombus, right?
And the middle one looks like an arrowhead.
Rhombus is "hishi", arrow, "ya", and chair, "kura".
Oh!
"Hishi-ya-kura"...
In Kanazawa Castle, isn't there a Hishiyagura tower?
Wow, you're right!
There is Hishiyagura, and it's Kanazawa Castle.
It is also correct!
Let's go then.
Kanazawa Castle is only four steps away!
Here's the next riddle.
-All right.
-You should know that this will be the last one.
No, Miss Akiyama, this is not the last one yet!

Oh, excuse me, I seem to have made a mistake.
Blow!
Really?
Don't worry, it's all right.
Say, don't you see anything special?
This riddle is really easy.
Yes, it's 21...
24 minus 3 is 21, am I wrong?
Ah, the Museum of Contemporary Art of the 21st Century!
-Ha-ha-ha!
-That's right!
There was no need to look any further.
It was a simple subtraction and that was enough.
This test was a little too easy, wasn't it?
I'm sorry, I couldn't think of anything else.
We are running a little short of time,
we might as well go to the Museum of the XXI Century.
Iah!
How dare you trip me up?
-Now he's going to pay for it!
-Mm?
Aaaah!
You're the thief who stole that bag before!
What went wrong, Mr. Mouri?
-Atura't!
Oh, let me pass!
Wait!
-Oh! -Oh!
-Oh..., oh!
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Where are you goin'?
Hey, stop!
(Kogoro) Stop!
Please don't run anymore!
Aaaah!
-Oh!
- (thumping)
Are you all right?
What's wrong, Conan?
Ay, ay, ay..., Miss Miyazawa, you didn't tell me you had so much strength.
Oh!
I told you to stop!
Huh?
What the hell is all this?
It looks to me like there's someone else hiding in there.
Mm?
You're the woman whose bag was stolen a while ago, aren't you?
But what are you, the thief and Miss Miyazawa all doing together?
I gather that the whole incident was staged.
That young couple was filming us from afar,
while Miss Miyazawa was filming us more closely
with the camera hidden in her bag.
I'm sorry.
It's a hidden camera to advertise the itinerary.
-Yes...
-A hidden camera?
Actually, this couple are the cameraman and his assistant.
And the thief and the woman are two actors that we hired expressly
because they will stage the theft of the bag.
And finally, Miss Akiyama and I were secretly recording everything.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Miss Akiyama too ?!"
Mr. Mouri, we were looking for her....
I'm so sorry, we just got caught.
May I know what it is, this mess you're making?
We are very sorry, now we will explain everything in more detail...
Let's go back to the castle, please.
Miss Akiyama!
Harumi?
Oh!
Harumi!
Hurry, call for an ambulance!
Right away!
Hey, you, stop filming!
This isn't a scene, it's for real!
(Shinichi, think) "Isn't this hidden camera?"
"Then why did Miss Akiyama...?"
"It doesn't look like it was a robbery."
"And if it had been the indiscriminate attack of an assailant.
there should be more victims."
"That is to say..., someone expressly attacked Miss Akiyama."
"And now I ask myself:" What's going on here?"

"Is that why you sent the Ran into the hospital,
