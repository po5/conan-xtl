The murder case on the eve of the wedding, part one.
(Heiji) Blow!
What a crowd!
(Girl) They make a procession?
It's always like that.
On Saturday, Shibuya is always packed to the rafters.
(Heiji) They look like fools, coming here.
It's like the Tenji temple parties in Osaka.
It's like the spring festivities at the Mint.
You call from the station, without telling us you're coming,
and ask us to show you around town...
What a nerve!
You didn't have anything to do, did you?
Since we had to come,
we wanted to take advantage of it to see Tokyo.
Why did you have to come?
For the wedding of the son of a friend of the mother's friend.
She was supposed to come,
but she dropped a pop tray on her foot and broke her toe.
Too bad!
Instead of her, you and Kazuha came.
-Well, she was added at the end... I wasn't added!
I didn't want to come,
but his mother asked me to come with him to keep an eye on him.
Ouch!
You just wanted to come to buy clothes!
Do you want us to go to a store I know?
I know, where I want to go, I have it under control.
Wow...
Oh, how nice!
What do you think?
Does it fit?
Sure it does.
Everything suits you...
If you like it, buy it, your fingers will take it.
Yes, you're right.
Gee, what should they do?
I still don't see them.
This that we have been told that we afanyéssim.
Hey... What do you want?
How is it, you're angry?
You're mad at me, right?
What's wrong with you?
I'm going the same way.
What?
This sweater.
It has the same stripes as Heiji's.
Wow... it's a coincidence.
And the day you came to Osaka, you were wearing a turtleneck sweater like his.
Agree.
This must stop!
What a bad feeling!
He thinks that people who wear the same...
Eh?
But we are in the middle of the street!
Look at this!
Now we won't look alike, right?
Ah, Ran, you're a good girl!
Did you find it?
(Heiji) This is Meiji Temple, isn't it?
Kazuha, I'll pray that you'll always have slender legs.
You're such a fool!
Why, Ran, you've changed the sweater Eiri gave you.
It's just that it was sweaty.
I'm sorry, Ran.
Don't be sorry.
Hey!?
Sorry, kid.
What are you in Heiji?
Ah!
Shigematsu!
What a coincidence, meeting you here!
I thought you were already at the mansion.
Heiji.
Who is this man?
He's the butler who works at my mother's friend's house.
My name is Shigematsu.
How do you do?
-What are you doing here? -She accompanied him.
Before marrying someone from Tokyo, she wanted to get to know the city.
So, this girl is...
The Kaede, the girl who will marry tomorrow in Kikuhito.
My name is Kaede Katagiri.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Hey, how come Kikuhito didn't come with you?
I don't know.
Well, we told him to come...
It's my fault.
I said I wanted to go see Tokyo Tower.
Kikuhito is afraid of high places.
So what?
What did you wish for, Miss Katagiri?
To be able to have lots of children.
Have children?
You made a very strange face...
Before getting married, girls think a lot of things.
That's right.
It's the same emotion.
(At the same time) Isn't it?
They are friends.
That's a bad thing...
Blow!
What a mansion!
It's the same as when I was a kid.
It's all right, we'll come too?
Of course not.
If you want, you can stay for dinner.

(All) Oooooooh!
Sakuraba, this is not done, in front of the guests.
(All) Sorry.
The gentlemen's cat had escaped again.
(All) Oh!
How cute! Let's see?
Let's see?
Ouch!
That's too bad!
Rebecca, wait!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Ah, wow, it's you.
My little brother's princess...
I've been told that you're the daughter of a big businessman,
but... you can get ready now!
From today on, we'll teach you to follow the customs of this house.
Eh?
Yes...
Don't worry.
I'm your sister Yurie.
As I'm usually abroad, I won't be in your way.
Miss...
You're on business, huh?
You've only made a couple of visits, but you've already brought my brother down.
No, you're wrong, miss!
He fell in love first.
Well, you didn't tell me that.
-It's just that... -Never mind.
You made the proposal go through.
That's nice, isn't it?
Maybe the father will pay you back.
Ah, so, you're the famous detective...
Kogoro Mouri, at your service.
It's an honor to share a table with you, Mr. Mouri.
No, and now, the honor is mine.
I have always admired you detectives greatly.
How does it feel, when everyone praises the figure of a detective like you?
Well, when I solve a case easily, we could say that I feel as if...
as if I were in a dream.
Like in a dream?
Very well found!
Ouch!
Why do you say that?
Shigematsu, can you bring the camera?
I want to take a souvenir photo with Mr. Mouri.
Very well, sir.
Oh, and then, come by my room.
You've helped me a lot with the preparations for Kikuhito.
And I want to thank you properly.
Ask me for anything you want.
I'll do that.
Hey, Sakuraba, the cat has disappeared again.
-Could you go look for him, please? -Oh, yes.
This cat always goes his own way.
Since my mistress is missing...
Your mistress?
Yes.
The mother left us 4 years ago.
In an unfortunate car accident.
Excuse me, this is in Kikuhito, my son.
It went well, the visit to Tokyo, terrosset?
Yes, very well.
Terrosset? Let it heal!
(Heiji) When we come back from the wedding, we'll stop by the office.
(Kogoro) Very well. Goodbye tomorrow.
(Heiji) Good night.
(Kogoro) Good night.
-Phew! -Why are you blowing?
Heiji?
I've become calmer.
Whenever I'm with them something happens.
With Ran, her father and Conan?
It doesn't fail.
Whenever I've... (brittle)
-What's this? A second-story window!
Ran, watch that window!
Kazuha!
Call Shigematsu and tell him to come!
In that room over there!
Hey!
Open up!
What's wrong, in here?
-It won't open.
It's locked. Heiji!
What about Shigematsu?
Where is it?
It's very strange.
She hasn't been seen for a while.
She's disappeared!
Well... Shigematsu is the one who has all the keys to the house...
We forced the door!
Blood!
The trail goes to the other room.
What happened?
This looks bad.
(Girl calling)
What was it, this scream?
Hey!?
What happened?
-What is it?
What happened?
They murdered... the butler of the house.
Mr. Shigematsu.
-It can't be. What nonsense!
You're kidding, right?
-Kaede!
-Kaede!
What are you doing?!
Kaede, you're all right!
I've already called the police.
Until they arrive, no one is to move from here.
It's locked.
This one too.
Don't start messing it up!
I feel ?!
Let's see if I'll have to screw it up.
Ran, you've been watching this window the whole time, haven't you?
Did you see anyone come out?
No one's come out here, guys.
That means... Let's go!
Hey? (grunts)
Hey, hey, hey!
I told you not to potinegéssiu anything!
Sakuraba, the only one who had the keys to the house was in Shigematsu, right?
Yes.
There are copies of the key to this room?
No.
Everyone has a key to their own room,
but the ones for rooms like this, which are not used, he had them.
He kept them.
If so, let me just check one thing...
What is it?
That the key to this door we've forced is on this key ring.
And if it is, what?
Don't you understand?
We have burst that door because it was locked.

-Are you following me, Mouri? -Yes.
The two windows of the next room were closed,
and no one came out of the windows of this one.
So, if the only key was in Shigematsu's pocket?
I see what you mean.
You see what we're getting at, don't you?
This is a crime...
in a locked room.
Shigematsu may have locked up and committed suicide, right?
If so, the weapon he would have used would have been at his side.
It is evident that he has received a stab wound to the chest.
Someone has made the murder weapon disappear from this room....
like a fog!
Hey, hey, I'm getting married tomorrow, guys.
Let's get down to business.
Come on, let's get down to business.
Kikuhito, what are you saying?
How can you want to get married, with what happened?
Leave me alone, Yurie.
In fact, the dead man is not a Morizono.
Besides, I don't want to delay the honeymoon.
I feel sorry for Shigematsu, who has served us for so many years,
but the wedding will be held tomorrow as planned.
This way, Shigematsu's soul will rest in peace.
Won't it?
What do you think, eh?
Flights stop, Kikuhito?
Can't you see there's been a death?
More respect!
Shame on you!
For Sakuraba, orphaned since childhood, in Shigematsu was like a father.
Put yourself in his place!
Besides, he made me get this marriage proposal.
And not only that: he always went out of his way to help you in the company.
This is no way to talk about him!
And you, Sakuraba,
let this be the last time you lay your hand on a household member.
Because if you don't, you'll be out on the street.
Is that clear?
Yes.
Yurie, call Kaede's parents, please.
Tell them the wedding is off.
Aaah!
The dead man just moved!
Don't talk nonsense!
It can't be!
Well, if it isn't the cat.
Rebecca, come here
So, this cat has been all the time in the room?
Too bad he can't talk.
She really likes to be with Yurie!
She looks just like her mother.
A in Kikuhito and me only comes close when we give him food.
Sir, the cops are here.
What do you want me to...?
Ah.
Don't worry.
I'll receive them now.
What's wrong with your leg, sir?
I was also in the car my wife had the accident with.
I got away with it, but she...
-Mr. Morizono! -Has the butler been murdered?
Your son's wedding will have to be called off?
Questions later!
Later! (shouting)
Come on, do not emprenyeu!
It's not your turn!
Back off!
(All) Phew!
I am Inspector Megure.
Benvingut, inspector.
I have already been informed of the murder.
Mouri, it seems that where you go doors bad luck.
Ah, no, sir... This is my reputation.
It seems to me that it's the bad luck, that follows me.
A murder in a locked room?
Both the door and the windows were locked,
and no one came out of the windows of the next room.
Besides, the gun was not at the scene of the crime.
It was in a locked room.
So how did you know there had been a murder?
I was outside and suddenly this glass broke.
We went upstairs and knocked on the door.
As no one answered, we forced the door.
And we discovered the body.
Even so, it is hasty to conclude that it was a murder.
The victim could have stabbed himself in the chest with the gun,
break the window glass and throw her out.
No, it is impossible.
When we felt the breakage, nothing came out of the window.
What are you doing here? And what about the floor?
If I had thrown anything out of the window,
there would be more traces of blood.
These traces are that the killer dragged the victim here.
The glass can only have been broken in two ways:
either while the murderer and the victim were fighting,
or when, seeing us, the victim has broken it to make us come up.
What is certain is that when the glass was broken, the murderer was here.
(Takagi) Inspector!
When the body was discovered,
it had been an hour and a half since the service people
(Takagi) When the corpse was discovered, the service people had been talking about the wedding preparations over dinner for an hour and a half.
Therefore, the only ones who don't have an alibi are these 5.
Very well.
We will question each of them individually afterwards.

Let yourselves be searched and wait quietly.
Come on, officers, start searching the mansion and its surroundings.
The murder weapon cannot be far away.
Find it!
What, Kudo... How many do you have?
Me, 4. Vaja, for you there are 4 keys.
The first is that the murderer took the murder weapon.
He wanted to commit murder with the room locked.
If he had left the gun there, he would have made it look like a suicide.
The second is the blood trail from when he dragged the victim.
Why did he bother to carry him to the other room?
The third is that there was only light in the room where we found her.
And the strangest.
The cat!
The cat!
There's another one, but I don't remember.
Eh?
You too?
Please, Inspector...
let me help them.
This can't be!
Au, wait in the room with the others!
I can't just sit here and do nothing...
Hey, you, don't play the donkey!
When you do what you want, you cause us problems.
Let's see if you understand what position you're in!
Is it clear to you, you bastard!
Are you all right?
What an asshole, this Kikuhito!
I'm fine now.
Thank you very much.
Evenly matched!
What's that?
Eeeh?
-I don't mean the clothes, I mean the penjoll. -The pendant?
It was coming out of the collar of his shirt.
Sakuraba and Kaede wear the same pendant.
Isn't it strange?
Yes.
It was a strange pendant.
It can't be a coincidence.
Hey, Kudo!
Aah.
We already have the other key to solving the mystery.
We should look at the balcony next door.

DETECTIVE CONAN
To solve the mystery, we should look at the balcony next door.
Why?
To see if it is possible to jump all the way down without splitting your head open.
And who will do it?
There's something there!
What the hell are you doing? Aaaaah!
Kudo!
In the next chapter...
The murder case on the eve of the wedding, Part 2
The clue to the next Conan is... A bag!
Private detectives in action!
(Takagi) Let's try to find the culprit!
