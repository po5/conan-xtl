Who wouldn't want to have a good car
and feel a thrill behind the wheel as big as the price of the car?

THE CAR TRAP, (PART ONE)
How nice!
Wow.
You can see the sea!
It's beautiful!
By the way... Where is he, the escort?
That's strange, a moment ago he was walking with us.
(Kogoro) Eeei!
You guys rest, what a bar!
OSPA!
I think it's great that you win a first prize,
but the hotel could be more accessible or have buses.
Pareee!
Hurry up, man!
Come on!
In the boonies, that's it!
I already thought it was too nice.
You would have preferred the second prize, the free buffet, right?
Of course I would have!
Come on, man, don't be a spoilsport!
What do you want me to do?
Can someone tell me if there's still a lot left?
We're almost there!
Aw, cheer up!
It must be the house up here, the Kirigamine Hotel.
(Boy) If you'd be so kind as to fill in the form...
Mouri.
Mmm?
Ah, the Mouri, right?
Room 201.
I heard something...
It's very nice, the hotel,
but could you put a pick-up service at the station?
Coming all the way here is horrendous.
Deixa correr, will you?
I'm very sorry, sir.
Let me show you to your room, please.
Thank you very much.
Come on, Conan.
Conan?
Conan, where are you?
Where's he gone?
Ooooh!
What a cane!
It's fantastic!
What's up, Conan?
What the hell are you doing?
You always have to mess it up, you.
This is a show!
It's full of fantastic cars!
That's right, it is.
This is a Jaguar XK120!
It's characterized by the elongated, curved nose,
features that make it look like a real Jaguar.
Many Jaguar collectors yearn to own this car!
And look at this one!
It's a Mercedes Benz 300SL, the "gullwing".
They called it that because it opens the doors upwards,
like a seagull spreading its wings.
It's true!
Well, look!
Isn't that a Cadillac over there?
Yes, the Cadillac Eldorado.
It's a '53 convertible!
They say it's the most powerful model of the American brand.
They only made 500,
and he says that, once they were in the dealerships,
they sold out overnight.
Collectors still talk about the Eldorado legend!
(Boy) I see you know a lot about us, kid.
This is the new antique car show we have at the hotel.
They are very nice.
The owner is a great lover of motoring.
You might say he's had the hotel remodeled just for this room.
Oh.
That's strange, there seems to be a car missing.
Yes, it's a space reserved for Mr. Teraizumi's car,
a Ferrari Dino.
What's that?
A Ferrari Dino?
It's not a 206GT by any chance?
Yes, boy, it sure is.
Ostreees!
What car is this, Conan?
How special is it?
Only 152 units were made,
and it's almost impossible to find one today.
Dino was what they called Alfredino Ferrari,
the only son of Enzo Ferrari, the creator of the brand.
He died in 24 years,
but he contributed to develop the engine of this car, before.
That's why Enzo Ferrari decided to name this fantastic car after his son.
to this fantastic car.
A car with history.
(Man) Suguro!
What's wrong, the receptionist is not in his place?
What are you doing?!
Oh... Excuse me.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
The exhibition doesn't open until tomorrow.
Until then, you can't enter the hall.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
This man... I know him.
I'm glad you arrived safely, sir.

This car is worth more than my life,
but driving it all the way from Tokyo exhausts me.
You have to be very attentive.
Sir, the rest of the cars are all in place.
I suggest you put yours.
Yes, yes, man, yes, but wait a little, it does not overwhelm me.
This car is my friend, I want to spend some time!
Once it's in there, I won't be able to take it out whenever I want.
Excuse me, sir, look at this.
A detective?
Au.
What's that supposed to mean?
There's only one bed!
Don't complain so much.
Be thankful it's free, man.
They expect all 3 of us to sleep in the same bed?
Either we change rooms or we're going bad!
We have the couch, too.
(thinks) "He-he-he. He's a spoiled brat."
(Man) Quiet, let-me-me!
The opening will take place tomorrow at 3.
Today is the last chance...
That's right, don't suffer.
Everything as planned, okay?
Conan, you're not coming in?
Let go of me, Ran! You're a pain in the ass, eh, father?
It doesn't cost them anything, they're not even full.
I want a bigger room!
But then they'll make you pay for it, won't they?
And this hotel isn't cheap.
If you make them too dizzy, you'll make them throw us out, father!
- (door: knock) -Huh?
- (door: knock-knock) - (man) Mr. Mouri?
(Kogoro) A threat?
Let's see what he says...
He arrived a few days ago.
The service and I have been brainstorming what to do...
We've finally decided to ask him.
Man, it doesn't have a very threatening tone for a threat.
You mean it's not a bad joke?
I hope you're right.
But just in case, I'd like to ask you to be alert.
-We want the famous detective Kogoro Mouri to contribute...
...to make this a success.
My advice is to call the police.
If you accept the assignment, as a special favor,
the hotel agrees to reserve this suite for you, the best we have,
so that you can enjoy them with your companions.
The special suite?
Really?
Father!
Very well done!
You're on!
I accept!
-We are very grateful to you. It's a rest, having you here.
Go to sleep peacefully, I'll take care of everything.
Ha-ha-haaa!
(Chimes)
By the way, Ran.
Do you want to go for a drive with the car tonight?
You mean... with the Dino?
Wow!
And me, can I come along, Mr. Teraizumi?
Of course you can.
Can we go with Mr. Teraizumi, father?
What a vice!
This steak is the best I've ever tasted!
This is dinner!
Ya soooom.
What a delight!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Can I eat more?
Hell, no!
Did it stain your clothes?
Don't suffer, it's going.
Father, you've had too much to drink!
Sir!
In the showroom!
Quick, you must come!
But... what's wrong?!
(Man) Let me go, don't catch me!
(Boy) Calm down, Mr. Otake.
Don't do it!
Please don't!
Leave me alone!
Don't grab me!
I'll finish what I've started!
I'll finish what I've started!
Quiet!
It's crazy!
Quiet!
I'll destroy this damn car!
Mr. Otake, what the hell are you doing?!
This car was the apple of your eye, man!
Calm down.
Oh!
What do you mean?!
You want to damage your own car!?
Let's see.
Mr. Otake, how can you do that?
You have no idea how I feel!
Let go of me!
Please explain it to me.
I'll tear the whole damn room apart!
I'll tear it apart!
(Otake) This car, the '53 Edorad,
was my life's dream.
I worked day and night to save the money it was worth.
And I finally bought it.
And how could you even think of damaging it, if you love it so much?
Look, kid, I'd rather have it damaged and in my hands than give it to someone else.
Here it is, what happens.
To someone else?
What do you mean by this?
(laughs) Ask Mr. Teraizumi.
He will explain what I mean.
He will explain it to you.
(Kogoro) What's going on here, Mr. Teraizumi?
It's all a misunderstanding...
Otake, you should be thanking me,
instead of being so angry.
Thank you for what?
Thank you for what?
There is no one who wants to see these cars on display here.
Only you, of course.
(Boy) You're right.

I understand that Mr. Otake thought of destroying his own car.
And it is true that no one wants it, the exhibition,
apart from Mr. Teraizumi.
Wait a minute, who are you?
My name is Shinsuke Sagara.
I had to give my Mercedes Benz to Mr. Teraizumi.
And I'm Joji Kameoka, the former owner of the Jaguar.
This man set us up to take our cars!
It's outrageous!
Nonsense.
If you lost the cars, it was his fault!
Don't blame me!
Explain yourself.
You mean you cheated them?
Each of us had our own little business.
That's what we were doing.
My is a travel agency.
-I have a real estate company and I have a car repair shop.
The crisis affected all of us and we couldn't get out of it.
Then Teraizumi offered us loans at a very low interest rate if we gave the cars as collateral.
if we gave our cars as collateral.
We accepted.
We were in a hurry.
We fell on all fours!
We didn't know until later,
that he had been pulling strings to hurt our business.
There was no way to pay on time
and he kept the cars for us.
That's what he wanted from the beginning,
that's why he offered us the loans!
But how can they say that about me?
Can they prove that I have damaged their business?
If you have the drive to slander me,
invest-get the money you owe me to pay me back,
and I'll return your cars without any trouble.
Shut up, thief!
Hey... You don't scare me at all, you people.
Of course, there's the one who sent you, the threat...
The thing is clear.
-What threat? -What are you talking about?
Don't pretend.
Look, tomorrow we'll open the exhibition, whether you like it or not!
(thinks) "The shoes!"
(Sagara) Quiet, let me-let me!
The opening will be tomorrow at 3 o'clock. Today is the last chance.
Just the same, don't suffer.
Everything as planned... OK?
Listen, Mr. Sagara, where are you staying, you?
In 202.
Why do you want to know that, kid?
No, it's just that... I really like your car...
and I thought maybe you could talk to me a little after dinner.
Oh, uh... Not today, sorry... I have other plans.
What kind of plans?
You don't have to do anything, man.
Well... That's also true.
Room service?
I didn't order anything.
You mean you didn't get confused?
No, sir, you are Mr. Teraizumi's guest...
and you will receive very special treatment.
Please let me know if you need anything.
Man, if you insist!
I'd like to have a glass of wine, I...
Burgundy, if possible.
Ah, no, no way!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I apologize that the father has stained it.
I apologize again.
Don't suffer, it was nothing.
I changed right away.
(Car: accelerations)
Oh!
It's the Dino's engine.
Yes, I feel an engine too, but I feel it very weak.
I'm convinced, it's the Dino.
Are you sure?
(Car: accelerations)
Mr. Teraizumi, but where, at this hour?
Those people have put me in a bad mood.
I'm going to get some air.
There's bad visibility, sir, I don't think it's a good idea.
It's safer than spending the night with that bunch of crazies, believe me!
(Accelerations: bromine, bromine)
(Kogoro) Very well, but drive carefully, sir.
(Teraizumi) Yes, man!
(Chimes)
Hey, Mr. Teraizumi hasn't come back yet.
But how is that possible?
It's already 9 o'clock in the morning!
Where has he gone?
(Kogoro) He's still not here?
(Yawns noisily)
Well, we're all fixed up.
In any case, the opening is not until 3 o'clock.
Don't worry, there's still plenty of time.
Don't think it over.
The Dino must get ready for the exhibition,
and the guests start arriving around noon.
I think it's strange that he hasn't called to let us know.
It's been many hours.
He's still not back, that lunatic?
Mr. Kameoka, Mr. Otake.
If only he'd had an accident and couldn't come back.
-Farewell to the inauguration. It would be God's punishment.
Hey, aren't you carrying a cell phone, Mr. Teraizumi?
Oh, you're right.
I didn't remember.

Give me, I'll tell you four of the fuss you've made late.
Hello?
Hello, Mr. Teraizumi?
It's me, in Mouri...
Where are you?
We're waiting for you here.
"Where... Where am I...? I'm... in the dark."
In the dark?
What do I feel, Mr. Teraizumi?
Sit down?
What did he say?
He spoke as if he was hurt.
He said "Where... Where did I go...? I'm... in the dark."
And then he cut himself off.
In the dark?
But it's already daylight.
What did he mean, Mr. Teraizumi?
(Chimes)
It's already 10 o'clock. We have to start preparing for the ceremony, sir.
You're right, Suguro.
Take care of everything, please.
Understood.
-Nothing will be inaugurated, I tell you! -God has punished him, of course.
Although he must be happy and all, the one who wrote that anonymous letter.
(Squeals)
La Ran!
Ran, listen!
Ran, where are you?
Conan!
I'm right here!
I'm here.
Where eeeets?
Ran, what happened to you?
Did you get hurt?
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Ran!
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I was out for a walk and I heard a voice.
It's so foggy, I got scared.
But it's Noda, the security guard.
I shouldn't be here.
It's just that I saw this girl walking towards the cliff,
and I thought I'd better warn her.
And as I got closer, she started calling out.
Then I got scared too.
Excuse me.
Damn, you've scared us all!
A car!
Perhaps it is in Teraizumi that has decided to return.
No, this is not your car.
It's Mr. Sagara's.
And this committee?
What are they all doing out here?
He was right, he knew which car it was just by feeling the engine.
Unbelievable!
I know most of the cars of the regular customers.
Hey, I'm going to work.
Hey, Mr. Sagara, could you tell me where you spent the night?
Well... driving, I felt like running around a bit.
And you haven't seen Mr. Teraizumi?
No, he hasn't.
Stand back, man, I'll park the car and you might get hurt.
Mr. Kuroiwa,
even if you arrive now, there's no time to expose the Dino.
What can we do, without Teraizumi there's nothing to do.
Nothing at all.
Help, hurry!
In... In Teraizumi... No, it's not right!
It's there, there in the car!
What?!
Sir!
Mr. Teraizumi!
(Coughs)
(coughs) Sir.
Someone call a doctor, an ambulance!
It's too late.
He's already dead.
He died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
The engine is running and the car is full of exhaust fumes.
I guess the fumes must have accumulated inside and he suffocated.
It's an accidental death.
(He thinks) "The window is a finger open."
"How do you explain it?"
"How can it be?"
"The window...?"
"Really... it was an accident?"
Come on, stop doing comedy, Kuroiwa.
Tell the truth, man, you've taken a load off your mind.
But I didn't mean him any harm!
Not like this bunch of fools!
So the engine of this car was running?
How did you know about this, kid?
-Sagara!
Then it was you. I didn't kill him!
(thinks) "And this liquid?"
"It runs straight down."
"The trap of the car. Part two."
