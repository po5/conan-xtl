DETECTIVE CONAN
The shipwreck murder case
Mail! (Ayumi) To the sea!
What fun!
-In the boat!
Come on, let's go! (Ayumi) -Viscaaaa!
(laughs)
Row, row! Come on, Genta, row hard!
Come on, harder! What fun!
Eh?
Aaaaah!
I'm sorry about that.
Are you all right?
I didn't see you.
Good thing you're leaving!
It's the best vacation of my life!
It was worth it, coming!
You are Mr. Kasuga, from the financial group?
Yes, I am the heir.
I'm an obedient son who knows nothing about life.
We wouldn't want to disturb you.
We've filled your boat.
The more we are, the more we laugh.
Oi, Shinobu?
Oh yes, of course.
Lucky you, going diving with the one you love.
What do you love, you say?
I still don't know if he really loves me.
If he wasn't rich, he wouldn't even look at me, Shinobu.
Teruhiko, I'm not like that.
Don't be polite, be honest, Shinobu.
(Thinking) What's he about, this one?
He looks like he wants to provoke her.
Ran, do you know where he went fishing, in Kogoro?
No.
He's gone at dawn in an unfamiliar place.
He didn't fish in the sea.
It sounds to me like he said it was a lake.
He has not gone to the sea?
(Kogoro) Ah, I got it!
Yes!
It's a big fish!
(Kogoro) Let's go!
The Shinobu has gone home?
She was angry.
It's nothing new, don't worry about it.
(Think) You, you've made her angry.
You're such a jerk.
(Genta) Look at those fish!
Wow, how fat they are!
(Genta) Wow!
You're a great fisherman, father.
-Where is it, this lake? (Genta) - Eh?
I want to fish too.
Ah, no!
That's impossible!
Why is it impossible?
Because it's a secret place and I promised not to tell anyone.
Gee, what a bore.
-Let's go play beach volleyball! -Yeah, let's go!
-Let's go! -Yeah! -Yeah!
Come on, you come too, Conan.
I'll be right back.
What if they are, eh?
Ah, nothing.
(thinks) "How can it be that you have caught sea fish in a lake?
The ten have bought them."
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Kogoro Mouri's talent is not limited to research.
Kogoro... Mouri?
I guess we haven't met, have we?
That's nice.
It's stopped.
Oh?
What's this?
Is there a paper inside?
-What's it supposed to say, the paper? -Maybe it's a treasure map. -Maybe it's a treasure map.
It's like in the movies.
(At the same time) We got it!
What's this?!
"SOS. Shinobu."
But what are you saying?
-Was it her, who threw it? -Is she asking for help?
Ha-ha-ha!
I see she's done it again.
She's done it again? Yes, she does it very often.
Let's see...
She does it so I'll be there for her.
She's a pain in the ass.
Geez, what a bore, guys.
Hip!
Soon the sun will set, the tide is rising.
Don't go back in the water, it's dangerous.
(At the same time) Very well!
If the Shinobu is calling for help, she must be desperate.
-We should find out for ourselves.
-But where do we start?
(Mitsuhiko) If it's on an island, how will we go?
She hasn't had time to go to any island.
(Mitsuhiko) The paper's not deteriorated.
It must be nearby.
Hey, Ran.
Keep an eye on Mr. Kasuga.
What do you want to say?
(At the same time) We trust you!
Hey, where are you going, now?
Wait! Alright!
I'm going back to fishing!
What?!
Ah, I come to keep you company.
You're going to that secret place, right?
I do scuba diving and I know this area.
Come on, let's go.
But father?!
We have to collect everything to go back.
They are a selfish bunch!
The youth, it's very well that they don't... Excuse me, sir.
What?
Again?!
Stop it!
Go swimming and diving, and see what happens!
-How dare you dirty! (At the same time) -Hey!
What do you want, guys?

Do you know where this bottle has floated from?
This one?
Come, over here! (All) Yes!
What is this?
Genta, we're not going to look for shells.
What doors?
Shut up!
I've come to the beach, and I won't go back without shells!
-You only think about menjar. -L'Ayumi is right.
(Think) We all want to look for shells.
(Shouting)
-Are you all right, Ayumi?
-Yes, I think so.
The tide is coming in, keep an eye out.
Hey, look!
-The Shinobu? -I think so.
Quick, the sea is starting to flood the cave!
Shinobu.
Are you all right?
-Come on, wake up! -Come on, Shinobu!
(All) Oh!
Shinobu!
Oh... You guys are...
What the fuck happened?
What's happened?
In Teruhiko told me that he would take me to a fantastic place.
(Off) "A place where caves disappear at high tide.
"When we arrived, he gave me some juice.
But when I finished drinking, I started to feel myself falling asleep."
Surely he must have thrown sleeping pills into the juice.
He wanted to make it look like an accident.
In Teruhiko he had it all planned to drown.
He needed an alibi
He has stumbled upon us expressly, because we got on his boat.
He provoked you to see that we were fighting.
But... why?
This is for the police to find out.
We're leaving and we're going to report it.
Conan!
Look over there!
Shit!
The tide is coming in!
(Genta) -That's right.
(Mitsuhiko) -Come on!
Go, skip and enfileu's-e to the edge!
(Mitsuhiko) -Oh, no... -How will we get home, now?
(Think) "The waves are too high. It's impossible to swim out.
Besides, the Shinubo is half asleep."
-Mother, how scary!
Somebody help us!
I don't want to die!
Turn around.
Don't be alarmed!
(Ayumi) Yes, but...
(Mitsuhiko) -If the water fills the cave...
(Genta) We'll die by drowning.
(Thinking) Now I don't know what to do...
(Ayumi) What's this?
They are fireflies.
What?!
(Mitsuhiko) - Fireflies?
(Genta) -In a place like this?
How can there be fireflies in a cave that fills up with water?
Maybe it's...!
(At the same time) Maybe what?
Maybe they've come through another entrance to the cave.
-What do you mean?
-Is there another entrance?
It would be the only way out.
What if the exit isn't big enough for us to get through?
Think that we are not fireflies, Conan!
The sole you caught in Kogoro was fat, and it passed.
The outlet can't be small.
It was high tide, in the early morning.
The sea water entered the cave.
It flooded the interior corridors of the cave
and came out where Kogoro was fishing.
The lake must not be only salt water
but there must be sea fish.
-Of course! -Of course!
You always have solutions!
(Think) Excuse me, Kogoro.
You didn't buy the fish.
(Mitsuhiko) If we stay, we'll drown!
(Genta) -Come on! (Ayumi) -I believe in Conan.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Ayumi) -What's wrong with you? I've dropped a drop of water.
-Aaah... Child...
-Don't give us these spants. I'm sorry.
(Genta) Oh!
It's like a maze.
(Ayumi) Which one do we take, to get out?
We'll only get lost if we rush.
(Mitsuhiko) But if we don't hurry, the tide will catch us.
(Genta) Drown or swim, we're going this way!
Wait, Genta!
Wow, a road with no way out.
What did I tell you?
We have to take the path of the fireflies.
The exit will be in the firefly corridor.
We separate selected and we look for the fireflies.
(All) All right!
I will help you.
I'm better.
There are none here.
And here neither.
Neither here.
They're here!
Look, they're all here!
Come on, let's go then!
(All) Yes!
Right or left... there are only two ways.
We're going back to look for the fireflies.
(Shinobu) I can't see anywhere.
-We're lost. Come on, don't moan, Mitsuhiko!
(What shall we do now?
There's still a chance.
(Catacrec strong)
(Catacrec flowing)
(Catacrec loudly) This way!
Ah, you've heard the echoing noise.
If the road is a dead end, the echo feels loud,
and if it's not, it's a way out.
-You're a genius!
-Come on!
-I can't! -Make an effort, Genta!

(Bird flapping)
What is this noise?
What is it, this noise? (flapping)
Birds!
(All) Birds?!
They must have come in to eat.
We're still the same!
The birds are heading for the exit!
Come on, let's go!
(All) SIII!
(Knock)
-Have you hurt yourself? -Aaaaai!
You are brave.
Come on, let's go.
Don't stop, hurry up! I'm fine, I'm fine.
Come on, let's go!
(Ayumi) -I can't feel the birds. (Genta) - Me neither.
(Mitsuhiko) Are they out? Yes, I can't feel them anymore.
Oh, seagulls!
What a fright you've given me.
What's the matter, boy?
Nothing.
The tide must have come in by now.
Come on, come on.
All the way in.
(Think) Don't let Mr. Kasuga out of your sight.
Hell, no!
Pick up the garbage before you leave.
Ah, excuse me, sir.
Do you know where there is a lake to go fishing?
(Genta) -Where to now, Conan? (Ayumi) -Where to?
Conan?
I don't know, nois.
What are you saying?
The tide has come in! Aaaaaaaah!
Help! Hold on, Shinobu!
(Mitsuhiko) -Help me!
(Ayumi) -Dad!
(Thinking) Geez, is it a dead end hallway?
(Mitsuhiko) -Oh, light! (Genta) -Bullshit!
Now you can't see anything!
(Genta) Where the hell are we?!
(Think) "I get it, we've reached the top of the cave!
"This means that the water comes out of the other opening.
(Genta) Roller coasters!
"I don't know if I'm going to the right, to the left?
(Genta) "Where will we end up?
"The exit!
(Kogoro) They're coming, they're coming!
(Kogoro) What happened?
I got stuck!
(Think) "Geez, it's so narrow that Genta won't pass!
"The life jacket! If I could take it off...
"It's useless. I'll have to break it.
"Shit, I can't break it, I can't!
"Mmm, what's this? A rake!
"Very good! Let's see if it works!
I can't breathe!"
Wow!
I thought I was drowning!
Finally, saved!
What happened?!
What the hell are you doing here?
(Thinking) "I thought so.
"The high tide floods the cave and stops the lake!
"The level of the lake doesn't rise because only the sea comes in,
but when the tide is low,
the water goes back through the conduit that is below the sea level.
Where did it come from?
(Shout)
I was afraid it would happen.
That's why I went fishing with her.
What?!
-Ayumi, no!
-Ayumi!
Don't move!
-What are you up to, Teruhiko?! - Quiet!
Don't do it!
Shut up!
If you use the gun,
your efforts to make it look like an accident will be in vain.
Won't I shoot?
I have enough bullets!
Ah!
Help!
Stop it!
Don't do it, Teruhiko.
You wanted to kill me, didn't you?
Let her go.
She didn't do anything to you.
Yes, it's your fault, Shinobu.
You should be killed, now.
Why are you doing this?
I got engaged to a rich girl because my father told me to.
I don't want to live a miserable life with you.
I want to be rich forever.
How cruel you are!
(He thinks) "You bastard!
"The only weapon we have is the rake.
I don't even have the shoes to do the superchery..."
As you know how everything went,
I can't leave you alive because it gives me away.
Idiots!
As I have to say it!
You can't come in here!
An enemy of women!
This is unforgivable!
(At the same time) Bastard!
It's already ours!
(At the same time) Long live the Junior Detective League!

DETECTIVE CONAN
(Off) "It's been an exciting case, full of suspense, but a little sad.
And for Kogoro it's been a terrible experience."
Idiot!
I'll have to confiscate the fish!
-But what are you doing?
They're mine! -Do you want to be beaten?
"The old man has given a speech to Kogoro of more than an hour.
"I guess it's logical,
because in Kogoro he was fishing in a forbidden and dangerous place.

What does he think, this Kogoro!"
Jinnai, the god Death!
Stop!
You're under arrest!
The murderer is still on the seventh floor!
I have seen his shadow!
(Think) "Why did he shoot, in Jinnai?
Where should he be hiding, that the police haven't found him?"
In the next episode...
The mystery of Jinnai, the god of Death
