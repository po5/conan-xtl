DETECTIVE CONAN
The Mysterious Murders of the Famous Family, Part One
(Kogoro) Wow, what a big farm!
It belongs to the president of the Nagato group.
It's associated with Sonoko's father.
Do you know Miss Sonoko Suzuki?
She had come to this house when she was very small.
(Think) "She's not very fine, Miss."
(Quietly) Why does he want to see you, such a rich man?
Mr. President of the Nagato Group called me personally.
He wants me to solve a complicated case!
If the woman gives him the jump.
What do you say, you boy?
Ah!
Oh!
Have you done wrong, sir?
What's happened?
Why are they, these holes?
We want to plant trees, this weekend.
Excuse me for not introducing myself.
My name is Takezohnosuke, and I'm the butler.
I've served two generations of this family.
Wow, that's impressive!
Please follow me.
The master is waiting for you.
Look, there are many policemen.
It's only natural.
It must be a very complicated case.
(thinks) "Eh? He looks familiar, this man."
Find him a girlfriend he had when he was young?
This is all he wants?
Yes, exactly, Mr. Mouri.
A friend assured me that...
you'd find this woman.
If it's a missing persons case, you could have called someone.
Too bad, it's not a complicated case after all.
Do you have a photograph of this woman?
We were sweethearts when we were in elementary school.
I don't have it anymore.
I don't even remember her face.
But lately I can't stop thinking about her.
She was such a sweet girl.
If my late wife felt me, she would be furious.
I don't have any photos, but I have data.
Miyuki, explain it to her.
Yes.
Her name is Kotomi Akagi.
She was born in Kanagawa.
At 21 married Kohei Yamato.
They had a son.
After 5 years they disappeared.
-Were they wanted by creditors? -No way.
By the way, who is this friend who recommended me?
It was me.
-And who are you? -A lifelong friend.
Heizo Hattori, the head of the Osaka police department.
The head of the Osaka police department?
The man we always see on TV?
(Thinking) "No wonder he looked familiar."
"Eh. Wait a minute. This means..."
Hello, Shinichi!
What, everything?
At Heiji Hattori?!
Did you say Shinichi?
Ah!
AAAAAAAAA...
Xxxxxxxxxxxt!
You still don't know? (Adult voice) No, you idiot!
Hey, why did you say Shinichi?
I said "aikido"... "aikido".
It's just that I've started going to "aikido" classes.
Caram, Father, I didn't know you had guests.
Well, well, there's also a blowfly among the guests.
You're often staying overnight lately.
-What are you planning to do? -Nobuko, don't be rude.
I can't move from my bed.
I have to take care of the company's business.
-Just use the fax. There are other things...
And who are you, these gentlemen?
I'm a private detective.
-A detective?! - Why do you want a detective?
He hired her to find him a girlfriend from when he was little.
I was not talking to you, understood?!
Flights stop?
Although you keep him?
It's disgusting, this pen.
Maybe it's a souvenir from your father, but I find it hideous.
Yasue, watch out or this girl will take you in Mitsuaki.
What a ?!
Nobuko!
No!
I'm sorry, Miyuki,
Nobuko is irritable
because she's getting big and she hasn't found a husband yet.
I'll take care of it.
(Thinking) "This way, she won't even get married."
If you don't need me, I'll go to the office.
This afternoon I will announce it officially,
but if you do it so that you feel sorry for my son...
I don't feel sorry for your son.
Actually, it was our destiny.
We are bound by a destiny of fire, Mr. President.
(Thinks) "A destiny of fire?"
(Kogoro) Wow, you were both from the same kendo club.

Yes, Mr. Nagato had given me several beatings.
By the way, Heizo, how, that problem?
Don't worry, they're looking at it now, the agents.
(Open the door)
Who are you?!
It's my son, Hideomi.
When he was in high school, he got badly burned in an accident.
Since then, he hasn't taken off this bandage.
Cosmetic surgery would disguise it, but he doesn't want to have surgery.
But thanks to that accident, things are going very well for you now, eh?
Hideomi?
Hey, Hideomi, please come back, why are you so angry?
Happy birthday, father-in-law, may you celebrate it for a few more years.
Ah, thank you.
Dear father-in-law, I would be very happy
if you would appoint me as successor to the presidency of the company.
Ha-ha-ha!
It's a joke.
Don't you believe it!
I'd better get back.
What?
I thought you were staying to celebrate my birthday.
Besides, there's that.
Don't suffer.
I'll leave you in good company, with this guy.
He'll look into it.
He's young, but he's got good instincts.
He will help Mr. Mouri a lot to solve the matter.
(Thinking) "Help him?"
(Yasue) -Happy birthday, father! (Yasue) -Happy birthday, sir.
And just today I would like to announce something very important!
My son Hideomi and Miyuki Hyuga are engaged!
How nice! -Do you really mean it, Mr. Nagato?
I wanted him to get used to the house,
and I told him to spend a few nights here.
I'm tying the knot now, father.
Miss Nobuko, where?
Let her be, Mr. Takezohnosuke!
Think of her as the only single woman in the house.
Where the hell did she go to, Hideomi?
She must be ashamed.
I'll go get her.
(Adult voice) Hey, Heiji, tell me everything.
What in head doors?
Why did you bring us here?
Nothing in particular.
I wanted to see you again.
Majadero...
It was a joke, the truth is... (phone)
(Phone)
Yes, hello?
I'm in Mitsuaki, I'd like to speak to the father.
I'm sorry, it can't be.
The master has already fallen asleep, and we were just leaving.
-I can't find Hideomi! -What?
Where has he gone?
Ah!
Aaaaaaaaah!
Mr. Mitsuaki?!
Hey, what's wrong?!
Where the hell is it?
In the room below his!
They've turned off the lights and attacked me.
Aaah!
Hey, are you all right?
Mitsuaki, what happened?
Mitsuaki!
Hideomi?!
No!
Come on, let's go!
We have to catch her!
Why? Why?
Oh, Hideomi, why?
Shit!
It's useless!
It's locked from the inside!
-Now I'm taking the other key!
-Aphans!
I'll go outside with the agents.
(shouting)
Mitsuaki, what's wrong?!
Mitsuaki!
Mr. Mouri, have the key.
There's no one here! Get out of here!
I think he came down with this rope!
But where is it, in Mitsuaki?
It's there.
They've thrown it and it's landed on the fence, right?
And the murderer is in Hideomi, son of Mr.
Nagato?
You're wrong!
The murderer is not in Hideomi!
Inspector, there must be some explanation for this!
Whatever it is, there's been a murder!
Put me back in Mitsuaki!
Take me back!
In Hideomi I'd be incapable of doing that.
We have no proof that that man was in Hideomi!
Eh? He's right!
We've only seen one person with a bandaged face.
Blindfolded?
Yes... aaa... Hideomi's face was burned.
We saw the killer around 10 o'clock.
Everyone was in the president's room on the third floor.
Who is it, everyone?
It was me, Heiji, Ran, Conan, the butler and Yasue.
In total there were 6 of us, sir.
When everyone left, what did you do?
I stayed with Mr.
Nagato.
The murderer had prepared the rope to come down from the balcony.
It's obvious that it was premeditated.
And there is no doubt that the murderer used it.
When the guards and I arrived here, though it was swinging.
Where is it, Hideomi?
He seems to have vanished.
We have searched for it all over the house, but we have not found it anywhere.
It's obvious that the killer is in Hideomi.
No.
It's impossible!
We found the weapon, the cap and bandages used by the murderer.
The analysis will confirm it.
Sir...
What is it, this wound above the right hand?

It looks like he's been stabbed.
Either it's a knife wound
or he's been bitten by the fence when he fell!
Inspector!
What's wrong, Takagi?
We've looked at the camera footage from outside and no one can be seen leaving!
So, the killer is...
(Heiji) He's inside, though!
Oh, no!
The president is inside! The president?
It's useless, it's closed.
Hey, is someone here?
What's wrong with him?
Don't make noise!
What are you doing here?
(Heiji) And you, what are you doing here?
I heard the Yasue's scream and I came.
And where were you before you came?
I went to my room and had a drink.
Were you alone?
Yes, I was on the phone with a friend.
But I don't remember who called me, because I'm a little drunk.
Is it true that Hideomi killed in Mitsuaki?
Yes.
Well, it seems so.
I knew it... It had to happen someday.
The truth is that those two fought whenever they saw each other.
They'd been friends since they were kids, and up until a few years ago they understood each other,
but since that accident, not anymore.
What accident?
Twenty years ago there was a fire in a hostel near here.
Coincidentally, Hideomi and Mitsuaki both saw it,
and Hideomi didn't think about it.
He ignored Mitsuaki and entered the inn.
He saved a girl.
Here she is.
It was the Miyuki Hyuga!
(Think) "That's why she said that thing about the fire fate."
That's why she burned her face so badly, at Hideomi.
After that accident, she didn't want to go back to high school.
He closed himself to writing novels.
No woman would go near him.
This woman took advantage of that.
She told him to convince her father to hire her.
And now, marriage!
Stop it, Nobuko.
Father, how long have you been awake?
I was half asleep,
but I seem to have woken up when everyone ran out.
Did anything strange happen, then?
No, nothing, Inspector.
The Miyuki didn't move from here until the Ran came.
It's not a good time to look for a childhood sweetheart, is it?
No...
We'd better... let it go.
Come on, tell me why you got me involved in this matter.
Mr.
Nagato felt a strange noise, and wanted to find out.
A strange noise?
Yes, someone running down the hallway at midnight,
and then he felt another noise, like a kind of thump.
What if it was...?
Exactly, I thought the same thing:
someone was preparing to commit this murder.
At first, the father and I thought it was a burglar taking sights.
We called the police and told them to come.
And he came back, but he didn't steal an object, he stole a life.
It was premeditated.
But don't you find it strange?
Knowing that in Kogoro Mouri, which you made famous, was here,
the killer must have been very sure of himself to do this.
Or maybe he couldn't make a change of plans.
And, why did he leave the disguise near the corpse?
If you had to make a quick getaway,
you wouldn't waste time taking off your cap and bandages.
Why did he decide to let us see, the killer?
It's as if he wanted to make it obvious that it was Hideomi.
Then, the only one who could have done it is Nobuko.
She's the only one who came out.
"Then, we searched every corner of the estate,
but we found nowhere in Hideomi."
"Two days after the murder,
when practically all of us had given up hope..."
It's no use, inspector.
We didn't find him.
You mean it's my fault, that Hideomi didn't get married?
You mean she felt sorry for me?
No, but he cared about you and...
Miyuki!
No, wait!
Wait, wait!
Watch out!
This pond is very deep.
But it was a souvenir from my father!
Without the pen, no...!
Empty the pond, please, sir!
Yes, right away.
Oh, my goodness!
What dirty water.
The late Mrs. Nagato had carp,
but when she died...
(Yasue) Why?
Why did this have to happen?
Hideomi, my dear brother!
What is the time of death?
It will be 24 to 48 hours since he died, Inspector.
In Mitsuaki he was thrown from the balcony the day before yesterday at 10 o'clock.
Forty-four hours ago.

If Hideomi had committed suicide by drowning himself in the pond
before the police arrived,
then everything would fit, and the matter would be solved.
The problem is that he did not die by drowning.
I will be able to confirm that with the autopsy,
but he must have taken some kind of poison before he went into the pond.
He didn't float because he was carrying such a stone in his pocket.
You mean he must have gone into the water and then taken the poison?
He wouldn't want us to find his body.
As much as the two of them hated each other,
Hideomi had no reason to kill Mitsuaki.
If I may, I think he would do it
because he was very, very fond of his sister Yasue.
Mr. Hideomi didn't want her to marry Mr. Mitsuaki.
Mitsuaki.
He couldn't stand her marrying such a repellent guy.
What a fool.
Inspector!
The lab results are in.
Lea-me.
The wound on Mitsuaki's arm
corresponds to the blade of the knife we found.
The blood on the knife was also his blood.
The hair on the cap and the bandages were Hideomi's.
And there was a meter of string in Mitsuaki's pocket.
Twine?
And the wound on his hand?
Was it from the knife?
The hand wound?
Yes, the wound above the right hand.
There was none, it seems to have disappeared.
Inspector!
We found this in the dead man's pocket!
"I have no right to marry you."
"I will die to purge the sin I have committed."
What?
This is a will!
Miss Hyuga, it's addressed to you.
Is that your handwriting?
Yes, it looks like it, sir.
I'll go to his room and look for something he wrote.
Miyuki, look, the pen you dropped.
Miyuki! Leave it.
Don't worry about it, now.
I'll give it to her later.
Hideomi...
This pen is badly burned.
How can this be?
Strange, isn't it?
Yes, this case is very interesting, Sinichi.
I'm intrigued by the will, Heiji.
He says he did it to purge the sin he committed.
He was supposed to write it after the murder in Mitsuaki.
But he couldn't have time to write it.
Someone forced him to write it or it is forged.
We know that someone poisoned Hideomi,
and that he sank it in the pond with the will.
But no one went near the pond
until we went out to search Hideomi.
This means, that in Hideomi died before in Mitsuaki!
