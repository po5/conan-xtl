"The feeling that we have always carried in our hearts

"The mask and in Conan are gone."
"A brilliant ending on the stage."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

(EBiz) We must assume that she has been kidnapped.
I am convinced that her disappearance
is related to the theft of the mask.
Can you show me the cell phone you found, please?
Yes.
The last call she received was at 4:5 minutes past 4:00.
You called him, Ran.
He was at the theater at that time, he told us himself.
We crossed paths.
After... 3 minutes later, he made a call from his cell phone.
He doesn't have the number in the phone book, he must have entered it by hand.
I tried to call, but the cell phone was turned off.
(EBiz) Who are you?
The deputy captain of the Conan Detective League,
my name is Ai Haibara.
- Deputy?
-Conan's deputy captain?
She is the person who advises the captain.
Ai's voice sounds sweeter than usual.
Sure.
Maybe I have it in the address book.
It's not easy to remember all the numbers.
I used to remember them all, but now...
-Yes, now you have to click here.
-Aviam, we enter the number.
At Kaneko isn't it... the photographer?
At Kaneko.
Come to think of it, when I summoned all the staff,
he was the only one missing.
It's about time.
Now I have to make the hole bigger.
"It works."
Oh.
Punyeeeta!
(EBiz) We'll go to Kaneko's house.
Do you know where I live, you?
President Yabusaki must have her address.
(Mobile: beep)
(Mobile: beeping) Eh?
-Conan.
Where are you?
-Conan, is that you?
Hey, guys!
I knew you'd come looking for me.
Look for a building they're tearing down.
It can't be far.
Ah!
Guys!
Soc the basement!
Conan, can you hear me?
Where are you?
What building?
It says it's in a basement.
Gee, boy, he's cut off.
And it's not far from here.
A building near here that's under construction...
There.
Someone go tell Mr. Mouri and the others.
- (Genta) You go, Mitsuhiko.
-They must still be at the theater.
(Me?
And why don't you go?
(Azumi) I'm too worried about Conan.
(Genta) We'll decide it this way, then.
Rock, paper, scissors.
(The three of us) One, two, three.
Why do I always lose?
I'll stop them.
(Genta) It's over there.
Keep it up, we're keeping a good pace.
Hey, you, where do you think you're going?
That everyone s'aturiiiiiiiiiii !!!!
Eh?
-An earthquake?
-What's going on?
I can't believe it, but it's the eBiz.
Hurry up.
There's a kid in the basement.
What?!
It's this way.
(EBiz) Conaaaaaaaaaaan !!!!
I'm here!
-Don't go, it's dangerous.
-It's him.
Yes!
You're back here?
I come to rescue you, buddy.
Hm.
Hello, eBiz.
It's warped.
Why won't it open, the door?
Bring a cable!
No matter how hard you push it, it won't move.
(Man) We'll take care of it.
(EBiz) Bring a cable.
We'll pass it under the door and stretch it.
(Man) If any misfortune befalls him, the country will be all over us.
Ran.
Conan!
Are you all right?
I hope you're not hurt.
No, I'm fine.
Don't worry, I'm safe and sound.
Thanks for coming, Ran.
Conan, can you hear me?
Take this wire and run it under the door.
Yes.
That's good. That's good.
That's it.
Now stand back a little bit.
We're all set.
Pick up the cable.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Foreman.
The second floor.
It's falling apart.

The cable!
Point it!
- (man 2) Okay.
- (home 1) To the right!
To the right!
And Mr. eBiz.
In Conan...
(man 2) Oh...
The truth is that this time it's been a hair's breadth.
I don't believe it.
You make a pretty good face, you could have held out longer.
You're kidding, right?
Hahaha!
- (Azumi) It's so good to see you!
- (Children) Conan!
(Man) Leave all this for later and get out of here, it's dangerous!
Come on, get out at once!
We have to go to a safe place!
Follow me, hurry!
(Think) "He doesn't give up, this man."
Are you quite sure?
Hm.
On the bottom floor of the basement there was a camera.
The lens on it was a professional photographer's lens.
This means that something has happened to Kaneko.
My team is looking for him.
If it turns out to be down there... I'm sorry, Inspector.
We collected all the keys from the basement, but...
(EBiz) It's not your fault.
You have also been victims...
of a ruthless criminal.
Sonoko and the children have just left.
Didn't you accompany them home?
They preferred to go back with the car that came to pick up Sonoko.
They found her.
I'm not surprised.
Eiji Kaneko's corpse.
And also...
- (man) Can it be fixed?
- (eBiz) What a mess!
Even if it can...
It was Mr. Kaneko's photo bag, wasn't it?
Yes, next to the body.
He stole it and now he's tried to get rid of the boy,
who was getting too close;
but the move didn't work out.
It seems too convenient.
This is what he would have us believe.
The culprit.
Huh?
I thought you were gone too.
The kids have to go to sleep, but we adults still have things to do.
Thank you. (Chuckles)
For you.
If you'd had the glasses, you'd have found your way out sooner, right?
Yes.
But I wasn't wearing the elastics either.
He looked too hairy.
How could you fall into the trap of someone who could be the culprit?
It's not like you.
Well, because I was convinced he wasn't.
Oh, what are you doing here?
I thought you were with Sonoko and the kids.
No, it can't be.
They've gone without me.
(Of course not.
You can come down now.
Chiba says he'll take us home.
And now what will they do, Mr. Mouri and the others?
They want to go back to the rehearsal room with Inspector Megure.
When we get there, I'll run you a hot bath.
Yes!
(Chiba) It must have been hard, being trapped for so many hours.
If being bathed is the reward...
Yes.
(Chiba) Shut up.
What should they do, Kogoro and company?
I couldn't get them wired.
Eh?
You have.
(Kogoro) "Who was the last one to see Mr. Kaneko alive?"
At noon he came to see me at the hospital,
right after he left the eBiz and Conan.
How come he came to see you?
What did he want, from you?
-Tell me the truth.
-W-well...
"Okay."
I know you went to the theater early this morning.
Hm?
Wha... What are you saying?
Don't go out of your way to hide it.
You went to steal the mask.
So it wasn't you who stole the two-faced mask?
N-no, I swear it wasn't.
If I had stolen it, I wouldn't be able to... I am innocent.
But is it true that you came to the theater tonight?
Mm-hm.
I couldn't bear to stay alone in my room, so I ran away.
"I didn't know where to go, I came without realizing it."
"But I had lost the paper
where I had written down the code to the front door."
I turned tail and went back to the hospital.
You don't know it by heart, the code?
It's just that... I've never been here in the morning before.
-Hm?
- (Minowa) Excuse me.
I'm the one who wrote down the door code for Mr. Iwami.
This means that I've been your accomplice
and you'll have to arrest me, won't you?
-Mr. Minowa.
-I already said I didn't steal anything.
-Please sit down.
-Yes, tell me. -Yes, tell me.
Yes.
And Mr. Kaneko took some pictures of you, didn't he?
Do you recognize this silhouette?
It's you sneaking into the theater.
You've ended up in the hospital because you're incapable of doing your job.
If the mask disappears, the performance will have to be cancelled.
-Nn-hn.
-Was it what you wanted, though?
Iwami.
Say.

Is it true that you have not arrived at the lockers?
Yes, it is true.
The paper where you wrote down the code was found there.
Yes, I... Do you have it, Mr. Mouri?
I asked that little boy to give it to you.
(Kogoro) "No. I have never seen it, me, this paper."
Poor thing.
(Minowa) "What a tragedy!"
(Kogoro) -Huh?
- (Shiratori) "Excuse me."
I've just been sent the complete call record
from Mr. Kaneko's cell phone.
Mr. Hoso,
you received a call from the photographer today at 5 minutes past 3 o'clock.
-At 3 o'clock in the afternoon?
-I'm wrong?
At 3 o'clock I was meeting with the foreign client.
I remember.
I was in a meeting and I had my cell phone on silent.
Oh, yes, I have a call from an unknown number.
Yes, I got a call from an unknown number.
It must be Mr. Kaneko's number.
You've never called him on his cell phone before?
No, he hadn't.
I'm sure he wanted to say, "I have the mask. How much is he offering me?"
Surely.
So the culprit is Mr. Kaneko?
No, Kaneko was a puppet.
Who pulled the strings was someone else.
It all started with the attempted murder of Mr. Hoso.
Then the theft of the mask,
the murder of Secretary Takahashi,
the kidnapping of Conan and the death of Mr. Kaneko.
Everything is related to one thing.
There is no case I can't handle.
Gather all the people involved.
I will reveal my findings to you.
You mean don't be hasty?
Isn't it too soon?
Thanks to my deductions,
you've saved time and a lot of money, haven't you, Inspector?
I see you're sure of what you're doing.
It's too late to notify the entire staff.
President, convene the staff for a dress rehearsal tomorrow at noon.
Shall I call them at this hour?
The preparations are not finished.
I'll get it.
Have all the staff come.
All right, then.
I'll call them right away.
And the mask of the two faces?
It's broken, but I'll wear it anyway.
"I'm so excited to be able to see live
the famous Sleeping Kogoro deductions."
"Gee, boy. In Kogoro wants to make me run around more than I should."
"I have until noon tomorrow to find the evidence I'm missing."
"Hm. I'll get it."
It's said thank you.
Hm?
By the way, when did you do it?
I used to remember them all, but now...
-Yes, now you have to click here.
-Aviam, we enter the number.
Did you put it on the eBiz?
Don't worry, I'll take it off tomorrow when he's distracted.
Assuming he's wearing the same clothes...
"Sure. Then..."
"I've got it. I know who the culprit is."
(Ai) "Where did you get it, the card?"
"Could you analyze this?"
"How?"
"From Kaneko's camera."
Sorry I'm late.
Do you think it's okay to keep a helpless child waiting at this hour?
Yes, I do.
Helpless.
I'll be done in a minute.
What? What was on the card?
What was on the card?
It's got it, that's it.
If you were able to get the card out of the camera by yourself,
why are you giving me such a hard time afterwards?
I know, thanks for helping me.
You're just being self-interested.
Oh, it's so heavy!
It's heavy!
He was a photographer.
How many photos had he taken?
And which ones are you interested in?
I'm interested in all of them, but first I want to see the ones of Takahashi.
(At the same time) Eh?
Who is he?
I don't know him.
Does he ring any bells?
(At the same time) Thank you.
I'll look into it.
"There's no time. I've wasted half a day trapped in that basement."
Eh?
What'd you see?
Let's see, zoom in on this.
The lower left?
Zoom in on the lower left.
It's the same.
You mean this belongs to the killer?
Yes, I'm sure it's his.
Wait for me!
Come on, let's go.
Shall we go back to the crime scene?
You mean we shouldn't go further down?
This is where I started to follow him.
(squeaks)
When it gets light, we'll see it clearer.
Shall we go to the level crossing?
No way.
If you hadn't stopped him, he would have hit the level crossing underneath.
"You're right, I wouldn't have been able to stop."
What?
Haibara.
I found it.
It's true.
We'll tell Takagi and the others to help us...
and we'll solve the mystery of the mask.

(Mobile)
(Takagi) Tell me?
Conan.
But you're still awake?
What do you want, Mr. Mouri?
Yes.
Yes.
It's enough that I investigate this, right?
It'll be a piece of cake.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
(cell phone ringing) - Huh?
- (cell phone ringing)
(cell phone ringing) Oh!
What happened, Conan?
Shouldn't you be sleeping?
Eh ?!
Mr. Mouri?
The store?
Yes.
Mr. Mouri wants to ask you to do him the favor of checking it out.
And could you also come and get us without anyone knowing?
First grade.

Oh!
As much as times advance and change,
the emotions and feelings of the human being
will remain immovable,
latent inside our bodies... throughout the centuries.
So it is and so it will be the history of mankind!
Ooh!
(clapping hands)
Extraordinary.
We could open the play tomorrow, if we had to.
"There's no denying that the nano has talent."
"Too bad, eBiz."
"If you hadn't done the nonsense you've done..."
Thank you.
I'll get ready.
Why don't you put her to sleep already?
"Because sometimes Mr. Mouri gets it right."
Mr. Mouri.
I've done my duty, my show is over here.
I hope I've been a good opening act for your show.
Mm, mm, mm, mm...
Very good.
Kogoro Mouri's show of deductions begins.
It's going well, this light?
The Haibara is having a good time.
Yes, quite well.
Shall we begin, gentlemen?
First we'll talk about the photographer Eiji Kaneko.
The culprit used him as a pawn
and killed him in that basement.
"He must have cracked his head with one of the stones on the floor."
"How strong! So far, he's on the right track."
In Kaneko had stolen Mr. Takahashi's mask.
This is as far as we have come.
There was one person
who was more interested in getting the mask than anyone else.
Yes.
It's you, Ichikawa...
Ebi.... ay.
-Yes.
-Now, to see it.
Did you say my name?
Oh!
If it isn't... the Sleeping Kogoro!
(Kogoro) We'd better talk another day,
about Ichikawa's sushi restaurant.
But no one had spoken.
-He made me hungry.
-I can tell you like this place.
It's not true.
It wasn't Mr. Takahashi.
He didn't steal the mask of the two faces.
-Mr. Iwami.
-Who was it, then?
The security camera at an ATM machine recorded him
while he was withdrawing money.
"He put them inside an envelope and gave it to Mr. Kaneko,
who was waiting for her;
the envelope was quite thick."
-Sorry.
-You gave him money?
He had photographed me entering the theater.
But Mr. Kaneko already knew it wasn't you,
who had stolen the mask.
-Then why did you...? -Huh?
-Eh?
He threatened to take money from you.
Messrs. Yabusaki and Minowa.
You can rest assured.
Mr. Kaneko didn't blackmail you, you two.
You mean you're innocent because Kaneko didn't blackmail you?
Here we have Mr. Iwami entering the theater at night.
Mr. Kaneko showed him these photographs
and Mr. Iwami gave him money to erase them.
But in Mr. Kaneko's camera there is another photograph.
It is this one.
Look closely.
Mr. Iwami leaves the theater empty-handed.
The photographer only showed him the pictures that suited him.
In this case,
Mr. Kaneko's camera has proven his innocence.
So, he can only have stolen the mask...
Hey, hey.
Please don't be hasty.
According to what Mr. Mouri said just now,
anyone who doesn't come out to Mr. Kaneko's photographs
is innocent, right?
Mr. Hoso.
How do you know, that you don't go out, to the photographs?
I don't remember saying that.
No, but it's impossible for me to go out, too.
(Kogoro) "You're quite sure, aren't you?"
"Because he paid you a fortune to buy you the card."
It's a bad joke.
Don't you remember?
I sabotaged the brakes on my car and almost died too.
The 7 masks of Kogoro Mouri.
First mask.
First thing today, I went back to investigate that street.

I soon realized that the brake fluid stains were only at the top of the climb, there was nowhere else.
were only at the top of the climb, there was nowhere else.
Why did you take that road, Mr. Hoso?
The most direct route to go from your house to the theater
is a flat, practically straight road.
What was the purpose of your detour to that street
that was so steep?
Nearby I also found adhesive tape
with traces of brake fluid on it.
Adhesive tape, you say?
Of course, of course.
You figured it out right away because you like cars, eBiz.
"Drilling a hole in the brake line isn't that easy."
First, he manipulated the line in his garage....
And then wrapped it with duct tape.
Hahaha!
What a silly thing to do!
The police saw them,
the security camera footage from my house.
I thought it was clear that I didn't do it, in the garage.
Of course it was.
Second mask.
Right in front of your house is a 24-hour convenience store.
We compared the images from the store's camera with the one at your house.
-Yes.
-Enter the video.
The time is the same.
The images on the left show the outside of Mr. Hoso's house.
Hoso's house,
and on the right we have the images of the store.
As you can see, although the time and location match,
only cars can be seen circulating in one of the images.
(Kogoro) Someone has tampered with your computer's hard disk.
(Kogoro) -I don't know who could have done it.
-Do you have any idea who it might be?
Third mask.
We were able to recover the authentic mask at the airport.
And we questioned the buyer, a Mr. Richard.
He stated that Mr. Hoso sold it to him at an exorbitant price.
Mr. Hoso.
You said it yourself, didn't you?
We will not allow our cultural assets to go abroad.
Don't you think you should set an example?
Nobody cares about my business.
Besides, this does not prove that I am a murderer!
-I receive.
-Now, go.
Fourth mask.
Miss Shioji has told me the truth.
Shioji...
This mask is a fake, I ordered it myself.
Mr. Hoso asked me to keep the real one in a safe place
until the day of the performance.
(Kogoro) You already knew that, didn't you, eBiz?
Yes.
I started to suspect it when I saw it broken, but...
Shioji... It was you, who killed them?
Sure, I know why.
For the money.
You wanted money, didn't you?
Takahashi was my boyfriend.
And you... you...
Mr. Hoso.
We found out that your company wasn't doing so well.
I needed the money.
The ones for the mask and the ones for En Takahashi's insurance.
Oh!
Life... insurance?
Yes, they can usually be collected even in case of suicide,
but in order to secure the money
soon after the insurance is taken out...
It's best if there's a murder.
Grrrr!
And the evidence?
How can you prove that I have done everything you say?
This button is yours, right, Mr. Hoso?
I always tell them the same thing, children of this age.
That, if one day they are kidnapped or attacked suddenly,
leave some clue so we can find the kidnapper.
If it's covered with something, for example, bite it.
Yes.
Saliva or teeth marks
can serve as evidence later.
He's making a mumps today.
Hahaha!
Really, Mr. Mouri?
I should know better than anyone.
Shioji, you tell him.
Tell him when he changed my jacket.
Hahahaha!!!
We're done now.
I have to go, I'm expected.
President, the button on the cuff has...
Yes.
When did I lose it?
When we went to the hotel, I was already wearing another jacket.
Nano.
When he attends, this button?
Ah...
Surely you can tell me, right?
Have you used the child
to frame me for Kaneko's murder?
I didn't say it, did I, that he would have wrapped me up in a blazer?
Mr. Hoso.
Why are you talking to me like this?
Conan just said that he was covered with something.
-Right now.
I shoot the images.
-Remata'l.
The button of his jacket appeared
the engine of the car in which he died in Takahashi.
(Takagi) These water tanks are next to the level crossing.
He intended to crash to brake.

This we found in his garage.
(Shiratori) He used vinyl gloves
so that his hands wouldn't get dirty when he was handling the car.
(Chiba) This is the building where he used to have his company headquarters.
Now it is being torn down.
(Takagi) The staff office was located in the basement.
That's why he knew it so well.
(Takagi) Mr. Hoso taking the note...
(Takagi) What's this?
The photos.
How did you get them?
Mr. Kaneko sold him the card,
but he had the photos saved on his computer.
With the intention of blackmailing him back.
Ooh...
The company is about to go bankrupt.
No company or business
that justifies the death of two people to avoid bankruptcy!
On this stage, Mr. Hoso,
the artists go up to perfect their art
and demand more from themselves every day.
A person like you is not worthy to set foot in this place.

That's exactly what I expected from Kogoro Mouri.
Hey, father.
You've been pretty cool today.
Yeah, pretty cool.
What do you say?
How come he hasn't been arrested?
Mr. Mouri.
Let me include the Sleeping Kogoro in my next play, please.
I'm convinced it will be a great show, I have no doubt.
(Kogoro) Get away from me!
Aaah!
Very well, but who will play my part?
This is what usually happens when someone dares to disobey me.
Hahaha!
Hahaha!
Enough..., please.
I can't take it anymore.
Come on, don't be like that.
Calm down.
Psychiatric tests nowadays
can't be considered 100% reliable.
Hm...
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me!
You must believe me, please!
