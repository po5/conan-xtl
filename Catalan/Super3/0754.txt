(Sonoko) Mmm!
It's so nice...
There's nothing like walking in the forest.
(Sonoko) You are right.
The air is clean and pure.
It's like breathing health.
What a pity the father isn't here!
I should have told him to come.
Thank you for inviting us, Masumi.
You're welcome, woman.
I'm glad you could join me.
Anyway, I wouldn't have said you'd like to go hiking.
I just don't like it.
I'm here because I've been assigned a case.
...of detectives?
A case?
You mean a case...
Yes.
Actually, the assignment came from my older brother.
Some friends from high school have asked him
to investigate the mysterious happenings at the cottage where we're going now.
But it turns out that he is too busy
and, as they know that I'm also a detective,
they asked me to take over the investigation.
I didn't know that your brother was a detective.
He's not, but it turns out that in high school...
he was always the one who ended up solving all the mysteries
and the most convoluted cases.
How'd he do that?
I thought your older brother was dead.
Yes, my older brother is dead.
The one who got the assignment is the middle one.
We are 3 siblings, 2 boys and a girl.
And all 3 of us have different surnames.
Why do you have different last names?
We changed it when the father died.
I have the mother's maiden name.
And my middle brother was also called Sera until he finished high school.
So, before I called you Sera..., you should have said...
-Huh?
-Look.
I was wearing red.
There was a woman dressed in red behind the trees.
Yes.
She had long hair
and she was wearing a red raincoat and red boots.
I could have sworn I saw her just now, too.
Huh?
A woman in red?
Conan!
Ouch!
Aaaah!
A... swamp.
You would do well to watch your step.
There are quicksand bogs in this forest.
Are you serious?
"Autumn takes the heat of summer."
"The deductions are quite a show."
"In a cottage with a red door
"The shadow of the Woman in Red will rise."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The tragedy of the Woman in Red (The mist)."
(Sonoko) The house is beautiful.
Yes... But how come only the door is red?
It's true, it's a bit disturbing.
(Woman) Ah.
You must be the sister of Sera and her friends.
Yes, that's us.
Thank you for coming all this way.
My name is Tamames Minegishi.
I'm sure we'll understand each other.
Now, which one of you is Sera's sister?
That's me, my name is Masumi.
And my classmates, Sonoko Suzuki and Ran Mouri.
How do you do?
Hello.
And this is the little boy who lives at Ran's house, Conan Edogawa.
He's a detective and he's much smarter than me.
Wow!
What do you know, as little as you are...
No, and now!
It's no big deal.
I'd better explain why you've come.
We've taken a couple of pictures with a digital camera
that prove that strange things happen in this house.
Sumika said she would bring them when she had printed them.
Look at her, she's already here.
Sumika.
Did you bring the photos?
Did you?
You have, I just printed them.
Good luck.
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.
Don't mind her, don't worry.
Sumika is always that unfriendly to people she doesn't know.
Ah, you must be Sera's sister.
We didn't know if you were coming.
Hello.
Is she here already?
You came together?
Ah... No...
In fact, we met in the forest... by chance.

You know what?
This one says it fell in the swamp.
I caught her
changing her clothes.
Some people trip over their shadow.
Stop it at once.
I'm very disappointed.
I was looking forward to meeting the girl detective,
but she came with the boyfriend.
What?
In Sera told us that her sister was coming with some friends.
I am Masumi Sera, her sister!
What?
You mean you're a girl?
Well I was convinced that you're a boy.
About that...
Do you mind if I ask you what's in the bag on your back?
In here, you mean?
It's a bat.
Whenever we come here I always carry it to defend myself.
It's pretty thin, for a baseball bat.
It must not be very good for playing.
I just use it to defend myself.
What's bones, over here?
To... to defend yourself from what?
-No.
-Well, no.
Not that I know of.
Do you?
Mm!
That's good!
Yes, oysters, it's very good.
You make delicious burgers, Tamames, really.
Yes.
What do you like, Conan?
I always tell him he could open a burger joint.
I always tell him he could open a burger shop.
Isn't that right?
-He's right.
-Come on, what an exaggeration!
You'd make a good living, making hamburgers.
Don't talk nonsense.
Caram, Masumi.
It doesn't cost you anything to eat with a knife and fork.
When I was little I didn't know how to use them,
I learned when I lived abroad.
I can tell, you come from America.
As they say, children learn everything right away.
You've got a little sauce on your cheek, Conan.
By the way, how do you guys know each other?
Hiking club.
We hiked mountains, went camping...
Yeah, like we did in high school,
we could only do it during summer vacation.
Thank you.
Yeah, but we had a great time.
There were only 5 of us, and we all went to class together.
Ah.
You say there were 5 of you?
So, I guess the girl in red that we saw in the woods...
is also coming with you.
Or... where did you see her?
A... in the forest, with the Sonoko.
Well... yes.
And she was dressed in red?
She was wearing a red raincoat and red boots.
She was wearing red, and she had long hair.
Uh, do you think she could be...?
No way, no way.
It's out of the question.
The Satoko is not alive.
It can't be her.
In fact, what I wanted to say...
maybe it's the person who killed her 15 years ago.
(Masumi) Guys...
I'd like to... know this story.
And Conan too, right?
(Masumi) Eh?
(Masumi) Yes, sure.
(Tamames) Well, then.
It's been 15 years since it happened.
In a rural house near here there was a murder.
The victim was a man who had gone to hide from his wife
to spend the weekend with his lover.
But the woman came in with a knife.
"A policeman who was passing by heard the noise
and, when he entered, the room was already a sea of blood."
"The woman's white raincoat
"It was dyed red with the blood of her husband,
whom she had stabbed again and again."
"That's why they call her
the Woman in Red."
Oh!
The Woman in Red?
And now where is this woman?
She's been arrested, hasn't she?
No.
After stabbing the cop, she ran away and hid in the woods.
No one knows where she stops.
After 3 years,
when we rented this cottage for summer vacation,
Satoko, our partner, saw a woman in red.
We all went out together
and we walked through the forest from one end to the other
to see if we could spot her,
but while we were looking for her, Satoko disappeared.
When it started to get dark,
we called the police and they started looking for her.
They found her after a week.
"They pulled her mud-covered corpse
from the bottom of a quicksand swamp."
"One of her shoes was on the edge of the swamp,
so they knew where to look for it."
Next to the shoe was the knife of the woman in red.
And everyone imagined
that Satoko...
"...had met the Woman in Red in the forest
and she had chased her into the swamp."
(Inaudible)
And you want the Masumi to help you catch the Woman in Red?
(Inaudible) What?
Ah.
No, and now!
This is police work.
After that,
we agreed that we would keep coming here every year.

to commemorate the day the body was found.
But 3 years ago strange things started to happen.
We found broken windows,
a pile of apples scattered on the floor...
One day when we didn't have hot water, we opened the tank...
and found it full of red rose petals.
And once a red paint stain appeared on the door.
More and more things were happening.
As for the door,
the owner of the house painted it red after that.
Of course, now I understand why it's all red.
I think all these strange things,
even the Woman in Red that you've seen in the woods,
is a joke in very bad taste.
But... we want to know who is responsible,
so we decided to ask en Sera to find out.
Understood.
I see what this is all about.
You brought me here to solve the mystery of the Woman in Red, didn't you?
No, the Woman in Red is a police matter.
-Huh?
-All right.
I'll go take a look in the woods.
I'll go, too.
Come here, Conan.
Who gave you permission to leave?
Well...
In the meantime, I'll go shopping at the store...
that's about a mile from here.
We'll need drinks and things to eat.
Yes, thank you.
Well, I'll pick up and wash the dishes.
And what do we do?
Shall we go shopping with you?
No, don't worry.
We have divided the work, and my job is to buy and carry.
Hey.
What's wrong, Masaie?
You're making a bad face.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Really, I'm fine.
I-I'll go clean the sink and the bathtub.
Oh, very well, thank you.
Well, I'll clean the rooms.
You want to give me a hand?
Yeah, sure, sure.
Oh, wow.
It's really dirty, isn't it?
Maybe we should have cleaned up before lunch, right?
Don't you think it's even too dirty?
Woman, think that there was a crime in a house here on the edge.
Not many people will want to rent it.
(Vacuum cleaner: clatter)
What a noise it makes, the vacuum cleaner!
It must be one of those industrial ones with more power.
That's right.
Yes, the ones they advertise on TV.
(Tamames) Hey, girls.
What would you like for dinner?
I will begin to prepare it.
- (Tamames: laughing) All right, all right.
-Something good.
(Tamames: no need, thanks.)
I want help making it, Tamames?
I've got it all under control.
Have you finished cleaning the dining room, girls?
Yes.
Will you help me clean the other rooms?
(At the same time) Sure, oh, so much.
(Sumika) Look, Masaie has filled the bathtub.
What a detail she has had!
And what should she do now?
Clean the sink?
At the ideal temperature.
How is the water?
How come it has this greenish color?
It's because of some bath salts that Masaie likes very much.
My mother likes them too.
She says they eliminate toxins.
And I've heard they're very good for the skin.
What, girls?
Shall we finish cleaning up quickly and take a bath together?
The bathtub's big enough, we can all fit.
Come on, let's go!
Good thinking.
(Jinsuke) We're here.
Hello.
(Jinsuke) -Yes.
-Ah, you all come together?
I met this pair on my way back
and they helped me carry the bags.
I've been all over the forest, but I haven't found any clues.
I see.
Well, that's a remedy, then.
We'll let it go for today.
It's getting late, and I'm making you my signature dish for dinner.
Where's Ran and the others?
That's good!
Because I'm so hungry, I...
Ah.
They said they're taking a bath after cleaning up.
Ran is in the bathtub with Sumika and Sonoko.
Wh-but what is this?
It looks like another bad joke.
(Sonoko) What a bad joke!
(Sonoko) What's wrong?
Hey.
What's the matter?
Is he alright?
Red...
Oh!
Red...
Red's... Woman...
"The bathtub has appeared full of tomatoes..."
"Red tomatoes."
"It's one of the jokes they were talking about earlier."
What?
Uh, where is it in Masaie?
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen it since lunchtime.
Jinsuke, do you know where it is in Masaie?
I don't know, I haven't seen him.
Where did he go?
He said he'd clean the sink and the bathtub, right?
Ah... Yes, that's what he said.
"Gee, no."
"No way."
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

This boy is in Masaie, right?
Yes.
"Oysters!"
"Sure, it was a bathtub."
It's... he's dead, right, in Masaie?
Uh... Yes.
This looks like it.
- (Jinsuke) We all know.
Then who could it have been?
Masaie was killed by the Woman in Red.
It can only be her.
The... the woman in red...
They don't exist.
Neither spirits, nor monsters, nor witches, nor wizards exist.
They are just fantastic characters.
