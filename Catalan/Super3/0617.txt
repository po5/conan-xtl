"Well!
The moment you decide what you want to do in life,
you must be honest with yourself.
In Conan Edogawa is cornered.
The Ran can't find out the secret!
The truth always comes out in the end.
He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

"Following Mrs. Diana's invitation,
"an English woman we meet by chance,
we all go on a trip together in London, the capital of the United Kingdom."
"Naturally, I can't leave the country with the identity of Conan Edogawa," he says,
"So Ay gives me two antidotes...
"So I can temporarily become Shinichi Kudo again,
and I fly to London without Ran and Kogoro knowing."
"I'm in the land of my dreams, the paradise of Sherlock Holmes!"
"I want to go to so many places that I don't know if I'll have time!"
"Unfortunately,
in London we get the threat of a possible multiple murder."
"The Apollo,
"The younger brother of the famous tennis player Minerva Glass.
"has received a cryptic message from a suspicious man,
a text accompanied by the words 'someone will die before your eyes'."
"On the letter there is written a mysterious text
that seems to hide a code."
"The sound of a bell wakes me up."
"I am a long-nosed magician who lives in a castle."
"My ration is a hard-boiled egg as cold as a corpse."
"I'll finish the meal with a whole pickle."
"Come to think of it, I'll save a cake for the celebration."
"The bell rings again and stokes my hatred."
"It tells me to end it all,
piercing a white back with two swords."
"May I know what he intends to tell us, this man?"
"We are to take the Apollo's mysterious message to Scotland Yard,
"And there we learn that there are many other children
who have received the same coded message."
"If all these children have to see a murder right in front of their eyes,
may actually be warning us of a massacre?!"
"Holmes' Book of the Apocalypse (Love is Zero)"
(Kogoro) The British Museum.
Buckingham Palace.
Hyde Park.
Well...
We have already toured all the most famous places in the city.
But we haven't seen anything suspicious.
And there was no one handing out strange papers either.
Look, at least we've been able to do a bit of sightseeing.
What are you talking about?
I've been all the time looking for suspicious people like a paranoid!
I didn't have the head for sightseeing!
It's just that...
I'm going to buy something to drink, wait for me here.
Okay, I'm going to buy something to drink, wait for me here.
(thinks) "So a code, huh?"
"I've taken a picture of him too, just in case, but...
I don't understand anything."
"Although... Shinichi here..."
"I'd like to call him for help, but I'm embarrassed.
What are you hanging up?
What's wrong with you?
"I booed her in a bad way and hung up."
"Of course, in fact,
it's understandable, she's in a bad mood."
"It must have tasted serious to her.
"That she went to the city of her dreams without him,
and then to brag about it."
"What a fool I am... I didn't realize that the fair."
"I even looked for information on the internet."
"How can I be... so stupid?"
Eh?
Ah...
Sherlock Holmes!
Wow...
We've ended up in Baker Street again, I didn't even notice.
Wow, wow.
So, you're Japanese.
"Yes...
Ah... I mean, yes. Quins memories, the Japanese.
I lived in Japan for a while, me.
My mother had eye surgery there,
and she was hospitalized for a long time.
So... you must be...
Or rather, you must be Minerva Glass!
XXT! The tennis player!
If anyone else recognizes me, it will make it very difficult for me to get back to the hotel!
Aai... You come here often?
Yes.
I always come before the Wimbledon final,

because in Holmes he entrusts me with his observation skills,
which always helps me to win.
I see that you like it in Holmes, eh?
It is largely influenced by the mother.
My father was German, but the mother is English.
She has always been a Holmes fan.
But recently she went blind,
and now she can only read Conan Doyle novels in braille.
And my father and my sister, 6 years younger,
were killed... in a car accident 8 years ago.
(Apollo) Minerva!
When the father died, the mother was pregnant with Apollo!
And because of all this, I am now the pillar of the Glass family.
(Apollo) By the way... Hm?
How did you know, what you told me?
That I had love problems, I mean...
By the look on your face, woman.
It was just like the one I used to see when I looked in the mirror.
Eh?
That you had a love disappointment, you?
So much so, I have long since stopped suffering.
Holmes said it very well:
"Love is an emotional thing,
and the emotional is contrary to cold reason.
And I put this cold reason before anything else,
he said.
And tennis is the same.
Love in tennis is zero.
Love equals zero, and, no matter how much we multiply it,
it always leads to defeat.
Oh...
No!
It's not here either!
Nor here either!
Ah!
A place that is a kind of castle
where there are two watch shops...
food stores, a bakery and an armory, it's a beast!
There is no place like that in the city!
Maybe we'll leave it.
It's already 8 o'clock in the evening.
But what are you saying, man?
If it's still very bright...
Ah, of course!
At this time of the year,
in the London area it doesn't get dark until after 9 o'clock at night...
(Mobile) Eh?
(Ringtone)
"Uh, hello, Ran! What's wrong?"
As if nothing is wrong?!
That at 8 o'clock we had arranged to meet with Mrs. Diana
the hotel restaurant for dinner.
I reminded you! "Gee, I'm sorry."
"Time flew by, talking about the message with the doctor."
Well, here we have already started dinner!
So, now it's not worth our while to come.
We'll have fish and chips or something.
What't'empatolles? May I know where it is?
It is very late.
"Eh? I really don't know."
There is nothing nearby to serve as a reference point?
Let's see... W-we've got a giant Ferris wheel next to it.
"That must be the London Eye!"
"Well, it is, huh?!" (hangs up)
Ah, wait...! (communication cut off: tut, tut)
Oh!
But what do you say, the London Eye?
If we have the Big Ben, together!
And what did you want me to do?
Imagine he says he's coming to get us.
We could not continue to investigate the message.
Yeah, but... Ran must be worried, poor thing.
It's all right!
Before they finish dinner, we'll be back.
Wait here, I'll go get that pair!
What's that?
But...!
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
What? What?
What?
What "speaking now"?
Okay.
(gasps) Huh?
(gasps) The London Eye... it's pretty far away.
"What are we going to do, I'll have to go there in the ordinary."
"At this distance it's not worth taking a cab."
"Oh..."
"This Conan is a case..."
"How can he get so distracted by the investigation
that he forgets to eat and everything?"
"Of course..."
"Of course..."
In Holmes it also says it, that when you are hungry?
is when the brain works the hardest and is most awake.
"Maybe yes, that I should call Shinichi."
"The truth is that it's a very complex text."
"I don't know... I don't dare to call him."
"But..."
This means that it is very possible
that they will kill a large number of people at once!
Oh... What do you want me to tell you?
Maybe the message does not refer to the stores
that sell these foods, but to something else.
Right.
In the first line it says... "The sound of a bell wakes me up."
Then, "I am a long-nosed wizard who lives in a castle."
"My ration is a hard-boiled egg as cold as a corpse."
"I'll finish the meal with a whole pickle."
"Come to think of it, I'll save a cake for the celebration."
"The bell rings again and stokes my hatred."
And to the last he says:
"It tells me to put an end to it all,

piercing a white back with two swords".
I can't make sense of it, really.
If only... we knew what the bell is at the beginning,
we could pull the thread with the rest.
(Mobile: buzzing)
"Again the Ran?"
"Let me concentrate on the text, geez!"
(Conan voice) Yes, say? "Is that you, Shinichi?"
Eh? It's me, the Ran.
(Thinking) "What a blunder! It's Shinichi's cell phone!"
"He must have been sleeping, right? In Japan it's 5 o'clock in the morning."
No, he was awake.
I was just tossing and turning on a case.
I'm sorry about before.
I shouldn't have called you or hung up...
It's just that I was so happy that I was able to come to London,
and since you're always talking to me;
it must have sounded like I was giving you teeth.
"No, woman! I'm not angry!"
"It's just that you caught me at a bad time, nothing more."
Yes?
In any case, forgive me.
"Changing the subject,
I have a code I'd like you to help me solve."
This code you say you had already sent it to me that nano, in Conan.
I didn't really sleep because I was thinking about the text.
But at the "sound of a bell" at the beginning already....
(Bell: chimes)
I'm already stuck...
Eh!
"The sound... of a bell!"
(Bell: chimes)
(Bell: ringing)
Sure, it's Big Ben!
He's talking about Big Ben!
What? "Yes, woman, can't you feel them?"
It must be the bells of Big Ben!
"Surely they are 'the sound of a bell' it says from the text!"
But how do you feel them, from here?
Ah!
Shinichi, what did you mean by this?
"No, it's just that..." Don't tell me you're in London, eh?
I-it's the TV!
They're making a connection to London.
I'm watching it live! You finally came!
Oh, I have another call!
I'm sorry!
I'll talk to you later!
(Communication cut off: tut, tut, tut)
"Now I understand."
"That's why you reacted so strangely...
and you were in such a hurry to hang up."
Because you're in London too!
Ah!
Danger!
The Ran is coming this way! It can't be!
We're supposed to be near the London Eye, don't you remember?
In... in any case...
...we should leave.
Y-yeah, right!
(thump)
Oooh!
Here's how I threw the culprit
flying through the air with a good ippon-seoi.
"Baritsu?
No, woman.
It's judo!
"I have no idea what it says."
Oh, yes!
Oooh!
"I already found it strange, me!"
"It was impossible that he wasn't dying of envy!"
"I won't let him get away!"
(gasps)
Eh ?!
It can't be!
It's the bridge I just crossed!
It must have gone over the sidewalk on the other side.
Shinichi!
Cason Dena!
If we don't find a place to hide, Ran will find us!
Two Japanese don't go unnoticed!
After the bridge, we'd better split up!
Yes, you're right! Ah!
Did you get hurt? Aai...
Ay, ay, ay, ay... Coi de desagüe!
How could you leave it uncovered?
Eh?
There's an inscription next to it.
"The Valley of Fear"...
It's the title of a Sherlock Holmes novel...
Come on, man.
Hurry up!
Yes, I'm coming.
"What was he doing there?"
"I'm lost!"
"If you find me now, you'll find out I'm Shinichi Kudo!"
"I have... no choice."
Shinichi...
You have no escape!
You can explain to me what you're doing, in London!
Shinichi, talk!
There's nothing to explain.
I had a trip to London planned, too.
It's a coincidence.
"Oh, Mother..."
"This fool has taken the antidote he needed to return!"
Then why were you running away from me?
N-no... It's not that I was running away.
But since I hadn't thought to tell you that I was coming too,
now I was embarrassed;
I-I didn't know how to explain it to you.
But why didn't you tell me?
You've had many opportunities to do so!
You have to understand me, Ran, I didn't want to... What a fool I am.
What a fool I am. I feel stupid.
I made the movie all by myself.
"I've been doing so much research...! I have suffered so much that I thought I was dying!"
How can I be so stupid!
It's exactly as she says....
Love is zero.
No matter how much we multiply it, the result is defeat.

A-now I'm lost.
La Minerva Glass told me this, and she's absolutely right!
Minerva Glass?
The Queen of the Runway?
You mean you've met her?
I've met her on Baker Street!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
A Baker Street?!
Hey, Ran, and was there some kid, with her?!
"Well yes. It looks like it was her little brother."
Tell me... Has he said anything, this child?
Did he comment or remember anything?
Come on, calm down!
Calm down?
Don't you understand?
Don't you say you're a detective, you?
Well, if you are, prove it,
and make an effort to try to deduce what I feel!
Idiot! Hey!
Wait, Ran!
Where are you going?
Ran!
You wait!
Ran!

"Mazarin Stone"?
From the fingerprints that were on the papers in the message,
it looks like they have identified a suspect.
He blew up the hospitals that refused to operate on his mother.
He says he blew them up?
Does he have explosives, then?
We can't make it clear on the phone!
Wait for me here, don't move.
I'll be right back!
