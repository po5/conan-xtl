DETECTIVE CONAN
The murder of the head of the Hotta family
I've come all this way because it's an important case, otherwise...
You should have said you could not.
I can't waste my time looking for a lost iguana!
(thinks) "It would be the perfect job for you."
You have a problem, sir?
Yes, my car broke down.
Would you mind giving me a ride to a house up ahead?
Oh, man...
I'd pay for it, of course.
Of course you would!
Wherever you want!
I'm very sorry.
My name is Kosaku Hotta.
Aaa... thank you.
Wow!
Hotta Heavy Industries!
You are the president of such a big company?!
Hello, Yamauchi.
But... Sir!
What happened to you?
My car broke down and this gentleman came with me.
That's too bad.
I'm in Yamauchi,
the butler of Mr. Kosaku Hotta's house.
I thank you for the gesture.
Ah, it would be lacking... I could find myself any day now.
Have Koichi and the whole group arrived?
Yes.
They were all worried because you didn't arrive.
You can count on it.
I doubt it very much.
They'd be happier if I'd died in an accident.
Mr. Mouri...
I'm having a birthday party tonight
and I'd really like you to stay.
-Ah, I don't know if... -I don't know if... -If you'd like to.
Well, why not, right?
Yes, we'll stay.
As we saw that you were taking so long, we were already suffering.
We were afraid you wouldn't have had an accident, father.
Hotta Industries would go under, if it wasn't for you.
You can say that again.
I don't know what we would do without you, father.
Château Petrus, 1979. A great wine, sir.
In Koichi has brought it expressly for his birthday.
It must be a very expensive wine.
Of course it is!
You'd be stunned if you knew how much it's worth.
It's very good, worthy of being called the king of wines.
Well then, let's toast to our father's 58th birthday.
Just a moment!
Why don't you taste it first, Koichi?
What do you mean by that?
Just in case someone gets poisoned.
That would be a drama, wouldn't it?
-You're a guitar player, Ryoji! (Ryoji) -There are rumors.
The foreign trade department has had a lot of problems
because of your short-sightedness.
You'll be transferred to a branch office
because you're being controlled by your father.
Are you insinuating that I intend to assassinate the father?!
Worried about you.
You have a lot of gambling debts!
And because you asked for money, now they are looking for you to collect them!
AAAI... Now we won't have dinner.
Enough of this!
I've had enough!
(Girl) As always, you're such a well-adjusted family...
-Fumiko!
-Fumiko!
What are you doing here?
Gee, what a nice welcome.
You sent me the invitation.
I cut ties with you 5 years ago.
Why would I invite you?!
I don't want to see you again.
Get out of here!
You told me to come because we talked!
We're not supposed to talk about anything!
Ah... well, I thought there was going to be a party tonight.
Come, Father, please...
Mr. Yamauchi, what problem did you have, Mr. Hotta and Fumiko?
Hotta and Fumiko?
I don't know.
I've only been the butler of this house for two years.
It's whiskey.
Oh, my goodness!
Who could have given it to me?
Wow!
What's happened?!
Lord!
A bomb!
-What? -Huh? -Oh?
Oh, my God!
-Truqui to the police! Yes, sir!
Clearly someone has planted a bomb in this room.
It can't be!
Quiet!
Don't come in!
Please wait outside until the police arrive!
Just a moment!
Who do you think you are, you?
The best detective in the world, in Kogoro Mouri!
-In Kogoro Mouri... -He's very famous!
Most likely the bomb was made of dynamite.

If they had used dynamite, wouldn't you smell gunpowder?
I told you to wait for him outside!
(Think) "Pieces of glass and wood stuck in your hand."
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
"A gift box of whiskey."
"The pieces of glass nailed to his body are pieces of bottle."
What's this?
The bomb was inside the whiskey box.
That's why there's glass.
I get it.
You didn't have to tell me, I had already figured it out!
It's quite clear to you, kiddo!?
(Think) "ungrateful."
"Eh?"
"Earth? How could there be earth?"
Father!
Mm?
Where is he, Mr. Yamauchi?
The phone doesn't work and he's trying to fix it.
Wow!
What a ?!
There's one person who had a grudge against him: you, Fumiko.
It's true!
We haven't heard from you for 5 years.
It's strange that you came just today,
even though no one invited you.
Yes... I hated it to the point of wishing death!
But it wasn't me, you understand?
Even if I am grateful to the murderer.
And I think I'm not the only one who rejoices in this death.
You are rejoicing too.
My God, what a group...
Still not working, the phone?
It looks like they cut the wires with a knife.
A knife?!
What shall we do, Mr. Mouri?
-Mmm...-What's this?
The bomb was inside the whisky gift box.
Where did it come from, this box?
Doesn't it ring a bell?
-Man, well... -Please explain it to me!
I think it's the gift that Ryoji gave to his father.
I remember because I brought it in Mr. Hotta's room.
-What?
In Ryoji?
-By the way, where is it, in Ryoji? -In Ryoji?
He ran away!
Gee, no.
A knife!
This is Ryoji's car.
If he's got the car here, he can't be far away in Ryoji.
He must have been hiding near the house.
(Thinking) "The wheel... the wheel is busted!"
What do you think we have to do now?
It seems to me that we'll have to go by car.
That's out of the question!
Why is that?
Well, because the tires of all the cars have burst.
It's terrible... We won't be able to leave until tomorrow.
It must have been Ryoji!
There's tire residue on the knife!
Let's see, how did you come, you guys?
We came by cab, we did, Mr. Detective.
-Are there any other cars?
-Mi.
But it's broken down, so it's no good to us.
We can't leave here.
If the killer is in Ryoji,
why did he blow out the tires of his own car?
That's normal.
He knew he would be the first suspect
if the police saw that his car's tires weren't blown out.
(He thinks) "This gives me a bad feeling."
"The fact that he disappeared right after he sent her the gift,
makes him the prime suspect."
"There was no need for him to blow out the tires."
"It's not on Ryoji."
"If the murderer wants to leave the family isolated here....
some other misfortune could happen!"
In Ryoji it must be this way.
Don't get separated, and don't let anyone go out alone.
You must be kidding, right?
I'm going back to my room!
Fumiko...
Wow!
How disrespectful.
Come on, please go inside, if you don't mind!
Mr.
Mouri, if you allow me, I'll try to fix my car.
Be careful, Mr. Yamauchi.
Hey, man, come on in!
Eh?
Okay. (Thinking)
(Think) "Fumiko's pendant!"
Miss Fumiko...
Shut up!
I've got a lot of work to do now!
Maybe look for that.
Come back to me!
Thank you very much, pretty boy.
This little object is my most valuable treasure.
Your boyfriend?
He died, 5 years ago.
He committed suicide.
No, more like murdered.
The real culprit of his death was my father!
That's why I left home.
I couldn't forgive my father...
I'm sorry, kid.
You must not be interested in anything, these stories of the past...
right not, my boy?
(Think) "Fumiko hated M. Hotta."
"But, honestly,
I doubt she had time to prime the bomb."
(Adult voice) What is this?!
Chemical fertilizer!
Maybe that bomb was made with it.
(Think) "Just as I imagined, sulfur and chemicals,
including the fertilizer he was holding in his hand."
Sure... the killer is him!

"What if it was...?"
Have you been able to fix it yet?
Ah... it's you, Conan!
Oh, my goodness!
Sir, it's very old, this car?
It's the first car I designed.
You were a car designer?
Yes, until 5 years ago, exactly.
But I quit because of a problem...
Wow, it's the first time I've seen a car like this.
Wow!
In this very old car there is an airbag!
Conan, nice, could you tell Fumiko, please?
And why?
I'll leave the car for her to call the police.
Everyone will want Mr.
Mouri to stay.
And you, sir?
I'm the butler.
I always have to stay here.
Of course you do.
I'll let you know.
Let's sit down, then.
It's time to eat!
Oh... where is he, in Conan, now?
Don't worry, he must be playing fora.
Oh, that nano!
I'm going to look for him!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Here we are...
Eeeh?
(Kogoro voice) Why is he standing so still?
This photograph was in your room.
You came into my room without my permission, detective?
I found something very interesting.
You have sulfur and chemicals hidden in your bedroom closet.
Turns out the bomb wasn't made with dynamite.
It was a homemade bomb,
made from a mixture of fertilizer, sulfur and other chemicals!
Can you make a bomb, with these products?
Of course it can.
With the right quantities,
you can make a bomb as powerful as dynamite.
What motive could I, poor me, have to kill Mr. Hotta?
Hotta?
You have murdered her,
to avenge the death of the person in the photograph.
Who, 5 years ago, committed suicide because of Mr. Hotta.
And I get the impression, Mr. Yamauchi,
that this boy is your son!
You have taken the whiskey that I had brought in Ryoji
and took it up to Mr. Hotta's room, didn't you?
Hotta's room, didn't you?
And you prepared the explosive by mixing the phosphate fertilizer,
the sulfur and the chemicals.
You placed the explosive inside the box
and added white phosphorus so that it ignites very easily.
The bomb is activated just like lighting a match.
But you didn't want to commit the perfect crime.
This was exactly the same for you.
You wanted no one to suspect you,
to have your hands free to commit another murder!
What's that?
The next murder?
(Car engine)
The Fumiko!
I have to admit that you're a great detective, Mr.
Mouri.
You are absolutely right.
My son, in Kentaro, was a humble pianist,
a young man in love with music.
He had a girlfriend and they dated,
but since he didn't have much money,
he dared to ask her if she wanted to marry him.
Five years ago, he won a piano competition and became very famous.
Then, he found himself with the heart to ask her if she wanted to marry him.
But the girl's father did not consent.
It was Mr.
Hotta.
Mr. Yamauchi, you mean the bride was the Fumiko?
In Kentaro came to talk to Mr. Hotta.
Hotta
to ask if he could marry his daughter.
And apart from objecting,
en Hotta stepped on the fingers of en Kentaro's hand.
The piano was everything, for Kentaro.
And after that incident, he could no longer play.
And on top of that, the Fumiko disregarded en Kentaro.
And disappeared, poor son.
After the funeral,
when I heard what had happened, I was indignant.
I was always so busy,
and I didn't know what problems my son had.
(Kogoro voice) And he decided he would take revenge.
(Kogoro voice) Exactly.
I quit my job,
found out everything I could about Mr. Hotta's life.
Hotta's life,
and became a house butler so I could take revenge on them.
But the Fumiko, it took me two years to track her down.
And she decided that she would murder them
taking advantage of Mr. Hotta's birthday party.
Hotta
and sent an invitation to Fumiko.
Yes.
And I don't have to wait for anything.
I did what I had to do, sir.
Didn't you leave with your car, Fumiko?
When Fumiko got in that car,
her destination was already decided.
"I prepared the car."
"When I step on the brake pedal, the airbag will inflate."
By now, she must be dead.
I can see she didn't understand.
What?
Why does she think she's still single, Fumiko?
Because she's still in love with Kentaro!
Don't talk nonsense!

Her father had disinherited her and made her leave home.
He had not disinherited her!
She left home on her own initiative,
because she couldn't forgive her father for what he had done to Kentaro.
That's a lie!
I don't believe it!
The Fumiko left in Kentaro!
What is this?
It's Fumiko's most valuable treasure.
It's the memory of her relationship with Kentaro.
It's the treasure chest of her memories.
Fumiko always carries it and it is hardly ever taken out.
Fumiko, even though she is fond of Kentaro!
She couldn't forget him!
Do you understand, Mr. Yamauchi!?
It can't be!
But what have I done?
I've killed a person I loved... my son!
Fumiko.
Hasn't the airbag inflated?
No, Yamauchi, Conan sent me a very timely message.
He told me to come back immediately.
Fumiko... I didn't...
I also hated my father to the point... of wanting to kill.
But... I can't forgive Kentaro either...
How he dared to leave me alone...
and allow his father to commit a crime like this?
You are... a bad person.

"In Ryoji was bound in the basement."
Oh!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Is anyone there?
Where are they, people?
Wow!
How hungry I am, all of a sudden!
Coi, sure, but now it's breakfast time!
Mr. Yamauchi, breakfast, please!
I'm starving!
I'm not fussy, bring me anything to eat!
Mr. Yamauchi!
(Thinking) "It's so strange. This gives me a bad feeling."
How strange... Eh?
The face mask is put on when you've already washed your face.
"I get it!"
"The killer must be that person!"
