(Radio) "Next, the baseball results.
The Chinichi Dragons one point ahead, three to two."
(Shots)
Hey, have you died?
Yes.
I screwed up 4 shots.
I'm sure he's well dead.
In Saiz Kano, the shadow mastermind, has he been swallowed by the sea?
You can put your hands in the fire.
There are very strong waves here.
The fish will eat him up.
B-but why did we have to kill it?
You mean there was?
You're such a fool!
Can't you see he was a coward?
Because we killed a bank employee, she wanted to turn herself in.
Besides, these bills...
It's true.
Of the 400 million, 300 are in numbered bills.
Don't worry, don't worry.
We have already done what we had to do.
Now we just have to wait for the time to pass.
It has!
It's our farewell gift.
Don't hold it against us... master!
An assassination attempt 20 years ago
The case of the murders on board the Symphony
A record!
A record!
Surely the solution is a record!
What are you talking about, Ran?
This contest.
Look at it! AAAI!
Look, that!
A riddle?
Let me guess.
Let's see...
"Something very important
that more than 10 years ago almost all Japanese people had...
"It's something very valuable that is no longer seen today.
People who had... "Read below!
Don't get in my way!
"The first 10 winners will be invited to go on a trip."
We can try.
Why don't we each take a disc and come along?
You'd like to see the dolphins, wouldn't you, Conan?
Wouldn't you?
Besides, these holidays we don't have to do anything...
Casum the pot!
Enough of this color, daughter!
First of all, your answer is not correct!
If it were a record, I would not put "the Japanese".
Very well, and what is the answer, then?
The samurai spirit that we have lost these last years.
And how can you carry this?
Besides, I don't have samurai spirit now or 10 years ago.
So, maybe a yo-yo, a pair of bell-bottoms, or a hula-hoop?
A Spectrum computer?
I already have it!
A scarf in the shape of a lizard!
10 or 15 years ago they were the latest crit.
What's this?
Listen.
What if the answer is this?
Correct answer!
All right, you can pass.
That's great!
You got it right, Conan! It was a fluke.
Next, please.
It's a good thing we had them well saved, these old bills.
Hey, we'll put them away right away, don't let them take them!
Don't make us laugh...
Don't suffer.
Nowadays they could not use them anywhere.
Isn't it the Rubick's cube?
I don't believe it!
Wrong answer.
Of course it is!
Next, please.
(Kogoro) Hey, wait!
(Kogoro) Coi, how nice! What a thrill!
(Woman) Congratulations!
Here, take the brochure explaining the trip.
(Kogoro) Ah.
Thank you very much.
About it... With us, how many passengers are we?
You are 3, but the child is not counted.
That's 9. Only one passenger left.
We're right on schedule!
What luck!
(Think) "A trip with only 10 passengers.
For so few, this ship is huge."
Conan!
(Conan) Let's go!
I'm coming!
It looks like a hotel!
Not bad, to go all the way to Oogasabara.
-Welcome, sir. -Ah, thank you.
There are 3 of you, right?
They're all family?
Yes, more or less.
We'll give you a double cabin.
110.
Hey, Mr. Masaru Furukawa, the trip organizer, is he here?
Well...
I'd like to thank him for inviting us.

It's just... we don't know him, Mr. Furukawa.
You don't know him?
The ship's reservation and passenger selection procedures
you have executed by phone.
And the boat rental has been paid by bank transfer.
Perhaps he is waiting for us at the port of Oogasabara, at the end of the journey.
Ah.
Well... thank you very much.
By the way, can you tell us the name, please?
Yes, of course!
My name is Kogoro Mouri.
Private detective.
(Male) former inspector of the first section of investigations
turned into a great private detective!
Am I wrong?
Wow!
Inspector Samezaki!
Hey, hey, I'm not an inspector anymore.
Luckily, I retired more than two years ago.
Ah!
Long time no see!
Oh, wow, Ran!
How beautiful!
You're a woman now!
But what are you doing here?
Well, look.
I wanted to see the sea.
Besides, today is a special day, isn't it?
A special day?
Since it's been 10 years since you left the police force, you don't remember, do you?
By the way, by the way!
And that beautiful woman you had?
Don't tell me she's still separated.
Yes, although, still... But I don't care.
Too bad for her.
Father!
-Daixò... (Kogoro) -What's up?
Ah, no, nothing.
I'll see you later.
A seal?
You dropped it. Eh?
That's very kind of you.
Thank you very much, sir.
Eh?
Ah... you're welcome, you're welcome.
Why did you say thank you, if you picked him up?
You'll find out.
(Boy) Hey!
You want to tell me nothing?
Yes.
I was waiting for you.
What do you think, if we go to the bar for a drink?
-I'll bring you the suitcase, sir! -There isn't one.
-Excuse me.
You're traveling alone? -Yes, I am.
Not counting the child, with you there are already 10. You're the last one.
We can leave now, can't we?
Besides, we're already past the departure time.
No, not yet.
That grandfather, the first to arrive, said he'd left something behind,
but he hasn't come back.
But he told me that he was sleeping in his cabin
and not to wake him up until dinner time.
Eh?
When should he be back?
Be that as it may, we already have the 10 passengers.
We'll have to tell the waiting ones that they can go back.
-Very well.
Your cabin is 107. Thank you.
Excuse me, sir...
Haven't we met before, you and I?
No.
You must have the wrong person.
I've never seen you before.
Well, you've already discovered a criminal, Inspector Samezaki?
(Girl) Luckily, it will be a very safe trip, Mr. Mouri.
You are a police inspector and you are a private detective.
That makes 3 in all.
-Three? -In addition to the two of us...?
That's right.
There is another detective, but from the looks of it, he doesn't seem to be.
(Megaphone) "Thank you for joining us aboard the Symphony.
"We will arrive in Oogasabara first thing tomorrow morning.
Relax and enjoy the ride."
I am the king of the mooon!
He told me he wanted to do it at least once.
Voice masses movies.
Besides, what if we sink?
Better not to call bad weather.
(Man) Ha-ha-ha!
Well, well!
The sea tinged with the color of sunset.
You can understand why they call that when they see such a beautiful landscape.
Ah... How nice!
This is fantastic!
It's nice, in the sea, isn't it?
All worries seem to melt away.
You are absolutely right.
The sea takes everything away...
The bitter memories..., the uncertainty for the future...
Even the corpses.
Eh?
Did you say the corpses?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I said something silly.
But it's just that years ago my father lost his life at sea and...
I'm sorry about that.
But we must be grateful
to the one who gave us this trip, Mr. Furukawa.
I know him! Eh?
I picked up an earthen seal earlier, didn't I?
It said Furukawa on it.
You've seen it too, haven't you, Conan?
Yes.
That's why you thanked him, right, daughter?
That's right.
Look, it's over there.
Mr. Furukawa is the one sitting over there.
Maybe he's waiting for dinner time to introduce himself and surprise us.
He's very strange.
Earlier, he told me his name.
I think he told me Kameda.
Oh, did he?
-Hey, Mouri!
It's dinner time! -Ah, yes.
We're coming!
Are you the famous detective Kogoro Mouri?

What a surprise!
Ah... Yes.
Wow!
I hadn't noticed that either.
I'm going to rest in the cabin for a while.
You haven't changed.
You get dizzy right away.
-A little wine, sir?
-Yes.
Thank you, sir.
That there are so few of us on such a big ship, it's a bit scary, isn't it?
You're right, sir.
Counting the two resting in the cabin, there are only 11 of us.
Counting him and me, right?
These two people you say are the other detective and the grandfather?
That's right.
The grandfather, I found him in the corridor, and he didn't tell me anything.
What does he do, this gentleman?
Well, you can see he's an eminent scholar of the sea.
Of it... His name is Saiz Kano.
Which cabin is he in?!
In 101, sir.
Saiz Kano?
This name sounds quite familiar...
You fool!
Don't you remember?
We're handling the case together!
He's the main accused in the 400 million robbery.
In Saiz Kano, the shadow mastermind!
-Who carries the key?
-Yes!
Ready?
He may be carrying a gun.
When you've opened...
step aside at once.
All right, now...
Take it easy, kid, it'll be all right.
It's... it's open.
Let's go, let's go!
That's...
(Thinking) It's strange.
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
-Are you sure it's this cabin, kid? -Yes, it is!
I'm sure it's this one, sir.
(Thinking) Shit!
I'll look downstairs!
Mouri, you take the top!
Eh ?!
From a... All right!
Eeeeeei!
Where are you?
You're here, aren't you?
I've already read the message!
Eeeeeeeeei!
Eh?
If it's not in the cabin it must be on the deck.
-And this cabin next to it? -It's the other detective's cabin.
He hasn't left since he boarded.
This gives me a bad feeling.
(Knock on the door) Hey!
Are you all right?
(Kogoro) Hey?
(Kogoro) Let me try it myself.
Hey, you!
It's in here, isn't it?
Answer me!
(Kogoro) Hey!
There's nothing to do.
Can you open up?
What's the matter?
What the hell is it, so much noise?
Hey!?
Oysters!
Mouri!
What are you doing here?
(Think) That's what I say!
The "shadow brain"?
When I was a kid, my father explained something to me about this guy.
His real name is Saiz Kano.
He is the main responsible for a heist 20 years ago:
the 400 million yen heist.
(Off) "He always prepared the heists down to the smallest detail,
and he had a great ability to mislead the police.
"That's why they called him "the shadow mastermind."
"In every heist he changed partners.
"The most remarkable thing was that he always acted without anyone noticing.
But in that robbery they killed one person by mistake."
Since then, nothing has been heard.
And you're sure it was the one who slept in the next cabin?
(Kogoro) We haven't found anyone.
Inspector Samezaki is looking for her.
(Kogoro) Gee, gee.
How strange!
He wasn't dead?
Didn't they find his blood-stained jacket
with a bullet hole in it on a beach?
(Samezaki) He's not dead.
That jacket was a trap to mislead the police.
That guy was too smart to die just like that.
I thought he'd be counting the money from the robbery by now
to split it with his buddies,
but I didn't figure it would be on this boat.
But that case was already time-barred.
Even if we found him, no....
You fool!
Don't you remember?
Murders are time-barred at 15 years,
but civil cases are not time-barred until 20.
If we demanded that he pay back the money, he should.
The pity is that the charges against en Kano are now time-barred,
but we still don't know who the 3 were that were with him that day.
If we could make him sing, maybe we would get the money back.
In fact, maybe his companions are also on board this ship.
Oogasabara we can look for them with the help of the local police.
We are in the middle of the sea, it is almost impossible for them to run away.
(Samezaki) Shrike!
We don't have that much time!
Didn't I tell you that today is a special day?
Tomorrow is 20 years to the day that robbery was committed.
At 12 o'clock at night, a new life begins for them:
they are free!
There are just over two hours left.
(Thinking) Wow, the statute of limitations expires today.
Eh?
Hattori!
What are you doing here?
Hello, Ran!

Long time no see!
Wow!
Were you on this boat?
What an illusion!
I was sleeping and this gentleman came to wake me up.
The Kazuha came too?
Why should I have come?
I wouldn't, here.
We are not like you two, who go everywhere together.
Eh?
Like us?
Yes, woman... Like you... You and Conan...
Watch what you say!
Mr. Samezaki, who found him, that shadow man?
No.
Now we'll look for him again with your father.
Very well, then.
We'll be the restaurant downstairs.
Hey, wait a minute!
I want to help you look for him.
You want to leave me alone on a boat where a dangerous criminal is hiding?
You won't, will you? Well...
I'll wait for you downstairs, eh, Father?
(Kogoro) Very well.
(Remember) I'll wait for you, eh?
I'll wait for you, eh, Father?
(Kogoro) Is anything wrong, Inspector?
Ah, no... There's nothing wrong with me.
Let's start looking upstairs and go down slowly.
Okay. (Title: "Free Magic")
