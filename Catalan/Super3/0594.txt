Ah! Ah!
(PA: man) "Hiroshima. Hiroshima."
Ahem!
Hello, this is the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
We just got off the train and are in the city of Hiroshima.
Here beside me, I have my daughter, Ran.
Hello, I am Ran Mouri!
And this one here, this heavy who's accompanying us....
(Think) "This comment could save him."
Soc Conan Edogawa!
We didn't come here to solve a difficult case.
Even a great detective needs to take a vacation.
We're recording, so wait a minute.
He's a famous detective.
(Kogoro) I want to see the most touristy places in the city.
I also want to enjoy its beautiful scenery
and its exquisite cuisine.
I need it to recover my body and mind after the energy I've spent trying to solve a lot of puzzles.
I've spent trying to solve a lot of difficult cases.
What's wrong with you?
What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry, but my tummy hasn't been feeling so good lately.
Don't miss the show:
"A great detective's vacation: a gastronomic tour of Miyajima".
I'm sure you'll like it very much!
Okay, cut.
What, guys, how did it turn out?
Very good, perfect.
I've recorded some very good images.
-What about the sound? -Perfect, Mr. Koshiji.
-Uf... -Wait a moment.
Mr. Mouri, are you really a detective?
You looked like a professional actor.
-Did he?
Really? -Yes, Fumie's right. -Yes, Fumie's right.
He looks like he's been doing it all his life, that.
Well, that's good!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"We were visiting Hiroshima."
"We had been invited by the Nichiuri television station
to do a travel program."
-Mr. Kitamura?! - What's wrong with you?
Hey, what's wrong with you?
What's gotten into you?

(Mobile: beep)
Eh?
Wow, it's Sonoko!
And by video call.
"Hello, Ran!"
What's up, Sonoko?
Didn't you say you'd meet us here?
Y-you're still at home?!
"I just don't know what to wear."
"I don't know if it suits me better
this leaf print dress, which is more for autumn,"
or something a little more formal like the one I'm wearing.
I find they both look great on you.
"Ha."
"We agreed to pass her off as a cousin of the Ran.
"Because she wanted to be on TV with us,
and now she goes and doesn't show up."
Sorry to keep you waiting.
What about Mr. Kitamura?
What about Mr. Kitamura?
Is he better?
I'm sorry you had to worry about it.
I had her stretch and gave her some stomach pills.
"If you rest for the rest of the day, you'll be fine tomorrow."
What do you say we continue the trip as planned?
Yes, that's a good idea.
"Hey, Ran, what's up?"
It seems to me that we have to leave, so I might as well hang up.
You hurry up and come, you feel? "Yes, I won't be long."
Producer's job must not be easy.
I'm sure it's very interesting, that's why.
Do you always have to be, when you shoot a program?
No, in fact, I come very rarely, the shootings.
Yeah, but this time you have come so that our guest is Kogoro, right?
Is that so?
Well... Yes, you could say that.
Wow, what an honor.
Ha-ha-ha!
Eh?
"The trip between Hiroshima and Miyajimaguchi takes 25 minutes."
"Miyajimaguchi Station
is known as the gateway to Miyajima."
"Just a few minutes from the station,

"And after passing by the stalls where they sell conger eel with rice.
"And autumn pasta, a specialty of the area,
you arrive at the Miyajimaguchi pier, where the ferry leaves."
"The sea trip to Miyajima, where Itsukushima Shrine is located,
takes only 10 minutes."
Ah, here we are!
Oh!
Miyajima is a place of veneration for its temples dedicated to the gods,
but the shrine and its gates
are built in the sea, on the water.
At low tide, you can walk through the "torii", the shrine gate.
Look!
This is where they dance the dances in honor of the gods of the temples!
How I would like to see it...
Great!
The grilled oysters are delicious!
Conger eel with rice.
So good!
This tempura is so delicious!
Delicious!
Very good.
Eh? Uh?
Ha-ha!
Ay, ay, ay.
Mm.
Mm!
So good!
The autumn pastries were great.
(Laughs) Huh?
What's the matter?
What bad taste!
Who has put salt in the coffee can?
Salt?! Eh?
-But who could have put it? -I don't know, I have no idea.
When we were rolling I left the can there,
with all our stuff.
-Maybe they played a joke on you. Maybe, but it's a bit heavy.
I don't know,
but who was near our stuff was in Kamisuwa.
Me?
Come on, what are you saying?
I would be incapable of making such a childish joke to someone.
-What? -What?
That man in the trench coat...
-What's the matter?
Do you know him? -No, no.
That man, he says ?!
But I think he's...
Yatsukawa!
We must keep rolling!
We're way behind.
Ah... Yes, sir.
Come on, get everything ready.
Now that my belly is full,
I'm completely at your disposal.
Excuse me, sir.
Eh?
What were you going to say, just now? Ah.
Nothing, I don't think it's of any importance.
There's a guy who's been asking about us
who hasn't stopped asking about us.
Maybe not, but it seemed to me...
it was that man who passed by a moment ago.
"Does a man follow the film crew from Hiroshima to here
and puts salt in a coffee can?"
"But why?"
Besides... Mm?
Look, I don't know if it's true or not,
but they say that someone in the chain is related to illegal gambling.
Of course, it's just a rumor.
Illegal gambling?
Yes.
That's why Mr. Kamisuwa and Mr. Koshiji
are so nervous lately.
Ah!
This is the famous store where they sell autumn pastries!
They say the first autumn pastries were made here in Miyajima.
They look great!
What can I do for you? Hello, good morning.
Which pasta is better?
What would you recommend?
Well, I recommend...
that you keep this assortment of autumn pastas.
They taste like the seven wonders of the Misen.
Oh!
The taste of the seven wonders?!
Yeah, but what is this seven wonders of Misen?
It is a legend that has been passed down from father to son.
The Misen is a mountain in the center of the island.
The seven wonders are: "the eternal fire",
which they say has not stopped burning
since the time of master Kobo-Daishi.
"The apricot tree of the tin staff."
The tree that took root again
when Kobo-Daishi there supported the tin staff.
"The rock of the tides", which has a hole through which salt water enters,
and there is more or less depending on the tide.
"The Mandala rock", where the writings of the master Kobo-Daishi are engraved.
"The sound of the wooden slats",
which is believed to be the clapping of a goblin who lives in the Misen.
"The dew of the cherry tree."
which causes a pink rain even when it is very sunny.
"The cedar of the dragon's fire."
A mysterious light that appears in the Miyajima sea and can be seen from a cedar tree.
and can be seen from a cedar tree at the top of the Misen.
The taste set of these pastes
represent the seven wonders that I have explained to you.
I recognize that they sell very well.
Ah!
This one tastes like apricot.
It is "the apricot of the tin staff".
It tastes like cherry.
"The dew of the cherry tree"!
This one stings like hell.
"The eternal fire"!
How interesting! Cut!
Very good!
Ha!
We have two stars, with the girl and the boy!
Wow, Conan!

I don't know if you know this, but you just made your debut as a child star.
"It's normal for me to do well, I've been doing this role for a long time."
Eh?
"Aren't these...?" (Woman) Oh, what memories!
You've been here before? Yes.
The fall of two years ago.
There we came to interview someone for another program.
Look who's here!
It's been a long time!
They told me you were coming, and I thought, "You know what?
You could pull out those pictures from a couple of years ago."
-Huh? -Ah!
But... this man here is what I've seen recently.
Huh?
Look, see?
Isn't he the man we saw before?
Is it?
Do you know my older brother? Eh?
What are you saying, Yayoi?!
He's your big brother?
And you say you haven't heard from us for two weeks, from your brother?
Yes.
In fact, in the autumn of two years ago,
my parents entered the forbidden area of the Misen,
slipped, fell... and they both died.
Eh? Eh?
My brother and I have always doubted that their death was accidental.
"My parents knew it very well, the Misen,
and it's very rare that they could fall off a cliff."
"My brother decided to inspect the area from top to bottom...
and discovered... something."
What something?
Something shiny, like a piece of a machine or an appliance,
something in the shape of a flower.
A couple of weeks ago, he said he'd figured out what it was,
and he left the house.
I haven't seen it since.
I have not been able to get in touch.
Mr. Mouri, please help me find my brother!
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry, but time is running out,
but time is running out and we have to continue shooting.
Yes, of course, I understand.
"What reason can you have, your brother,
for wanting to follow the Nichiuri network film crew?"
"Shut up!"
"The fall two years ago?"
"Isn't that when they came to Miyajima
Mr. Koshiji and the rest of the crew came to Miyajima?"
"Maybe their visit is related to the accident that happened."
(Woods: CLEC, CLEC)
(CLEC, CLEC)
(CLEC)
Mm?
Come on, how strange.
What?
What's the matter?
Well, Fumie is calling me,
but the ringtone is very strange.
I didn't have it on, this tone.
"It's the sound of wooden slats."
But why isn't she answering?
Ah, yes, good idea.
Yes, hello?
Is that you, Fumie?
You don't feel me?
Do you hear?
Listen?
Where has he gone, the Fumie?
"I haven't seen him for a while, he can't have gone far."
Ah!
Hey, Fumie!
Are you all right?
"Phew, lucky you. She doesn't look badly hurt."
But this is...
-Are you feeling better? -Yes, I am.
Don't worry, it's nothing serious.
What were you doing, in a place like that?
I don't know, it seemed to me...
I saw Yayoi's older brother and I wanted to follow him.
What? My brother?!
My brother?!
Yes, I followed him, but a stone fell on my head from a wall.
Putting salt in a coffee can is something,
but this joke is already over sized.
I think there is someone who copies the seven wonders.
What?
In Yatsukawa, the assistant manager,
has found salt in the coffee can.
At Hamada, the cameraman,
he received a call with the tone of wooden slats,
but he hadn't changed it.
And now the make-up artist, Fumie, has been injured with a stone from a wall.
They are 3 objects of the seven wonders.
The rock of the tides,
the sound of the wooden slats and the mandala rock, right?
-That's true! -I congratulate you.
Good deduction, little one.
Come on, I think you're being too clever.
It's only 3 of the 7 wonders, it's just a coincidence and nothing more.
I don't know.
Maybe it's more than 3.
The tie worn by the producer's assistant, Mr. Kitamura,
had some cherry blossoms on it, right?
-Oh, it's true! -Yes.
I don't know how he got the idea to wear it, it's old-fashioned.
It's another one of the seven wonders.
Cherry blossom dew.
So, it could be that...
-...that her stomachache......was also caused by someone?
When you say "someone", do you mean... do you mean Yayoi's older brother?
No, it can't be.
Yeah, but why is he attacking us?

Can't you think of a reason?
Maybe it would be better to ask Mr. Kitamura, right?
Yes, of course.
Mr. Kamisuwa.
He's not picking up.
He must be sleeping.
To be on the safe side, I'll ask the hotel staff to check.
(Kamisuwa.) "Ah, thank you. So he is sleeping."
Can you tell him to call me, when he wakes up, please?
Thank you, Miss, that's very kind of you.
"There are still 3 wonders left. Can something else happen?"
"And is that man, the Yayoi's brother,
who's behind all this?"
"Eh? Wait a minute."
"Yayoi's brother disappeared two weeks ago,
and the photo was also posted two weeks ago."
"Could it be... that her brother had seen the photo and...?"
-What do we do now, Mr. Kamisuwa? -What was the plan, for today?
Ah.
Well, we were to visit the area around Daishoin Temple.
Shooting should be the first priority.
We'll talk about it again tonight, if necessary.
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri, I hope you agree.
Of course.
-Well, let's get down to business! Yes, sir.
Cut!
All right, here we are, for today!
All right, guys.
We only have one sequence left and we're done.
"I don't trust these two at all. Better keep an eye on them."
And now, to rid ourselves of the impurities of life in the dark,
we will visit the Mayan Ordination Center.
Ran, Conan, come, please.
But, do we have to go down here by ourselves?
To tell you the truth, I don't like these things very much.
"What bothers me most, because of that, is that I won't be able to keep an eye on these."
Au, you can't be such a coward, to life.
Come down, come on.
Be brave, Ran!
Come on, come on.
Get down!
Conan, wait for me.
Don't leave me alone, please.
Stay with me.
Oh, lucky we're already out.
Thank you very much, that's all for today.
Come on, tomorrow will be another day.
Thank you, thank you.
At last.
Where are they, Mr. Kamisuwa and Mr. Koshiji?
- (Kamisuwa) Somebody come here! (Kamisuwa) -Huh?
What the... what's wrong?!
Mr. Kamisuwa!
Mr. Koshiji! What are you...?
Mr. Koshiji! He's still breathing.
Yatsukawa, call an ambulance!
Oc... Who the...
Eh? Mm?
What did he say?
"Fire. It was here"?
-But who was here? -Who attacked her?
What?
Mr. Koshiji, repeat this! You can't do it anymore.
You've lost consciousness.
What is it?
"What's this?"
"A cell phone strap with a tin staff!"
"The miniature replica of one of the seven wonders,
the apricot tree with the tin staff."
"2Potser has fallen to the one who attacked him."
-It was him! -Eh?
I saw the man we saw this afternoon.
He was running away from here when I arrived.
And why didn't you say so before, eh?
I'm sure he wants to escape with the ferry.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
"I hope I get there in time."
Hey! Excuse me, sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.
"Where is it, the ferry?"
No!
We're late. It's him!
Look at him!
It's that man!
Damn him!
We missed him by a little!
Hurry, come!
He's set fire to Yayoi's store!
What? What what?!
That's what he said in Koshiji: "Fire"!
(Bells: alert ringing)
Help!
Help!
Hurry, more water!
Bring more water!
Hurry up!
Yayoi! Are you all right, Yayoi?
Yes.
(People: talking at once)
(Mobile)
It's in Kitamura!
"Mr. Kamisuwa, I'm sorry about what happened."
Look, I don't have time now, because of you.
They've attacked in Koshiji and set fire to a store.
What?
They attacked in...?
But what's going on?!
(Think) "It's Mr. Kitamura, who was resting in the hotel!"
Mr. Kamisuwa!
You won't believe this, but shortly before the fire started,
there are people who say they saw a man
who looked like Yayoi's older brother.
What do you say what?!
("Tomorrow is the last time", Mai Kuraki)

Your brother?
He attacked in Koshiji and set fire to your house.
"Famous detective on gastronomic trip solves complicated case."
PETA ratings!
(Woman: call) It's the Yayoi!
Can't you see?
We could be attacked too.
"I will not allow you to continue attacking whoever you want!"
"The time has come to act."
