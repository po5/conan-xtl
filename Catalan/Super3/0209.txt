DETECTIVE CONAN
I tell the heart to be strong
and go to the essence of everything with intense rhythm.
Today we will go hiking on a mountain road.
It's a long episode full of fun.
He looks like a kid, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

(Ayumi) OSPA!
It's awesome!
Fixeu's to him, we've come so far up!
We still have a long way to go.
We've only done half of it.
(Genta) Oysters no!
But what do you say!
(Genta) What's the matter? Everything.
Look, Conan, with so many curves, my head has started to spin.
Come on..., you're a brevas.
Ha-ha-ha!
No, man, think there's a reason they call this Tsuzura Ori pass.
It's got 99 curves, big and small, but all tight...
Poor me.
Just hearing it, I feel like throwing up.
Come to think of it: where is it, in Mitsuhiko?
Well, I imagine reading a book in the car.
What?
Mitsuhiko!
Come out, it's better out here!
No, I'm fine now.
Now I'll read the most interesting part!
Ah!
By the way, doctor.
Ay hasn't come either, this time, has he?
He didn't?
No, he didn't.
Days ago he already told me he had to do something.
Mmm?
Wait, doctor, I think I already know.
That happened!
(Imitates Ai) "I don't like camping."
"It doesn't make me either hot or cold."
Bravo, Genta, you're doing great!
You nailed it!
(Thinks) "You got it right."
(Wheels: squeaking)
What is this...?
- (Genta) It's gone over the edge! - (Mitsuhiko) It's awful!
Doctor, call an ambulance and call the police!
THE BIG FALL FROM MOUNT Ryuji
(Man) He says they were at the lookout point above,
and you saw the car fall down the ravine and you saw the currents?
(Agasa) Yes, sir.
(He thinks) "This lump.... What if it was...?"
(Ambulance: siren)
I would like to ask you again.
Have you seen anything suspicious?
A car or a person?
-No, we haven't seen anything, agent. -Okay, thanks.
(Thinking) "Sure..."
Sorry to bother you...
Mm?
What did you have to tell me, kiddo?
That I can go to the accident site and see what they're doing?
They can't see these things, the creatures.
They'll be finished by now anyway.
There's no problem.
But...
Understood.
But try not to get in the way while they do their job.
Yes, sir!
Hey, Mitsuhiko, what do you say we go, too?
Eh?!
As usual, Conan's going again without us!
So what?
Let him do what he wants, man.
We have something much better to do, Genta!
Something better?
All right, I'm in!
I'm in!
All right!
16 meters and 33 centimeters.
16 meters 33 centimeters.
Look at this!
Here's a piece of paint!
Yes, it must have peeled off!
-You're right, it's dark blue! -Dark blue!
That means...!
(thinks) "Yes. So... that's what happened."
We've come all this way to have a picnic
and we're involved in a traffic accident.
It's not an accident.
What?
That it's not an accident?
Do you remember that one of the things they asked us
is if we had seen another car?
Of course we did.
Look, that car has fallen...
because it has been pushed from behind by another car.
What the hell?!
That car had a bulge behind, indicating that she has been pushed.
In addition, they found paint on the ground that had come off from the other car.
And it seems that the car that pushed it was deliberately pushed.
This means that it was a murder!
Yes...
And you think we'll have to cooperate with the police?
With the pile of evidence they've found, it'll be all right, don't worry.
But all they've got is a bit of paint and a lump...

Look, the Japanese police are very efficient, don't hesitate.
With a piece of paint they will already determine, by doing analysis,
the model and color of the other car.
After that, all they have to do is ask around to find out more details.
Now I really understand.
What did you mean... with something better?!
(Flowing) XXT!
Shut up and don't chatter so much!
That Conan will feel you!
Look, that's it, Genta!
What is it?
-It's a secret code. A secret code?
Xxxt!
I've caught it near the place where the accident has occurred.
Oh, my!
Are you sure you shouldn't tell the police?
We've only seen one accident, right?
Hard to believe this code has anything to do with it.
It's true,
secret codes are used to find out where there are hidden treasures.
-Yes, exactly!
-A treasure trove?
Yes, look what it says here.
At the top, squared, there is the operation 100 minus 1.
Very good, Genta.
What is it, 100 minus 1?
What is it, 100 minus 1?
Well, no-no-no... 99?
-Exactly, very good (sigh of relief).
What's the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of the number 99?
Eh?
99... 99... 9, 9...
Ah!
The ambulance!
No!
Oops!
What's an ambulance got to do with it, you donkey?
-First aid, help... (Ayumi) I got it!
The Tsuzura Ori Pass, right?
The doctor explained to us that there are 99 sharp turns in a row.
Yes, Ayumi, right!
This means that this code points somewhere
in the Tsuzura Ori Pass area.
Mitsuhiko, can you think of where it is, this place?
No, I can't tell you, but this code looks very familiar.
Mitsuhiko, where have you seen it before?
Mmm...
Hey, guys!
What's she up to here, you guys?
-No, it's nothing, man! -We were talking about secret codes... Ah!
Secret codes?
Well, it's about...
some secret codes that come out in the novel I read.
Some codes that are too easy for you, so... (thinks) "Right.
(thinks) "Yeah. Stuff for kids..."
Aaaah...
Gee, that was a close call.
The doctor and I are going fishing.
You guys are going to get firewood.
(At the same time) Yes!
So far.
(They laugh derisively)
-Let's go! -Let's go!
Mitsuhiko, did you really find out?
I sure did.
Yes, it's the book I read!
Is it really?
It's this!
-Oysters!
What is this? -A computer keyboard?
Yes.
The numbers are written in numerical order from the left side
and correspond to the hiragana letters on the keyboard.
14 is the character "ta";
27, "to";
and the others follow the same system.
-Yes, understood! -Let's give it a try!
Genta, please read the numerical codes, come on!
All right, let's try!
04, 23, 38.
(Mitsuhiko) 04 means "U", 23 means "se",
38 means "tsu".
(Mitsuhiko) -Turn right! (Mitsuhiko) -Turn right!
But, listen... What does it mean, this mark?
Mm...
Such is the shape of the road, guys.
You're right!
You must be right!
So you decipher the first code.
Turn right at the junction.
You look fantastic!
Ha-ha-ha!
Let's continue!
(Ayumi) Yes, I'll write it down!
Looks like they don't want to bite.
(Ayumi) Done!
We've got it!
Please read it, Ayumi.
In the meantime, I'll follow the map.
"Turn right at the intersection
"After crossing the Tsuzura Ori Pass."
"Turn right at the fork and left at the next fork."
"Cross two bridges, and turn left after the second bridge!"
I got it, it's here!
This house here.
It's close enough!
(Ayumi) You're right!
Let's go check it out!
Maybe we'll find the treasure!
This'll give Conan a real morale boost.
(They laugh)
(Ayumi) Here we are!
(laughing) Hi, guys!
Are you up there?
We caught a peixarro!
Hey, kids!
(Think) "Eh? What's this?"
"Mmm?"
Bad news.
I can't find the kids anywhere.
They've disappeared!
What?!
Hey, Mitsuhiko... (snorts) We haven't arrived yet?
No.
We're a little way off, so hang in there.
-Aaaaiii... -Now we cross the second bridge.

We will have arrived when we have turned right at the next fork.
Aiiiiiii!
Still so far to go?
If we find the treasure, you will have a giant bowl of eels with rice!
Eels with rice...
If we find it, I'll eat as many rice eels as I can!
Come on, Mitsuhiko!
For the 100,000 bowls of eels!
All right, that's the spirit!
It can't be!
It can't be that!
What, have you figured out what's going on?
Doctor, call the police! What are you saying?!
They've gone to the hideout of the killer who pushed the mountain car!
What do you say, now!
(Think) "Just, this is the code they were talking about in the car."
"What a fool I am!"
Ayyy...
Friends, we finally made it!
Genta, here we are!
This is it!
Hey, Mitsuhiko, are you sure this is the place we're looking for?
It doesn't seem to have anything to do with treasure, does it?
What a thing to say!
We've followed what the code says point by point!
Besides, this is the kind of place where treasures are hidden!
-Great.
There's a shortage of people inside!
Yes, thanks for everything, officers!
All right, boy, the police will report to the place immediately.
Well, let's go, too! (Mitsuhiko) All right!
(Mitsuhiko) There doesn't seem to be anyone.
Hey, Mitsuhiko, where do you think it is, the treasure?
Mm...
Eh?
In the building in the back, I think!
-(Mitsuhiko) Huh? -Eh?
Look, fixeu's right: that building is the only one that is closed and fenced.
Surely it's there!
-Come on!
Let's go see it! -Hm.
-A... this is...! - Ooooh!
(Genta) OSPA!
Look at all these foreign brand cars!
You know what I tell you, Mitsuhiko?
I don't think there's any hidden treasure here.
Gee, that's strange...
(Ayumi) Hey, guys.
Something's wrong.
(Ayumi) Look!
These cars don't have license plates.
That's right.
Look, Mitsuhiko!
This car doesn't have one either!
You know, I think all these cars might be stolen.
You're sure?
They must be planning to sell them in some foreign country.
We've just stumbled into the hideout of some car thieves!
You are absolutely right!
You're the brats that were at the accident site, aren't you?
Bah!
Where are they, the man with the mustache and the other boy?
I don't know who you're talking about.
-That's enough! - (gunshot)
What's that noise?
What's that noise? It's a shot!
What are you saying?!
Eagerness, Doctor!
Accelerate!
Come on, then!
(Somiquen)
I'll ask you again.
Where are they, the man with the mustache and the other boy?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, really.
What?!
-Hey, Mitsuhiko... -Mitsuhiko, please...
No, I can't let them get involved in this because of me.
-Yes, he's right.
-So right.
Oh, geez.
You must have a death wish.
(cell phone ringing)
Yeah, it's me.
(Cell phone rings) Excuse me.
No, I only have 5, for now.
In Sada has panicked and wanted to run away with a.
Yes, I've already taken care of it, a while ago.
I hit him from behind when we got to a ravine.
I'm not useless.
I'll get rid of the car before the police find it.
When he destroys it, there will no longer be any evidence.
(Car: approaching)
-Ooh. -Oh!
What is this?
Hey, what's wrong with you?!
What's the matter with you!
What are you doing, pointing a rifle at some kids, big guy?!
(at once) It's the doctor!
Mm!
What timing!
Ha-ha!
You've saved me the trouble of looking for you!
It's no use, sir.
Mm?
Hey, isn't that what this is?
It's the police sirens!
The police? From the sound it looks like they're coming this way.
Surely they're coming to arrest you! To arrest me?!
(at once) Very well!
(Thief) Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
What do you mean, such a fuss, gentlemen policemen?
Give us this rifle before you say another word, come on!
This rifle, you say?
Nothing, nonsense, I was just trying to scare these children,
because they have entered my property.
Oh, really?
By the way, this car here, is it yours?
Yes, it is.
Is there a problem?
The problem is that today...
a car went off a cliff at Tsuzura Ori Pass,

and it looks like a car like this has hit it from behind.
The car has a bump in front of it.
Has it been in an accident?
Let's see, let's see... You're telling me I'm a suspect?
There's a pile of cars like this, didn't you know?
And of this pile of cars,
how many would you say were at the scene?
Can you tell me where you were, at that time?
Yes, you're right, sorry.
It was an accident...
The scenery was so beautiful that I took my eyes off the road...
and I felt once.
Officer, that's a lie!
Shut up, don't interfere, kid!
I won't shut up!
He said on the phone that he hit the car and knocked her off the road!
-I heard it too!
-I heard it too!
Do you think he believes the nonsense these brats say?
How do you think you could push a car down a ravine
just by slapping it on the back?
Yes, sir!
You've done exactly this and you've succeeded!
Shut up old man!
Stop talking nonsense!
You've got proof, eh?
As much as you want.
They are on the roadway of the curve where the car has fallen.
(Agasa's voice) There are marked two pairs of ruts
that were left there when you pushed the car.
You've hit it twice.
So what?
I wasn't looking at the road and I hit it twice!
Well, this is quite a remote possibility, in any case...
Do you know how much distance there is, exactly,
between the ruts of the car that has fallen down the ravine?
Yes, 16 meters 33 centimeters.
Exactly, 16 meters 33 centimeters,
and how fast were you going down that road?
I was only going 30 kilometers per hour.
Well, let's assume that's true.
The fact that you were going 20 miles an hour would mean...
you'd be going 5.5 feet per second.
To leave ruts with a distance of 16 meters 33 centimeters,
it would take you about 2 seconds.
After pushing the car in question for 2 seconds,
you have not swerved at all to avoid another collision,
nor did you step on the brakes.
If this is not deliberately attacking, I don't know how you can tell!
If you have nothing else to say,
we'll feel the rest of the statement at the police station.
(Mitsuhiko) Shit...
- (Mitsuhiko) Inspector, sisplau.-Yes?
There are several luxury cars without license plates
in the building in the back.
I'm sure they're stolen cars.
I congratulate you.
You've done a good job, children!
But listen to me, don't ever do anything so dangerous again!
(At the same time) Y-yes, sir...
This is the world of simplicity
and aesthetic serenity!
(Thinking) "What's wrong with him? Why is he going around looking sideways?"
Let's see.
You say that the master is afraid of a spirit?
Do you really believe that there is a spirit?
(Kogoro) Don't talk nonsense, woman!
It's impossible for such a thing to exist!
And the next Conan:
"The Mansion of the Legend of the 5-colored pond, (Part 1)"
