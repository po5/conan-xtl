"On Conan, trapped in the darkness (Part Two)."
Tell us what's wrong, Conan?
Conan, can you hear me?
(Transmitter) "A car..., the coffin is inside a car."
"A hearse."
Yes.
(All) A hearse?!
"I heard the smell of incense, and the cold air of dry ice."
"I'm quite sure."
I'm inside a coffin, in a double bottom.
Therefore, this means... that on me is the body of someone.
-We have to go and look for it right away!
- (all three) What?!
If it's a hearse, it won't take us long to find it.
-I'm not sure.
Yes, it's true.
Nowadays most of the hearses are normal cars.
There are not many of them left, like the ones from the old days.
So it won't be easy to find.
We'd better call the police right away.
"Wait, Ay!"
The police will need more information.
It's likely that the place where he was before was a funeral home.
(Ai) "Got it. I'll look into it."
I wouldn't be surprised.
It's better that we split them up, to call him.
If we find one where they've had a ceremony recently...
Yeah, then we'll know that Conan is the hearse...
that will have left the funeral home.
If so, it will mean that they're taking Conan... they're taking him to...
-Towards the crematorium?
-Yes, they're taking him to the crematorium. -Yes, they're taking him to the crematorium.
What?!
You mean they're taking Conan to the crematorium?
That's why we have to hurry to find him.
-This one either.
-No luck.
This isn't it.
(All three) Eh?
(Ayumi) Guys!
(Ayumi) Hi, Ran!
Excuse me, could you wait a moment, please?
I won't be long.
I was really worried, guys.
Where's Conan?
And where is he?
We know where he is, we found him.
So far all we know is that he's in a hearse.
A hearse?
Oh... (All) Eh?
(All) Eh?
Well, if it isn't...
A will?
(Mitsuhiko) What?
You've hired at Kogoro?
Are you sure it was the Asada Law Firm?
Yes.
Early this morning the father came here for a case.
(Mitsuhiko) Maybe it has to do with the robbery he said at Conan?
What's at stake?
I'm sure it does.
The father called me a little while ago and told me
that he had to go to a funeral with the lawyer from the Asada law firm.
He asked me to bring him the burial suit.
(All three) Eh?
What do you say, a burial?
Yes... He did tell me that name.
And he told you if he was here?
But what are you doing?
Where are you going, in such a hurry?
-We have to leave right away.
-Run, get in, Ran, hurry! -Hurry!
Oh...
Go, get in, run!
What's that?
What are you saying now?

How can Conan be inside the coffin?
And, moreover, you say that inside is also the will?
Are you sure, what you say, guys?
Yes, because that's what Conan told us.
He said it was inside a small box made of paulownia wood.
They are right, it is the box of the will.
-Live.
-We got it.
It was finished a while ago.
Father, when is the burial?
The hearse and the family have already left for the crematorium.
(The three of us) We're late!
What, they've already left?
-I don't believe it!
-It can't be!
I beg your pardon!
The culprit must want
to cremate the will along with the body of the deceased.
If the will doesn't turn up in the end,
the siblings will divide their father's fortune
equally among the three of them.
How can you think of that now, father!
We must find out who the culprit is.
Don't you see that they are about to cremate Conan?!
Yes, you're right.
(Alas) Mr. Karahashi's coffin is the only one that has left here, today.
I asked them to call the crematorium to inquire.
They told them to expect the car any minute now,
but they haven't arrived yet.
They haven't arrived yet.
If they haven't arrived yet...
Where am I, you say?
Listen to me, Conan, where are you now?
I'd like to know, now.
"Again?"
Eh?
We've stopped again.
Yeah, we've been stopping and moving forward bit by bit all the time,
at intervals of a minute or so.
Now I'm thinking that maybe they're taking so long to get to the crematorium
because they stop at places where there are people who knew the deceased.
"The president was a very well-liked man,
both in the small workshops and in the big companies."
Places where people knew him?
You mean like branches and partner companies of Karahashi Group?
Check right away.
-Yes.
I'll go straight to the crematorium.
If you stop as you say, maybe we'll get there before they do.
Hello, inspector.
We have an emergency.
-Please, we're on time! -We're coming, Conan!
-We're coming, Conan!
Can't you go a little faster, please?
We're here.
We've arrived before them.
Father..., don't you find it strange?
(Mobile)
- (mobile)
-Mm?
-Hello, Mr. Mouri.
It's me, the Asada.
-It's me, Mr. Mouri, tell me.
The funeral procession has made a stop at one of our branches.
But since it's the weekend and there's a lot of traffic,
they have decided not to make any visit.
They will go straight to the crematorium without making any more stops.
-Aaa...
-And when will they arrive?
They should be there by now.
Or if not, they should be just about to arrive.
-Mm?
- (Ai) Look what it says, here.
In the annex building?
- (all) Eh?!
-It must be the building next door!
Wait!
Wait a, wait a minute!
(Conan!
Conan!
What do you mean?
They want us to override the cremation?
Why should we override?
I don't get it.
This detective doesn't have a clue about anything.
Conan is inside the coffin!
Inside the coffin is a child, you have to stop the cremation!
Mm?
From the look on everyone's faces, they seem to know what we're talking about.
-How do you want there to be a child?
-Of course not!
And now, how barbaric!
It can't be.
So it won't do them anything that we open the coffin to inspect it.
We were waiting for you, inspector.
Come in.
I'm Inspector Megure,
of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police.
We could be talking about a kidnapping case.
(Both) Yes, sir!
Takagi, Chiba!
Even if you're from the police, you can't do that.
Do you object for any particular reason?
No, no, not at all.
It's under, in Conan, the double bottom.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Excuse me.
Mm.
- (all) Huh?
-Here it isn't!
Actually, this coffin doesn't have a double bottom.
We checked.
There's nothing here.
And now what?
What does it say?
How can it be?
I just don't understand, inspector.
Can you explain what's going on, Kogoro?
Let's see, can you explain to us what's going on?
Why are you asking us for explanations?
You should rather give us your explanations.
Who will be responsible for what happened?
Eh ?!

We'll-we'll talk about it later.
Hey ?!
Conan, can you hear me?
Tell me where you are, Conan!
- (transmitter: interference)
-Conan, can you hear me?
-What happened to him?
Where is he?
-How come he doesn't answer you?
Poor Conan...
Can you hear me?
Oh, can you feel me?
Wow, you!
Where are we going?
Wherever you take me, now?!
What a ratchet!
The engine can't take it anymore.
I've lost a lot of time, with so many stops.
(Shinichi's voice) This noise... I think it might be..."
Now I understand!
(Conan voice) Oh, can you hear me?
Can you feel me?
(Kogoro) What?
What do you say now?
That there's another hearse?
Yes, Conan says there must have been another hearse.
It seems to him that it must have been parked in some subway parking lot.
(All three) Mm!
What are they doing now?
Where are they?
Have they gone?
Takagi!
Inspector.
Yes, sir!
Good afternoon, sir.
Shall I speak to the undertaker?
Just a moment.
Don't think you can leave in such a hurry.
Yes.
Chiba.
I'm sorry, you can't leave until we clear up exactly what happened.
Inspector, confirmed by the funeral home:
there was another hearse.
There was, sir.
Oh, was there?
Another hearse?
It's a very old hearse that they haven't used for a long time now
and they've taken it to be scrapped today.
They've had it parked in the basement until today.
And where is it now?
What have they done?
Yes, I knew it!
They don't know.
The person who has taken care of it is now gone.
(Mobile)
It can't be, they must know!
(Mobile)
Ah...
Hello, Ay, why has he left?
Where are you calling me from, now?
What? What?
Follow the hearse in that Conan?
What?!
What do you say?
Now I understand.
This car was to be taken to scrap.
We just turned right.
(Wheels squeal: iii)
And now to the left.
(Wheels squealing: iii)
Now straight ahead.
(Wheels squeaking: iii)
Again to the left.
(Wheels squeaking: iii)
Turn right and turn left.
Then straight ahead and another left turn.
-We can't miss it!
-You've felt it, haven't you?
So, the incense, the dry ice,
the cardboard boxes and the wooden box...
All the other things inside are also to be thrown away.
It's debris left behind by the car.
You're not inside a coffin, as you thought.
"And the car wasn't going that slow because of the deceased's acquaintances."
It's a very old car and it's not running well.
It was all a coincidence.
It seems to me... I'm finally starting to understand this case a little bit.
I'm finally starting to see things clearly.
"There was more than one culprit, opening the box, this morning."
So, it wasn't one and enough?
Was that why...
"Eh? But they all have alibis!"
Because I guess...
They've found each other at the crime scene.
And meanwhile...
(Shinichi, thinks) "He wants to open the safe."
(Shinichi, thinks) "Oh!"
(Knock: knob)
Yes, it sure went like this.
We've stopped.
(Wheels squeak: iii)
A traffic light is felt.
(Pip discontinuous)
(Pip discontinued)
After leaving the funeral home, they've gone through a tunnel.
Then right, left, left.
And now they've come to a crosswalk with a traffic light.
"We're moving."
Phew, there are so many of them.
(Flashing acoustic signal)
We are in a level crossing.
(Ai) "A level crossing?"
A level crossing... I've already found it!
- (all) That's good!
-I know where it is, I've already found it!
That's it, I've cut it.
Now I can detach myself completely.
We have stopped again.
(Motor: stops)
But now the engine has stopped completely.
This means that we have arrived.
They're heading for the Kuriniji junkyard!
(Police: siren)
Hurry up!
(Police: siren) Eh?
(Knock: knob)
(Knock: knob)
(Vehicle: metallic clang) That's it.
(Vehicle: metallic clatter)
Aaaah...!
-(Ayumi) Where are you?!
- (Ayumi) Conan!
(Ayumi) -Huh?
-Look up there!
(Police: siren)
No, it can't be!
Conan, no!
(police siren) Eh?
No!
Conan!
Stop the machine!
Stop the press!
Stop-AAA!
-Stop the press!
-Stop the press.
No..., no..., no...!

Oh, we are too late!
It can't be!
It can't be...
No, it can't be... Conan!
No..., no!
Conan!
Conan, if you get out from under here I'll buy you... ten bowls of rice!
(All three) Eh?
I couldn't eat that much even as a joke.
Genta...
- (both) Conan, you're all right!
-You're out, Conan!
-Mm?
(both) Huh?
-(both) Huh?
Yes!
Oh... I've been doing well.
I have to do it now, come on!
Oh...!
He-he-he-he-he!
Aaah...!
Where is it, the will, where is it?
It can't be that it has been crushed and smashed with the car!
Where has it gone, in Conan?
I don't see it.
Oh!
Where, where is the will?
Where is it? Where is it?
Ah...!
Ah..., ah..., oh!
Is there any news?
Have they found the will?
-Eh?
-Did they find it or what?
En-Kogoro Sleeper!
(Hello!
(Kogoro voice) Now, Conan!
Thank you, Conan.
The box.
- (all) Eh?!
-It's the last will and testament.
This will includes the changes
the president wanted to make before he died.
(Kogoro's voice) Well, well...
-What?!
-What a disappointment, isn't it, Eisuke?
Chewing gum, you say?
You've stepped on chewing gum, haven't you?
You can smell it.
And the phone is really sticky, from when he stepped on it.
What? I don't know what you're talking about...
I don't know what he's talking about...
(Kogoro voice) And the big brother and sister,
in Kozo and the Mitsuyo, they were also.
They wanted us to believe that they are three siblings very bad together
and that they can't stand each other,
because we assumed that they would not want to confirm each other's alibis.
But it's a very old trick and it didn't work out well for them.
-Exactly, he can't prove anything.
-What are you saying?
You don't have any proof!
What are you saying? You don't have any proof!
Inspector Megure...
Can you check for prints, the will, please?
If I'm not mistaken and my deduction is correct,
in addition to the prints of the deceased, Mr. Asada and Conan,
you will also find the fingerprints of the three suspects.
Is this true?
(Both) Hey?!
How they planned to get rid of the will,
they all touched it without thinking it was necessary to wear gloves.
"They were in a hurry to check its contents
as soon as possible."
I'm not mistaken, am I?
Surely the three of them conspired
to get your father's fortune
to be divided equally among you
or to rewrite it in his favor.
They have hidden the will in a hearse that was not in use
and you have also left it locked up in Conan,
thinking they would let him go later.
But they didn't know that just today
they were to send the car to be scrapped.
Aaah... Oh, this is all the father's fault!
It seems unbelievable, I don't know how he could have been called.
He left everything to his secretary.
-It can not be forgiven, something like that!
-Leaving everything to his mistress!
How could they?
How could you dare to endanger the life of a child, of Conan?!
What you have done, you can't be forgiven!

When I think... It must have been very hard, Conan.
Being locked in the dark in such a small space!
Maybe now you'll be afraid to go to the bathroom at night.
Eh?
If you want, I can go with you.
Mm?
No... no need, Ran.
Don't worry, no.
It's not necessary, really.
Come on, don't be embarrassed, man!

I don't care!
"That I'm already going to high school, me."
You're asking me to look for an alien?
Yes.
I'm saying it because I saw it with my eyes.

A UFO?
An unidentified flying object.
Get out of here!
You can't stay!
Oh!
Mr. Mouri...
But, let's see, what did the man who was next to the victim say?
According to him, an alien came out of a UFO,
killed Mr. Nakatsu, returned to the UFO and left.
