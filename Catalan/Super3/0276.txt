The water that flows has no form.
The wind that blows is not seen.
Cases, deductions, mean freedom.
The truth always comes out in the end.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is detective Conan!
I can not stop my love for you!

Eh!
Ei.
Listen!
What are you saying?
Inspector Takagi?
Where is he?
In that park over there.
That's right.
He's looking for something like a desperate man.
(Think) "Any proof? No... I'd wear gloves."
Mm!
I know what he's looking for, me, Inspector Takagi.
(At the same time) eeeeh?
It must be this way... It must be this way...
Mm?
(At the same time) Eh?
Where did you come from?
We've come to help you, Inspector.
Well, we should back you up, shouldn't we?
We already know that.
You've lost something like that, haven't you?
How... how do you know, this?!
(laughs)
We're the Junior Detective League for a reason.
If you don't find it, too bad, huh?
Yeah, right.
For a detective, it's almost as important as life.
-Huh? -Huh?
-So, what you've lost is... -Not the wallet, then?
Aaah!
You've lost the badge, maybe?
Xxxt.
(Flow) Don't shout, Ayumi.
(Think) "Aaah, aaah, what a mess."
THE CASE OF THE MISSING PLATE
I didn't realize until the morning, that I didn't have it.
I looked for it around the apartment, but nothing.
Yesterday, while I was on duty, I'm sure I had it, right?
I sure did.
On my way home I passed in front of this park, and...
(Man) You bastard!
Surely you're cheating on me!
(Man) Flights stop?
What are you doing?
You're a swindler!
I'll kill you right here!
I'm drowning!
(Man) Stop it!
Hey, you.
Wait a minute!
Stop fighting!
Leave us alone!
Police.
Stop fighting!
I must have lost her right then and there.
(That's why you're looking for her here.
Didn't one of those fighting find her?
(Ayumi) Oh.
(Ayumi) You're right.
It's very likely, it's very likely.
Don't you know anything, of those who were fighting?
The name?
The address...?
Mmm.
(Man) One moment.
Listen to me.
Why don't you trust me, Hanzaki?
Hanzaki... Exactly: the young man's name was Hanzaki!
And you don't remember any more details? Mmm.
How can I trust you?
Since you've been my manager, I only get jobs that nobody wants.
It's a bad time right now, because of the traditional songs.
Have a little patience, eh?
How many years have you been telling me that, eh?!
Of course you cheated me!
You can give me back all the money I left you!
-You swindler! -Wait a minute!
A singer of traditional songs that is not successful.
Do you remember what kind of shoes they were wearing?
Mm?
Well, now that you mention it...
"In Hanzaki I wore sandals."
Of course!
You deduce that you must live near here, right?
Aah.
Yes, let's go!
We'll help you look for it!
And if he didn't find it, the plate, what?
We'll split up into 2 groups: one group to go look in Hanzaki...
and the other to stay around looking for the plaque.
-Very well.
Let's go!
- (at the same time) Rock, paper, scissors.
(at the same time) Sorry.
So far, guys.
It's not coming out here, guys.
What if we ask the record companies?
No.
If we have to ask even the small ones, we'll never finish.
Shall we try asking around the neighborhood?
Hey, do you know a man named Hanzaki, who is a singer?
He is a singer who lives in the neighborhood.
About that... Excuse me, excuse me.
(Ouch) Wow, the police badge!
Yes.
If you don't find it, what will happen to poor Inspector Takagi?
It seems to me that he's... very hard up.
Shrike!
How could you have lost the badge?!
It's the soul of a policeman!
You're going to the carreeeeer!
Oh, poor Inspector Takagi...

(Genta) Hey, you!
Do you want to stop eating and help a little?
Ah, excuse me.
Ah, mi'-te!
What, how did it go?
Did you find her?
No.
With just the name and description it's almost impossible.
(Ayumi) We haven't found anything either.
(Man) Hey!
Inspector!
What are you doing here?
You're from the neighborhood?
Aaah!
(Man) Ah!
Aaah!
It's you!
You're the one from yesterday.
Aaah... I know very badly, what happened.
So this is the famous singer?
(At the same time) At Hanzaki?
(thinks) "He-he-he. It could have happened before."
Mr. Hanzaki, yesterday shouldn't you find a thing of mine?
So, like square...?
No, I didn't... And I'd say my manager didn't find anything either.
Ah, gee, wow.
You lost something like that, didn't you?
If you want, I'll help you look for it.
Uh... Don't suffer.
There's no need to bother, really.
I just want to thank you for what you did:
thanks to you, inspector,
we made peace right away, with my manager.
Today we had arranged to meet for lunch.
I waited for her at home, but she didn't come.
It's just that she likes to drink, you know?
I'm sure she spent the night sucking and now she's sleeping it off.
She's a case like a basket.
(Laughs)
-Aaah? -Aaah?
I've called him several times,
but he won't pick up the phone.
That means he's sleeping it off.
(laughs)
If he didn't come to the appointment, why don't you pick him up at his house?
It's more than an hour and a half by car to his house.
It's too far, man.
(Laughs)
Excuse me..., you have soiled your pants.
Eh?
Ah.
It's shampoo.
It's just that I cleaned the bathroom and I stepped on it by accident.
The bottle of shampoo, I mean.
By the way, Inspector: what time do you have, please?
It's one o'clock.
One o'clock.
Is it?
It's already one o'clock?
It's already one o'clock?!
-We have to find him soon! -Don't suffer.
You don't need to help us.
But... Ah!
At least let me buy you lunch at that restaurant.
For 2,000 yen you have two hours to eat as much as you want.
I appreciate it, but I can't accept it.
Oh, you can't?
Suit yourself, as you wish, sir.
Come on, let's go!
I'll make the most of the 2 hours!
See you again, inspector.
-That's strange... -Strange is a little strange.
If neither of us found her, even if it's around here.
This Hanzaki is up to something, I'm sure.
Yes.
He had no need to ask the time the way he did.
If he lives nearby, he should know that this clock exists, you know?
It's very strange.
(Thinking) "Yet he asked the time at Takagi."
"Why did he do that?" (Mitsuhiko) I already got it.
(Mitsuhiko) What?
That you found it?
Ah, no..., it's not exactly the badge, no.
(Mitsuhiko) -Wow.
-Why are you shouting so much?
Come on, guys, come with me for a moment.
What?
That Hanzaki has murdered his manager?
You mean, Mitsuhiko?
I'm absolutely sure.
And not long ago.
In fact, she blames her manager for her lack of success as a singer.
She has a reason to hate him;
but to the point of killing him?
Isn't it true he had shampoo on the bottom of his pants?
Yes.
It got on them while he was cleaning the bathroom.
-This lie has made me suspicious. -Lie?
When you clean the bathroom,
the most normal thing to do is to roll up your sleeves so you don't get them dirty.
If he had rolled up his sleeves, he would not have soiled the shampoo.
So, what he was doing was not cleaning the bathroom,
but... he was in the bathroom to do something else.
(At the same time) Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wait a minute, wait a minute, Mitsuhiko.
And what else?
What else?
This morning, Hanzaki invited her manager to her house...
telling her that he wanted to make amends.
(Man: laugh)
Stop it, stop it... I can't drink so much... Stop it.
(Mitsuhiko) "He's made to drink as much as he wants,
"until he was well toasted;
"And just before one o'clock, he took her to the bathroom and drowned her."
"At this time he soiled himself with shampoo."
"Then he left the house in a hurry
"And came to the park to have an alibi."
To have an alibi?
That's right.
"Tonight he plans to take the manager's body out of the bathroom,
"take it home...
"and put it in the other bathtub."
"This way it will look like an accidental death."

"Even if someone suspects murder,
"The time of death..."
will be set at one o'clock noon today.
-Exactly.
By the way, Inspector: what time do you have, please?
It's one o'clock.
One o'clock.
If anyone suggests that the manager has been murdered,
Hanzaki will be able to say that at the time of death he was here,
which is also an hour and a half's drive from the victim's home.
As in Takagi he will be able to confirm the alibi, no one will suspect him.
And we already have a perfect murder.
That's impeccable reasoning, Mitsuhiko!
(Think) "Tell me about it, flawless."
Poor Inspector Takagi...
He loses his police badge
and they use him for an alibi for a murder.
Mitsuhiko, you said that when you clean the toilet,
the most normal thing to do is to roll up your pant legs, right?
It's the most normal thing in the world.
Kogoro sometimes gets lazy and doesn't roll up his sleeves.
-Don't... don't smoke.
-And neither does Dr. Agasa.
Eh?
So, he may have made a mess cleaning the bathroom.
Besides, Inspector Takagi came just to look for the badge.
I don't think that Hanzaki would have risked
to have an alibi by relying on a fluke.
-Other... -It's not so impeccable anymore.
He-he-he-he-he.
He's a scoundrel! Ah, Ayumi.
- (Genta) Stop it, Ayumi.
-This guy is a scoundrel!
He wants to take advantage of someone as good as Inspector Takagi!
-So, my reasoning wasn't as good as I thought.
What's he doing now?
Look at him.
Ostres!
Look at this.
That's strange.
Hanzaki doesn't prove anything.
It's true.
"What's it like? This guy is up to something... Of course."
-He doesn't touch anything, does he? -It's a good pity.
He's just keeping an eye on the time.
It's true... He keeps looking at his watch.
If he wasn't hungry, why did he come into a restaurant like this?
-That doesn't add up.
-You're absolutely right.
"What's it like...?"
"Oysters!"
(Hanzaki) You lost something like that, didn't you?
If you want, I'll help you look for it.
At least let me buy you lunch at that restaurant.
"Of course I wanted to be with in Takagi forcibly for a while!"
You know what, Mitsuhiko?
Your reasoning was only half wrong.
Half wrong?
You were right that Hanzaki wanted to kill his manager.
And he went into this restaurant
to be seen so he'd have an alibi.
To have an alibi?
If Inspector Takagi hadn't refused to help him,
he would have tried to set up an alibi while he was with him in the park.
But we agreed that Takagi was at the park by chance.
No.
I'm sure he knew he'd come back to look for the badge.
Because he probably found it himself.
So, would you say he still has it, Conan?
I don't think so, Ayumi, he must have thrown it away somewhere.
You're right: he doesn't have to carry something so dangerous on him.
Wow.
Mitsuhiko's reasoning fails at the time of the manager's death:
it's not one o'clock, but around 2 or three-thirty 3.
But now it's five-thirty from 2.
That's right.
We have discovered the plan...
while it's just... being executed in the bathroom of his apartment.
That's why he's keeping such an eye on the clock.
Listen, guys!
We still have time to save the manager's life!
-Let's go! -But where is it, this guy's apartment? -It's true.
It's true.
Even if we ask him, he won't tell us.
Let's look for him separately.
Let's go!
(All) Let's go!
Mm?
The Junior Detective League also stands me up...
Aaah, that singer who's so unsuccessful?
Just yesterday I saw him picking up one of these bricks... (laughs)
We don't care about that.
What we want to know is where I live, madam.
Well, I don't know, sorry, guys.
In Hanzaki.
In Hanzaki.
The singer.
He must live near here, man!
No idea.
I don't like traditional music, kid.
-Come on, adéu. Hey, hey, wait a minute!
-Shall we go that way?
-Yes.
(Acoustic signal: beep-beep)
(Mitsuhiko) "Ah, you feel me? I already got the address from Hanzaki."
-Uaah!
Really?
-Hurray!
District number 3, Backside Heights building, second floor.
Copy that!
We'll be right back, Mitsuhiko.
We should notify Inspector Takagi.
You're right.
If he avoids this murder,

maybe it will make up for losing the badge and nothing will happen to him.
This morning in Hanzaki she went to buy a block of ice
at that store.
And yesterday he picked up a brick.
I've got it.
I know what he wants to do!
This way, he can even make it look like the manager was drunk...
and fell down the stairs, like it was an accident.
Hell, no!
Let's hurry.
Run, Conan!
What?
There's been a murder?
I mean it's about to happen, inspector.
I don't know what you call me, girl.
Look, I've got to find the badge now.
But...
Let me do it!
Inspector, your badge was found yesterday in Hanzaki.
He found it?
It's on the floor.
He asked us to come and get it.
And wherever he goes, it's his apartment?!
(Mitsuhiko) Conan!
I convinced the landlord to leave us the master key.
Eeeeeei!
Conan!
Is it here? Yes.
Where is it?
Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is the plate?
Where is it?
Huh? (Laughs)
Oh.
(At the same time) Viscaaaa!
Ah.
Now I untie him.
-But it's you!
That's right.
My name is Sugiyama.
You saved me again, Inspector Takagi.
Thank you very much.
What's your name?
How do you know my name? I didn't identify myself yesterday.
I saw it here.
Look.
You see?, it says it clearly.
Aaah...!
The badge!
Hurray!
We have found it.
So, in Hanzaki you didn't find it,
but you saw how in Sugiyama you found it, right?
Yes, it seems so.
Ah.
How fortunate.
How nice!
(All: laugh)
But what are you doing here?
What a surprise, right?
Maybe I should ask you.
You have talent.
That's why I've always supported you.
Why didn't you trust me, Hanzaki?!
Why didn't you?
I'm sorry.
I'm Inspector Takagi, from the first investigation group.
Mr. Hanzaki, please come with me to the police station.
Yes.
Mm?
What's that?
This girl is the one from before...
What's the matter?
Eh?
And the next Conan:
"The English teacher vs. the Osaka detective, (part one)."
