UAH, I think I had a little too much breakfast.
To make up for it I'll run home.
-Good morning, anyway!
-Good morning, young man!
Hello, good morning!
What a morning!
Eh... Don't worry, I won't do anything to her!
Oh.
-Yes, it looks like it.
-Someone lost it?
Oh, my goodness!
Oh!
Hm.
I won't stay step, this money!
It's 30 million yen!
And no one has reported losing it?
No.
But I'm glad it was you who found them, inspector.
So you're a policeman... And I was suspicious of you.
Mrs. Sasamoto.
Sasamoto, do you make the same route every morning?
Yes.
I hope you can return the money to the person who lost them.
We hope so.
"Of love and crime there are always: they are repeated every day."
"In the bag they found there are 30 million yen."
"What did he want to do, its owner?"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"
Take me to the high, We never cry on.

Try again, try again, try again always.
Try again, try again, try again, try again.

"Inspector Takagi finds 30 million yen."
Have I seen anyone around here carrying a brown bag?
Yes, although it's not entirely certain that this person lives in the neighborhood.
I'll try to ask my neighbors.
Thank you very much, madam.
Is it true, Inspector Takagi?
They say you found a lot of money!
Gee... and how did you know that?
Because we're members of the Junior Detective League!
Yes.
Besides, if the person who lost them doesn't show up in 6 months,
they'll be yours, right?
-Ha-ha!
It doesn't work like that.
-You'll be a millionaire!
The duty of every policeman is to hand in the lost objects he finds.
So you won't be able to treat yourself to eel and rice?
I already told you that.
Well, we'll help you find the person who lost them, won't we?
-Mm-hm.
-We have a school party today and we can!
-Yes, around 6 o'clock in the morning.
-You found them very early, didn't you?
Since I have the day off today,
last night I slept over at a friend's house who lives nearby.
Then, on my way home jogging...
together with a woman named Hideki Sasamoto, I found them here.
Like this, in the middle of the street?
Yes.
(Kogoro) You'd have to be a real idiot to lose a bag full of money.
-(Kogoro) What?
-What do you say we make a deal?
If I, a simple civilian, had found the money...
(Mobile)
Yes, hello?
Yes, it's me.
Eh?
That the person who lost the bag has turned up?
Well, if you ever have problems again, do me a trick.
I don't understand why he came.
He-he!
(Takagi) Toshiyuki Hiranuma.
Are you sure, it's him, who has lost the money?
I'm positive.
Mr. Hiranuma's wife
Hiranuma's wife died recently because of an illness...
and the 30 million was the life insurance money.
Understood.
But, Mr.
Hiranuma, how can the loss be all that money?
Well, I'm a little embarrassed to explain....
I have a good friend in Beika's neighborhood and I happened to want to teach them.
You mean he brought the 30 million here to show off?
Pretty much.
Then I drank and went home very happy.
Today, when I realized that the bag was gone, I got a cover.
So you didn't lose it this morning, but last night?
Yes?
That's right.
(Takagi) Understood.
Anyway, since it's a large amount of money,
we can't get it back to you right away.
- (Takagi) It has paint stains.
-(Takagi) Of course.
(Takagi) Oh, thank you.
I don't know where I should lean.

(Takagi) Once everything is cleared up and the bag can be returned to you,
the police station will contact you.
(Hiranuma) Thank you.
In fact, I'm in no hurry, that's all right.
The man who lost the bag showed up right away.
The Junior Detective League couldn't help at all.
It's very boring.
Inspector, I was just thinking of going to the police station.
Ah!
I spoke to you this morning.
Did you?
You said there was nothing?
That's right.
It was about 5:00 in the morning.
When I passed by to deliver the newspapers, as I do every day,
I assure you that there was no bag there.
In other words, Mr. Hiranuma lost it.
Hiranuma had lost it...
after the paperboy had passed by.
What anguish!
Conan, is there anything in here?
Well, I don't know yet, but...
Look, could it be Mr. Hiranuma's footprints?
Hiranuma's footprints?
It's true, Mr. Hiranuma's shoes were dirty, but...
Hiranuma's shoes were dirty, but...
And look at this!
This painting is the same....
that Mr. Hiranuma had on the back of his jacket.
Hiranuma had behind his jacket.
Ouch!
That's too bad!
Do you think it's likely that Mr. Hiranuma was here this morning?
Hiranuma was here this morning?
Yes, he must have taken the bag out just before you came by.
He did?
He took it out?
Even if it was very early,
it's hard to believe that no one else came by between 5:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.,
when the paperboy came by,
and the moment you arrived, an hour later.
You are absolutely right.
And if Mr.
Hiranuma had left it just before I passed by,
I should have seen him leave.
That's right.
Therefore, Mr.
Hiranuma had to calculate the time that would pass...
until a person found the bag.
"So he left it in the middle of the street
and watched what was going on from this abandoned store."
-Yes, it looks like it.
-Someone lost it?
But why did you want Inspector Takagi to find it?
I've got it!
Mrs. Sasamoto!
Mrs. Sasamoto!
I happened to pass by here today,
but Mrs.
Sasamoto said that she passes by every morning.
So, I wanted Mrs. Sasamoto to find the 30 million yen?
Sasamoto to find the 30 million yen?
(Mitsuhiko) But it's very strange, it's a very big amount.
(Genta) Of course!
So you can return it to the person who lost it?
(Mitsuhiko) I'm so glad.
It's a man named Toshiyuki Hiranuma.
Mrs. Saramoto, you don't know him.
Saramoto, don't you know him?
Toshiyuki Hiranuma...
No, not that I know of.
He should know?
Who is that man over there?
-From the police?
-He's a police inspector.
(Takagi: sighs)
It didn't seem to me that he was hiding anything, this lady.
- (man) About it... inspector!
- (footsteps: approaching)
Tell me, how can I help you?
Have you found the culprit?
Eh?
The culprit?
Hm?
(Oba) Isn't that why you've come?
My name is Kunitaro Oba...
I'm the floor manager of this supermarket.
What were you saying about Mrs. Sasamoto's husband?
Mrs. Sasamoto's husband?
Hideki's husband... he was murdered a long time ago.
Eh?
It was 15 years ago on the 30th of last month.
They still haven't been able to find the culprit.
If it's been that long, maybe the statute of limitations has passed.
Yes.
She's been more cheerful lately,
but the first few years she never smiled,
and she always looked down.
The truth is that Hideki and I want to get married soon.....
Oh.
The first time I asked her to marry me, she said no. She said, "You'll be more than that.
She said, "You'll be happier, but he, who is no longer here, won't be."
It's funny, don't you find?
but lately
but lately he has even started to think about his own happiness.
The other day we both said to go to visit her husband's grave,
to ask him to let her start a new life.
But... things are not so easy.
If her murderer were to show up now...
I'm afraid she would feel hatred and suffer again.
-Calm down, I'm coming, I'll be right back!
- (man) In charge!
15 years and still unsolved.
A murder and 30 million yen...
What if they are related?
-Why should they be?
-What you say is absurd!
I don't know, but there's something...
I have an idea!
I'll look for all the information there is on the case.
The crime was 15 years ago
on the fourth floor of a multi-company office building.

"To avoid detection by surveillance cameras,
"he climbed the 4 floors through a pipe in the building next door
and entered the office through the balcony."
"Then he killed Mr. Akio Sasamoto, who was there alone,
working overtime, and took 5 million yen in cash."
"As the offender left sneaker prints on the floor," he said,
"A list was made of the people who had bought that model of footwear
and a thorough investigation was made."
Curiously,
Mr. Hiranuma's name was also on the list.
Hiranuma's name was also on the list of buyers.
So... here's the story.
What do you mean by that?
Well, to compensate her for the crime
he tried to give the 30 million yen to Mrs. Sasamoto.
Mrs. Sasamoto,
his widow.
He wanted her to find them.
He thought that if no one knew it was him who had left them there,
after 6 months they would be hers.
But you are saying that Mr.
Hiranuma was guilty of that crime?
No way.
At first I thought so too,
but Mr.
Hiranuma was not the culprit of the crime 15 years ago.
Eh?
It was impossible that Mr.
Hiranuma could have committed the crime.
What do you mean?
When the investigators went to check,
they found he had a broken leg.
"At the hospital where he was treated, they confirmed it."
"They had cast his leg 3 days before the murder was committed."
You couldn't have climbed 4 floors with a broken leg.
And with a cast he wouldn't have been able to wear slippers either.
Exactly.
The case that took place 15 years ago
and Mr. Hiranuma's 30 million
Hiranuma have no connection whatsoever.
We have wrongly assumed
that Mr.
Hiranuma had left the money there because she found them.
(Mobile)
Oh, there's a call for me.
It's Mr.
Mouri.
Hello, Kogoro, how's it going?
Mr.
Mr. Mouri says he's also in the middle
with the 30 million yen issue.
When I explained to him what we were discussing just now,
he asked me to do some research for him.
He wants you to check whether in that period of time
there were any of Hiranuma's friends who had also broken their legs.
Uh... If Mr. Mouri says so, I will try to check.
Mouri says so, I'll try to check, but...
And he has asked the Junior Detective League for help.
He wants all the information about Mr. Hiranuma, whatever it is.
Hiranuma, whatever it is.
You mean we can help the famous detective?
Come on, let's investigate!
-We'll see you later.
-Yeah!
They say that Hiranuma closed his store about a month ago.
They say it was because his wife, who was sick, died.
Everyone says that Mr. Hiranuma is serious and kind.
Hiranuma is serious and kind.
But recently something curious happened.
It seems that he said he was going on a long trip for a long time
but it seems that he came back on the same day.
And that happened about a week ago now.
A week ago?
Ah, it.
It was at the end of last month, the 30th, if I remember correctly.
However, the evening before,
while we were at the restaurant,
M.
Hiranuma said something a little strange.
(Man) You've been very good to take such good care of her.
But take it easy from now on.
Your late wife...
I assure you I would do it if I could.
I've been thinking about it for a long time,
but when I make up my mind, I'm so afraid.
-I'm... so pathetic!
So pathetic!
-What do you mean?
And I'll never be able to do it!
Then he said a few times
that some things can't be fixed with money.
Then the next morning that's when it happened.
Mr.
Hiranuma, I see you're carrying a bag,
are you going away for a few days to a spa?
No, I have decided to go away for a while.
I hope everything is going well for you, Mr. Morita.
Morita.
"It sounded exactly as if he was saying goodbye to me forever."
However, that same day in the evening he came back saying...
that he had not been able to go on the trip.
What's the meaning of this, Conan?
Hm?
(Mobile)
It's Inspector Takagi.
Hello, Inspector.
Kanzaki, what are you doing drinking beer at noon?
-Hello, everyone.
-I'm having a party today.
-I want a bowl of soba.
- Hey, good morning!
(Man) A bowl of soba!
What happened to you, then?
I tripped on the stairs and broke my right leg.
And the day I tripped

I guess I wasn't supposed to have a health card, was I right?
Who are you, man?
Who the hell told you that?
(Thinking) "That day Mr. Hiranuma came up with the idea."
"That's why what happened happened."
(Hiranuma) But, I don't quite understand.
Why does the famous detective Kogoro Mouri want to talk to us?
I have no idea either.
In the meantime, let me introduce you.
This is Mrs. Hideki Sasamoto,
she's the woman who found the money bag with me.
Hey, Takagi!
Why are you calling me so urgently?
I have things to do too.
What are you saying?
But it's you who has...
What are you saying that I... Ah!
Why do you always...?
Ah...
That's it!
What?
He's fallen asleep.
(Kogoro voice) A detective as good as me is able to find out things...
just from information given to him by other people, you know, Mr.
Hiranuma?
-What about?
-I don't understand what you're talking about.
Well, about the robbery-homicide you committed 15 years ago.
-It can't be!
-What?
(Kogoro voice) Yes, it can be.
(Takagi) But it couldn't possibly be him, Mr. Mouri!
Mouri!
Three days before the incident,
M.
Hiranuma broke his right leg.
That the medical report and the X-ray had Mr. Hiranuma's name on it.
Hiranuma's name
does not necessarily mean that they were his.
Thus Mr. Kanzaki used Mr. Hiranuma's health card.
Kanzaki used Mr. Hiranuma's health card?
Hiranuma's health card?
But what about the cast?
(Kogoro) He probably put it on himself after committing the crime.
- (Kogoro) I don't have any proof.
- (Takagi) But...
But Takagi, if Mr.
Hiranuma is innocent,
why hasn't he said anything to defend himself yet?
It occurred to me when Kanzaki broke his leg.
Oh, what a bad thing I've done to myself!
I must have broken it!
Gee, you could at least pay the insurance!
Here, my card.
-Impossible, it doesn't have a photo or anything.
-Won't they catch me?
Yes, it's me... who did it.
I'm responsible.
I'm really sorry, really!
(Cries)
At that time I was a loose cannon,
a coward and a miserable criminal.
Shortly after...
"I met a woman and it was as if I was born again."
"I married her
and she made me a responsible worker."
"I was even able to open my own store, though it was small."
"But the happier we were,
the more I regretted all the bad things I had done in the past."
I thought many times about turning myself in to the police,
but... I lacked courage.
"Then my wife became ill."
"Since she had no parents or any other relatives,
if I hadn't taken care of her, no one would have taken care of her."
Finally, it was a month ago that my poor wife died.
It was then that I received the 30 million yen.
That is to say that you did not lose any money at any time,
but you left it there.
Yes.
But why did you do something so convoluted?
If it hurt you, all you had to do was to take the money to him.
Don't forget that I'm a coward.
I was too afraid that the police would stop me.
(Kogoro voice) This isn't true, Mr.
Hiranuma.
(Kogoro voice) Eh?
You came here a week ago, didn't you?
You wanted to give the 30 million yen to Mrs. Sasamoto...
Mrs. Sasamoto...
and then turn himself in to the police.
But he was unable to do so.
That day, when I was here, I felt them talking to the deceased.
Mr. Sasamoto...
I've asked Hideki to marry me..,
but she said to me:
"You will be happier, but he, who is no more, will not be happy at all".
I understand her feelings but today, 15 years have passed.
Please, would you be so kind as to free her from the pain....
to be the widow of a victim?
I guess you already know that I won't be able to forget you
but I will put everything that surrounded your death in a corner of my heart
and try not to think about it too often.
Please forgive me.
-Yes. -Yes.
-Come on.
"I couldn't show my face."
Not when the widow was trying to forget the whole incident.
So he couldn't give her the money to make it up to her,
or apologize to her, or turn himself in to the police.
If a criminal who had evaded justice for so long turned himself in, the press would have harassed the family,
the press would have hounded the victim's family.

Precisely when she was trying to start a new life.
But, Mr.
Hiranuma, no matter how much you try to convince yourself...
you can never erase your past.
Now, you could say that this case is very special.
Although we can't erase what happened,
we can put an end to it.
If you carry out your sentence, Mr.
Hiranuma,
and if you, Mrs.
Sasamoto, accept the money.
Once the case is resolved,
there will no longer be any reason for you to continue to carry this burden.
And you can start all over again.
Oi, Takagi?
Mr. Toshiyuki Hiranuma
Toshiyuki Hiranuma, acompanyi'm,
you are charged with robbery resulting in death.
Yes.
Mrs. Sasamoto, will you accept the 30 million yen?
Sasamoto, will you accept the 30 million yen?
No.
Make them serve you to start a new life.

Good bye!
Ouch... I haven't thought anymore!
Eh?
Eh?
Atxum!
Eh?
What am I doing?
Where am I?
I'm sorry, Kogoro.
Did something happen?
(Woman) Aaaah!
-Oh!
-It's-it's in Hikari!
(Takagi) This way, maybe?
(Takagi) No!
Conan!
(Takagi) Wait!
I'm going to look at it.
"This is what the murderer took from the crime scene!"
"This means it was who I thought it was."
"Don't miss the next episode: 'The Client's Message'."
