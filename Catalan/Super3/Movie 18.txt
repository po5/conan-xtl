(Sonoko) So?
What do you think of the view from the Bell Tree tower built by the Suzuki Financial Group?
that Suzuki Financial Group has built?
It's very impressive, Sonoko.
Thank you very much for inviting us.
You too can be very grateful.
You must think that only company personnel
only company personnel are invited to these openings.
-It's unbelievable.
-Yes.
Thank you very much.
What the hell?
But she's the one who told us to come.
(Kogoro) Hey.
What do you think if we go pulling?
But what are you saying, father?
If we have just come up.
Aaaaah!
How the hell could I let myself get tangled up again to climb to a high place?
Come on, father, come here.
There's a breathtaking view.
Enough nonsense.
I'm pulling.
Oh, boy.
Besides, haven't you ever heard it said that only idiots and clouds...
like high places?
The problem you have is that you're afraid of heights.
What are you talking about?
Heights don't affect me at all.
So, I'm sure you don't mind looking down at the ground.
What?
Towards the ground?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
It's... it's transparent.
No... there's... there's no ground!
Aaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaah!
How scary!
I'm so scared!
I'm scared of heights!
Listen, father.
-This elevator...
-Listen...
(PA: woman) This elevator will take you to the observatory.
We hope you like the view at 460 meters high.
Let me go down!
Gee, Father, you're a case.
Don't suffer.
Sorry, Sonoko.
"This man is hopeless."
I know he does, these things.
(Sonoko) Come on, let's keep admiring the view of the Bell Tree Tower.
Hey, by the way, what's that building?
Ah, that little building is the Sky Court Asakusa.
It has nothing to do with our company.
And, when it's finished,
it will only reach the height of this first observatory.
(Genta) So, the Bell Tree tower is better.
(Sonoko) Obviously.
(Sonoko) Man!
Ha-ha-ha!
Hey, look at that river over there.
Look how many bridges it has.
Yes, that's the Sumida River.
That blue one is the Komagata Bridge.
The red one is the Azuma.
And in front of us is the subway leading to the Bell Tree Tower.
(Mitsuhiko) There's a train leaving right now.
How cool!
Wow.
But now it's stopped at the bridge.
It doesn't stop, it just slows down...
because just after the bridge is Asakusa Station.
Ah.
I've come up with an idea for summer work.
What do you say we make a scale model
of the Bell Tree tower and its surroundings?
-Yes, that's a good idea.
-Wouldn't that be cool?
It could be fun.
Conan, Ai, you guys in or what?
Well, I am.
Oops, it'll be a lot of work, won't it?
(Ayumi) Great.
Eh? (Mitsuhiko)
(Mitsuhiko) Alright, it's already decided.
- (Agasa) It was worth it to come.
- (Genta) We'll make a brutal demo.
- (Genta) I'll record everything on video.
- (Ayumi) Come on, we'll take lots of pictures.
We will have to look for a lot of information on the tower.
Because I hope that nobody wants to skip them, the summer homework.
(Ayumi) Let me be.
(Man) That one.
The yellow building.
Wow, that's amazing.
Ah, I see it.
What a beautiful building!
This building was built 30 years ago.
And now that the construction of the Bell Tree Tower has been completed,
the view alone is already four-star.
There's no doubt that it's a five-star estate.
-Oysters!
-Oysters!
"Did you say 30 years? Isn't it a bit old?"
How I love this house!
Me, too.
You don't?
No, it's not.
No, nothing.
What's the matter?
Mm?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
A sniper.
Everybody down on the ground!
(people: screaming in panic)
- (woman) Stay calm, please.
- (Ayumi) It's heavy.
(People: talking at once)
"Damn, people have gotten out of control."
"I thought so, coming from there. And the Ran?"
"Yes."
Doctor.
The car keys.
I'll go get the skateboard.
The... the keys?
(Ayumi) Doctor, it's heavy.
Keep calm, please.
(Ayumi) Hey.
(Ayumi) Wait.
But Conan...

DETECTIVE CONAN.
THE DIMENSIONAL SNIPER
"I'm teenage detective Shinichi Kudo."
"One day, I went to the amusement park with Ran Mouri.
"My best friend and classmate.

"And I witnessed a suspicious exchange
between two men dressed in black."
"I was so focused watching those two men,
that I didn't realize there was another one behind me."
"He made me swallow a poison.
"And, when I woke up....
(Conan voice)... my body had shrunk."
"If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
they would want to kill me and the lives of those around me would be in danger."
"That's why Dr. Agasa
recommended that I hide my identity."
"When the Ran asked me what my name was,
I randomly told him I called myself Conan Edogawa."
"Since Ran's father is a detective,
"I decided to go live with them
to try to get information about the Men in Black."
"The mysterious Men in Black organization."
"I'm not the only one trying to discover their true identity."
"There's also the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FBI."
"In James Black, the Andre Camel,
the Jodie Starling and in Shuichi Akai."
"He was one of the smartest agents,
"And an excellent marksman,
but a CIA agent who had infiltrated the organization had..."
"In addition, new characters appear on the scene."
"The Masumi Sera."
"A new student at the institute,
Ran's classmate who claims to be a detective."
"And, finally, in Subaru Okiya."
"An engineering graduate student
who I let live in my house while no one's home."
"But his real identity is..."
Soc small, but I have the brain of an adult.
A detective who solves all mysteries.
The truth always ends up knowing!
"Such a precise feature from that distance..."
"Don't tell me...
it was their work."
"I must find out at all costs."
"The building was this way."
(Horn)
(Horn) Ah!
Oysters!
-Oh! -Oh!
-What's the matter?
A child has fallen!
(People: shouting)
This is the way to the building.
This is it.
(People: shouting) Perfect.
"He can't have gone very far."
"If I wanted to run away and avoid the traffic,
the best thing would be... to go on foot... or by motorcycle."
Maybe it's him.
A holster this size... No doubt about it, it's a rifle holster.
Oh, can you hear me?
This is a useless piece of junk!
(Pin: interference)
Haibara.
Haibara.
Answer, Haibara.
What's the matter, Haibara?
You don't feel well.
Where are you, Conan?
"Pursuing suspect. He's on a motorcycle."
-Huh? -You got it.
Roger that.
-Doctor, call the police, please. -Doctor, call the police, please.
The license plate is Shinjuku S-E-3-3-1-7,
and heading north on Mitsume Avenue.
He's turned left.
You won't get away.
Yes.
(Ai) "What's wrong? Conan! Is everything all right?"
We're crossing the Kototoi Bridge right now.
Fuck.
(Interference)
(Horn)
The signal doesn't reach here.
"I'm in your blind spot."
Where is he?
"He's gone in the wrong direction? It can't be."
-Seems in Yaiba.
Watch out!
"Wow, he must have seen me at last."
Why did you...?
Eh?
Masumi, what are you doing here?
We'll talk later.
Let's go.
(Male) The suspect's license plate is Shinjuku S-E-3-3-3-1-7.
According to the latest information we've received,
he was seen crossing the Sumida River at Kototoi Bridge.
All cars in the area
be directed to apprehend the suspect.
How?
Were you at the Bell Tree Tower?
Followed the man who has been shot by the sniper.
"As a detective, of course."
So, you were, when it all happened?
Yes, but I didn't think she'd be killed.
I can see that.
Hold on tight.
He's turned left towards Kuramae Bridge.
Do whatever it takes to close him off.
(Radio: male) "Receiving. We've blocked the bridge."
Punch.
Hold on.
We'll chase him.
No.
It's too dangerous to continue the chase.
Don't worry.
We'll soon know where he's headed.
He has stopped.
It's very likely he's got another getaway vehicle ready.
We don't want that.
Let's stick to it.
Mm-hm.
But... be careful.
Take it easy, man.
I just want to see what he's doing.
(Radio: male) "Suspect has fled on a medium-sized motorcycle."
Apparently, he's beaten us to it this time.
(Jodie) Yeah.
It's his bike.

It must have continued on foot.
Yes, it's the same one.
Wow.
Masumi.
Masumi.
(Car: approaching)
Oh.
Camel!
You're already mine.
(Jodie) Here I wait for you.
Masumi, have you done anything, you?
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
No.
But if it weren't for the helmet, I'd be dead by now.
Apparently, she hasn't taken too much damage.
Easy, easy.
We, lightning.
And you, how are you?
Ah... I'm fine.
Luckily, I was wearing this.
I get it now.
But what Jodie did with the gun...
I'd better not tell anyone, right?
(Jodie) It's over.
She's escaped.
(Man) There's nothing to be done.
(Black) Let's let the Japanese police handle it.
(Jodie) We'll ask them to make a sweep of the docks in the bay.
It won't be easy to catch now.
It's a seal.
He moves through the sea like a fish in water.
A seal?
(Black) Look here, please.
Based on the photos we've been able to obtain and his shooting technique,
we believe the suspect is this man.
Timothy Hunter, 37 years old.
An elite ex-Army Special Forces ex-Army Seal.
He was deployed to the Middle East in 2003 and spent 3 years.
He is a war hero who has received several awards.
And why would that make him a hero?
We believe the reason for all of that is the Silver Star.
(Kogoro) The Silver Star?
It's a decoration awarded to soldiers
who show extraordinary valor
fighting against an enemy of the United States.
Hunter received the Star in 2005 for his acts of heroism.
But the following year it was withdrawn
because he was accused of violating the rules of engagement.
-Yes.
-It was withdrawn?
An officer of the army
reported him for shooting an unarmed civilian.
Evidently, he denied it.
Due to lack of evidence, the case did not reach the military courts.
But the incident left him scarred,
and he went from being a war hero to a hero under suspicion.
(Jodie) "In addition,
"Possibly as a result of the withdrawal of the Silver Star,
"When he returned to combat he had lost his calm
"and efficiency that characterized him,
and was shot in the head by an enemy rifle."
And how did he manage that?
Oysters.
(Camel) After a very complicated operation, they saved his life.
But as a result of his wounds, he was forced to retire.
But his misfortune did not end there.
"When he returned to the United States, seeking a quiet life,
he moved to Seattle, in the state of Washington."
"But he couldn't get the terrible memories of the war out of his head,
which continued to haunt him."
"And the misfortune did not only haunt him."
"It also affected his wife and his little sister,
with whom he lived."
"He lost all his money because of bad investments.
"His sister committed suicide because she was left by her fiancé,
and his wife died of an overdose."
"In Hunter he lost his honor,
money and the family he loved so much, all at once."
For the next six years,
we have had no record of his whereabouts or his activities.
(Shiratori) And may we know what makes you suspect that this man is the perpetrator of the murder?
that this man is the perpetrator of the murder?
(Shiratori) An incident 3 weeks ago.
In Brian Woods, a journalist,
was shot and killed by a rifle in Seattle.
When the police investigated the victim,
it was discovered that he had taken to harassing Hunter and his wife.
He wanted to interview them for a series of articles
he published under the title "The Hero Under Suspicion."
In the end, both had several nervous breakdowns.
For this reason, the police and the FBI?
investigated Hunter as a prime suspect.
And they found out that he arrived in Japan a couple of weeks ago.
Then, knowing that we were on vacation in Japan..,
FBI headquarters called us and ordered us to detain him.
Understood.
And that brings us to where we are now.
Yes.
By the way, do you have any idea where he might be?
We're doing a sweep of Tokyo Bay,
but so far we haven't found anything.
I'm not at all surprised.
As you know, the acronym SEAL,
stands for "Sea, Air, Land".

The "seals" are excellent swimmers,
as well as extraordinary elite marksmen.
Speaking of shooters,
we found some curious objects on the rooftop of the building
of the building from which he fired.
-Agent Chiba...
- (Jodie) Curious objects?
Yes.
Next to the railing on the corner facing the Bell Tree tower
there was a die and a 51-millimeter-long sheath.
It is 7.62 millimeters in diameter,
which matches the caliber of the bullet used to commit the crime.
These are the same NATO cartridges used with the MK11 rifle,
which is what he used in Hunter.
- (Shiratori) And the die?
(Shiratori) -So, it is obvious.
Was a die also found, next to the scabbard,
the place from where the shot was fired in Seattle?
(Camel) No.
I have no record that there was any.
But there is a relationship between Hunter and dice.
We know that he is very fond of playing.
Even in door some of tattooed on the left arm.
Ah, of course...
Although it seems a weak clue,
it is very possible that in Hunter
wanted to leave us a message with the dice.
Yes, and the strongest proof...
to prove that the murderer is in Hunter,
is the victim's identity.
It means that in Hunter he had some concrete motive
for wanting to murder Mr. Fujinami?
Yes.
In Hiroaki Fujinami is the person who, 7 years ago,
caused him to go bankrupt by selling him an estate that was in disrepair.
Really?
As you say?
So, there is no doubt that the murderer is in Hunter.
By the way, Masumi,
could you explain to us why you were following him, Mr. Fujinami?
-That, why did you follow him?
-Yes, it's true.
A relative of a classmate of mine
was planning to marry Mr. Fujinami.
She suspected something
and asked me to check his background.
Are you going to check them?
Oops.
I found out he was in the business of swindling foreigners
by selling them bad properties.
And that was the reason for the follow-up.
"Come to think of it, moments before..."
(Masumi) I'm sorry she was killed, of course,
but on the other hand, I'm glad the wedding didn't take place in the end.
Besides, from what they say,
it might not be the last murder you want to commit in Hunter, right?
Yes, that's true.
You mean there are more people in Hunter that you want to liquidate?
-Yeah.
-Jodie, photos, please.
The FBI have come to the conclusion
that there may be at least 3 more people who are in danger.
(Jodie) Yes.
(Jodie) How?
Three, you said?
We have information that leads us to believe that you want to kill these 3 men.
Jack Waltz, 45 years old.
He's the former captain you accused Hunter
of violating the rules of engagement.
(Camel) He currently lives in San Diego,
where he owns a company that manufactures military equipment.
Next up is Bill Murphy, 35.
In Murphy was a sergeant in the Army, under Waltz,
and testified against Hunter.
He then went to work as a clerk at Waltz's company.
at Waltz's company.
If they live in San Diego, there's no way he'd murder them.
No.
They're both in Japan right now.
They're what?
Waltz and his family arrived two days ago in Kyoto.
And Murphy's in Nikko City.
-And in Nikko?
Oysters!
-To Kyoto, you say?
Yes, and they both plan to stay 8 more days.
And the last person is...
Hitoshi Moriyama, 34 years old.
He was her sister's fiancé,
who pushed her to suicide when she broke off the engagement.
In Moriyama worked as a salesman for a company in Seattle,
but since he retired 4 years ago, we have lost track of him.
So, two of these three men are here in Japan.
So... he's obviously going to try to kill them.
Yes.
Contact Kyoto police and Tochigi prefectural police.
And put out an APB on Timothy Hunter
as the alleged perpetrator of the murder!
(Kogoro) An extirpator of the "seals".
We've got ourselves a dangerous individual, eh?
"(Kogoro) At least now I know that they had nothing to do with it.
(Masumi) What I don't understand...
Is why he has waited 6 years to take revenge on these men,
on Hunter.
Now that you say it, you're right.
It is true.

Maybe he wanted to do it at this moment and that's it.
By the way, you better stop playing detective.
This time you've gone off the deep end.
Marrec!
(laughs)
You should also watch a little more, eh?
What case...
Yes, of course.
Masumi, I'm very glad that nothing happened to you, obviously,
but don't take any more on Conan.
I don't want you to put him in danger ever again.
"Ran..."
Don't suffer.
I promise I'll always protect him.
Besides, right now,
there's no bullet that can pierce his heart.
And, evidently, neither can you.
I'll be on my way.
I've got the bike parked over there.
So long, Conan.
(Kogoro) Wow.
You mean you understood what we said?
What did you mean by that, that no bullet can pierce my heart?
Ah.
That you can dodge bullets because you know karate, maybe.
It's impossible, dodging a bullet.
"Nothing is impossible for her."
What's wrong with her?
You don't like flares, or what?
(What's wrong with them?
That they've witnessed a murder.
(Genta) It's not just that.
Well..., these are things that happen.
It's just that they've taken all the photos we've taken.
- (Ai) Just for a while.
-They've confiscated our cameras.
Soon they'll give them back to you.
There might be some photos that could be useful for the investigation.
(Ai) Oh... It's turned off.
And my.
-My, too.
Oh...
Oh.
We're done, then.
How's it going?
It's a little livelier now?
-I'm not really convinced.
-Not really.
Maybe I should have bought a few more.
I was thinking about it, what would that tell me.
And I've prepared a surprise for you.
Yes, but it's a new version.
The ball-shooter belt?
Yes, I know.
Let's get to work.
You have to kick it up high, okay?
Wait, just a minute, I'll set the timer.
Let's go, let's go.
Raise it!
How high!
Yes.
Very good!
-I love it.
Thank you very much, doctor.
-(Agasa) Great!
(Agasa) It's a fireworks ball.
I don't know why, but it seems to me that the neighbors will complain.
(Agasa) Eh?
I had not thought.
And now what do I do?
What if...
(Ayumi) Why did you only manage to hit it in Conan?
(Genta) It's true, doctor.
(Mitsuhiko) Don't you have any more for us?
(Agasa) Ah... Worse could not have gone.
Well, it's already daytime?
"This Hiroshi Moriyama end,
"I seem to remember reading
a newspaper article that talked about."
"Or am I getting the wrong person?"
(Black) We have received this list from FBI headquarters.
These are people you are very likely to contact at Hunter.
Roger that.
I've organized 3 teams to interrogate everyone, but....
first of all, can you tell me what information the FBI has on these 3 men?
on these 3 men?
Of course I can.
The first one's name is Scott Green.
"A former navy petty officer.
"Who decided to pursue his passion professionally
and set up a motorcycle store in Machida."
"When he was a member of the Seals.
he was a Hunter instructor at the shooting academy."
"Next up is Kevin Yoshino. Former Marine sergeant."
"Currently runs a military supply store a Fussa."
"Thanks to his contacts,
he imports surplus military equipment from the U.S. and sells it."
And we have one left, the last one: at Marks & Spencer.
This one I don't think was on the list you told us yesterday, was it?
No.
He has no direct connection with Hunter,
but, as a former officer, he works as a consultant...
to U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan.
"Since he doesn't have many friends at Hunter..,
it wouldn't be strange for him to ask him for help."
Right.
The rifle and the rest of the equipment
he could have gotten them anywhere,
but it's very likely that one of these men helped him.
(Man) How?
Tim?
I mean, Mr. Hunter is the prime suspect?
(Takagi) Well, we're still not entirely sure.
(Camel) Is it true that Hunter saved your life in the Middle East?
Yes.
If it were not for him, I would be dead now.
And if your savior came to ask you a favor...?

For example, to leave him the rifle with which he committed the crime...?
-I don't sell these weapons.
-An MK11 rifle?
You think it's real?
Try shooting him and you'll see for yourself.
(Sato) You say you saw him?
Yes.
He told me it had just arrived in Japan.
And can you tell us where he is?
I'm sorry, but I have no idea.
(Jodie) The suspect fled with a motorcycle.
It was a second-hand dirt bike, with fake plates.
Are you implying that I gave it to him, the bike?
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I only sell new motorcycles.
What do you think of the accusation...
that you broke the rules of engagement?
Well, it's true.
Wanting to protect some colleagues, he overstepped his bounds.
He... jumped the gun and shot at a civilian.
(Yoshino) "It's not true."
It's impossible for Hunter to do something like that.
(Yoshino) -A setup?
It was all a set-up.
In Waltz he had also been an elite marksman,
and he was very jealous of Hunter.
In Jack Waltz had also been a marksman, you say?
It was he, who stole the Silver Star from en Hunter.
Then...
So, you don't think he broke the rules of engagement?
No.
Of course he didn't.
In Hunter is a true hero who saved hundreds of lives.
If he ever came to me asking for a favor,
I'd obviously be happy to help you.
I don't know.
I have not had any dealings with this Hunter end,
and I have no information.
Oh, you haven't?
And what do you think of the infraction of the rules of engagement...
that you allegedly committed?
In fact, whether he broke them or not doesn't matter now.
But if this Hunter guy is really the killer,
I will not forgive him
that he has sullied the good name of the Navy in this way.
Shoot to kill, then let them see him.
-We shoot... to kill, you say?
-What?
I doubt very much that your shooters will be able to shoot him down.
If you want, I can lend you my driver.
-Hello.
-Carlos.
Carlos Lee is an elite Marine extirpator.
He caused 36 enemy casualties in the Middle East war.
Counting only confirmed casualties.
If we add the others, it adds up to 78.
Ah, yes, you're right.
And, if we count in Hunter, then it will be 79 casualties in total.
Because only one shooter can kill another shooter.
What do you say?
They want to take him away?
"If I can't find the article in any newspaper,
maybe it's because I saw it in a magazine."
"Be that as it may, I'll have a good job."
(Ay) Come on, spread out the map on the table.
(Panda) Yes!
First we have to decide on the area we're going to reproduce.
(Agasa) Well, I see you're taking this job very seriously.
(Panda) Of course.
That's the way I like it.
What children more applied.
You deserve a prize.
(Ayumi) What prize, what prize?
Will you give us a belt that shoots fireworks?
No, we already bother the neighbors enough, yesterday.
I'll give you something that will be much more useful.
Eh?
Some Detectives League pins?
Yes, but they're a new version.
I've upgraded them and increased the coverage.
He was offended, wasn't he, that one I know said they were "useless junk"?
Wow.
You can tell he was sorry.
(Ayumi) I don't see them much different from before.
Only the coverage has improved, you say?
-Ehem...
(Ayumi) -Well, how boring.
No, I have done more things.
If you change the settings, when you tap to talk...
(Ayumi) Ah.
They make light!
(Mitsuhiko) You put an LED lamp on them!
- (Ayumi) Yes.
- (Genta) They're much cooler than before.
You can choose the color, and the person you want to communicate with.
(Ayumi) How cool!
But what's this annoying noise you feel?
-Noise?
Well, I don't feel anything.
- (constant high-pitched sound)
What is it?
But how can you not feel it?
It's called "the mosquito".
It is a high-frequency sound
that we stop feeling as we get older.
That's why the doctor doesn't feel it.
I'm sorry, I didn't take that into account when making the modifications.
Don't you think it's fine now?
I'll fix it later.
The mosquito could be useful at some point.
But... Doesn't it mean that the device is defective, if it makes a noise?
Ouch... What a disappointment!
(Ayumi) I don't like them so much now.

Ah... Let's see, you want me to tell you a riddle?
-Again?
-What?
It must be another pun.
But to listen to it, nothing happens, don't you find?
-But we do it for you.
-Yes, of course, if Ay says so...
What are we going to do, then...
Well... Let's see, listen.
Let's say a sniper challenges you
to a game of rock, paper, scissors.
What would you have to draw to win?
The clue is what "sniper" is called in English.
-I have no idea.
-What do I know, how do you say it?
Ah, yes.
Conan, you know, how do you say it?
But... I don't think you'll find it funny.
We don't know as much English as he does.
-Come on, tell us the solution.
We give up.
The solution is scissors.
Sniper, in English, is called "sniper," which is similar to "snip."
which means "to snip".
And that's why he can win by pulling out scissors.
-I find that they're not alike.
-But they're pronounced differently.
It doesn't work, the pun,
because it's spelled alike but pronounced differently.
-I thought it was good.
-It's a bit of a stretch.
-Eh?
-Ehem, ahem...
So, which of these sports would a sniper be good at?
One: baseball.
Two: soccer.
Three: golf.
Do... do... do... well...
-Huh?
-Number 3.
If we change the order of "sniper", we get "nice par",
that is, "a nice par".
-I'd expect nothing less from you.
-You really know.
A nice pair?
From now on, let Ay do the guessing.
Yes, man!
With the effort it took me to think...
Let's leave the doctor to his worries and focus on work.
-Let's go, let's go.
-You're right. -You're right.
My worries?
By the way, Conan... You lost your cell phone, didn't you?
The police called earlier to say they found it.
Wow.
This doctor...
He could have told me that before we took the guessing game.
Mm?
One other thing.
About the Masumi.
Be very careful.
You know she's dangerous.
Well, look who's talking...
Ep.
Where in Conan?
He's going to get his cell phone.
I think we can do without it.
(PA: woman) "Thank you very much for your visit."
"Beika's library is about to close."
-I don't understand.
- "Leave the books..."
Maybe I got the wrong person.
Ah!
I got it!
Hitoshi Yasuhara.
What?
Wasn't his name Moriyama?
He set up an import business 4 years ago.
His wife is a well-known cook
who has a cooking school in Honjo, in the Sumida district.
-Yes.
-Excuse me, we are about to close down.
-Sorry for the inconvenience.
-I'll be right over.
Thank you.
"Mr. Yasuhara decided to adopt his wife's surname,
Nami, when they got married."
Of course, he changed his last name when he got married, now I understand.
(Camel) We were investigating the Men in Black
and we ended up in this very complicated case.
Yes.
(Camel) I don't see it at all clear, of facing an extirpator the "seals".
I wish we had the Akai here.
-Easy. -Easy.
-I'm sorry.
I was thinking exactly the same thing.
"Shu, I want to ask you something."
If we compare a police shooter and a military shooter,
which do you think has better technique?
-Huh?
-It depends on the circumstances.
Up to 100 meters, the policemen are better.
If we talk about marksmanship,
cops are trained for this kind of situation.
-Yes.
-Ah, yes?
Police shooters act especially when there are hostages.
In such complicated situations,
they must have a very sharp aim
to be able to completely neutralize the target with a single shot.
If the aim is to instantly kill a person
without allowing the slightest reaction,
you must shoot at one point.
-Exactly.
-The brainstem.
Anywhere else, even if it is in the heart,
the person could stand up and resist for about 10 seconds.
And, during these instants,
he could endanger both the hostages and the policemen.
So where to shoot?
I would stand in front of the target...
And I would aim at his nose.
What?
Do you look like you have a heart?
Don't worry about it.
As long as I'm here, you won't have to go through this situation.
Never in life.
Shu...
Thank you very much.

(Man) Watch out and don't lose it again.
(Mobile)
Yes.
(Masumi) "Conan, where are you?"
I had lost my cell phone.
"I'm sorry. By the way, what did you want?"
That's why you wouldn't pick it up.
Well... I found some interesting information about Moriyama.
Wait, I'll come with you.
"I was just about to confirm it."
Where are you right now?
"At Honjo, in front of the police station next to Azuma Bridge."
What a coincidence!
I'm in Honjo, too, right now.
Yes.
"Oh, really? Really?"
It seems as if fate would have it that you and I solved this case.
Yes, now you have to turn left.
Yes.
What's new?
Wow!
You've made a track!
Don't worry.
Not yet.
Aw, what, let's have a look?
(beeping)
Mm-hm.
(Female voice) Vehicle exit.
(female voice) Attention, please.
Oysters.
Run, Conan!
It... it... it can't be...
There are two places he could have fired from.
I'd say from the highest.
Where do you think he did it from?
Mm-hm.
What do you think, come on?
I was thinking the same building, too.
"If we connect with a line the impact on the windshield...
"And on Mr. Moriyama,
"It would be normal to think
that the killer fired from the lower building."
"But, at the time,
Mr. Moriyama was in the middle of the garage ramp."
"This means you have to add up the angle of the ramp
to know the actual angle of the shot."
Therefore, the shot can only have been fired from one building.
This is it, right?
Wait.
Conan.
Conan, don't go alone!
Oysters.
(Hey, hey!
You can't pass without checking in.
He's got nothing in his head, this kid.
Surely Hunter's still around here.
(Masaumi) Conan!
Three?
Well then...
Hey, look.
Look at this.
So it's true that he shot from here.
I had no idea, that Mr. Moriyama had returned to Japan.
(Black) Yeah.
It just slipped my mind.
(Jodie) Now that these two men have been killed,
we can say without a doubt that the culprit is Hunter?
Yes.
The diameter of the bullet matches
with the caliber of the MK11 he uses.
In addition, the place from which the two victims were shot?
confirms with certainty that the perpetrator is him.
Can you explain it to us, Akahoshi?
-What do you mean?
Yes.
Mr. Fujinami used to invite his clients to high places...
because the buildings he came to looked better than they were.
Surely it was also in this way that he cheated on Hunter.
You mean that's why he decided to murder him
while he was showing a building to some clients?
Yes.
According to a real estate agent,
"Mr. Fujinami obtained a large amount of income
for the pre-opening period of the Bell Tree Tower."
"It is seen that every day he was showing his estates to the buyers
from the same place."
For his part, Mr. Moriyama broke off the engagement
with Hunter's younger sister and married another woman.
"That's why we think she decided to kill him
right in front of the home he shared with his new love."
We have confirmed that Mr. Moriyama left at the same time every day
to pick up his wife from cooking school.
We believe that Hunter took advantage of this to kill him.
"On the same day of the murder,
"The door and the cameras were disabled by gunfire
and left a clear path to the roof."
He visited the site several times,
gathered information and planned the assassination in detail.
Exactly as a "seals" shooter would plan it.
Yes.
Speaking of details.
This time he left a pod and a die at the scene again?
Ah, yes.
At the spot where he fired from.
We have a picture where you can see it.
This time he left the 3 side up.
I think the last time he left the 4, facing up.
It could be that it was... a countdown.
Oh... Right.
Well, if that's the case, we have to assume...
that the number of targets he has on Hunter in Japan is 4.
So far, there are two victims,
Hiroaki Fujinami and Hitoshi Moriyama.

Now we must assume that he plans to murder two people and, subsequently, leave one die with the two and one with the one.
and, subsequently, he will leave one die with the two and one with the one.
This is terrible.
If this deduction is correct, the next two victims will be?
Yes.
No doubt about it.
In Jack Waltz and Bill Murphy, of course.
We have already informed both of them extensively about these two killed
and they've already changed their plans for these days in Japan.
They had planned to meet in Tokyo,
"But in the end they have decided to stay in their respective hotels
until the case is satisfactorily resolved."
"Jack Waltz's wife and daughter, for their part, wanted to return home immediately,
wanted to return to their country immediately."
"But, since in Hunter he plans the crimes so far in advance
and it is probable that he had foreseen this possibility...,"
in the end they have also decided to stay in the hotel.
I don't think there will be any problems, if they don't move.
Already.
The local police have been alerted
and in Hunter will not be able to approach so easily.
We have set up checkpoints at the entrances and exits of Kyoto and Nikko,
so you won't be able to access these cities either.
But this does not mean that we have to sit here idly by.
It is very likely that Hunter will still be in Tokyo.
(Men) Yes, sir!
We have to find her at all costs.
(Sirens: from afar)
(Mobile)
(Masumi) What is it, Conan?
Ah.
Yes.
What?
That what?
That they've shot dead in Hunter?
Actually, they haven't confirmed the identity yet,
but I doubt it's anyone else.
Yes, do not suffer, I'll call you when I have more information.
(Shiratori) At Hunter's hideout we found his personal diary.
And, when we have translated it, we have found a few surprises.
Here you can see a photograph.
"August 3. That one wants to challenge me. He has taken my prey again.
I don't know why it does it, if not to provoke me.
I have to kill it at all costs
and liquidate the other two takes with my own hands."
This means that somebody anticipated Hunter
and killed Mr. Fujinami and Mr. Moriyana before him.
Does this mean that the real killer challenged Hunter,
and finally managed to kill him and win?
If so, the person we saw in the harbor was not in Hunter.
Apparently, the killer shot from a barge?
located in front of the hideout, on the Sumida River.
And, once again, he has left us a pod and a die.
This time, with the number two facing up.
But this time there was a difference.
Although the features have been fired from about 150 meters,
the shortest distance of all those killed,
one missed and ended up hitting the door of the room.
And to the barge we have also found another bullet impact.
The forensic police are analyzing it.
I suppose that that of the pod and the die,
we've kept it a secret from the press, haven't we?
That we found the same objects
even in Hunter's murder
I think it means, without a doubt,
that the 3 crimes have been committed by the same person.
In addition, we must take into account...
that in the Seattle crime we did not find any pods or dice.
Yes, that is true.
And by this you mean that Hunter did kill Brian Woods, right?
Yes.
If you stop to think about it, it all fits.
So now, given all these arguments,
we must focus on the numbers on the dice.
Four, three, two... and the next one...
will be one.
So, there will be another murder?
Yes.
And, unfortunately, we have no way to prevent it.
Of course, uh...
The two people Hunter had a score to settle with,
Jack Waltz and Bill Murphy,
are no longer the killer's clear targets.
No.
And now... we have no idea who the next victim might be...
the next victim.
It's the worst thing that could happen to us.
(TV: male) "Early this morning,
"In an abandoned building on the side of the Azuma Bridge,
"In Tokyo's Sumida Ward,
a third sniper victim has died."
"It is Timothy Hunter, a 37-year-old American,
"who had been a marksman for the 'seals',
the elite corps of the U.S. Army."
"Until now, the police considered him
the main suspect in the two previous killings."

"Police have not yet disclosed the details of the crime,
"But I think we can assume
that the two previous murders were committed by the same person."
"Eh? This means that..."
"Effectively, that these crimes are not over yet."
"And that we don't know who the next victim will be."
"What do you mean? You mean the killer kills indiscriminately?"
"Well, I wouldn't put it exactly like that."
"What I mean is, if they don't stop this sniper soon..."
(Male) Have you felt it?
The sniper kills indiscriminately.
How scary!
(Man) There are a lot of helicopters flying over the Sumida River.
(Man 2) So, is it dangerous to walk around downtown?
(Woman) No, I've been told that he will now perform in Shibuya.
(Woman 2) Really?
What if we hide in the subway?
(Woman 1) It's true.
I've been told that Harajuku can be dangerous.
(Man) And now!
Don't believe everything you feel, woman.
(Woman) There's not a soul on Takeshita Avenue.
It's unbelievable.
(Man) "Nothing like this has ever happened before."
"I'm sure it's Asakusa. You don't see a single child playing in the street."
"What nonsense! So far all the victims have been adults."
"No old people go to temples. What the fuck is going on?"
(Woman) "The first murder was at the Bell Tree tower."
- "It's still closed, isn't it?"
- "They say that from the places where the last murders have been committed...
you can see the Bell Tree tower."
- "You can see the Bell Tree tower?"
"This means that the tower is the key to this case?"
"So, however far away you go, as long as the Bell Tree tower is visible,
you are in danger?"
"If you carry an umbrella, from above it won't see you."
(Clicks)
(Panicked screams)
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
How funny!
Look, look, look!
"We are informed that there are at least 5 people with minor injuries."
"Nothing more so far from Kinshi."
Wow.
Panic has spread throughout Tokyo.
The problem is that the expression "indiscriminate shooting"
is spreading like wildfire.
Let's see, it's understandable.
There's no precedent in Japan for such a serial killer sniper.
Thank you very much, Ran.
You have.
That's very kind of you.
So what?
Do we have any idea who the killer might be?
Well, well...
Hunter's murder has left us a little bit shaken up,
why should we kid ourselves.
That's why... we've come here to ask your advice, Mr. Mouri.
Very well.
We understand.
"Oops. I don't know if that's the best option, asking Kogoro for advice."
For me there is not the slightest doubt
that the killer must have some connection with Hunter.
Yes.
Among the people living in Japan who were related to en Hunter,
include his former shooting instructor, Scott Green..,
who was also a sharpshooter for the Seals.
And also the expression "Marine" Kevin Yoshino.
And it's funny, but we've lost track of them since last night.
What do you mean?
But we believe that none of them had any reason to want to kill him.
So, the police don't know who the culprit is?
Although we're still investigating at the moment,
we believe it's someone we don't know.
No.
Because there is someone else.
The former commander of the Yokosuka base,
retired Rear Admiral Mark Spencer.
-Not him.
His driver.
-But...
The Marine extirpator.
In Carlos Lee.
But neither Mr. Spencer nor Mr. Lee
have any relationship with Hunter.
Nor do they have any motive.
The motive is his pride as a marksman.
And so much.
Pride?
The number of enemy casualties of en Hunter is 79.
And how many does Lee have?
Let's see... 36. 36 in the Middle East.
These are only the confirmed ones.
If we add the unconfirmed ones...
I think... there were 78.
That's right.
And there was no way Lee could afford that.
He considered himself a much better shooter than Hunter.
Then he learned that in Hunter he had killed in Woods in Seattle.
And, therefore, his number of casualties amounted to 80.
So in Lee he decided to anticipate....
And killed in Fujinami and Moriyama.
(Kogoro) Here the score was 80 to 80.
And, as soon as he got this tie,
he decided to challenge him to a final duel.
- (Takagi) It became clear to me!
-(Takagi) Pam!

We will base our research on this.
Ah... Okay.
-Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
-Thank you very much.
(Door closes)
You've been great, Father.
Eh? (Door closes)
Ah... (door closes) Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"That's a bit of a peculiar deduction, but it has its logic."
"But, even if this assumption is correct,
more information must be obtained."
(Jodie) If there is any news?
Now that you mention it,
the bullet we extracted from Hunter's corpse
was 5.56 by 45 millimeters.
It was lighter than the previous ones and didn't go all the way through.
(Shinichi voice) How?
It was a lighter bullet?
"Yes, even though he was shot in the head, we identified him right away,
because the visible injuries were minimal."
Do you think the bullet was a lighter caliber
because it shot him closer?
"Surely. He must have chosen it because it has less recoil and more accuracy."
However, he missed a shot.
"Have you discovered anything else?"
Strange, isn't it?
There's something that has really caught my attention.
"When I went to see Hunter's corpse in the morgue,
I found that he was very thin."
"Yes."
He was very thin?
"He didn't look the least bit like
to the Hunter who received the Silver Star."
The corpse, to go well, in addition to the forensic autopsy,
a clinical autopsy should also be done.
Eh?
"And also an MRI of the skull."
Understood.
I'll tell Inspector Megure right away.
Good bye.
I'll talk to you later.
Eh?
Conan.
Where are you going?
Don't go far, it's dangerous to go on the street.
Don't worry.
I'm just going to Dr. Agasa's house to get the skateboard.
Wait a minute...
Yes, I felt it.
But who would want to kill Hunter?
(Man) "Yeah, I have no idea."
At least now I don't have to suffer in case he shows up and attacks me.
Remind me to thank his murderer.
(Man) True, but, still, we'd better be careful.
"Yes, as usual."
Apart from the murder in Japan,
the fact that they killed in Brian Woods means we're still in danger.
(Waltz) "You've always worried more than you should have."
Even though I was only obeying orders from him,
I still regret what I did...
on the battlefield back then, sir.
But may I know what t'empatolles?
(Flow) If you make a life of luxury.
"It's because you obeyed my orders
and you took the Silver Star from Hunter."
-Yeah, right, I'm... sorry.
- "Keep well in mind."
Let it go.
Look, my family's going back to the States...
as soon as we find tickets.
Japanese police are useless.
You better play the deuce, too.
Go home, and hurry.
- "See you in America."
-(Woman) Yes, sir.
(Woman) Mr. Murphy.
I'm the receptionist.
This envelope came for you.
We understand.
Thank you very much.
From Yokosuka Base?
But from whom?
"I know everything you did in the Middle East"?
What?
"I don't want to cause a stir,
but we need to talk
about Hunter's infraction of the rules of engagement.
I'm enclosing a ticket.
Come to Tokyo, or you will be court-martialed.
Do not tell en Waltz
and destroy this message immediately.
Ma... Mark Spencer ?!
My God my Lord!
(Masumi) It's very strange.
Despite being at a shorter distance, it turns out he missed two shots.
Yes.
Maybe he was nervous
because he was facing another sniper.
To me... what strikes me the most...
is that all the killings were committed in the Asakusa area.
That's true.
Maybe the distance, trajectory and dice...
have a special meaning.
(Mobile)
(Mobile) Come in.
What do you explain, Jodie?
Just like you told me,
we've done a clinical autopsy on Hunter's body.
"We found a large amount of painkillers in his stomach."
-Painkillers?
Wow!
- "And they were the most potent."
"And we discovered the motive
when we did an MRI of his skull."
"He had a bullet fragment lodged near the brainstem."
"And it was not a recent injury."

"It was from the shot you took in the war eight years ago, wasn't it?"
Yes.
The operation was considered successful.
But a bullet fragment was left behind.
"It was pressing on his optic nerve and other nearby nerves
and caused intense and constant migraines."
"In addition, it is likely that his eyesight was affected."
His eyesight?
So, it would have been very difficult for him to kill Seattle in Woods.
Perhaps that killer is the same one who has now acted here.
But, then, he would have had no motive to attack in Hunter.
Yes.
Yes, of course there is a motive.
Don't tell me that...
If so, it's possible that the first two murders in Japan...
have a different meaning from Hunter's murder.
(Phone)
Soc in Takagi, say?
Ah, Conan.
How nice of you to call!
Can you tell Mr. Mouri that, unfortunately,
Mr. Lee has an alibi and also...?
"Where are Mr. Waltz and Mr. Murphy?"
"Well... Mr. Waltz is still in Kyoto,
but Mr. Murphy said he's no longer in danger."
"Against the advice of the local police,
he took the Oruro Express to Tokyo at 9:00 a.m. today."
"It looks like someone sent her a ticket to go see her."
If she took it at 9 o'clock....
A ticket?
"I'm told she'll arrive at Asakusa Station around 11."
Wow.
If it's a trap set by the killer...
So, he should wait somewhere with a good view of the platform.
And he'll have his prey in the seat on the train that he has reserved for himself.
It must be near Asakusa Station.
Let's try.
Only three minutes to go.
"Hurry up. Mr. Murphy is in danger."
Conan, what do you mean?
Conan!
"The express? It's already here?"
"I remember it slows down on the bridge."
(Cars: horns)
"And that car? What's it doing, standing there in the middle? Let's see if..."
A rifle!
"Don't tell me he's planning to shoot from there."
"There's no time to turn back now."
Conan.
Don't tell me... he's planning to shoot with the train moving.
I've got to find a way to stop him from shooting.
"I must get there in time."
Come on!
EEEEE!
Look here, Mr. Murphy!
(PA: man) "We'll be arriving at Asakusa Station soon."
"Please. You must realize that you are in danger."
Eeei!
Oysters.
Eeei!
Mr. Murphy!
Conan!
Watch out!
Eh?
Ma... sume...
Eh?
What? What?
What's this?
You're already dead.
Masumi!
Hang on, Masumi!
How could this happen?
Shit... Shit...
Shit!
(Woman) Are you sure you're okay?
You didn't do anything to yourself?
But you have blood on your clothes.
No.
Conan!
It's not mine, this blood.
Can you come here a moment, please?
Inspector Megure.
- (woman) Shall we go home?
- (child) I do not like injections.
I hope it won't take long, mother.
So, if it wasn't a random murder,
it means it was aimed at Mr. Murphy from the beginning.
Thank you.
We had to confirm it.
So, we can come to the conclusion...
that the killer and Hunter were accomplices?
But, uh... What do you mean?
In the last few hours, thanks to the collaboration with the FBI,
we have discovered some new information.
Certain new information?
It turns out that 8 years ago Hunter was rendered unfit to shoot
due to a bullet fragment
that was not removed from his head when he was operated on.
Eh?
But in his diary...
Wasn't there a section where he said
that he was competing with the other shooter?
We believe that this was a lie
and that there's a very strong possibility
that he asked the other shooter to kill him.
-But how...?
-It can't be.
He knew that if the killer killed him, who was the prime suspect,
the investigation would turn into chaos.
And, thus, Mr. Murphy would let his guard down...
and he would be much easier to kill.
It is very likely that he had it planned from the beginning.
The assassin, when it comes to killing in Hunter,
"Although firing from a distance of only 150 yards,
"He missed the first shot

"Because, although he fulfilled the victim's wish,
he had a moment of doubt."
"We believe he chose a smaller caliber bullet.
"So as not to leave Hunter disfigured,
most likely as a sign of respect."
I get it.
In Hunter he didn't miss so that his eyesight would fail him,
but because he had no intention of killing the other shooter.
Surely he noticed that he hesitated and wanted to send him a message.
Yes, indeed, this may explain the mystery?
that two such expert marksmen
would miss at such close range...
and, what's more, when they were facing each other.
However, isn't it dangerous to jump to conclusions...
from conjectural evidence?
No.
Because we have actually found conclusive proof that it proves it.
Conclusive... proof?
After the first murder at Bell Tree Tower,
the videos recorded by Conan's friends were analyzed by the FBI.
We discovered that, in addition to the killer,
they recorded a person who we believe was his accomplice.
(Chiba) It's true.
There are two people.
(Camel) In Hunter, he was carrying binoculars and acting as a spotter.
(Chiba) "The 'seals' don't usually use spotters."
"Being the first assassination in Japan,
perhaps he wanted to secure the shot."
"Or maybe..."
With the constant migraines and loss of vision,
and aware that he would never be free of all that suffering,
Hunter asked someone
to execute his plans and kill him.
Wait a minute.
We still have to solve the riddle of the dice.
Yes.
This time a die and a pod also turned up
the place from where the shot was fired.
What number did it indicate, the dice?
Well... no, it wasn't one.
It was five.
What was it?
So, it wasn't a countdown?
Four, three, two... After... shouldn't it come from one?
What meaning could it have?
I was thinking that the fact that the numbers on the dice were going down each time
was a warning message from Mr. Waltz.
Apparently, then, it gives the impression...
that we had jumped to conclusions.
Aside from being one of the people
who drove his family to suicide,
what other motive could Hunter have for attacking Mr. Waltz?
Be that as it may, we have to track down Yoshino and Green.
It is more than obvious that they have some connection to this case.
"I will not let the killer get away with this."
"When she acts up again, I'll catch her."
(Male) The Asakusa neighborhood and these dice,
do they have some kind of meaning to you?
I've already told you that I don't know anything.
Neither about the Asakusa neighborhood nor the dice.
What you should do
is to issue a search and arrest warrant for Scott Green.
-But... but... but...
-I know he's the culprit.
It's just that we don't have any evidence against him, we can't do anything.
Oh, boy.
What a waste of time, my goodness!
It's no use, talking to the Japanese police.
Mr. Waltz.
Whatever happens, I ask you not to go to Tokyo at all.
As you have seen for yourself on the map,
it is more than likely that the assassin will be back in Asakusa.
And do you think I would even think of going to that damn place?
I'm anxious to get tickets
to return to the United States from Kansai airport.
Murphy has sacrificed
by making it clear to me where the killer was.
If I don't leave now while I still can, his death will have been for nothing.
This is unbelievable.
And what a lack of respect for Murphy.
"If there is someone willing to do Hunter's bidding,
it means he knows the crimes I committed 8 years ago."
"Fuck... I have to do something."
Oh.
What the fuck...?
- (cell phone)
- (man: deep voice) "Ha-ha-ha..."
-Tell me?
You... you!
Hey, Conan.
We'll stay here with Masumi, okay?
Mm-hm.
Don't worry, you can rest easy.
The doctor said her life is not in danger.
We'll let you know when she wakes up.
Okay?
Huh? (chuckles)
Yes.
I'll come tomorrow, then.
Hey, it could have been a lot worse.
If it wasn't for her, the nano could have ended very badly.
Yeah, apparently, she put her life on the line to protect him.
She saved his life, yes.
Masumi, you kept the word you gave the other day.
Don't suffer.

I promise I will always protect him.
Besides, right now,
there is no bullet that can pierce his heart.
And, evidently, neither can you.
Come to think of it,
he also said that no bullet could pierce your heart.
Eh?
I don't forgive him...
The killer.
The assassin has put Conan and Masumi in danger.
I won't forgive him.
Ran...
Shu... Brother...
Big brother...
"Shu, big brother"?
Maybe he dreams of his older brother.
I think he said he had a brother who died.
Hey, this bouquet of flowers was already here when we arrived?
That's right.
Who must have brought it?
I don't know. I don't know.
Who sent it?
But look at it, Sonoko.
It's beautiful.
Yes, I'm going to look for a vase.
Yes, I'm going to get a vase.
Shall we put it in the window?
What's wrong, Ran?
Ah... No, it's nothing.
Do we know where they are in Green and Yoshino?
There are several witnesses who claim to have seen someone
matching Green's description in the Kansai region.
We've deployed a search operation throughout the area,
concentrating on Osaka.
It is possible that he may try to assassinate en Waltz before taking the plane.
-(Black) Bad business.
- (Black) Bad business.
I find that too much of a coincidence.
What if it's all a trap to divert attention
and let Yoshino off the hook?
-Mm?
Inspector Megure.
- (mobile: vibrates)
"Tell me."
Mr. Black, I have some information for you.
What is it about?
If it's about Green, he already told me about it at Camel.
"No, it's much worse."
"Mr. Waltz has disappeared without a trace."
But... but how can this be?
It has left us at a standstill, too.
According to the Kyoto police, he has spoken to the officers,
told his wife he wouldn't be back until tomorrow,
he went out the back door and we don't know anything more.
But why?
What could be the reason?
-Something has happened.
-Yes, understood.
I will contact you so we know something else.
(Mobile: vibrates)
(Shinichi voice) Say, Jodie.
Yes, Inspector Takagi already told me,
that you've seen Green in the area.
Yes.
So?
What did you do, Mr. Waltz?
What did you do, Mr. Waltz?
But how could he do such a thing?
If we can figure out the riddle of the dice..,
"...maybe we'll find out where he's headed."
"You mean he's voluntarily heading
the place where the next murder is going to be committed?"
I don't know for sure.
But there's bound to be some relationship that we don't know about
between the shooter and Mr. Waltz.
Maybe they have some kind of special bond.
You're right.
I'll take a look at the relationship between the victims and the suspects.
I'll get back to you.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Camel.
Come on, let's go.
Yes.
I'll meet with the investigators and we'll go over all the reports.
All right. Okay. Okay.
All right. (chuckles)
"Mr. Waltz disappears without a trace...
and says he'll be back tomorrow."
This means
there's a good chance there'll be another murder
in the next 24 hours.
(Lee) I'm bringing you what you asked for.
All untraceable.
-They're already set.
-And the sights?
Very good.
I expected nothing less from you, Carlos.
You're the best, after all.
Along with Hunter, of course.
How about this time I let you take out the shooter?
Then you'll be number one for real.
Didn't you say you had one less casualty than Hunter, to war?
I can't accept the offer.
Rear Admiral Spencer's orders were only to get the gun.
It doesn't matter.
Knowing the target, you certainly don't need to help me.
Thank you for the weapon.
I have a message from Rear Admiral Spencer.
He says at no time is it intended
to investigate the origin of those killed.
To liquidate the shooter at all costs
and preserve the credibility of the military.
The origin of those killed?
What does the rear admiral know about this?
Surely... he knows everything.
What?
But how?
"There is only one person alive who knows about that operation,
and that's me."
The shooter used the rear admiral's name
to threaten Bill Murphy.
Murphy panicked.
The day before he was killed,
"...he asked for a reduction in charges."
"He sent an email to Rear Adm.

"And he confessed the plan to take the Silver Star away from Hunter,
the orders from you, everything."
What?
The crimes you committed eight years ago
are absolutely unforgivable.
But... we must prevent, at all costs,
a former American soldier from committing any more murders on foreign soil.
All right, well, if you already know everything...
Tell the rear admiral
that when this case is closed, I'd like to see him.
- (Waltz) What?
- (Lee) One other thing.
Have you discovered the meaning of the dice?
What difference does it make?
Never mind, now we know who the shooter is.
"And now we come to the news of the day."
"Today we learned that yesterday, around 11:00 a.m.,
"Bill Murphy was killed
aboard the Oruro express bound for Tokyo."
"The man is believed to have been related to Timothy Hunter,
the previous victim of the sniper."
"Also injured in this same incident was
"Accidentally a girl,
but there is no fear for her life."
"How, so it wasn't indiscriminate killings?"
- "I said so, I, remember?"
"Because of your irresponsible remarks two days ago,
panic spread through Tokyo."
"Oh, really? Really? Well, I'm sorry."
Come on.
But how can you be so alarmist?
Mr. Mouri.
It seems that Masumi has already woken up.
Now we're all going to see her at the hospital.
Ah... I'm sorry, but you'll have to go without me.
I want to stay a little longer here at the agency studying the case.
"Come on, man. You've been up all night."
If my deduction on the last die is correct,
the mystery will be solved.
Right?
Sure.
No doubt about it.
Huh?
Is that so?
For a great detective like me, one night is enough to solve it.
So, the dice, what do they mean?
Well, they're... a countdown.
The bridge was supposed to wobble.
And that's why the last die changed from the face of one to the face of five,
there's no other explanation.
What is it?
If you stop and think about it, it all fits.
Huh?
Hey.
Marrec.
Where did he go?
"It can't be, a countdown. It means something else."
"I have to get to the hospital before anyone else
to talk to Masumi about what happened yesterday."
Here.
A clear line of fire.
Yes.
I've already found it.
The perfect position to shoot toward the Chigusa.
(laughs)
Ha!
I've won the game.
"(Phone: a river man)"
You... you...
"I've already taken care of Murphy. Now it's your turn."
W... why you?
Why you?
Is it... because of the money?
How much did he pay you?
I'll double it.
-Look, we can make a deal.
- "You'll never change, Waltz. Never."
You're abroad now.
I'm sure you need money, right?
"Come tomorrow at 8 p.m. at the Chigusa restaurant."
-Yes, very good.
- "We'll talk there."
Okay.
At the Chigusa in Asakusa.
"If you confess even if you admit that you are guilty,
...I'll let you live."
"But..., if you're not on time,
you can say goodbye forever to your family."
- (phone: hang up)
- "Okay?"
Listen, listen.
Hey, but listen.
Fuck!
Helen. (phone ringing)
Sarah.
Mr. Waltz, we have a problem.
Security cameras
have detected the Scott Green at Osaka station.
It's too dangerous to go to the airport right now.
I'm sorry, but you'll have to cancel tomorrow's flight.
"Damn. So, it's a matter of kill or be killed."
Here.
The perfect position to shoot towards the Chigusa.
"He'll pick this spot. It's textbook. Every sniper's dream."
"But tonight the target won't be me. It will be him."
"It takes one sniper to defeat another."
"It all comes down to guessing intentions."
"Anticipate the opponent's movements
to gain the tactical advantage."
"Above all, a superior position guarantees victory."
And, as I have found this position,
victory is mine."
"If you challenge me, you will lose. Give my regards to Hunter in hell."
Eh?
Conan.
You came alone?
Yes.
The others said they'll come by car later.
I'll be fine.

Now we were commenting on going to the store on the first floor.
No.
I'll wait here.
Do you want to come?
Yes.
Shall we go, Sonoko?
-Okay.
See you now.
-Masumi, we'll be back in a while.
If anything happens, let us know.
We won't be long.
We'll be back in a while.
Hello, Conan.
I see you didn't get any bullets in the end.
I can't tell you how glad I am.
I haven't had a chance to thank you yet for saving me.
They don't deserve it.
I only kept the promise I had made to Ran.
What about the culprit?
We haven't been able to locate the two suspects yet.
Oh, dear.
Yesterday, during the shooting, I noticed one thing.
The sniper used a laser sight.
You don't find that strange?
Elite shooters never use laser sights.
The target realizes it's being aimed and can figure out where the shooter is.
Now I get it;
that's why Hunter preferred...
to be killed rather than kill himself.
Huh?
What's your point?
That if he had killed himself, the investigation would have been closed,
and Murphy and Waltz would have let their guard down even further.
Of course they would have.
But he decided against it.
"It was the ultimate test that the killer had to pass
to become a sniper capable of killing in cold blood."
The first test was to shoot at the MK11's maximum distance.
The second was to shoot at a moving target in the dark.
And the third was to demonstrate
the ability to shoot without emotion, whoever the target was.
In Hunter he dedicated himself to forming a perfect sniper
before he died.
So, the killer is... Ah!
Ugh... Yeah, take it easy.
Are you all right?
(Genta) Hey, we've come to see you.
-Oh, sorry.
-People, you can't call here, man.
Hey, what's this you're wearing?
Ah, Conan.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-A very cool thing, isn't it?
(Ayumi) It's something that we think will cheer up the Masumi a lot.
Isn't it?
-(Ayumi) Yes.
-(Ayumi) So much.
Wow, you.
And you did it all by yourselves?
That's so strong!
-It's our summer job.
-Yes, it is.
It's not finished yet, that's why.
But we wanted to take him because we saw him.
-Oh.
That's awesome.
-Thank you. -Yeah, it's very well done.
Yeah, it's very well done.
The buildings are not exactly the same shape,
but the dimensions and the positions are the real ones.
The Ai has been in charge of measuring everything.
And that one that I know has not collaborated at least.
It seems to me that everything is there.
So, God that it is not finished?
-We still need to paint the buildings.
-What do you need to do?
But, when we went to the Bell Tree tower,
we could only take pictures of the west side
and we don't know what color the buildings on the east side are.
Before we start painting, we'd like to go back.
So what do you say we go?
The repairs have been completed, but it's not open to the public yet.
-What do you say?
-It will be all for you.
-That's great!
-Really? -Great!
That's great!
What's up?
What's up?
Now we'll have a perfect job!
(Laughing)
Haibara, the scale of the model is correct, right?
Yes.
Come on, let's go get the cameras to take pictures.
-What's wrong, Conan?
What's wrong, Conan?
-Yes.
"I don't get it."
"I think there's something I didn't see on the map."
Hey, you've got to help paint the model, okay, Conan?
"But what did you see, now?"
But what's the matter?
Do you see something strange, Conan?
-What?
What do you mean?
-Hey, how interesting!
If you look at it from below, with the perspective,
it looks like all the buildings are the same height.
Genta, let-let me look.
Conan.
-Yes, it's true.
-Look.
Yes, it is very curious.
"Sure."
"This message is impossible to see
on a map in two dimensions."
"But it can be seen in three dimensions."
"As seen from here,
"the points from which the shooter fired the first and second shot
are at the same height."
"What about the others?"
"The third was on a barge. And the fourth, on the Komagata Bridge."
"If we look at them with that same perspective, they form....
an isosceles trapezoid."
"Wait a minute."
"If I add the Bell Tree Tower observatory, it becomes...
a pentagon."

"That the dots form a pentagon can't be a coincidence."
"There's no doubt about it. This is all deliberately thought out."
Ran, I have to go home, I've left something behind.
What's that?
Conan.
Don't you want to come to the tower?
"Be very careful, Conan."
No.
I just can't right now.
"Mr. Waltz said he'd be back in Kyoto today."
"This means that if he takes the bullet train..,
you must finish whatever you came here to do by 8:00 p.m."
(Mobile)
"I can hurry up now, then."
(Jodie) Hey, kid.
We have some new information.
The police in Osaka have just informed us that they have arrested Scott Green.
"Apparently, Hunter asked him...
to go into hiding in Osaka and to allow himself to be arrested at this hour today.
Yes.
"I thought so."
Surely he realized
that Hunter had come to Japan seeking revenge.
"And, when he saw him so determined to die,
he decided to help him fulfill his ultimate goal in life."
"Yes. Ah, another thing."
If he was a bait, the culprit?
"We've also received information from FBI headquarters."
After losing the family,
it is seen that in Hunter went to live with an Asian man.
What if this man... is Kevin Yoshino?
(Jodie) "He may be behind everything."
"By the way, Conan, where are you right now?"
All right, you got it.
Thank you, Jodie.
I'm heading to where I think the sniper will be acting.
No.
I'm not sure yet.
"Eh? Have you solved the dice riddle?"
I want to confirm, but I don't have much time.
Is there anything we can do to help you?
"If my deduction is correct,
the killer could be back at work in the Bell Tree tower."
The Bell Tree tower?
Okay, we're on our way there now.
Be very careful.
"All right."
-Yes.
-Let's go.
Let's see...
According to the model, it must be this way.
"From the top of this building, I might be able to see it."
Where is the Bell Tree tower?
"The building where Mr. Fujinami was shot from...
and the building where Mr. Yasuhara was shot from."
"As I saw on the model, they are at the same height."
"This means...
"That if we connect them with the other points from where he was shot,
it forms an isosceles trapezoid."
"And if we add the Bell Tree tower observatory..."
"There's no question. It's a pentagon."
"If I take the dice the assassin has been leaving behind
"At the points from where he has shot
and add the missing die on the Bell Tree tower..."
"Sure, that's what I meant."
"The killer's intention
was to show Mr. Waltz a star."
"The star that represents
the Silver Star that was taken from en Hunter."
"In Hunter and the murderer have been drawing this star
from the beginning
to show the Silver Star to Mr. Waltz."
And that means...
that now the murderer wants to leave the die with the face of the one
somewhere in the observatory of the tower.
The same spot from where he plans to shoot.
I have found it.
So, the killer is...
Kevin Yoshino!
Gee, where should he be aiming at?
He must have to go up to a higher building to see the star.
Which surely there... is where Mr. Waltz is.
There?
Ha-ha-ha!
Give my best to Hunter in hell.
Come on, Waltz.
Come to the window.
The moment you decipher the message will be the last moment you'll ever live.
"This time I'm going to stop you any way I can."
Ah... Today I'll finally get the ghost of Hunter off my back.
We'll pass once and for all.
What the...?
This wasn't there before.
Oh... They left it for me to see?
Vingaaaaa!
You're already dead.
What was that flash?
It came from that building.
What's that?
That little boy got in the way again!
"I'll get you for this... boy."
"I can't hide anywhere here."
"Oh, man!"
"The... the leg..."
"Ah!"
"It can't be."
"You idiot. You've ruined everything. All of it!"
Aaah!
Aaaah...
Don't tell me he's been shot.
The only place you can shoot from at that height is... from there?
(Groans in pain)
Another sniper?
But how?
The only place you can shoot from is the Sky Court Asakusa.

But that building...
If you shoot from the Bell Tree tower, you won't have any problem.
But, if Waltz discovers the star's message first,
he'll shoot me from Sky Court Asakusa.
Don't worry.
The only shooter who could shoot from this distance with accuracy
can no longer do it.
Yes, you're right.
Since you have the sight...
No, at this distance it would be impossible for me, even though I have good eyesight.
What do you mean?
What are you saying?
That there's someone who's better than you?
An FBI agent.
An elite marksman known as Silver Bullet.
But don't worry, you don't need to worry.
I've been informed that he disappeared, and it's believed that he was killed.
No... it can't be!
(Yoshino) "It's him?
(Yoshino) "It can't be. In Silver Bullet he's back?"
In Subaru?
But what's he doing here?
Ah... (Yoshino) (Yoshino) Sure.
Now I understand.
He has also deciphered the riddle of the dice.
(Mobile: vibrates)
Conan, we're in front of the Bell Tree tower and we're about to enter.
(Mobile: vibrates) Perfect.
Go up to the observatory.
You will find in Yoshino.
"Yes. Will you go up right now?"
So it's him, the assassin.
We can't.
They say it's booked today.
"They won't let us in."
Come to think of it... Hey, Jodie, Ran and the others have booked it.
Explain the situation, tell them what's going on, and get on it right away.
"Okay. I'll talk to Inspector Megure, see if he'll sort it out for us."
(Sonoko) Won't you?
Wow, it's beautiful.
I told you, the view at night was much more impressive.
- (Ayumi) Night is better than day.
- (Genta) Wow, how cool!
(Mitsuhiko) Yes, it's true.
(Mitsuhiko) What?
Shall we go to the other side to take the missing photos?
-Yes, let's go to the other side to take the missing photos.
Let's go to the other side!
- (mobile: vibrates)
(Mobile: vibrates)
"In Shinichi?"
(Subaru) No.
I haven't neutralized it.
(Yoshino: moans in pain)
"Now that I've come this far, I can't give up."
"I promised it to Hunter."
Very good.
You've improved.
Now you just need to gain experience.
I'll start with Brian Woods.
I'll start with Brian Woods.
And Waltz won't get away from me.
-Huh?
-Are you sure?
Maybe it's late, but I have to tell you...
that now I'm sorry I got you into all this.
But what do you say now, Tim?
You saved my life a lot of times in the war,
don't think I don't remember that.
And now I finally have the chance to repay that debt.
Yeah, but...
And I can't forgive Waltz and his subordinates either.
They dedicated themselves to accuse you unjustly
just because your merits eclipsed theirs,
and they took the Silver Star from you.
"And, just when we had gotten the case reopened,
in Waltz ordered Murphy to assassinate you."
Well, yes.
You're right.
If it hadn't been for you,
that you're going to suspect and you're going to compare the bullet that was removed from me
with Murphy's weapon, the truth would have remained hidden forever.
But they took the test
before I had a chance to present it.
-Kevin, I'll ask you again.
-And in the end...
For my wife and my sister,
and for the life that's been ripped out of me by Waltz and his men,
are you willing to avenge me?
Yes.
I promise.
You can take it for granted.
I promise I'll send them all to hell.
I leave it in your hands.
Now... is not the time to give up.
If I can get away from here, though, I'll be able to get out.
And Waltz will get what he deserves.
(Shinichi voice) Yes, you must leave here right now.
"But what about the murderer?"
Don't suffer.
Now the FBI agents are coming.
Understood.
The emergency stairs are this way.
Ah!
Sonoko!
-Leave your finger right now.
-What do you think you're doing?
What are you doing?
Run away, come on.
Hurry up!
-What about Ayumi?
-But...
Get out of here, kids.
It can't be.
Sonoko!
Don't move from here, you scoundrel.
Stay where you are.
I'll take him.
What?
Stay back!
FBI.
Drop your weapon.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
If you come any closer, I'm gonna kill this girl.
Flashbulbs?
That one hasn't surrendered yet.
Don't let him escape.
Make him come this way.
No mail.
What do you want?
That I kill the girl?
(Genta) Listen...
(Genta) -Yes.
-We must save the Ayumi.
Don't do foolish things, think that armed man.

"We have to do something."
Sonoko, wake up.
Sonoko.
"Shinichi... What should I do? Help me."
Oysters.
I can't do anything from here.
Stop it.
Get a move on or I swear I'll kill the girl.
"In a hostage situation,
the target must be neutralized with one shot."
"But, to get it right..."
If you try to instantly kill a person
without allowing the slightest reaction, you have to shoot at one point.
-Exactly.
-The brainstem.
"I have no choice."
"Shit, I have no choice."
Jodie.
-Aaaah!
-Yoshino!
"You're already mine!"
No way.
What's the matter?
-Has the power gone out?
-I can't see anything.
Quiet, don't make any noise.
Stand back.
Oh, man.
He turned off the lights.
Now the Subaru won't see it.
Now I understand.
He wants to run away taking advantage of the fact that they have been left in the dark.
What now?
Damn.
In the end he'll run away with the Ayumi.
It can't be... Night vision goggles?
Run away from here, Jodie!
(Yoshino!
Turn yourself in right now.
Camel!
Answer me, Camel.
Oh, man.
He'll end up killing everyone in the end.
"If I could find a way to turn the lights back on,
I could shoot him in Subaru."
"But the way my leg is..."
"What can I do, so they can see in Yoshino? Just a moment."
"I think the night vision goggles are an older model."
"That way, I would only need to focus a light on the Bell Tree tower."
"I know."
"From this height... will I have enough?"
"Yes. There's no choice."
(Mobile: vibrates)
On Conan.
(Conan voice) "Enlluerna'l."
Di
"Focus-a light in the eyes."
Wear night vision goggles.
So the enlluernaràs.
But how do I know where he is?
Ah...
Okay.
"Exactly. Make him serve."
"He will soon pass near you. Listen to me well."
"Stand still for 30 seconds, so he doesn't get suspicious. I'm hanging up."
What?
Did you feel it?
Do you have to stay still for 30 seconds.
Yes.
"I'll get another chance soon. That nano must have a plan."
Please, it has to work.
-Yes. -Yes.
-Are you ready?
Go ahead.
(Pin: high-pitched sound, "the mosquito.")
(Pin: high-pitched sound, "the mosquito") -Wait a minute.
-Where is it?
Where's the noise coming from?
(high-pitched sound)
- (Genta) Come on.
- (Ai) It's over there.
(Mitsuhiko) Let's go.
(Mitsuhiko) -Now.
-(Ai) Huh?
-Got it.
-She's got it.
Ayumi, over here!
(Yoshino: moans in pain)
(Yoshino: moans in pain) Ah!
(Yoshino: moans in pain) Ah!
Coi of kiddies!
Kids!
Mail!
Don't do it, Ran!
(Mitsuhiko) Ran!
Ran!
(Mitsuhiko) Shit.
There's no time to think about it.
"What should I do, Shinichi?"
"You wanted to play the hero and now I'll take you hostage."
It's now or never.
I have to do it.
Wait for me.
Raaan!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Vingaaaaaa!
Let's go.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
But...
-M'enlluerna.
-What's wrong?
Ah!
Aaaaaaaah!
Ran!
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
This is Sonoko.
Iaaaaaaaah!
This is Ayumi.
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
And this one, for Masumi!
Yes, we just stopped at Yoshino.
-That was great, Ran.
-Lively, lively.
Ran!
You're the best!
Sonoko!
Are... are you sure you're okay, Sonoko?
Yes.
I'm not sure what happened to me, but I'm fine.
By the way, how come we're in the dark?
Is the power out?
You're a case, Sonoko.
Boy, how she's a real handful...
(Subaru) has neutralized the target.
There's no more danger.
(Black) "Yes, I just heard from Jodie just now."
"Congratulations. We'll be in touch."
Understood.

Yes.
Tomorrow you will be discharged, right?
Thank you so much for taking care of me all these days.
You don't deserve it.
I'd miss.
Ah.
By the way, I saw Waltz on TV.
It looks like these murders have brought to light
all the crimes he had committed years ago,
and he's going to pay for everything he did.
Yes, he will spend the rest of his life in prison.
The people responsible for the murders were victims of Waltz
and that is precisely why they wanted revenge.
By the way, Ran,
you were very brave to take on a man armed with a machine gun.
It just got me a little out of control.....
I still can't believe you got away with only a scratch.
If a bullet had gone through your heart, I don't know what I would have done, me.
Well, you know I usually have good luck.
(Masumi) That's why you don't have to suffer.
In fact, you, the only one who can pierce the heart...
we already know who it is.
Ah, you're right.
Your esteemed Shinichi.
"At least, for the time being."
Oh, shut up, Sonoko.
Aaa... aaa... aaa... atxim!
Are you all right, Conan?
It won't do you any good to play sick.
Since you haven't helped us at all, it's your turn to paint from now on.
-Yes.
-Come on, let's go to the pool.
I'm sorry, Ay, but thank you very much for keeping watch on Conan.
You're welcome.
And you, get back to work.
What a nerve!
But how can I paint it all by myself?
