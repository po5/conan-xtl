(Birds: chirping)
(Genta) Look...
It's done!
-Oh, you, it's very pretty.
How nice!
The drawing is the same as our Junior Detective League pin.
Eh? (Genta)
Just a moment.
Stars must have a tail, so they can fly.
If they don't, all they do is spin around in circles all the time.
Oh, easy, easy, easy.
I've made two, I just have to put them in.
And I've also written a message.
See.
(Ai) "If you need someone to investigate a case you want to solve,
please contact the Junior Detective League
at Teitan Elementary School."
Oh.
Alza!
-Isn't that a very good idea?
-We won't stop getting cases.
And in the other queue, what did you put?
It's just that this one was going to be developed when we went there.
"If you want to have any ingenious and useful inventions made...
contact Hiroshi Agasa, at Beika, district 2, block 22".
And on the other side
he even put the address of his website.
I guess that's good for you, isn't it?
I have helped you to make the kite and I find that I am entitled to it.

"The case of the star contest on the Teimuzu River (part one)."
-What do you mean?
-But you will see, the messages?
That the tails of the stars will be making waves continuously with the wind
and I don't think anyone can read what it says.
We have to win one of the prizes
of the kite flying contest on the shore of the Teimuzu.
-And what categories are there?
-Are there prizes?
There are two.
One is for the star that flies the highest.
And the other, for the one with the prettiest decoration...
of all the entries.
The ones that end up winning will be hung in the town hall for a month.
So it would be a very effective method of advertising.
-That's great!
-Huh?
Well, we have to win no matter what.
Can you feel me, Ai?
(Humming) Mm, mm, mm, mm-mm...
Eh? (hums)
I'm sorry.
You were saying?
-Yes.
-Well, we've got to win no matter what.
Oh. (Laughs)
The stars!
-So much!
-Oh! -Oh!
How beautiful!
We have to go to all of them.
Eh?
Does Ai always listen to this music?
He always hums this tune and looks like he's having a good time.
I'd like to know what is this song that makes him feel like this.
Because I'm really intrigued, I can't get it out of my head.
You mean it's not a song from an anime?
Mm... Well, it sounds like a Yoko Okino song to me.
Strange, it sounds like classical music to me.
And you haven't thought to ask her?
I did ask her, of course!
But she told me it was a secret and that she wasn't going to tell me.
Ha-ha!
Don't give it so much thought.
I'm sure it's just some silly song that's in fashion right now.
Eh?
Well, I apologize...
...for listening to silly songs.
Ah, you were here.
Why don't you solve their doubts
and explain to them what song it is?
I'm curious to know, too.
And a black lamb!
I'll never tell them.
Wait, wait, Haibara!
What?!
If you want to know so badly,
why don't you figure it out, "great detective"?
Hm.
Eh?
Huh? (Chuckles)
All right, then.
Well, we figured it out.
Hey, hey, hey!
It won't be long before we have to fly the kite ourselves!
One thing:

Do you know what is that song that Ay listens to so much lately?
Eh?
It occurs to me that it might be
the theme song of the beginning of some series he's watching.
Ah, well... he hasn't seen many, of series, I don't think so.
But he has watched many times the program dedicated to Higo
when he played with Big Osaka.
And above all, the report that recalled that season...
that the soccer team that he captained as a teenager
came second in the high school league.
It is clear that in Higo he is very fond of his old team...
and, when he has some time, he goes to see them when they play.
But, apparently, now it's his old high school's baseball team?
which is more popular and has a bigger following.
(Think) "In Higo went to a high school in Kanto, right?"
Hush, now that I remember, a teammate, in Sanada,
talked about his friend Higo for quite a while,
in this special program,
and revealed some of his more unusual hobbies.
-Huh?
-That's enough of that color!
I'm really sorry, but now I'm going to have to apply a punishment.
"Shit!"
You mean the song doesn't have something to do with Fig.
She's a big fan of his.
Too bad!
En Higo doesn't comment anything about her favorite song on her website.
Maybe she'll end up putting it on, but for now it's not there.
Well, for now, it's impossible to know.
No.
There is... a way.
Eh?
We'll record the Ai on the sly when he sings it.
-We'll... we'll record it on the sly? -Yeah.
-Hmm? -Hmm?
First of all, I activate the mobile application...
which will act as a voice recorder
and then I make the screen go black.
This way, even if I saw it,
she would not be able to guess that we are recording her while she is singing.
The Ayumi can put the cell phone in her pocket
and approach the Ay slyly, as if nothing is happening.
Meanwhile, in Mitsuhiko, in Genta and I will go fly the kite.
And the moment the Ai lets his guard down....
and starts humming the song...
we'll record it and, with a tune identification program..,
we'll know it right away.
Wow, Conan.
There's him in it!
You've got a scary look on your face.
This is not detective work.
That's right.
It's more like a crime.
(Man) The next contestants are
the Junior Detective League and Café Renno.
Junior Detective League and Café Renno,
step right up here and get ready to fly the kite, please.
How nice, finally!
-Hey.
We're up, guys.
Yeah, we're on.
Well, we're counting on you, Ayumi.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, Conan, what do you think here?
Go a little further back.
Because the star catches the wind ahead.
(Mitsuhiko) OK.
Be careful not to step on the star's tails.
-To win, go!
-It's finally our turn.
He-he!
(Humming) Mm-mm... mm, mm, mm, mm... mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm...
Eh?
You're curious to know what song it is, too?
Yes, I am.
Well, if you promise not to tell Conan, I'll tell you the title.
This song is called...
No, shut up.
No, I don't want you to tell me!
I'm sure it's not right to record a person on the sly when he sings.
-Secretly recorded?
-It's not right.
Hm.
-Yes.
-Don't tell me that...
Conan told me to record you with my cell phone while humming.
(Thinking) "What does he think he's up to, this guy?"
Eh?
Ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha!
Very good.
Now!
-We're out.
-Oh!
-And it flies way up, doesn't it?
How cool!
Huh?
Wow!
-It's broken.
-Oysters, you!
The tail!
Ah.
Oysters!
Ah-ah-ah...
Ah, ah... I can't.
Oh, boy.
-Oh, it's coming down!
-Aah! -Aah!
Aah!
Aaah!
-Our star!
-Yes, Takami, I'll be back before dinner. -Yeah, Takami, I'll be back before dinner.
Eh?
-Hey, watch out!
-What bad luck!
Geez! (Takami) "Hey, what's up?
(Takami) "Hey, what's up? Is anyone with you?"
No, some kids.
A bunch of little kids whose star has fallen.
"(Takami) I told you I was going to participate in a kite flying contest, didn't I?"
(Takami) And how do I know?
What confidence is deserved by a man who cheats on his wife
and sneaks out with another woman?
Can you explain to me how I can trust you?
Come on, what other woman do you want me to go out with?
It's your imagination.

"And you still have the bar to raise your voice at me!"
You wouldn't get out even if you wanted to.
What?
My little sister slit her wrists in the bathtub last night.
Poor girl, she's unconscious, in critical condition,
in a hospital bed, right now.
And all because she believed you when you told her that you loved her
and promised her you'd leave your wife and marry her.
She's still my little sister and I love her.
Come find her when the contest is over.
Or we could also settle things right now, if you wanted to.
Renno!
What are you doing?
You're not doing well here.
You have to go further back, further.
Ah, sorry.
Boy, you need to go with four eyes.
Your partner, Ken Yatsukoshi,
is also very much in love with my sister.
(Speaker: man) Fly the kite as high as you can!
Each team has a time of 15 minutes.
Ayumi, the organizers say they haven't received any cell phones.
Are you sure, that you dropped it here, in front of these portable toilets?
-No, it was here.
-Couldn't it have been somewhere else?
I had the feeling that something fell out of my pocket when I got out of the washroom
when I got out of the washroom and picked up the handkerchief.
And how come you didn't check if there was anything on the ground, then?
Because I heard that they were saying over the loudspeakers
that it was his turn to fly the kite in the Junior Detective League.
Oh, right.
And did you know if there was anyone around at the time?
Ah...
Ah.
There was someone who stumbled behind me.
What happened is that I didn't see his face.
Ah, well, maybe this person thought...
that he had dropped his cell phone when he tripped
and picked it up from the ground thinking it was his.
And if he tripped, he was probably in a hurry.
It is the safest.
Well, maybe this person had to fly the kite at the same time as the
at the same time as the Junior Detective League.
Yes.
Well, look, you know what?
When the guys get back,
we can try to do a trick on your cell phone and see what happens.
There's nothing to do.
The bamboo rod in the frame is broken.
So it won't fly even if we glue it back together.
-Maybe it's just...
-Wow.
What is it?
Maybe the gods have punished us, Conan.
(Man) Hey.
What are you doing?
Punished?
For wanting to record the Ai?
No.
Don't go back any further.
What?
What?
Ah!
A-ah!
Eh?
Aaaaah!
It's that man from before.
He fell into the river.
Okay, okay, okay.
Mitsuhiko, an ambulance!
AHG!
AHG!
It's bad.
He can't swim.
Someone jump in the water to save him.
AHG!
AHG!
(Man) Hey.
Hang in there.
Now we pull him out.
(Thinking) "Was it an accident?"
(Takami) "Ryota? What's wrong?"
"Ryota? Ryota. Answer me. Ryota."
"No, and now!"
"It wasn't an accident."
He has swallowed quite a lot of water, is unconscious and in serious condition.
I'm going.
What?
Who's the man who fell into the river?
He's the owner of a coffee shop in the neighborhood.
Ryota Renno, married, 39 years old.
According to eyewitness accounts,
Mr. Renno was holding the star like this
while he was walking backwards.
And, unfortunately, he had the misfortune...
to end up between these two poles that had no rope,
slipped on the grass on the bank and finally fell into the river.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I can see that.
The ends of the ropes are very old and worn,
it's a clear sign that they were broken a long time ago
and that they were left like that, unfixed.
It looks like an accident,
so we can leave it to the local police.
I don't think it was an accident.
Yes, sir.
Uh...
Ho-hello, Conan.
Takagi, do me a favor?
You say it wasn't an accident?
Could you try putting the ends of the top ropes together, see what?
Huh?
Yeah, okay.
You see?
You can't make them touch.
Huh? (Laughs)
What's the matter?
Well, no.
But if it's been exposed for a long time to wind and rain,
it's normal for it to have shortened.
What's wrong?
Yes, but...
On the other hand, take a good look at the bottom rope:
it is long enough to be able to join well.

And although it has a piece left over and, if the lliguéssim as it should be,
it would be hanging and would not do service.
You are right.
And, besides, there is another thing:
this bass string has changed color on the top,
but the bottom part has not faded.
Why is that?
Maybe they have used the stick string from one of the ends of the closed one.
That they have used the rope from the pole at one end of the closed end?
The rope from one end of the enclosure
would have been exposed to the weather,
to the rain above all, and it would have been very unraveled.
And then they untied it, matched the length...
and reattached it here.
They've gone to the trouble of doing all of this
because it looked like the rope had been cut a long time ago.
And the rope isn't discolored on one side
because it used to go around a stick
and on the side that touched the wood it was protected.
I-I get it now.
Mitsuhiko and Genta have gone to look at it
and they will be able to confirm right away if it went as I told them.
Hm?
Yes it is as you said, Conan.
(gasps)
The rope of the penultimate pole of that band has been cut recently.
And it's not attached to the last pole.
"There is no string between the second to last pole and the last pole,
there is an empty space with no rope."
(gasps)
(Genta) Hey!
The last pole at the other end doesn't have any rope attached to it either,
as you were saying, Conan.
See?
Eh? (Genta gasps)
But... why... why the hell...
...have you been doing all this with the ropes?
Hm?
Hm?
And how am I supposed to know?
I'm a 7 year old kid!
Evidently.
You're right.
You are a child, though.
Hm?
But maybe...
Maybe it was to make the man who had approached the river end up falling in
and suffocate.
But this can't be.
That man has approached by himself, in the river, and slipped.
But he has been walking backwards for a long time, concentrated,
holding the star with his hands like this, right?
At times like this, we don't pay attention to what's behind us.
No.
We know that there is the rope that will stop us and we are not going to fall into the river.
Yes, you are absolutely right, Conan.
We are much more aware of not stepping on the tails of the star.
Therefore, if they could stop the man between the poles....
which didn't have any protective rope,
it was not difficult to make him fall into the river.
Yes, you are right.
This means... that the culprit is...
The suspects are...
The man in the same team as the one who almost drowned in the river.
Eh?
That fat man.
If they were on the same team,
he would have warned his partner that he was getting too close to the river, right?
You're not doing well here.
You need to go further back, further.
Yes.
And also the burly man who is now chatting with the fat man.
We don't know who he is.
We know that he had also said something to the victim before he fell.
Come find out, when the contest is over.
Or we could also settle things right now, if you'd like.
Takagi.
Investigate well who these two are.
There is another one.
The third suspect we should include in the list
would be the person she was talking to on her cell phone.
Before he fell into the river, he was talking to someone on the phone.
-Huh?
-No.
Don't go any further back.
What?
And you know, who was he talking to?
What?
His cell phone fell on the floor.
(Takami) "Ryota? What's wrong?"
"Ryota? Ryota. Answer me. Ryota."
And I heard a voice calling him.
I thought it might be his wife.
Takagi, call his house immediately.
It is not necessary.
I picked up the cell phone myself and talked to this woman,
who turned out to be his wife,
and told her that her husband had fallen into the river.
"He came running over here. He left with the ambulance with him."
In Takagi he will bring her back.
We have to question him.
She's a prime suspect in an attempted murder.
Yes, sir.
"There is no doubt."
"It's a well-planned premeditated assassination attempt."
"It is very likely that the culprit is one of those we have mentioned."
But how did he do it,
to carry out his plan in an esplanade full of people

that he was participating in a kite flying contest?
I don't understand... how he could have done it.

That I made him go in Renno to the part of the fence where there was no rope
so that he fell into the river?
The gods have punished him for what he did by making him fall into this river.
Let's see, can you explain to me why I am a suspect, me?
The culprit must be a different person from these three suspects.
Yes there must be some system, some way to....
I don't think there is.
