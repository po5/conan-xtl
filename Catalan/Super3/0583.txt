Aaaaah...
Ah... Aaaaah...
-Good morning, inspector. -Ah...
A-that, good morning.
(Sato) Where are you going, like this?
Haven't you looked in the mirror?
Don't make that face, you're a police inspector!
And what face do you want me to make?
I spent a sleepless night doing a surveillance.
Well.
You could at least fix your tie knot.
That's not necessary.
Now that I've got the report done,
I'm going to go home and crawl right into bed.
-Quiet!
Don't be silly. -Ah... Okay, okay, okay.
Ah!
De... leave it, please.
Seriously, I'll do it.
Thanks anyway.
I'd better go.
What's that?
Wait a minute, Takagi.
Wait a minute!
Where are you going?
He's been on a roll lately, that bastard Takagi.
I can tell this pair go out to eat together day in and day out.
I have unconfirmed information that they've been kissing.
-What are you talking about? -Without asking my permission?!
Wait a minute... It's not confirmed, I've already told you.
Then go confirm it right now!
You're not a cop?
-Hello, hello! -What do you know Shiratori?
Do I?
What's between Takagi and Sato?
Aren't you, the top man in charge...
of the Miwako Sato's line of defense?
Ah!
In Takagi and Sato?
In the end, what had to happen has happened.
-They look very much in love, don't they? -What?
Besides, I want to stop being...
the one in charge of their line of defense.
-We're looking for it in someone else.
En-Eh, Shiratori!
How come it's so quiet, this one?
From the information I have,
it looks like he has a girlfriend, Inspector Shiratori.
Really?
And they say she looks just like Inspector Sato.
And... where did she get it from, this wench?

Summer time gone Anata ga koishii.

"Regretting the passage of time takes us away from the mystery."
"Ms. Kobayashi unwittingly becomes the key witness
the key witness to a murder."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"Miss Kobayashi's love."
(Woman) Ah..., yes.
Understood.
You don't want me to go out alone at night, do you?
No.
Whenever you can, try to avoid leaving the house...
after 9:00 at night.
There's been a rash of muggings in your neighborhood lately...
in the form of muggings.
Ah!
They talked about it on the morning news.
They said the robber was a woman.
Well, yes, it was.
But... I don't understand.
How come every time you call me to warn me?
Woman, because I care about you.
-Does it bother you that I call you? -No, and now!
On the contrary, it's good for me that you call me.
"I'm glad."
"Well, that's just it. Please be very careful."
Yes, of course.
Thank you very much for calling me.
Miss.
I've been trying to tell you for a while now that we've already cleaned the rabbit's cage.
Can't I sit down? Ah, yes!
It's true, it was you...
the ones in charge of the summer cleaning.
Thank you, guys!
Isn't it true that it was Inspector Shiratori, who called you now?
What was it?
Ah... Yes.
And how... do you know?
-It's very noticeable, Miss. -Miss, you've turned red!
No... it's not true!
And now, what things to say...
And then?
Has he already told you that he's in love with you, the inspector?
What?!
Wh-wh-why do you say so?
(He thinks) "I see he hasn't yet."
Surely that doesn't ring a bell, Inspector?
What should he look like?
From having seen it once many years ago, when you were little.
Now that you say it, yes, he's right.
When I met him, he gave me the impression that he had seen it before.
Somehow it was as if the trunk of memories had been opened.

-I'll give you a hint: the bookstore! -The bookstore?
Xxxt! Eh?
(Flux) Inspector Shiratori asked us
not to tell Ms. Kobayashi
that he was the one who protected her from thieves in a bookstore.
He wants to explain it to her himself! Oh, that's right.
Of course he does.
He must be waiting
for the right moment to touch his heartstrings with the story.
-Well, he can take it! -Oh, man!
Was that today?
"The 30 mistakes of the mysterious man with 30 faces".
Was it today that it was coming out? Yes.
That's great!
I haven't reserved it, so I'll have to buy it today.
Well, if I were you, I wouldn't take too long.
At your usual bookstore they told me
that they would close earlier today to go see the fireworks castle.
Really?
So, I'd better run.
By the way, will you go too, to see the fireworks?
Of course we are!
We have arranged to meet at half past five at Conan's house to go together.
Oh, really?
How's that?
I thought that Dr. Agasa would accompany you from home.
The doctor can't come because he has to help a friend to move.
And who's accompanying him, Mr. Mouri?
He's meeting some neighbors to have a drink and watch the fireworks,
and the Ran is the karate summer camp.
So we're going alone.
Why should we?
Yes, man!
No way!
(Genta) If it takes...
-If we don't hurry, we'll miss the fires.
Come on, he must be about to arrive.
Miss!
Miss Kobayashi!
Hurry, hurry!
-You're late! -Sorry, guys.
-I've been dawdling at the bookstore. (firecrackers: whistle)
(All) Oooooh!
Oh, it's already started.
Gee, they've already set off the first firecrackers!
You see?
If we had gone alone, we would have arrived on time.
No way!
Children can't go out alone at night.
We have to be very careful,
there have been several robberies in the neighborhood lately.
I suppose Inspector Shiratori told you that.
Well... yes.
(Thinking) "Inspector Shiratori has a good hang-up."
Well, I guess he must not trust me, and that's why he called me to warn me,
that's why he called to warn me.
Well, that's it.
If he feels like leaving you alone, then he's in love with you.
What?
You... you think?
Well, maybe he is.
-Of course, I'm sure he is. (firecrackers: whistling)
(People, from afar: exclamations of admiration)
Yeah, but anyway...
Even if it were true, I can't imagine him as a boyfriend.
After all, he's a cop.
I can already see myself suffering like a donkey when he goes out to chase criminals.
But, on the bright side, maybe he would tell me funny anecdotes about the cases.
You know how much I love mysteries... don't you?
But there's nobody there!
(Child) Mother, I want to climb the trestles.
(Firecrackers: roar)
(People: rumor of voices)
(People: rumor of voices) Alza!
What a pile of stops!
-I want to eat cotton candy! -I want to catch minnows!
The lady is not here.
No?
But I told her we'd take the shortcut....
(Firecrackers: whistles and pops)
(People) Oooh!
These children!
Where have they gone?
Edogawa!
(Thinking) "No, they sure aren't."
- (truck: starts up) - "Where should they be?"
"Shut up! I'll send a message to Inspector Shiratori."
"Inspector, I have a case.
5 children have disappeared without a trace!"
"How exciting!"
(woman) Listen to me and woman-me at once!
- (Man) Don't touch me! - (woman) I'll kill you!
- (man) Don't come near me! - (woman) Let go of me!
"It looks like they're fighting."
- (couple: shouting) - (firecrackers: roar)
"And if it was... the mugger?"
"I could call the inspector."
"But...if it turns out I'm wrong, I'll have upset him for nothing."
"If only Conan and the kids were here..."
"Gee! I hope nothing happened to them."
"Be that as it may, I have to make sure."
(Firecrackers: popping)
"Wow!"
"Who was that, this one running?"
Oh.
Oh!
Oysters!
- (people: exclamations of admiration) - (firecrackers: popping)
She's late, Miss Kobayashi.
Oh, so long.
Guys, listen to me.
What?

I'm going to look for Miss Kobayashi.
Stick around, okay? Of course I will!
Excuse me... Hello...
Are you alright, sir?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(thinks) "Oh! Miss!"
Oh my God!
Why did you...?
Miss!
Don't move!
I don't want him to make you... Oh!
Not anymore.
Senyoreta.
You've seen her, haven't you?
She just ran away.
The person who killed... this man.
- (Ayumi) Calm down, senyoreta. Huh?
There's no need to be so tense.
It's-it's just that... it's never been here before.
You've only been asked to come to the police station
to testify as a witness to a murder.
Don't be nervous,
no one will question you to force you to confess to any crime.
That's true.
I, on the other hand, have already been here so many times...
I've tried every dish on the restaurant's menu.
Come on!
(Thinking) "God-goddamn, I'm stuffed to the gills!"
(Woman) Miwako!
Hey!
You're taking the children to the interrogation?
Geez, girl!
Where are you going, looking like this?
How come you're wearing glasses?
Is it a new look?
-No, and now! - "No, and now!"
Don't be silly, we know each other.
Ow, wake up!
-Oh! -What?
What are you doing?
You look terrible, girl.
-But... who do you think you are? -Who do you think you are? -You're talking to me about you?
You mean you don't have a fever, Miwako? You're wrong, Yumi.
What's wrong? This lady...
(Chiba) Hey!
Hello, Sato! What?
You've come with the kids?
(Chiba) Ah.
Oh, my...
I thought a schoolteacher was coming.
It turns out that this lady...
...is the first B tutor at Teitan Elementary School...
...and a very important witness in the case,
Miss Sumiko Kobayashi.
Please don't confuse her.
What?!
Join me in the back room and tell me what happened yesterday.
Yes, of course.
I can't believe it!
I guess you must have a coworker that looks a lot like me.
Not that much, I think they just have a slight withdrawal.
Well, maybe they do look a lot alike.
By the way, are you taking me to the interrogation room?
-No, it's just a simple meeting room. Ah.
Wow.
-No, I was just curious.
This must be the girl who stole Inspector Shiratori's heart.
I'd heard she looked like Inspector Sato,
but I didn't know they were like two peas in a pod.
I was surprised too, the first time I saw her.
She's very strong, isn't she?
Yes, but the way she talks and acts are nothing alike,
so...
Who is this person who has nothing to do with me?
No, no one...
Miwako, what I wanted to say in Takagi...
is that you are more masculine and bestiot.
What?!
What does it mean?
It doesn't matter.
We have arrested 3 suspects of yesterday's murder,
it's better that we're going to interrogate them.
Yes... yes!
This pair have picked up speed,
since Inspector Shiratori, who was their main obstacle,
has dropped out of the race.
You know what?
The truth is...
I'll miss poking Shiratori and embarrassing them.
(Shiratori) It's a pity.
(Shiratori) Sure.
Well, let me get this straight.
He was going to see the fireworks castle with the children
and lost them by accident.
"While he was looking for them, he felt two people arguing."
"He went into the alley to try to find out what was going on...
and the culprit ran past him."
Then he found the victim's body, shrieked....
and Conan, who heard her, arrived quickly at the scene of the crime,
quickly arrived at the scene of the crime.
-That's it, isn't it? -Yes, that's it.
You'll have to confirm it again.
The corpse you found in the street...
was Akira Sumida's, wasn't it?
Yes... Yes.
I think it was.
Understood.
And do you remember more or less what it was about,
the argument between the victim and the person who killed her?
It's just that, look, I know they were arguing,
but the noise of the firecrackers didn't let me get a good sense of what they were saying.
But... there was a moment when the murderer was calling,
and I remember her voice.
I felt her when there were no firecrackers.
I remember her saying, "Listen to me and woman-me at once! I'm going to kill you!"
Okay.
That's why I thought she was the woman who's been hanging around the neighborhood lately.

and who has already robbed several people.
No, the mugger was arrested that same night.
But... how do you know, that the culprit was a woman?
You say that because you heard her scream?
And also because of the silhouette I saw running.
"You could see the shape of her breasts."
"Also, her hair was long, and she wore it up,
and she was wearing a cap."
-I'm sure it was a WOMAN. What was her face like?
You didn't get to see her face, did you?
No.
It was too dark.
But the culprit...
maybe you'll remember Miss Kobayashi.
What's that?
What makes you think?
I say that because I wasn't the only one who arrived in the current
right after hearing her scream.
What?
What are you saying now?
Don't tell me that...
Right, miss? Yes.
It seemed to me that the culprit was watching me,
although it was quite far away.
But when Conan arrived, he was already gone.
Well, he's in danger.
The murderer could attack her to prevent her from identifying him.
-What? - Don't be afraid.
We of the Detective League will sleep at home...
...and we won't allow anyone to touch a single hair on her head.
How... how beautiful!
-No.
There won't be, guys. (at once) Why not?
Because I, in Ninzaburo Shiratori,
will protect her... with my life, if necessary.
Ah... Ouch...
Ahem...
I'm very sorry to cut you off,
but perhaps you'd be interested to hear the version
those of us who arrived at the crime scene after Conan.
Yes.
Let's see, guys.
I have to ask you if you saw any suspicious people running away.
We didn't see anybody.
This seems exactly like a routine question.
No, and now.
You didn't see anything, Dr. Agasa?
It was with you, wasn't it?
He didn't come because he had to help a friend of his with a move.
A move?
Oh!
By the way, before the discussion started,
I saw a moving truck stopped at the end of the alley.
-What?
Are you sure? -Absolutely.
I didn't see what model it was so that I'd be covered by the buildings,
but it had a fat zero and a fat new one painted on the side.
How do you know it was a moving truck,
if you only saw two numbers?
Moving trucks and movers are the only ones that have the phone number
that have the phone number painted on the side.
If the truck sat for a while at the entrance to the alley,
maybe someone else sensed the content of the argument.
We'll look into it right away.
Excuse us.
We can go home, can't we?
Yes, you can leave whenever you want,
but Miss Kobayashi should stay a little longer.
Me?
We've recently arrested 3 suspects related to the victim
who have no alibi for the time of the crime.
As you felt the culprit's voice,
maybe you'll be able to identify him.
Oh, right.
Yes, but, before that..., what can I...?
Yes, go ahead.
Go ahead.
Would you like me to walk you to the bathroom?
I know the way by heart.
Oh, uh... Yes, thank you.
I'm coming with you too.
-Excuse me, I'll be right back. -Don't hurry.
Man!
When a woman goes to the toilet,
it's not elegant to tell her not to hurry.
What do you mean?
Put like that, it seems that the lady has to go to the...
No, it's not that!
I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable!
By the way.
Eh?
What did she do for a living, this woman?
The one who was murdered, I mean.
Well... she had a lending house.
-W... wait a minute, what did you say?! - Like, she was a woman?
Yes.
Women's shirts have the buttons on the left.
As for the first name, Akira, it can be either a woman's or a man's.
You're right.
It's clear that she was often mistaken for a man and it made her very angry.
On the other hand, she had quite a few enemies,
because she wasn't very legal in business.
I'm here.
Ui.
They haven't come out yet.
(thinks) "Toilets are the same everywhere,
even in police stations."
"What nonsense."
"What a donkey."
(Sato) Why would it be better if we didn't know each other?
-(Sato) "Not at all, woman, it's just that I don't know." (Sato) This is no good as an answer.
(Thinking) "Wow! It was true, he looks a lot like me!"
"I think they called him Miwako Sato."
"I'm so jealous! I would have liked to be a police inspector!"

(Man) casum!
Takagi is already fooling around again.
-With our Miwako! -We can't tolerate it!
But who does he think he is?
-Since Shiratori withdrew from the race, he's gone straight to the point.
-What? -Yes.
After all, in Shiratori he was...
the top man in charge of defending the Miwako Sato.
But in the end it worked out well for him, the move.
Yes.
I didn't imagine it was so much like the Sato.
-And you mean there's no other one who looks so much like her?
-Like the teacher, no other. -What a pity.
Miss Kobayashi!
We've finished.
What's wrong, Miss?
Miss?

It seems to me that she doesn't like me anymore, she must be tired of me.
She thinks she's a replacement for the inspector.... Sato.
She's accusing me of being a liar, maybe?
- (Shiratori) It's a lie. - What?
The truth is... I came to see her.
