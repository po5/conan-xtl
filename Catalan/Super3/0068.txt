DETECTIVE CONAN
The Mystery of the Night Baron's Murder, Part One
(Thinks) "Which one do you think."
"How did it occur to us to come here in this hot weather?"
"And all because of the professor's call."
Where?
To Izu?
Three days and two nights in a hotel.
All expenses paid!
Gee, that would be great!
Let's go! Yes!
-It's free!
"Aaaaaaaa... I don't know what I'm doing here!"
"I should be looking for the men in black who made me shrink."
"What a waste of time."
"Of course, on the face of it... it's not so bad."
What's the matter with you, Conan?
Come on, let's go.
Let's go for a swim!
Come on, let's go!
"Let's make the most of it."
They have only paid half of the stay?
-Yes, Dr. Agasa's group of 3. It's absurd!
Check again!
What's wrong, father?
Eh!
They only paid half of the hotel bill!
Anyway, pay-you, the other half!
It's just that I don't have that much money now.
Professor Agasa told me...
Are you sure, it's free?
For Shinichi stay is free!
What do you want to say?
Listen to me well.
With work colleagues we surfed the Internet a lot.
One colleague found an advertisement for a trip, on the computer.
And he asked me if I felt like signing up.
It's called "Izu's Mystery Trip"!
The mystery trip?
He, his granddaughter and I signed up
and we were accepted.
But his granddaughter has caught a cold,
so I'm offering you our places, Sinichi.
This trip will involve 6 groups, 10 people.
The room and board will be half price.
The promoter of the trip pretends to be from the excursion.
Whoever discovers his identity will get free stay,
and the winner will get a diskette with a special program.
And how the hell will we know who the promoter is?
The travelers will have a list
with the name and room number of the other participants.
The promoter will disguise himself as a specific character
and will pose mysteries to you.
A character?
A character from novels, that you know perfectly well.
The character is... (thinks) "The Night Baron."
It's you, isn't it?
3 seconds and 4 tenths.
That's how long it took you to answer.
Thank you very much.
My name is Shiro Konno, sir, and I'm in room 2002.
Nice to meet you.
There would be no problem, if it were easy to know who the male is.
You, who answered after two seconds,
must be Mr.
Ebara.
And you are a pain in the ass!
When we are caught off guard,
we humans become vulnerable.
-Right, Shizue?
-So much so, sir.
Mr.
Kaneshiro, from room 2001,
it took you 6 seconds and 29 tenths to answer me.
As you can see, I'm blind.
I didn't think you'd ask me anything.
It's all the same.
When I compare the data, I will have the answer.
(Woman) But your data is incomplete.
You are missing one person's data.
Oi, male of the night?
I don't know what's wrong, Mrs. Kamijo, from room 2102!
Kamijo, room 2102!
97 tenths of a second.
Enter it after my time of one second 48 tenths of a second, Mr.
Konno.
-Hey.
-Yes? -Yes?
Who is he, this man?
Don't you know who he is?
He won't fool me, even if he pretends to.
He's the main character in Shinichi's father's books!
(Thinking) "Exactly!"
"He's that sneaky thief my father created."
"He moves in the dark,
and sometimes transforms into a cruel killer."
"My father has not revealed the identity, of the male,
and someone has the peppers to use his name."
I do not understand.
I'm going to my room.
Father!
What do you plan to do, with the hotel bill?
(thinks) "Dr. Agasa told me there would be 10 of us."
"We are 3, and here are 5 more. Two are missing."
(Woman shouting)
What are you doing?

Come on!
I just spanked you.
Be a good girl and pour me a little drink.
(Thinks) "Cheeky!"
-Will you stop! - Ouch!
Turkey, what are you doing?
-I wanted to ask you the same question: "What do you think you are doing?
How strong!
Aren't you Satoru Maeda?
How do you know?
Hey, Ran, do you know him?
He won the Japan karate championship 6 years ago.
He was my hero.
My name is Ran Mouri.
I won the Tokyo competition!
Wow!
The women's karate champion!
Meet Satoru Maeda!
How lucky!
(Think) "Yes, you can count."
(Girl) -Who is it, this one? -Akiko.
I'll introduce you.
It's my promise, Akiko Sayama!
Ah!
I didn't know they're celebrating.
Akiko...
Don't listen to her.
The Akiko is jealous.
Is it one of you, the night baron?
Room 1901, Mr.
Maeda, 75 tenths of a second.
Mrs. Sayama...
Sayama...
(Think) "He can't get enough."
We were aware that there were two teachers and one girl, to your group.
Yes, but since they couldn't come, we came.
The man accompanying us is not a teacher,
he is a private detective!
A detective?
Yes, he is Kogoro Mouri.
(Girl) In... Kogoro Mouri?!
I've read about him in the papers.
They say he's very competent.
Look at giving the place to a private detective.
We can already rule out a male candidate.
Maybe so,
but if Kogoro Mouri is here, we'd better not fool around.
He's really famous, the father!
(He thinks) "Me, the one who has done the job."
"Who's there?"
Conan... Conan!
Let's go back to our room!
Yeah, right.
I get it!
That's why they got nervous, when they found out you're a detective.
Of course, of course.
This is very interesting.
If during the time we're here I find out the identity of the male,
we'll get a free stay, right?
That's why I should say it was free, Professor Agasa!
I suppose...
Of course it is!
In Kogoro Mouri can solve any mystery!
(Think) "A moment ago I wanted to leave because I didn't have enough money."
Very well!
I'm going to do some research.
Father is in high spirits.
Shall we go for a walk around the hotel? Ah, all right.
What's the matter, Conan?
Come on, let's go.
I'll stay a while, Ran.
I'll be in the gift shop.
I'll be in the gift store.
Okay, Conan?
Yes.
I'll meet you there.
(Thinking) "I don't get it."
"Why did they get nervous, when they knew he was a detective?"
"It's just a game."
"So much fuss for a free stay?"
"And this feeling of imminent danger..."
"Besides, Professor Agasa said:"
The winner of this contest will get a floppy disk with a special program.
Of course, it won't do you any good...
"I don't know..."
"I have an unpleasant feeling."
"I'm going to call Agasa and ask her what this is all about."
The male of the night!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Oysters.
Look!
(Think) "A swimming pool?"
Hey!
Are you okay, kid?
You son of a bitch!
(Thinks) "It's gone."
"He must have changed the sink and gone downstairs."
"Who should play the male role?"
"Other than Ran, Kogoro and me, there are 7 more participants."
"Anyone can be what wanted to assassinate me."
"The purpose of the trip is to unmask the promoter,
who is disguised as a male of the night and who is proposing mysteries."
"But if it's a game to win the free stay,
why the hell would I want to throw myself off the balcony?"
Ah, yes, you want to know what program it is?
(Adult voice) Yes, what is it, on the floppy disk?
I'm sorry, I know.
The blurb just said: "secret program".
But now that you mention it...
The colleague who came with me on this trip...
said something about a virus.
A v... virus ?!
But he could only know that it was a secret program.
Wow!
You mean the virus didn't... Conan!
Aaaa... Hello, Ran!
What the hell are you doing, Conan?
I've been waiting for you at the store for a while!
Can you feel me?
Yes. But you're soaking wet.
What happened to you?
Ah, it's just that...
I slipped and fell into the pool.
What?!
It's not funny to me.

What were you doing?
You have to watch out!
It doesn't look like he's hurt... Go change and we'll have dinner.
Come on, let's go!
Yes.
Wow, what a crowd!
What shall we do now?
(Hey, Ran!
Ran!
We're here, we're here!
(Kogoro) Father!
Good evening, Satoru and Akiko.
(Kogoro) What?
Have you become friends?
Yes... Your father was questioning us.
He's very funny.
He says I'm the man of the night.
Oh, father how you are...
Oh, Akiko, what a nice suit you're wearing!
Ah... thank you very much.
But keep an eye out!
There may be some man with evil intentions watching you.
(Thinking) "That pervert still hasn't gotten over it."
So it was Akiko who signed up for the excursion.
Yes, she's a fan of Yusako Kudo's novels.
He apasssiona that someone dresses up as a male of the night.
I know all about the male.
And I'm wearing his hairstyle.
Hey, girl.
You're not the only one who specializes in the male of the night.
Honey...
I just want you to be aware.
Excuse me, gentlemen!
My God, what a beautiful suit.
You won't change!
That's why he left you, the mother!
When will you take your eyes off her?!
(Think) "Indeed, it's a beautiful dress..."
Hey, be quiet, sir!
"That pig hasn't even looked at it. Maybe he's not your type?"
"Isn't that Mr. Kaneshiro, the one in room 2001?"
"Who knows where he is, his assistant, the Shizue?"
"I'll go do some research!"
Conan, where are you going now?
What?
In the washroom.
Father, don't you drink too much today?!
Excuse me, sir, but do you also want the computer virus?
Ah, I'm Conan Edogawa, from room 1902.
Do you remember me?
Oh, my goodness!
Where did you get that virus thing, kid?
It's just that all the participants are talking, sir!
But how could they know?
They just had to know that it's a secret program.
It's because of the name they gave it.
There has been a lot of talk about an unidentified virus
that got into the computers of large companies
and destroyed all their data.
It is such a perfect program that it has not been located or destroyed.
It was so elusive that it was christened "The Man of the Night".
The man of the night?
Those in the computer world have heard of it.
(Think) "I get it."
"The developer has disguised himself as a male, because of the name of the program."
It's a name that brings back a lot of memories.
And especially of a son of mine who died 4 years ago.
A son?"
(Shizue) What's wrong with you, little one?
Eh?!
I'm going now.
See you later, sir.
Please keep an eye on him, Shizue.
This child is too curious for his age.
I'll keep an eye on him.
(Thinking) "Eh? It's Mr. Konno from room 2002."
"He's talking on the phone. What should he be talking about?"
So I was right, it was also in Tokyo Ebara.
"In Tokyo he's the one who's after everyone."
It was him, that damned hacker....
"Hacker?!"
"You mean one of those who steal information from computers!"
Yes... And what else?
Eh?
I'd really like to have one like this, sir!
Don't touch my Satomi!
Sa... Satomi?
It's my mother's name.
She died last year.
Are you all right, Satomi?
I see you are...
"You put your mother's name in the computer!"
"Eh? That pervert has disappeared."
Excuse me!
Where did he go, the man who was sitting here?
In his room to do I don't know what.
If you know him, will you give him this?
He has neglected it.
(He thinks) "I remember... he had put it on his head."
Conan!
Aaaa... Hello, Ran!
Don't pretend, now.
You disappear every moment.
On has gone, all the people?
The father, Satoru and Akiko have gone to the room.
Looks like he hasn't arrived, the father!
Hey!
Akiko!
Don't play with me, let me in!
(Akiko) No!
You're a pervert!
(Akiko) Come on.
You're drunk!
What's wrong?
She says I winked at the waitress, and it's not true.
You've bitten her!
Oh, Lord... I'll go to the gazebo and wait for him to calm down.
Ran, do you want to come to the gazebo? Do you want to come to the gazebo?
Don't pay any attention to him.
Come on, let's go!
Well...
(thinks) "It's amazing."

Oh, look at that beautiful sky!
Yes, but it's not as beautiful as you.
Ah, sorry...
I want to see it too.
Wow, the sea is really black!
How scary it is, at night!
Conan...!
Satoru, tell me something.
When did you meet her, Akiko?
We were friends since we were kids.
Her older brother was my best friend.
He died 3 years ago.
Her brother died?
How sad...
(Think) "Another dead relative."
Hey, Ran!
Where's he gone, in Kogoro?
Ah, earlier I saw Detective Mouri with a woman,
Mrs. Kamijo from room 2102.
Ah, wow...
(Think) "He's a pervert too!"
(Kogoro) Oooooh!
Excuse me!
So you were married?
Yes, but it's been 3 years since we were divorced.
What a divorce from such a beautiful woman!
Why don't you tell me about yourself?
You must have solved the mystery by now.
Do you know who the man is?
I won't tell you!
I'll bet my hotel bill...
Please, just a little hint...
Please... Mr. Detective...
(Thinking) "My heart is very hot..."
He's a bad guy, Kogoro!
(Think) "I'll have a great time, tonight."
I'm going to the room, guys.
(Thinks) "Go on, go!"
The Akiko will have calmed down by now.
Besides, if I stay here with you any longer...
this bodyguard of yours will still bite me.
See you later.
Aaa... listen, do you know what it is, you, a virus?
A virus?
Like a cold?
Ah, it's the same, kid...
Why did you ask him this question?
(Think) "A perfect computer virus, the baron of the night."
"It could be used to steal money from banks or large companies."
"There will be many people who will snatch it."
"What does he intend, the promoter of the excursion, by gathering these people?"
"Is it just a game? Or maybe..."

(Man) -What's wrong?
(Woman) -What is this?
(Woman) -Look!
Look! (Woman) -Huh?
What is it?
I wouldn't have imagined that the immortal male of the night would end up dying.
Who knows why he must have fallen.
Eh?
It was just an accident.
An accident?
This knot is not right.
Aaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
