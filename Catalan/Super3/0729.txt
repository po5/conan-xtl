We will not see each other anymore.
Please take care of yourself!
Wow!
I've seen her a few times, but she still thrills me.
It's very kind.
It's an old movie, and you are very young.
But I hope that in spite of everything you also liked it.
I liked it a lot too.
Yes, oh, so much!
Mother, why don't we show the guests upstairs?
It has a collection of objects from his films.
Wow, how interesting!

(Conan voice) "Diamonds, a portrait and a great actress."
(Kogoro) Oh, no!
It's all old movies.
It's like a little museum of Misuzu Shirakawa.
What a shame!
The collection was made by my late husband.
Very interesting.
Here you will find the costumes and objects
she used in the movies.
Blow!
(Kogoro) Mm...
(Kogoro) Oh!
How wonderful!
This is the mother's bedroom.
In this display case she has jewelry and objects of sentimental value.
(Kogoro) Oh!
Is it authentic?
It sure is!
Oh! (Laughs)
Oops...
Who keeps a fake necklace in a display case?
And that one?
Is it also authentic?
Yes, it is too.
I was sorry to keep it closed in the showcase so that it wouldn't look so good.
This portrait was painted during the filming of "Vacation at the Rokumeikan".
As the painter portrayed me without a necklace,
I added it later.
- (thud)
- (Kogoro) Good thinking.
But what are you doing, Father?
Be careful!
Oops!
Oops.
Aaah!
Yes, yes, yes!
Ouch!
Oops!
Yikes!
(Shinichi, thinks) "He'll make us all look bad."
I've had enough, Mother!
Why did you get involved?
What's wrong with you now?
I'd like to know why they canceled my role.
Don't take it like that, Miss Saori...
I've talked to the production company.
You're going to call them and ask them not to take me for the part!
What role?
Saori went to a casting and passed.
You sing very badly, and as an actress you're a zero to the left.
I'm ashamed of you acting in public.
-You don't have to decide!
-Mom!
Quiet!
I don't want to risk losing my reputation because of you.
It's been many years since you retired from this world.
Who remembers an actress named Misuzu Shirakawa?!
-Leave her alone!
-Saori!
-Ehem...
- (Misuzu) Au, let's go eat.
Yuka, join the guests on the terrace.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm coming!
Conan, don't dawdle!
Yes, thank you.
Some jam?
Sorry for the show earlier.
Mother takes things at work very seriously.
Don't suffer.
Mother lives in a fantasy world.
A world where she's still a big diva.
Ah, you have to be more sympathetic to your mother, Kyosuke.
I have to apologize, Mr. Mouri.
I shouldn't have seen such a pitiful scene.
No, don't worry.
You know, children will always be children, no matter how big they get.
They say that, don't they?
Children won't know how much we love them.
Ah!
-Mani'm.
-Yuka!
This jam isn't the one I like, is it?
I'm sorry, madam.
Yesterday I thought there were two jars left, but today...
Go buy some right now!
But mother, aren't you exaggerating?
In the film studio everyone remembered which one was my favorite.
It's been many years since you've been to the studio.

-I'm going to buy right now.
-What?
Kyosuke.
I know it's very early, but I want to take my medicine.
-Yes.
Get-me-ready.
Will you excuse me, Mr. Mouri?
I'll see you later.
-I'm sorry, everything...
-Y-yes...
-Excuse me.
-And now!
I have to leave you too.
I'll go check on Yuka.
O-Of course.
Ah!
What a bad feeling there is in this house!
-It's all right.
-Excuse the commotion. -I'm sorry.
Oh, well!
Where's Chiharu?
Ah, she said she was going to check on Yuka.
Oh, she said she was going to check on Yuka.
About that, who is sick, Mrs. Misuzu?
-What?
That she's... napping?
-What?
No..., she takes a nap.
Yes, she has the habit of lying in bed for a couple of hours every day,
two to four.
She even takes sleeping pills to fall asleep.
She says it's good for beauty and health.
(wheels: squeak)
- (horn, continuous honking)
- (vehicle: crash)
Yuka!
Yuka, are you all right?
-It was my fault.
-What happened?
I was distracted.
I'm sorry, I was so upset...
Wow!
What a chestnut.
I saw everything.
Chiharu suddenly appeared in the middle of the road,
and Yuka had to swerve to avoid her.
It's not your fault, Yuka.
Hey, you!
What's all this noise?
-I'm so sorry, ma'am.
-Oh my God, the car!
-It's not true, it was me.
-I got lost and... -I've had enough!
I've had enough!
Yuka, pack your bags right now and get out of this house!
I don't believe this!
You didn't even ask the poor girl if she was hurt!
The car repair will be paid for by the insurance.
Do me a favor, mother!
Why do you always think only of yourself?!
You should make the effort to put yourself in other people's shoes!
Do you think you should talk to your mother like that?
I'm tired, I'm going to sleep for a while!
-Don't suffer, Yuka.
- (Yuka: crying)
Then we'll try to convince her together.
-Yes!
-Go ahead, Mr. Mouri!
-No, you don't need to thank me at all.
-I'm very grateful to you, Mr. Mouri.
The only thing you have done is to step on the accelerator.
Don't you smell burning?
-Mom!
-The lady's bedroom!
Mother!
Mrs. Misuzu!
-Mommy!
-Mrs. Misuzu!
-Yes!
-Kyosuke, take her by the feet.
(Kogoro and Kyosuke: cough)
(Shinichi, think) "This fire..."
Today, at two o'clock in the afternoon, a fire broke out....
at the residence of the actress Misuzu Shirakawa,
who died of poisoning.
Mrs. Shirakawa was already dead when you entered the room?
Yes.
She was in the habit of taking sleeping pills before going to sleep,
so it was already too late when we realized
that there was a fire in her bedroom.
We understand.
Anyway, the fire originated in a very strange place.
You can say that now.
-No.
What was she smoking, your mother?
In fact, no one smokes in this house.
(Shinichi, thinks) "What is this?"
"Could it be that too...?"
"Sure!"
"Therefore, this has been a murder."
"And the culprit is..."
"I know who did it!"
(Tamagawa) Well, then.
Soon the sun will have set,
and we don't know if it was an accident or a murder.
You'll have to wait for the lab results.
-Huh?
-One moment, Inspector Tamagawa. -One moment, Inspector Tamagawa.
-Any problem, Mr. Mouri?
-Huh?
- (dart: whistle)
-No, no.
(dart: whistles) Oh!
(dart: whistles) Oh!
Father!
Oh..., ay!
M-Mr. Mouri!
-Who?
-Is this the famous Sleeping Kogoro?
(Kogoro voice) Gentlemen..., today's fire has been set...
with the intention of killing Mrs. Misuzu Shirakawa.
What do you mean?
That it was a homicide?
(Kogoro voice) That's right.
Besides, the culprit is here.
You mean, father?
When the fire started, we were all together.
I know that.
In fact, the fire was caused by the magnifying glass effect.
"The magnifying glass effect"?
The magnifying glass effect, miss, is the convex lens effect...
that water does from inside a plastic bottle, for example.
So, Mr. Mouri,
the sun's rays have heated the portrait and set it on fire?
But this room faces north.
The sun never enters.

(Kogoro voice) Take a look out the window.
- (Kogoro) Look at that building.
-(Kogoro) What?
It looks like it has a slant cut made by a knife.
Doesn't it awaken any memories, Kyosuke?
Of course it doesn't!
That's right.
When we ran into the bedroom...
But even if the sun's rays entered the bedroom,
they'd be projected on the wall opposite.
No.
The mirror!
The mirror can reflect the sun's rays,
but it can't deflect the trajectory to the portrait.
(Tamagawa) That's true, it's impossible.
(Kogoro voice) What do you say we do an experiment?
-A little higher.
-(Tamagawa) Is it going well like this?
-(Kogoro voice) Now it does.
-(Kogoro voice) Here?
(Kogoro voice) You can turn on the flashlight now.
Do you see it?
(Tamagawa) The light is projected on the wall in front of the painting.
(Kogoro voice) Yuka, please,
could you put back the mirror that fell on the floor?
(Kogoro voice) Right now.
(Kogoro voice) It must have been knocked over during the fire extinguishing.
Do you see the mark on the stand?
It's a small notch.
Well... Yes, I can see it.
There's one just like it on the surface of the display case.
-Yes.
-Please match it.
Now place the mirror perpendicular to the glass case.
Y-yes.
-Do the same with the other two.
-Renoi!
The light reaches the portrait!
- (Kogoro voice) It's all explained.
- (Tamagawa) Oh!
The sunlight has reflected off the glass building,
entered through the window
and the mirror deflected it into the showcase.
From there, the three mirrors have projected a single beam of light....
above the portrait on the opposite wall.
I imagine that the culprit had calculated
the position of the mirrors to the millimeter.
But, if you think back, you will remember that..,
when they showed us the bedroom, I accidentally knocked the mirrors over.
When I straightened them,
I probably didn't leave them in their original position.
However, the fire started just as the culprit had planned.
This means...
...that someone has rectified the position of the mirrors again!
Yes..., and only one person could have done it.
The only one who stayed in this room
when all the rest of us have succeeded.
Chiharu Shirakawa!
Only you could have done it.
It can't be...
Really?
Is it true, Chiharu?
It was you who did...?
No!
One moment, please.
The mother only had the window open for a couple of minutes.
What flammable substance can ignite in such a short time?
(Kogoro voice) There are many.
Chiharu, after correcting the orientation of the mirrors,
you applied a flammable product to the portrait,
probably a solvent used for oil painting.
-Yes.
-Dissolvent?
Among the volatile solvents,
such as turpentine and petroleum,
there are those that have a flash point below 50 degrees.
"It was also you who hid the jam jars,
"With the intention that Madam Misuzu
to send Yuka to buy more."
"Then you planted yourself in the middle of the road
when Yuka was arriving by car and..."
- (vehicle: crash)
- (wheels: squeak)
(Misuzu) Hey, you guys!
What's this clattering?
(Saori) You should make an effort to put yourself in other people's shoes!
(Misuzu) You think you should talk to your mother like that?
Is it true, Chiharu?
Was it you, Chiharu?
Have you killed the mother?
Can you prove it?
He seems very convinced of what he says,
but he has not yet provided a single piece of evidence.
-(Kogoro voice) Yes.
- (Kogoro voice) Proof, you say?
Everything he's said so far is mere supposition.
It's true that I was the last one to leave the dormitory,
but this doesn't prove that I touched the mirrors.
- (Kogoro voice) Yuka.
-It doesn't make sense.
Send me.
In this bedroom there was a vase with lilies, right?
Yes.
Madam liked them very much.
-No, sir. -No, sir.
-And the other rooms?
This was the only room that was decorated with lilies.
Hey, Mr. Mouri, what are you talking about now?
-Eh?
-About the test you asked me for.
I'm referring to the traces of lily pollen
that you have at your elbow, on the right sleeve of your sweater.
Oh!
And what does that prove, if I may ask?

How is it that you have on your sleeve traces of pollen from flowers that were only found in this room?
that were only found in this room?
I could have unintentionally brushed against the lilies at any other time.
-At what other time?
-That doesn't mean anything!
-Try to remember.
-I-I don't know, I don't remember.
The lilies were in a vase placed on top of the display case.
"If you have pollen on the right sleeve of your sweater...,
it means that you've been close to the flowers
while touching some object to the left of the vase."
And what was there?
Exactly: there was the one we used for the experiment,
the one you used to reflect and concentrate the sunlight.
The three mirrors!
-But Chiharu...!
-Chiharu!
Why did you do it?
Why did you kill him?!
"Chiharu-san."
That woman has called me that ever since I was little,
as if I wasn't family.
You two, on the other hand, she called you Kyosuke and Saori.
And that's why you have...?
I am the daughter of my father's previous marriage.
When I heard that the father was going to marry her,
I was very excited.
After all, I admired her greatly as an actress.
So I did everything I could to please her.
I tried not to be selfish and always helped with the housework.
But from her I would only get comments like:
"Very good, Chiharu-san."
"Thank you, Chiharu-san."
"This is not done, Chiharu-san."
"Chiharu-san, Chiharu-san, Chiharu-san..."!
And last week...
(Misuzu) Ah, no, that one has no relation to me.
She really doesn't.
In fact, she's the daughter of my husband's ex-wife.
That's right.
The only ones who are really my children are Saori and Kyosuke.
When I die, she won't inherit a penny of my fortune.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Kogoro voice) Chiharu..., you want to know my opinion?
I think you've tried too hard.
Between parents and children, you shouldn't force things.
Maybe you should have been more selfish.
I guess you were going to press the wrong button
when you were at the starting line.
(Cries)

I can't believe it, father!
You went to the racetrack again, didn't you?
What?
How could you not?
I did?
And now!
Why do you say this?
And besides, you've eaten curry!
You won't be hungry for dinner.
Mmm, mmm...
How-how do you know?!
Stop the stains on your shirt.
They're curry!
Ah, well... Ha-ha!
Ahem!
I admit I've eaten curry, but I swear I haven't been to the racetrack.
Mm?
Mr. Mouri!
Ah!
The ear, the ear.
Oops, what-what is it?
How did it end up, in my ear?
Strange..., what a thing to happen, isn't it?
Come clean at once!
I'm going to cut your pay in half!
Like ?!
Have pity on your poor father!
Please have pity on me!
(Shinichi, thinks) "He-he-he!"
"He doesn't keep a close eye on details, for being a detective..."
(Shinichi, thinks) "A single stab in the chest."
Surely it was you, what died in Masahiro!
Eh?
Ah, but it's Kenji Hiroto and Shunichi Morishita!
- (both) Eh ?!
-I understand that you have killed her.
In this room there is something that is exactly this color.
- (all) Over there.
-Does anyone know what I mean?
