The amusement park bungee jumping murder case
What are we doing here?
Well, weren't you dying to go to an amusement park?
Yes, I did.
Well, we're in Nichiuriland.
When I was talking about an amusement park, I meant this one!
Tropical Land!
Why would you take me to Nichiuriland?!
If they are not very different...
You can go up to many places.
The contents are different.
You shut up, you wise rat!
For starters, there aren't many attractions!
They put on a show!
Yaibaaaa!
In Yaiba, we will fight!
We will not swallow the first show of the day!
Well, I think you'll like them.
So much so, go have fun, I'll be right back.
That's funny.
What are you doing with a diary of the boat races, Kogoro?
Ah... Eh?
Gee, was there really a racing diary?
Gee, Father!
Neg!
Neg!
Yaiba kick!
Damn you, you'll remember this one, Yaiba!
Yaiba!
(Think) 10 years ago maybe I would have had fun...
(Boy) What a drag!
Come here a second, Conan.
What was it, Kogoro?
Mi-te, it's up there.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Did you get scared?
This is bungee jumping.
(Thinking) It has made my hair stand on end.
It's amazing!
Look what we have, up there.
You promised me, daughter!
Then do not undo you.
What is he doing?
I told him that if he goes bungee jumping I'll let him watch the boat race.
A... that's scary... but I'll do it!
Come on, sir, eagerness.
Some people are waiting, man.
Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Careful, master, this is dangerous!
Shouldn't you quit?
No, I can't quit.
I have strong reasons, you know?
But in Kogoro I didn't have much vertigo?
Are you sure?
Aaaaah What the hell are you doing?
Are you upset, master?
You had to do it, didn't you?
Ready!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Don't make yourself pray, pull s at once!
Leave me alone!
When I pull is up to me.
Neg, neg, neg!
Yaiba the Masked, you ran away because you were afraid of me!
Now the planet Earth will fall into my hands!
Neg, neg, neg, neg, neg, neg, neg!
Enough of this!
Step aside!
No... I don't know how, but I've finally been saved!
We'll make it big today too!
He's not coming.
That coward has fled and abandoned you!
No.
This is impossible!
In Yaiba the Masked One will come to save me no matter what!
Help me!
Yaiba!
(Children) Yaiba!
Yaiba!
Shut up!
No matter how much I run him in Yaiba he won't come!
(Yaiba) In Yaiba is here!
Yaiba!
Yaiba!
When the roller coaster dummy disappears, it's you!
(Yaiba) Sorry for the wait, Black Alien!
I won't let you do and undo!
It's quite a spectacular appearance.
Yes.
(Yaiba) Ah!
Excuse me, madam...
Be calm, princess!
I'll be right back to save you!
Come on, Yaiba!
Is this also... Is this part of the show?
No, I don't think so.
The spectators do not see how Yaiba falls into the water.
(Boy) Hey, Hosono!
Are you all right, Hosono?!
Have the rescue team come!
Hosono has fallen into the river!
Has fallen into the water?
(Thinking) "It's been 20 minutes since he fell in?"
"Eh? Caram."
"The rubber that broke is scorched."
"This means it's not an accident."
"The lady from before... If we were to look at it..."
Of it, excuse me, ma'am.
(Man) Guys, found!

(A girl cries)
Poor things...
Kogoro, we'd better call Inspector Megure.
This looks bad.
What happened, Conan?
Look at the ring.
That rubber, it looks like it's been burned from the inside.
If it had just broken, it wouldn't have scorched, would it?
That's right.
It hasn't been cut naturally.
So this is a murder case, Mr. Inspector?!
You were the first to say so! Oh, you mean?
Takagi, gather those who are related to the case.
(Think) "They've taken the body out of that area."
"What is it, this water?"
"It goes all the way over there..."
"That child is..."
"What a sight to behold with a bored look on his face."
"If it was like I think..."
Hey, listen!
How did you find him, sir?
Well, just as you said, it's all right, sir.
I knew it... How do you know these things?
Very well.
Come on, Tomohiro.
Let's go, but where?
We'll go catch the bad guy!
We'll take her instead of Yaiba the Masked!
The victim is Mr. Yuta Hosono, 28 years old,
director of the theater group HO Company.
While playing the role of Yaiba,
the rubber band of the bungee jump broke and he drowned.
Did you put the rubber band around the victim's ankles?
Yes.
I was always in charge of putting it on.
Did you notice any anomalies in the rope?
If I had, I wouldn't have let him jump.
Sure, I suppose so... Let's go on.
You belong to the same theatrical group as Mr. Hosono.
Yes, sir.
My name is Okubo.
We mainly do theatrical performances, but that's not enough to live on.
Mr. Okubo, in the show you play the villain.
And you?
My name is Kanako Harukawa and I play the princess.
My name is Wataru Otaki.
I'm in charge of the scenery, the EFs, and what's behind it.
The EF?
The special effects.
I manipulate the explosives that are used.
Ah... And you?
I am in Fujita,
responsible for the activities that take place in the park.
The Yaiba who went on the roller coasters, who is he?
This is a dummy.
We wanted to include an actor to do it, but we lack resources.
That aside, why did you want to gather us here?
It was an accident, wasn't it?
As we investigate, we see other hypotheses.
(Kogoro) Wait a minute!
We're talking about a full-fledged murder!
And the perpetrator is one of you!
One of you hated Mr. Hosono.
Do you have anything to say, Mr. Ishijima?
In fact, with the Okubo, you had quarreled over how he ran the group.
Eh?
And you, over some money he left you.
It's nothing to do with me!
Kanako complained that he asked her to go out together.
I just felt uncomfortable!
And the Otaki, in Hosono he treated him as if he were his slave.
I did the same with you!
Between Mr. Hosono and I there have never been any problems.
Then we came to a very clear conclusion:
taken from Mr. Fujita,
everyone had some motive to murder Hosono!
The murderer who has taken the life of Yaiba the Masked is you!
You want me to be the murderer because I didn't let you go bungee jumping?!
This rubber was broken by an explosion,
and the only person who handled it there is you!
If we look at this we will know.
How ?!
I asked for the tape from a lady who filmed the fall in Yaiba.
That's good.
It can become a proof.
Let's watch it, Mouri.
Yes, yes, let's do it.
Ah, excuse me, madam.
Stop the tape!
This smoke must be from the powder of the explosive.
(Mouri) "Surely, when they've put the rubber to the ankles at Yaiba,
they must have placed an explosive on the inner side of the rubber."
(Mouri) "After en Yaiba jumped, he calculated the moment,
and pressed the device that detonated the explosive."
Will you admit that you did it, Ishijima?
I can't!
I didn't do it!
Don't make things worse!
Look at this.
Don't you think that in Yaiba the Masked One plays the rubber?
It's true.
What do you say, Mouri?
You're close to him, aren't you?
Come to think of it...
In Yaiba he's stuck his fingers inside the rubber.
Look at this, too.
Don't you see something strange?
The strange one is you, kid!

The fingers of the left hand are open and the right hand is closed.
Prize!
But isn't that your typical posture?
No, it's the first time I've seen it.
Maybe he was carrying something,
such as a detonator to set off the explosive.
What?
So it should be a suicide?!
It must be a suicide.
In Hosono has committed suicide!
Oi?!
Certainly, it's a reasonable hypothesis.
Ah... If you see it that way, Mr. Inspector...
Ah!
Ah!
Aaaaaaaah...
(Kogoro voice) No!
This is a murder.
So, the murderer is Mr. Ishijima, like you said?
You're confused, man!
(Kogoro voice) Before we point out the murderer, we'll check alibis.
First, Mr. Okubo's.
I was on stage playing the Black alien.
Like him, I was on stage playing the princess.
I was working with the special effects explosives.
Mr. Ishijima was at the top of that infrastructure.
Yes. And you, Mr. Fujita?
I was arranging some papers in this room.
Can anyone corroborate that?
No, as I was alone...
Problems had arisen between you and Hosono as well.
What... but what's wrong?
In exchange for using that space, in Hosono had promised him money,
and he had not paid.
Quiet!
Au, that's enough.
We heard the deductions of en Mouri.
(Kogoro voice) As we have already learned from the filming,
perhaps he himself has put the explosive to the rubber.
Then it is a suicide!
No, this is just a farce created by the killer.
I had to put on record that the one who played Yaiba was Hosono.
Probably, the murderer,
when Mr. Hosono was left alone,
attacked her and made her lose consciousness.
And then, dressed up as Yaiba the Masked Yaiba himself
carried her to the river
and drowned her.
Then, the killer went to the dressing room,
he put on Yaiba's spare costume
and pretended to be Yaiba.
The killer pretended to check the rubber,
placed an explosive inside and jumped!
And with the remote control in his right hand he detonated it!
Swimming under the water
he reached the courtyard of the hydraulic machinery room,
took off his disguise and returned with the others.
But from the bungee crane to the hall it is 100 meters.
He used a small diving rebreather.
He could swim underwater for about 10 minutes.
What do you think?
Did I get it wrong somewhere?
What about Mr. Hosono's killer?
Speak up, Mr. Wataru Otaki!
It's... it's ridiculous!
I was at the show taking care of the explosives!
Did any of you see Mr. Otaki while the show was on?
-I didn't.
-I didn't either.
How did he want me to control the explosions of the show?!
This mystery was revealed to me by a boy I admire a lot in Yaiba,
Tomohiro Takada.
Well, tell them everything, Tomohiro.
I realized that what he was doing as Yaiba was not the same as usual!
He moved badly and didn't know how to do the Yaiba kick.
Also, before the explosions he was doing a specific posture.
He was doing...
Like this.
He did... like this.
Yes, that's the posture he does before the explosions.
-Yes. -Yes.
But today it was different.
In-in what way?
The explosives went off when he put his hand on his waist.
They should go off after calling "Yaiba".
In fact, it went faster.
I... I just lost my attention for a second...
And what's more!
The final stance was different from the usual one!
In Yaiba's final posture,
he doesn't open all his fingers, but points to the sky with his index finger!
This posture is different from the one referred to on TV,
but when they did the show here they did it!
When Yaiba came to our city, the show was cancelled because of rain,
the show was cancelled because of rain.
In Yaiba he promised me that he would do that posture to make it up to me!
That is to say, he detonated the explosives of the show
when he put his arm around his waist.
This nonsense is no proof!
(Kogoro voice) You want proof?
He has it on his body!
Surely at your ankles there are still....
Signs of burns!
Because he had to provoke a pretty strong explosion
to break a very thick rubber ring!
-Allow me.

-Don't touch me!
Wataru...
Tomohiro, come on, let's go get some ice cream.
Hosono assumed that I was incapable of playing the role of Yaiba.
In the action scenes, I'll run my hand over your face, Hosono!
Don't think that in Yaiba it's all about posturing and action.
To become a hero, certain qualities are essential.
So much did they do to him, the qualities, he only knew how to criticize me.
After all, he was envious of me and wanted to crush me!
Probably what Mr. Hosono wanted him to understand...
was that feelings had to come before everything else.
He wanted to say:
"With a heart like yours,
who will only see evil in words and actions,
you cannot play a hero."
For Mr. Hosono to point to the sky with his left hand
was a symbol of his friendship with the children.

In the end I couldn't go.
Next time I will go to Tropical land with my boyfriend.
Xi... xi... What a boy!
Is he that bearded detective?
Apa here, it's not Shinichi, man!
Lla... lla... then who is it?!
It's this one!
"Oh, mother! Oh, mother! To my raft, but..."
In the car he had placed a very powerful explosive.
An explosive?!
(Think) "I knew it."
"Eh? This man..."
Kogoro, doesn't he look like that man?
Yes, the man who was driving the car we ran into!
In the next chapter...
The truth of the car explosion case, part one...
The clue to the next Conan is... The garage!
In the next one, a surprising case that leaves you stunned.
