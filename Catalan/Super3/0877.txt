-(woman) A... a thief?
- (woman) A... a thief?
A-a thief!

-Auxili!
Ah...!
Well now I don't know if... Where will it be?
-Oh!
Oh!
-Get out of the way, greaseball!
Oh, man, what a pain!
I've got a bump.
Donkey!
I won't let you get away.
Wait a minute.
Don't run, you scoundrel!
(both) Oh...!
- (both) Aaaah...!
- (thumping)
Wait, don't run away!

"The crossed fate of two people".
That's right, you've got quite a bump.
That's too bad!
I'll do whatever it takes to find that man and turn her in to the police.
We will help you.
By the way, Genta, what were you doing, walking around Oku Beika?
-Well...
Because it's quite far from Beika...
We must find that man by any means if we don't want him to escape.
You're right.
You said you only saw her from behind, right?
Yes, I did.
She was wearing a red jacket and jeans.
It's not much, but what can we do?
(Mitsuhiko) Wait a minute!
Let's separate selected and ask people.
Calling him "the red jacket aggressor" is too long.
I think we should look for a code name.
Are you sure?
A code name?
Mm?
I think Gonbei would be a good name.
So that it is used by strangers.
-Mm...
-Gonbei, eh?
Since you've dropped in Genta, we could call you Gonta, couldn't we?
Every day you look more and more like Dr. Agasa.
Good thinking!
Oh, you're awesome.
It's a fantastic name!
Since he's the Gonbei who made Genta fall, we'll call him Gonta.
It's perfect.
(Genta) That's a name Dr. Agasa would say!
I don't suppose you're not saying this to make fun of me, are you?
I don't think so.
(Gime)
Oh, what a pain!
It's true, I fell up there.
Yes... Because of this one.
But that's all the same now.
I have to run away.
Wait a minute... But no one has seen my face!
If I change my clothes...
"No, it wasn't me.
Someone changed my clothes while I was unconscious".
"But do you really think we're going to fall for it?
this cheap excuse?"
How nice!
Ha-ha-ha!
Nothing.
No one has seen anything at all.
How did it go, guys?
-Punyeta!
-No, nobody.
Where did he go, that jerk?
-Oh, yes.
-You mean in Gonta. -You mean in Gonta.
What?
(Takagi) Hi, guys.
How's this?
What are you doing here?
You haven't met a suspicious man, by any chance?
-(Takagi) Hey?!
-Wearing a red jacket and jeans.
He's a burglar who just robbed Mrs. Koda's house,
a little further up.
Yes...
So he was a burglar, huh?
-Who... are you talking about? -Oh.
-Oh.
What's he mean?
That he's seen her, guys?
Yes.
Well, no, I haven't.
In fact, I didn't see her face.
When he ran into Genta and knocked her to the ground, he must have run away.
(Mobile)
-He made you fall?
Yes, and look.
I got a big bump on my head and everything.
That's why I chased her for a while.
-Yeah, okay.
-I wanted to turn him in to the police.
-Mm?
-Takagi...
The cameras near the station haven't picked up any man
fitting the description.
We understand.
So, though he may be hiding somewhere around here.
-Yes.
-It was.
You've felt it, now it turns out...
that Gonta is not only violent, but also a thief.
Yes.

We must do everything we can to catch him.
What do we do now?
They're getting very excited about this case.
Don't worry... He must be a criminal working alone.
But if things get complicated, I've got this.
(Mitsuhiko) Conan!
Come on, come on, come on, hurry up!
Ah, yes, now.
Ah...
- (birds: chirping)
-Oh..., oh...
Oh, oh, oh..., that's too bad...
Damn, I don't even know where I am.
I don't know how I got here.
Oh!
Gee, I don't even know who I am!
Maybe... maybe I'm carrying...
a driver's license, something...
Why... why am I carrying this in my pocket?
-Eh?
-Excuse me...
-Excuse me?
-Do you know me?
Do you know who I am?
I don't know what's wrong with me, but I don't remember who I am or where I come from.
-Well, no, I have no idea.
-Oh, boy.
You don't even know your name?
(Man: thinks) "Red jacket and jeans."
(Man: "Red jacket and jeans.") Oh!
But it turns out he's the thief they're looking for!
No!
A burglar?
No way!
Come on, you'll have to answer some questions.
No, I don't want to be arrested.
-What?
-Stop!
-We just found Gonta.
-It's him!
It's him, I'm sure!
Of course it's in Gonta.
Oh!
But what's he doing coming into my house without permission?
Is that...
Oysters.
(Traffic light: flashing beep)
(Train: whistle)
(Man: gasps)
Why did I commit a robbery?
- (Policeman: siren)
-(Man: I don't remember anything...) Why?
Anyway, if they catch me, they'll shut me down.
(police: siren) - Eh?
- (vehicle: close the door)
Ah!
What are you doing?
They steal my car!
I have to run away, no matter what!
Oh, man... It's broken down!
-I have to run away!
-What are you doing?!
Stop it!
Thief!
So, the man gave you a push...
and took your bike?
Yes.
First a car and then a bicycle.
-Yes, of course.
-(Mitsuhiko) He's bad bad, this man, huh?
(Mitsuhiko) It's no use, we look for him randomly.
(Genta) Maybe if we go to the house where he robbed we'll find something.
(Ayumi) Yes, there might be some clue.
There is something that you do not see clear.
The police officer...
said that Gonta seemed to have amnesia.
Maybe if we go to the house where he robbed we will solve the mystery.
Are you quite sure it was one man, Mrs. Koda?
Quite sure.
He hit me very hard on the head, from behind.
And when I came to,
I saw that he stole my souvenir coin from the Space Exhibition.
I'm asking because...
there are indications that two people have entered the house.
Yes.
You only saw one man, didn't you, Genta?
It could also be that the police made a mistake.
What's that?
Takagi...
Oh, hi, guys.
Inspector Megure told me to come and see what he found out.
Oh, my...
Mr. Ujihara...
His name is Masuzo Ujihara.
Do you know him?
He's a loan shark who has an office across from Beika Station.
Rumor has it that he sends people of dubious reputation
to visit people who don't pay their debts.
He makes a bad face.
We follow in Gonta's footsteps.
(Mitsuhiko) After knocking the woman unconscious, he has fled from the house.
Here he has given me the push and made me fall.
And more or less here you have lost sight of.
(Mitsuhiko) What is this?
What is this?
Someone rolled down, didn't they?
Sure, I got it.
Gonta was scared, he took this curve too fast...
and he fell off the edge here.
And this is where he hit his head hard and lost his memory.
Let's go down, hurry!
I think you're right.
Eh?
There are two marks...
It means that two people have fallen.
Could it be?
That's right!
This means that there is another person involved.
When Gonta turned the corner,
he bumped into someone who was around
and they both fell down.
But if it were like that...
The person who bumped into him would have gone to report him, right?
But Inspector Takagi didn't say there were any reports.
That's right.
How come this person didn't report it?
I got it!
He hasn't said anything because he doesn't know what happened to him yet.
And he doesn't know because he's lost his memory.
-You're wrong.
-I don't see it so clearly.
The person who lost his memory is not the man he bumped into.

No, it is in Gonta.
Yes.
Conan, don't tell me that...
I saw something earlier that didn't fit.
"The clothes she was wearing were too loose."
Hey, Genta, are you absolutely sure..,
that the man who gave you a shove earlier was in Gonta?
Huh?
Well, now that you mention it, maybe?
It looks like he was a bit bigger.
Well, that settles it.
They've made a switch.
After falling here, they've swapped clothes.
So the Gonta we've been looking for so far...
Turns out he's not the thief who brought me down.
But the man who was involved in the incident.
And of course, now..., like, he doesn't remember anything,
he thinks he's a thief and runs away from the police.
And in reality he hadn't done anything wrong.
But in order to run away he ended up doing bad things, and now the poor guy....
-Eh?
-Ah...
To Beika?
Come on, guys, back to Beika.
Yes.
You're talking about Mr. Ujihara, right?
If that man forced the real thief to commit the robbery..,
it's only natural that he showed up at the scene of the crime.
To see how it went.
Or because he was worried that someone had discovered her.
It's true, it's very likely!
If we talk, I'm sure...
we'll end up finding the real culprit.
(Think) "Hey, who are these guys? Oh!"
It's the sixth one.
But how are we going to do it, to talk, let's see?
(Think) "It's that chubby nano!"
Eh?
(Shinichi, thinks) "Could it be...?"
Mm?
Hello, Takagi.
Conan!
What about you?
What are you guys doing here?
What did you come here to do?
I came to talk to Mr. Masuzo Ujihara.
I want to show him this sketch.
Ah, it's that...
-This man...
-Ah, Inspector Takagi...
I see the elevators aren't working, so...
- (Mitsuhiko) Wait, wait!
-This man is not the thief.
(Think) "I've been worried for nothing."
Take a good look at this man, Mr. Ujihara, because he sure looks familiar.
-Oh!
-You know him?
Ha-ha!
No, I don't know this man.
Are you sure?
Because when he saw the drawing, he made... Ah!
-Oh!
-Wait a moment!
- (door: closes)
-Oh...
(door: closes) -Yes?
What do you mean?
-There's something strange.
This man in the composite sketch is an innocent victim
who got caught up in the case unwittingly.
-Yes, really?
- (both) Mm-hm.
And yet, Mr. Ujihara, when I showed it to him and he saw it,
he got nervous.
Wait a minute...
I found it very strange.
Inspector Megure said that...
(All) Hey?!
I know what happened!
Tell me about it.
I'd like to talk about today's robbery of Oku Beika.
It does look like it was him, yes.
You remember me, don't you?
-Paro s.
-Ah!
Don't let him get away!
Ah...!
Ah!
Now he will pay for having thrown me on the ground!
-Ah!
-Iaaah...!
-Hello?
- (mobile)
Takagi, it's me.
We've finally caught the suspect.
It's him, the thief, for sure.
He was wearing this red jacket and jeans.
No, ma'am.
In fact, it's not him.
(Both) Huh?
Ah, isn't it?
It's not him?
It's a bit of a... complicated story.
-Ha!
-Sir Shinya Torimaru...
Yesterday I overheard a conversation...
between Mr. Ujihara and a customer of yours.
(Ujihara) At Oku Beika lives a woman named Yoshi Koda.
If you have trouble getting paid, wear some clothes.
Are you telling me to commit... robbery?
It will be easy, she is an old woman and lives alone.
(Torimaru) "I found it an easy and lucrative job,
and today I entered her house, here."
(Torimaru) "I saw that the woman was unconscious
and that someone had disturbed the whole house."
"While I was at it, I could take the opportunity to take something."
"And while I was looking..."
A souvenir coin.
-(woman) A... a... a... a souvenir coin.
- (woman) A... a thief?
- (bang: pam)
-A-a thief!
Help!
Well now I don't know if... Where will it be?
-Ouch!
Oh!
-Get out of the way, greaseball!
Geez, what a pain!
- (thump)
- (both) Aaaah...!
(Genta) Wait, don't run away!
(groans)
Oh, what a pain!
It's true, I fell up there.
Yes... Because of this one.
But now it's all the same.
I have to run away.

Wait a minute... But no one has seen my face!
If I change my clothes...
I thought that, changing clothes with his,
I'd get out and they'd blame it on him.
So it turns out that I was assaulted not by one thief, but by two!
It is obvious that they did not work together....
It seems unbelievable!
But yes, both have entered your house.
What?
Well...
Inspector, this means that he...
I haven't committed... any robbery, but I thought I had,
and on the run I've committed one crime after another.
It's dreadful!
Oh...
(Cries)
Mr. Torimaru, was it this voice,
the one you felt yesterday in Mr. Ujihara's office?
And now... What am I going to do now?
Are you telling me to commit a robbery?
Yes, indeed, it was him!
Yesterday Mr. Ujihara threatened you.
- (both) What?!
-What?
Threatened me?
Yes, Conan, it seems you were right.
If Mr. Ujihara hadn't pushed her to steal,
he wouldn't have gotten so nervous... when he saw her sketch.
That's right.
So...
He broke into Mrs. Koda's house...
and knocked her unconscious.
But while he was looking for things to steal..,
he felt you coming in and decided to run away.
But, while running away, you sprained your ankle and,
when he bent down to look at you..,
you came running up and collided with him.
Of course, now I understand.
Mm!
It seems that everything is clear.
So now, the only thing left for us to do...
is to arrest Mr. Ujihara for instigating robbery.
And then we can call this case solved.
He-he-he!
So I am a thief, actually.
Since you threatened him,
Gonta was forced to commit the robbery.
Eh?
Gonta?
My name is Gonta?
No.
It's just a code name we've given you.
That's right, you're right.
- (all) Gonna Taro?
-My name is Gonta, yes!
Gonna Taro.
Yes, but everyone since I was a little boy has known me as... Gonta.
Now I remember everything.
It's about time!
The company where I worked went bankrupt
and I fell into a depression, but just yesterday...
Are you telling me to commit a robbery?
(Gonta) "I was surprised, but at the same time...
the idea of stealing... I found it exciting."
That's why I entered the house!
I was happy to have found a new goal in my life.
Ha-ha-ha!
But what does he say!
It's worse than me!
Take this pair away right now!
Yes!

Come to think of it, what were you doing, walking around this area, Genta?
It's true, although you haven't explained it to us.
I came... AHM...
Well now... now I don't remember.
(Both) You can't not remember!
When you fell, you hit your head...
Ha-ha-ha!
Yes, it's true.
I do not remember...
Why did I have to come?
(Mitsuhiko) What?
You're asking us?
(Mitsuhiko) What?
Look carefully, okay?
Taraaan!
Aaaah...!
No!
Wait, Conan!
(Shinichi, thinking) "Wow! It's the store where I've been before!"
