DETECTIVE CONAN
The case of the great chase of the Junior Detective League.
Ayumi, Mitsuhiko, Genta, we got it!
-Message received, Conan!
-Deixa'ns do us!
Let him come whenever he wants!
Entoma-la!
-Let's go! (At the same time) -Yes, yes!
What do you do?!
Unload me!
Unload me, please!
-The Junior Detective League... You've won!
We accept all kinds of cases!
-We chase them!
-We solve them!
(Thinking) Can't you see that all this is too big for you?
(At the same time) Trust the Junior Detective League!
(At the same time) Thanks, it was great!
(At the same time) Geez!
He's been fed up like a bunch of thieves!
Do not you know what it means, the word "moderation"?
In recognition of the boys' merits, you're taking them out for a bite to eat.
What?!
Do I have to take them?
Casum, this month's pay is completely lost.
You guys are unbelievable!
That man had robbed 50!
There was a suspicious customer.
Conan saw him.
(Think) It was a coincidence.
(Genta) Our customers will increase endlessly.
We will put a detective office!
Watch out, a car.
(Genta) Ah!
Aaaah!
Ayumi!
Shit!
"Shinjuku 33 33-96"
He ran over and ran away!
Ran, stay here!
I'll get an ambulance and call the police.
Stay for her, Ran!
Don't say anything!
It can't all be done by the police!
Done!
Agafeu's-e strong, guys!
He's turned!
If you don't run anymore, we'll lose him! I already know!
Watch it.
It's that car!
He must have thought we'd lost it!
It's stopped again!
It must have engine trouble!
So we can go on!
(Think) "Stop the car in front of us?
It's as if he wanted the atrap√©ssim!"
He has fled!
What the hell are you doing, Conan?
Accelerate even more!
-Hey, I don't see the car! -This time we've lost it.
We'll look for it! Yes!
Hey, maybe he's hiding here, right?
No, it can't be in a place like this.
Besides, it looks like this factory is having a party today.
Let's go in the back!
Caram.
What twists and turns!
This is not paved...
Here we have stairs!
So...
It's not there.
There's a tobacconist!
We asked!
Madam, have you seen a red car go by?
Let's see, 3 cars passed by, but I'd say...
It was a two-door!
-A sports car!
I don't understand anything about cars. (Phone)
Yes, hello?
What a surprise, it's you, Ume?
Is everything all right?
Eh it's been 3 minutes since we arrived.
He must have escaped by now.
Look at it, please!
The red car!
It's that one over there!
His engine has stopped again!
Let's follow it!
(Think) "No, this time it's different!
"There was no car there!
Has he gone back?
Why?"
-This time we'll catch it!
-We won't let him get away!
All right, we got him!
A little more!
(brakes)
(Brakes) What?!
This is...?
A police station?!
Officer, detingui'm.
I've run over a girl and I've run away!
You surrender ?!
After running over you, the first moment has fled,
but he has realized what he has done and has decided to surrender.
What a disappointment!
I wanted to make him see the power of the League of Detectives!
Conan, did anything happen?
No, nothing special...
She has very serious injuries, Ayumi?
Fortunately, she just got a few scrapes.
It won't be necessary to admit her.
Then you'll be going home today.
Y-You must be looking forward to it.
I'm not...
I've lost the Detective League communicator.
In the onslaught, you must have dropped it.
The police told me it was gone.
I'll ask the professor to make me another one.
You're serious?
What a joy!
That's why I like you so much, Conan!
You play dirty, Conan.

Loving you-won her with gifts is cheating.
(Think) Oh mother...
Hey, children, come with me, let's go to industrial district 4!
Inspector Megure is waiting for us!
It is the place where we have passed before.
What happened, Kogoro?
A person died in a factory.
It looks like a murder.
(All) What?
Did you understand?
You stay here!
Good morning, Inspector!
Oh, so you've come!
The situation is this:
the victim is the president of the factory, Hisashi Ishikura.
He's 50 years old.
This looks like a robbery.
Yes, investigations are proceeding along the lines of a robbery-murder.
The factory was closed today,
but Mr. Ishikura had come by himself to examine the items.
(Thinking) "Tape marks on the mouth and wrist....
"So, he was tied up. But why?
Why did they go to the trouble of removing it?
The killer..."
Don't wander around the crime scene!
I'm sorry!
(Think) The back door is diagonal to the tobacconist.
We're waiting for the details of the autopsy,
but death took place an hour and a half ago.
That's about the time we passed this way.
Of course it is!
Are you sure?
At that time, did you see anyone suspicious?
Even if so, then...
We were so aware of the man who ran over the Ayumi...
Isn't this him here?
Mi-te, look at the guy in the second row!
Yes, it's the man who ran over the Ayumi and ran away!
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure!
And it must not be him, the murderer?
It can't be, it must be a coincidence.
How could he steal and murder in the middle of the escape from the hit-and-run?
The children were following me
and I stopped the car in the street behind the factory.
I didn't stop the car in front of the back door.
let alone committed a murder.
It's all a coincidence.
This man is a former employee of that factory.
He was dismissed for violent behavior.
So it could be him!
-Is it really him?! - That's impossible.
Why? Because at that moment we were in front of the factory.
Because at that moment we were in front of the factory.
While the children have lost sight of him, he may have entered from behind.
However, we have the statement of the lady of the tobacconist.
I did not see any car stop anywhere.
Neither behind the factory nor in the street.
The tobacconist is right in front of the access door to the factory.
It is a reliable witness.
So, maybe yes, it must be a coincidence?
(He thinks) "No, behind these cases there is something hidden!
There is something we have not seen, something absurd."
Conan, even if something is going around in your head?
Let's go to Ayumi's house to pay her a visit!
You go on by.
No!
The Junior Detective League is a team, we work together!
I'll buy myself an orange soda.
My throat is dry.
If you want orange soda, there you go, at the tobacconist's.
Was that Wataru?
Too bad, he was such a formal guy....
(Think) Hey ?!
Wait, wait!
Hey, lady!
When the crime was committed, did someone call you by mistake?
Oh, now that you mention it, they called twice by mistake.
(Think) I thought so!
You've distracted him!
Thank you, madam!
Good bye!
What's the matter, Conan?
Genta, put me on your shoulders.
Shoulders?
Is there anything?
(thinks) "I knew it!
"I thought so!
"Eh?
I got it.
So it was here!"
What do you mean?!
That I'm carrying Kenichi Shishido, the one from the hit-and-run?!
Okay, Mouri!
(Think) And now at Kogoro.
(Phone)
(Megure voice) Mouri?
It's me, in Megure.
Come to the factory in industrial district 4.
Thank you very much, officers.
Where is Inspector Megure?
(At the same time) We were waiting for you!
Casum dena!
What the hell are you doing here?!
Inspector Megure will be here soon.
Wait here for a while, until he arrives.
Oh!
You're such attentive children.
Oh!
Here we are...
At least... I would have liked to have a little sip...
Well, it went just as you told us in Conan.
On the scene, he has become "The Sleeping Kogoro".
Good thing he didn't see that the can was full of water.

-Conan, where are you? What should we do now?
(Kogoro voice) Conan explained everything to me.
I'll take care of the rest.
This is not fair, sir!
Don't worry, you'll play your part too.
-Hail!
It's a deal! -It's a deal!
Mouri, I've taken her to you!
Why do you want it? Mr. Shishido already knows.
Why should he know?
This morning, you ran over a little girl and ran away.
You drove the children who were chasing you here,
where the factory is,
and where Mr. Ishikura was, whom you had a grudge against.
Hey, what do you want from me?
I see you are forcing me to tell you.
It is you, Mr. Shishido, who murdered Mr. Ishikura!
Let's take it one step at a time.
What are these accusations!
There is not the slightest possibility that he is the murderer!
The fact that the murder was committed while he was on the run
made him off the hook.
That's right.
There you have the witnesses.
The children who were chasing me!
But that was a preconceived plan.
What if he had engineered the whole thing
because he wanted the kids to be his witnesses?
What?!
What do you mean by that?
In other words,
what if running over the Ayumi and running off
was a cover to camouflage the murder?
You mean he is capable of doing something like that?
According to Conan's comments,
she sometimes slowed down and stopped unnaturally.
At no time was she out of sight.
He was doing it because he was being followed.
The car was not in good condition!
It's true, Mouri!
The spark plug in the engine was in bad condition!
A breakdown of this type could even cause an amateur.
As you wish..., but even if that were the case, I have an alibi!
A perfect alibi!
Yes, sir... The children have only lost sight of him for 3 minutes!
In 3 minutes you can't do anything!
Yes, I had more than enough... enough to get in here.
It's ridiculous!
If I had stopped the car behind,
the lady at the tobacconist's would have seen me!
Yes, you are well informed!
I had worked here.
It's logical that he knows!
Then, it would be logical for him to know the telephone number of the tobacconist's shop.
No... I don't understand what you're trying to tell me.
You didn't stop the car at the back door!
You came in here on foot!
What was it, from the car?
How did you do it?
Conan!
Yes!
-Co... Conan! -Where did you come from?
Where have you been?
I'll tell you about it.
Let's go see the warehouse I looked at before.
That warehouse?
This car?!
It's just like the one Ayumi ran over.
The license plate matches!
How come we have a car here identical to the hit-and-run car?
I don't know!
He must have changed the license plate to a stolen car.
Mr. Shishido, you worked with sheet metal,
I'm sure it must be very simple for you.
Mr. Ishikura's office was taped up after he put it to sleep with drugs.
after putting him to sleep with some drug.
(Off) "He got into the car, committed the hit-and-run,
and then fled in a hurry.
"Then, to try to make sure the children could catch him,
from time to time he stopped and shortly after he started up again.
"And when he had led the children to the front of the factory, he hid the car in the storeroom,
he hid the car in the warehouse.
"Then he called the lady at the tobacconist's shop,
"passed by while her back was turned to the street...
and entered through the back door.
"Then he murdered Mr. Ishikura,
"he removed the adhesive tape
and left everything as if it had been a robbery.
"He probably broke into the safe first.
"When he came out, he called the tobacconist again.
"Then he has afanayat to take the other car that he had hidden.
He took it out and waited for the children in the street."
You had manipulated the spark plug of the first car
to give to understand that the engine was not well.
That was your car.
-What do you mean, you did it like that?
-It's surprising!
I ran over the girl with the car that was confiscated from me!
You have evidence to the contrary?!
Inspector Takagi,
tell me, the confiscated car, were there any mud splashes left on it?

Splashes?
No, it shone, it looked freshly washed.
Next to the factory there is a puddle!
(Off) "If you drive through it,
the car gets splashed with mud and sticks to it."
Check if that car has mud splashes.
Yes, it does!
On the underbody.
The mud on the car must have fallen at the end of the leak!
If that's the car I ran over,
prove it to me somehow!
With pleasure!
Conan!
Hey, Mitsuhiko!
Request the Ayumi with the communicator!
The communicator?
But if the Ayumi has lost its.
Listen to me, call her.
Yes.
Hello, feel me, Ayumi?!
(Communicator) "If you feel me, answer me.
We'll come to see you in a while."
Mr. Inspector!
In the car there is a communicator!
It's the communicator!
It's Ayumi's communicator!
He dropped it when he ran over her and ran away!
He intended to use us for his alibi,
but we are the evidence that proves his crimes!
Ridiculous!
This can't happen!
This can't happen!

DETECTIVE CONAN
There you go, Ayumi, I found the communicator.
Thank you, Conan!
-Conan...! - You were so close?!
-Quiet, Conan, where did he kiss you? -Let me kiss you! -Let me make you one myself! -Let me make you one!
What?
It's open!
What a lazy family.
A blackout?! Oh!
