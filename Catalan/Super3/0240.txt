Destiny is a clue to deductions.
It is a light that sheds light on mysterious cases.
Today's scenario is a bullet train.
There is a locked room inside another room.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is Detective Conan!
Something 's just not right!

THE TRANSFER CASE, (PART ONE)
(Mobile: beep-beep)
(Beep-beep)
(Beep-beep)
I don't know what to choose.
Hey, Ran, isn't that your cell phone ringing?
(Beep-beep)
Who should call me?
(Beep-beep)
(Beep-beep) Ah!
"Unknown number"?
(Beep-beep)
Blow!
It must be the love call you were expecting from your Shinichi.
(Beep-beep) What?
Come on, put it on right away, lest it explode.
That's not necessary.
Besides, it's an unknown number.
Look here.
Don't say these things and answer, come on, come on!
Eeeh?
Don't worry, I won't be in your way.
I'm leaving now.
Eh... Yes, hello?
Eh?
Shinichi?
Shinichi...!
Shinichi!
How long?
And a black good! (Kazuha) Mr. Mouri.
You must be worried, eh?
Well no, child, not in the least.
Ah, just the wood!
I've already told you.
There's no way to talk to you.
Yes, but...
But how did you know, that we're in Osaka?
(Shinichi voice) What?
Ah, it's... It's that Heiji called me.
(Shinichi voice) What?
Cheeky, more than cheeky!
You do call him, huh?
Ah.
No-it's just a coincidence.
You know, because of the K3 thing...
"Because there's been an event, right?"
I mean, what could I possibly choose?
But I don't need anything to eat.
Maybe I'll buy a diary.
-You've bought one before.
Ah... Ran, what do you have?
Shi-Shinichi, listen...
have you heard about this case?
Eh?
Yeah..., I saw it on the news this morning.
You're talking about the Ray Curtis case, right?
Although... I don't quite believe it though.
(Thinking) "Kudo..."
Then... then, too... Shinichi...
"The truth is, I asked him for a..."
Ah... You mean the...
"From the uniform with Ray's autograph?"
That's right.
"It was explained to me on the phone."
"How can you even think of doing this nonsense?"
But I wanted to...
I'm sorry... but you'll have to keep it for me until I get home.
A lot has happened, but nothing will change...
the fact that in Ray he'll always be my hero on the soccer fields.
"Thank you very much, Ran."
"Well, I have to go investigate a number of things."
Wait, wait a minute, Shinichi.
(Heart: beats)
Ran, you don't want to know?
Don't you want to know how Shinichi feels?
You'd better know.
"What do you want?"
Shi-Shinichi, you...?
Yes, Ran.
Tell him!
Shinichi...
Shinichi, do you...
do you feel something, do you feel something for...?
(Train: shrill whistle)
(Megaphone: woman) "Shin-Osaka Station."
"Nozomi number 54 bound for Tokyo will depart at 14:26..."
"I feel your train coming." My train?
"I'll call you when I have some time again."
Yes, okay... Wait a second!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Stop the car!
The conversation is not over.
(Phone: tut-tut)
Oh, no...
Already hung up.
I couldn't do anything.
Shinichi is too busy.
-What's wrong, Kazuha?
-Ah, Heiji.
What is it, those screams?
It's just that Shinichi called the Ran...
and he hung up on him at the crucial moment.
That's not it either...
What moment?
You know... He was getting romantic.
Well, well... So, in Kudo he must have hung up to run away from study.
Eeeh? Eeeh?
You know, in Kudo he's a coward.
He-he-he-he-he!
(Thinks) "You'll pay for this..."
(Acoustic signal: ring)
Listen to me, Ran.
Don't throw spinning balls.
Throw direct balls.
Straight! Yes.
(Train: whistle)

You must place them right in the middle.
Throw direct balls and you will win!
Raaaaaaan!
(Kogoro) Ran, what's wrong?
You have to play baseball... soon?
Uh, yeah..., sort of.
(Man) No straight balls.
It's better to throw balls with spin to get a feel for it.
No.
Wait...
Eh?
Mr. Mouri!
Inspector Takagi!
What?
Transfer a detainee?
Xxxt.
Mr. Mouri, don't call.
Please don't call.
Ah, sorry, sorry, sorry, kid.
And listen: what has he done, this man?
His name is Senza Ogura.
He's a drug dealer.
We were just short of arresting him in Tokyo, but he slipped through.
Since he's from Kansai,
we organized a raid in the region and he fell into our trap.
I think I read about it in the newspaper.
Today he is being transferred from Osaka to the metropolitan headquarters.
I could swear they found a large quantity of narcotics
at his home in Tokyo.
Yes.
We have high expectations.
We hope you will confess the name of your boss, for everyone's sake?
Don't we?
Coffee.
Eh?
I want you to give me coffee.
We'll have to give it to you.
Takagi, can you go get some?
Yes.
Bring us a cold one and a canned one.
If it occurred to him to throw the hot coffee in the picture to distract us...
and take advantage of it to run away... we'd be all set.
Let's see if I have... coins.
You do.
It's a ticket
for the Ichizo Sanada Magician's illusion show!
Blow, are you going to see it?
Ah, it's... for my day off...
Gee, Takagi, do you like this kind of thing?
Not really... Actually...
I was invited by Yumi from Traffic.
I had an extra ticket...
Eh?
Yumi?
She did?
But I told her I wasn't interested in going.
Hey, Takagi.
Say.
Why not?
You could go.
You'll tell me what tricks he uses.
Hey, now...
You tell the Miwako, as if you don't want anything,
that I invited you to go out with me.
What's that?
If she turns pale, it means she has feelings for you.
If she turns pale... ah...
With girls like Miwako, straight balls are forbidden.
You have to go in with a spin ball and feel her out.
-What's wrong with you?
Takagi? -Huh?
Ah, yes.
I'll be right there!
We'll go back to our seats.
(Thinking) "I knew it,
"My spin ball has been... a failure."
We'll see Fuji-san soon.
What's up?
Something seems to have happened.
(Kogoro) Something happened?
Maybe it's a case...
I'll take care of going to the bathroom just in case.
-You stay here, Takagi.
(Kogoro) -All right.
Please let me through.
It's, it's this sink...
"Contains a bomb. Do not touch."
When did you find it?
A passenger let us know.
I don't think it's been here long.
Well, thank you very much.
There's a lot of passengers gathered there in the back.
Looks like something did happen.
Oh, boy.
I'll be right back.
I'm going to see what's going on.
Ah.
Wait, wait, wait!
Can't you see it's dangerous? Hold still.
Hey, inspector...
May I go to the bathroom?
I've been holding on, but I don't think I can hold out until Tokyo.
Wait a moment, we'll go when Sato comes back.
Didn't I tell you that I can't hold on any longer?
Don't you understand me?!
I might as well piss right here?!
Eh?
No, please...
Wow, what a rage... Eh?
I'm sorry about that.
What a nerve.
Where, Inspector Takagi?
In the washroom, the washroom.
He-he-he.
(Clock: ticking)
-Inspector... -What did you find?
-Do you feel something?
Yes, you feel a clock.
(At the same time) Quèèèèèèèèèè ?!
We must evacuate the passengers from this carriage right now...
and tell the conductor to stop the train.
(Alarm clock: alarm)
(Ring)
Eh?
(Ring)
-It was just a joke. (ring)
(People: sighs of relief)
I'd like to talk to the first... person who found it.
Hey, master.
You haven't finished yet?
Don't come to me in a hurry, Inspector.
Don't think it's so easy, I only have one hand free.
Which one do you think.
By the way, inspector, I felt you were saying something earlier.
That they would make me confess the name of my head.
I'm sorry, but this will be impossible.
Because soon I will be a little bird that will never sing again!
(Groan of pain)
(groan of pain) -Huh? - (groans)
Hey, wait a minute!
(groans) What?

Where, where did you get it from?
Where did you get it from, this knife?
Ah... Now it's the same, I have to tell the Sato...
I can't!
The cell phone has no reception, inside the tunnel.
Shit, I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back... I'll be right back.
Don't move.
What?!
What did you say?
That the prisoner is wounded in the bathroom?
He's cut open his stomach with a knife.
How can that be?
He didn't have any kind of knife on him!
It's true, but... when I opened the door, there was blood all over the place.
Come see for yourself, Sato.
I'll see for myself, Sato.
Sato, it's here.
Right here!
Hurry up!
He's pulled it out!
He's pulled the knife out of his body!
He's hopeless.
It's hopeless.
He's already dead.
I-It can't be.
(Thinking) "It's not normal."
"This scene of events is not normal."
What?!
That the detainee we were transferring has committed suicide?!
"Alcornocraneo!"
May I know what they did, the one and the other?!
Ah... look... the thing is that I took the detainee to the bathroom and suddenly...
"I felt a groan of pain."
"When I opened the door,
"I saw that he had stuck the knife in his stomach."
"Then I went to report it to the Sato
"And I taped my handle to the sink counter."
"And after securing it to the sink, I went to tell her."
Even if he was badly wounded,
I found it dangerous to have a detainee with a knife in the passenger car.
to be in the passenger car.
Later, when I returned with Sato,
we saw that the knife had been pulled out and that he had bled to death.
I will come to Tokyo Station with forensics and officers.
No one is to enter the bathroom until we arrive!
Yes, sir...
That a policeman has made the mistake
allowing a detainee to commit suicide during a transfer is serious.
This can result in a reprimand,
a reduction in pay and even suspension.
(Sato) No, no.
If you are not careful, it can mean a dismissal without honors.
Poor inspector... Poor inspector...
You too, Sato?
What's wrong with you?!
-It seems not... -(mobile)
Yes, hello?
It's me, Takagi.
"Hello, is that you, Takagi? It's me, Yumi."
- "Eh? Yumi?"
-Tell me how it went.
You know: the grand plan of love tickets.
"Has the Miwako gotten jealous? Or hasn't she reacted?"
Come on, tell me about it.
How did it go?
How did it go?
Now is not the time to talk about these things!
Don't make inopportune calls to me!
(Phone: tut-tut)
I knew it.
An honorable defeat.
What did he say, Yumi?
Ah, nothing..., it's of no consequence.
(Kogoro) The problem is the knife he used to kill himself.
Yes.
He was no magician.
It's impossible that the detainee we were transferring
could be carrying a knife without the police noticing.
He is not a magician.
This man is a samurai.
Look at the knife on the floor.
And look at the position it's in.
The knife was facing upwards.
He must have taken it this way, right?
He stuck the knife in his stomach just like the samurai.
Hey, Takagi...,
how did he take the knife, when he stuck it in his stomach?
Upside down, of course.
That way it was easier for him to stick it in.
The other way around, dear inspector.
To stick it in, you hold it upside down;
to pull it out, no.
So, it looks like someone else has pulled the knife out of you?
Ha-ha.
That's impossible.
Speaking of strange things.
There's something weird about this blood, too.
The blood that's been splattered and the blood from the knife has hardened
and now it looks like jelly.
But the one on his hand hasn't hardened yet.
It's so liquid it looks like water.
So, the one in his hand is not exactly blood?
But from the color, though it looks like it.
(Sato) Heparin.
-He... Heparin? (Sato) -Yes.
Perhaps they have mixed blood with heparin.
With that anticoagulant?
Yes...
Normally the blood coagulates after a short time
and becomes difficult to transport.
But if you mix it with heparin and put it in a bag,
you can use it to simulate a wound.
If-if it's prepared blood... It can't be...
That's right.
Someone had previously hidden the blood and the knife in the sink.
Everything was perfectly studied.

It is a full-fledged murder.
We have fallen into the trap.
(Thinks) "What's this?"
"There's something, in this blood-soaked hand at the ready."
Gentlemen, can we have your diaries?
And Mr. Tokuyama, don't forget the coffee can, please.
(Thinking) "I was right. The murderer did say something strange. That man..."
And the next Conan: "The transfer case, (second part)"
("Always")

(Heart) Always give my life!
Always give my life to you!
Always give my life!
Always give my love to you!
(Girl) Son Jana?
Ima kara de mo.
