"My name is Shinichi Kudo and I am a young detective."
"One day I went to an amusement park with the Ran,
and there I saw a suspicious exchange between some men in black."
"I was so engrossed in watching them that I didn't see a third man."
"He gave me a blow and made me drink a potion,
and my body shrank."
"If they found out Shinichi was alive,
the people around me would be in danger."
"When the Ran asked me the name, I said....
Conan Edogawa!"
"And to get information from those men,
I went to live at Ran's house, since his father is a detective."

The murder of the university professor
(Ayumi) Guys, you know it?
There's a new student arriving in class today!
Gee, are you serious?!
Conan was the last one to arrive.
How will it be?
I want a beautiful girl!
No, no, Genta.
Whether boy or girl, the most important thing is the character!
What do you say, Conan?
How do you think it will be, the new one?
What do you think, the new one?
I don't know...
Maybe he surprises us and turns out to be a study maniac.
So, he could be a kid, right?
But you haven't seen him, when he was in the teachers' lounge?
No.
But I heard his last name.
It's Haibara.
Haibara?
Yes!
"Hai" for ash and "bara" for plain.
That's strange... It's more normal than Conan's.
(Think) "Screw you."
(Students) Oooooh!
-It's a girl! -(All) Hooray!
(All) Ooooh!
How beautiful!
(All) - Children, take your places. (All) -Yes, yes!
(All) "It's not to make such a fuss. A girl has arrived and quite a lot.
As of today, we have a new student with us.
Her name is Ai Haibara!
Feu's-in very friendly.
(All) YES!
That's the way I like it, an enthusiastic response.
And now, Haibara, you seuràs....
Miss!
Next to me there is a free place!
Come, come here!
Eeeh?
Much like.
Eh, ya...
What does she think?
What a stupid girl!
-What a girl.
-Surely she's nervous.
Ow, ow, children!
Class is starting!
(All) Yesssssss!
(Ayumi) Haibara!
Shall we go back together?
Do you want to?
-Leave her alone!
She's a scoundrel! -But...
Excuse me, where's your house?
You just moved in, didn't you?
No need to pay compliments, we'll see you home.
Second Beika Island, number 22.
This is the place where I'm living now.
Eh? What's wrong?
Ah, nothing...
(Think) "If she lives on the second island of Beika 22, she's my neighbor."
"But there is no block of apartments or apartments nearby,
nor do I remember any Haibara's house."
Eh!
What's wrong with you now?
Can't it be, you like that turkey?
No, no, it's not that!
You're wrong.
The Junior Detective League?
You guys?
We are on duty 24 hours a day to solve complicated cases.
Haibara, will you join our group?
Is Edogawa also part of it?
Yes, this little rascal is my assistant!
The orders are placed at the ticket office in Genta!
They give us the letters with the orders!
The teachers don't know anything!
(He thinks) Well, he sings a lot.
We can't keep up!
We always find it full of letters with riddles!
Eh ?!
There are none...
There are usually many, today's is just a coincidence...
(Think) Believe it, there are not always...
Come on, let's go back home and play soccer!

-Yes, we make a match! -Good thinking!
Hey, wait!
There's one!
An order!
You're serious?
Yes.
After classes, we are expected in the first class A!
Well then, let's go without wasting time!
Everyone to First A!
Haibara, you come, too.
Hurry up!
(Genta) Who has disappeared from home?!
Yes!
My brother has suddenly disappeared!
-Maybe he's been kidnapped. Wait, Genta, don't run so fast.
-We've already had cases semblants.-Yes, now that you say it....
This "Brother" must not be a cat.
Of course not!
It was my older brother.
He disappeared one day at sunset a week ago!
He said he was going to a friend's house and never came back.
The police have been looking for him too, but they haven't found him.
I thought I could do something...
Has he received any blackmail calls?
A call?
No, we haven't received any.
He hasn't run away from home?
My brother would never run away from home!
Because he, because...
Because my brother and I get along very well!
But maybe he had some reason to do what he did.
We can go to your house to take a look at it.
We don't make assumptions.
We don't make assumptions. Thank you!
The Junior Detective League springs into action!
Haibara, let's go!
My house is here where the patrol car is parked.
Wow, how cool, a patrol car!
It's the special patrol car model.
How cool, they've made a lot of modifications!
Wow, you mean?
What is it, the radio?
It's the thing on the driver's side.
We could order Chinese food with it, right?
(Mitsuhiko) A pizza.
(Thinking) Stop.
What's he supposed to have come?
After you find out something, report it to the police station.
Thank you for your help.
Thanks for all you do, officers!
Hey, Toshiya!
Are they friends of yours?
-Yes, they are. (Vez) -Good afternoon, madam!
Come in, come in.
Toshiya, shall I take something from you?
Don't worry, madam, we're leaving right away!
Ah, ah, understood...
Well, I'll be in the kitchen.
Excuse me, but the mother has my brother in her head all the time.
It's understandable.
Let's go to your brother's room.
(Genta) Wow!
It's very tidy.
Is it here, where we should look for clues? That's right!
-Oh! -That's...
Look how nice, Conan!
They are slippers with built-in inner tubes!
(thinks) You fools, can't you see you're wrong?
Don't take things out of place.
No!
But with this, we know that you really like branded stuff!
Is he a brand-nut? I don't know...
These slippers are a gift from our uncle in America.
(At the same time) Ah, well...
So, he's not a brand-nut!
Hey, Conan!
No matter how hard we look, we don't find anything...
Don't you think maybe he's run away from home?
No, it doesn't go that way.
Is this your brother's wallet?
If he had run away, he would have taken it with him.
Lla... so, my brother...
An accident.
Or maybe he was involved in some incident.
(Ayumi laughs) How bad!
What are they, these pictures?
There are strange pictures!
(Genta) Oh!
How ugly!
What a handful!
Who has painted it, this ugly picture?
Picasso.
(Genta) It's true!
It's a copy of Picasso's "Weeping Woman"!
Van Gogh, Monet, Gauguin, Utrillo...
They are identical copies!
My brother painted them!
In high school art class, he's very good at imitating.
Hey, wait.
They kidnapped her to force him to paint pictures?
They force him to fake paintings and sell them as the real thing.
No, that's not it either.
The drawing is very rigorous,
the use of colors and brushstrokes are not very elaborate.
It does not reach the perfection that a forgery would have.
nor is it a kidnapping for money.
It is this painting that worries me.
This man looks familiar.
It is Soseki Natsume.
My brother admires him very much.
He likes this painting very much.
He presented it at an exhibition!
But because he made it from a photo,
all the people criticized him.
The only one who complimented him was a strange woman.
Strange?
It was a woman who wore a hat with wide brimmed wings
and she was dressed in black.
What a ?
And when was that?
When did you meet her?
About... about 10 days ago.
Was there a man dressed in black?!
Yes, there were two of them.
There were two of them.
(thinks) "It can't be!"

What's wrong with you, Conan?
"It can't be! It can't be!"
"It can't be!"
Take me somewhere your brother might have gone!
The wallet and the money and the bicycle are also at home!
It's possible that they were left around here and took it!
-If we investigate around here... Maybe we'll find out something.
Come on, let's go!
Ah, wait for us, Conan!
(man) The sunset of a week ago?
Let me think... I don't think she came.
A woman in black would attract attention but I don't remember seeing her.
(Think) "casum!"
"Coffee shops, arcades, department stores, galleries..."
"There is absolutely no one who saw it that day..."
"But why the hell are we wasting our time doing this?"
"The police must have already canvassed all these places."
"The clues are too scarce!"
"There's nothing? Isn't there something else?"
"Something!"
What do you say we go into the supermarket?
I've got a thirst...
How cool!
Thank you very much, good bye.
Hello, good morning.
It's 430 yen.
Thank you very much.
See you later.
One of "Seven Mild".
Here's your change, 770 yen.
I'll see you later.
What's up, Conan?
He pays for a pack of cigarettes with a 1,000 bill.
Maybe he didn't have any coins.
He could have bought from the machines in front of the store.
He didn't need to pay at the cash register.
He must have finished the brand he wanted.
Excuse me!
Can you show me the bill this gentleman gave you?
Let me see it!
Ah!
What are you doing?
(Thinking) No watermark on it!
Well, I was right.
Stop it!
What's wrong with you, kid?!
Co... Conan?!
What have you got now?
Call the police, quick, it's a counterfeit bill.
What?
What do you mean, boy!?!
-Wait, Conan! -Wait!
(Conan!
What's wrong with you?
(Ayumi) Wait!
What's gotten into you?
You came out saying the bill was counterfeit.
This man bought tobacco with a 1,000 bill, didn't he?
Even though he had the machine in front of him, he went to the cashier.
He wanted to use a bill that he couldn't get through any machine!
It's easy to slip a counterfeit bill!
But this has nothing to do with my brother disappearing, does it?
It has a lot to do with it!
In your brother's painting, there was the image of a person.
Soseki Natsume.
Soseki Natsume goes out to the banknotes of...
Lla... then, my brother...
Yes, maybe they have noticed her drawing ability,
kidnapped her and forced her to forge banknotes.
I can't say that the man is one,
but he could be an accomplice of those who shrunk me.
Those men in black... Shrink?
You swallowed it!
I was joking!
I was just pulling your leg!
(Thinking) "What a blunder!"
"I can't involve this group in such a dangerous matter."
"And if we go on like this, I'm going to lose track of that man."
"All right! Then, I'll do that!"
Conan!
Hey!
You, sir!
You dropped this!
This 1,000 bill is yours, isn't it?
Co... Conan!
Since you had dropped the money,
I've been following him to return it!
-I don't know why.
Why?
-We have to look for his germ. And it's getting dark.
We'll have to keep looking for him tomorrow.
Go to Toshiya's house to look for the wallets.
I have to go somewhere else.
No triguisNo!
So far!
(Think) "Show up!"
"That man has taken the ticket with the adhesive transmitter!"
"I just have to follow the direction the glasses show me."
Haibara, don't fall behind!
"If I were one of them...
it will guide me to the place where the men in black are!"
"Oh! The station?"
"A... a tobacconist?"
"No, it can't be."
That man in the black cap, yes, he has come!
He bought a 110-yen can of coffee with a 1,000-yen bill.
Are you serious?
I found it rude,
and besides, the bill had a sticker on it.
What else do you know?
Which way did you go?
Well, after he bought the can, he's called from this phone.
He has taken out all the coins he had, he has made a pile,

and he talked until he ran out, about 10 minutes.
The change, did he ask you to give it to him in 100 and 10 coins?
Yes, but since I didn't have any 100s, I gave it to him as best I could.
(Think) "The change they gave you at the supermarket is 770 yen."
"One 500, two 100s, one 50 and two 10s."
"If we add the 890 yen change from the tobacconist,
I could only use:
5 100-yen coins and 11 10-yen coins, 610 yen."
"If we assume that he already had coins, the amount rises..."
"More than 610 yen for 10 minutes? A long-distance call?"
"She must have boarded the train to meet where her caller is waiting for her!"
"No, calling a cell phone from a pay phone,
it costs 10 yen per second."
"I still have a chance."
Excuse me, my boy.
Do you know the man in the black cap?
Yes, sort of...
Well, I'm glad.
Give him this for me, please.
What's that?
50 yen?
He was so nervous,
and he got careless when he took the change from the machine.
Which machine did he leave them at?
The one where there is no one now.
Do you know which button you pressed?!
Let's see...
There's a 500 yen coin in it,
and I heard the sound of the change coins, but I didn't see it.
Well, I didn't notice it, kid.
Thank you!
I'm going to Búscalos to return the coin.
Good bye.
Ah, thank you.
(thinks) "If you heard the noise of the coins falling
it means that there were more than 3."
"Putting in his one 500,
the station that gives more than 3 coins of change along with a 50...
500 minus 320... the answer, one 100 yen coin,
one 50 and 3 10's, 5 in total."
"It comes out to 180 yen change."
"It's Daitoma Station!"
