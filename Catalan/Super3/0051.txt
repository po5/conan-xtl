DETECTIVE CONAN
The golf course murder
Where did he go?
Isn't he wasting his time?
In Kogoro he will never learn.
He has always said that golf is not his forte.
Why didn't he say no?
"At Kogoro he wanted to learn to play golf for a specific reason."
An amateur golf tournament for charity?
Thank you, but golf is not my.... What?!
Yoko Okino has selected me?!
Will you also participate, Yoko?
I'll come, I'll come!
Although I don't look like it, I'm a great golfer!
(Thinking) "Yes... yes..."
"Even if the early morning rates are cheaper,
it wouldn't be necessary to make us come at 2/4 of 7 in the morning."
Come on, we need to work up a good sweat today too.
It goes very well, working out before going to work.
Mr.
Tachibana, I'm in good shape thanks to you.
(Tachibana) You can say it!
What's the matter, Minami?
Do you have a stomach ache?
Always inopportune.
Hurry up, go to the bathroom.
(Thinking) "Third try."
"Let's see when I get to send a ball on the field."
I'm going to watch someone else.
Don't get in the way, okay?
-Mr. Tachibana, here.
Tachibana, here.
-Ah, thank you.
(Thinking) "He's an ass-kisser, this one."
Kid, don't go through here, it's dangerous.
But I can stand here and watch, can't I?
The repair of Mr. Tachibana's cane will be paid for by the department.
Yes, very well, you understand.
You see?
I was telling you, it was dangerous.
You're absolutely right.
(metallic noise)
Very good sir, Tachibana!
Caram had not seen anyone... that the ball came out with so much force.
We already know who will win the tournament this Sunday!
What's the matter?
It's already over, this guy?
This gentleman has finished the balls in a moment as if nothing.
And before starting, he gave his balls to the director.
So he's an ass-kisser.
Well done!
Very good, sir.
Your baton, sir.
(Kogoro) Shit!
Hold still!
You missed another swing?
Yes, it's the twentieth.
Mr. Tachibana!
(Kogoro) Sir!
Quiet!
Please gentlemen, don't touch him.
This man is dead.
Ran, Inspector Megure is calling.
D'accord.
Oh!
What the hell happened here?
Probably a bomb must have exploded, sir.
A bomb?
(He thinks) "This strong and characteristic smell...
is gunpowder..."
Mr. Ohkubo!
There's no need to call an ambulance.
There's a hospital next door.
You're hurt, too.
I'm fine, but Mr. Ohkubo needs help!
Ohkubo needs help!
OK, OK, OK!
The dead man is the head of Goi Electronics' department, Mr.
Tachibana.
And who are you?
My name is Sho Yasui, the deputy director.
He is at Tatsuya Ohkubo, and he is at Minami.
We all work in the product development department.
And you come here often?
Yes, we have the company near here.
Today, we were celebrating Mr. Tachibana's farewell.
Tachibana's farewell.
The farewell?
He had to go to work at the New York branch.
Inspector...
We know it's gunpowder that caused the explosion.
Would you mind coming here for a moment?
This is a fragment of the golf club,
but the rest of the scattered fragments are from the ball.
Take a look at this, please.
This? This must be the fuse from the golf club.
It must be the fuse from the bomb, probably.
All this evidence indicates that the bomb was inside the ball
and exploded when Mr. Tachibana hit it.
That's right.
Mr.
Katsuta, do all golf balls have red stripes?
No, they have a blue stripe.
A blue stripe?
Look at them, Mr. Inspector.
I see, it's a blue stripe, and a single stripe.
So, these red lines were a sign...

to distinguish the ball from the bomb.
You are right, Kogoro,
but we don't know whether they intended to kill M.
Tachibana or anyone else.
I would say it would be prepared by Mr.
Tachibana.
Ah, why do you say so?
Because all 3 of them, both Mr.
Ohkubo, Mr.
Yasui, and myself...
resented Mr. Tachibana, deep down.
Tachibana, deep down.
What do you mean?!
Minami!
What's wrong with you?
Shut up Sho, Minami is right.
We all had a reason to kill him.
I invented 3 new products,
and Mr.
Tachibana has always taken the credit.
For many new ideas you proposed, he would not accept any of them.
He would completely sideline us.
No, no.
I didn't have any problem.
Come on, Sho, don't be a liar.
You had a girlfriend and Mr.
Tachibana took her from you.
She fell in love with someone else, no one took her from me.
Inspector Megure!
I got it!
I've got it!
I know who the murderer is!
Kogoro!
What do you say now?
Yes.
And I also know how he committed the crime, Inspector Megure.
The murderer has mixed the ball from the bomb with the other balls,
put them in the machine, and gave it to the victim.
What we have to find out now
is who put the ball in his vending machine.
It was this man, Mr. Ohkubo.
I was looking at them,
and Yasui went to his machine.
It must have been you, Tatsuya.
En Minami and I haven't touched Mr.
Tachibana.
Therefore, you are the only person who could have planted the bomb.
It doesn't necessarily have to be that way, Mr. Yasui.
It is clear from the evidence that Mr. Minami is not a suspect at all.
Minami is not a suspect at all.
But in your case, Mr.
Yasui, it is not so clear.
Because we have seen that you have passed your balls to the victim.
Yes, but I...
And you were able to put the bomb in Mr. Tachibana's machine.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
If I had done that, the explosion could have killed me too,
because I was playing on the track on his side!
These kinds of machines are made in such a way
that the last balls that go in, come out at the end.
You've finished throwing your before Mr.
Tachibana, right?
You haven't rushed to throw before the one with the bomb came out?
No, sir, I didn't!
I have a habit of throwing balls in a hurry.
Isn't that right, Tatsuya?
Minami...
And another thing.
When the explosion occurred, where were you?
We'll be able to eliminate Mr. Ohkubo from the list of suspects.
Ohkubo from the list of suspects.
Because, like Mr.
Minami, he was near the site of the explosion,
and he was also injured by the blast wave.
And you, on the other hand, were near the exit.
Yes, but... but... but...
Don't fool us anymore.
Didn't you see how the ball came out of the red stripes
and went to take shelter?
No!
I went to order some coffees.
Some coffees?
Mr.
Mr. Tachibana always felt like having a cup of coffee
when the training session was over.
And I always went to ask the golf director's wife for it.
That's true, what Mr. Yasui says, sir.
Since we grind our coffee, I tell them to tell me ahead of time.
But the fact that you left before the bomb went off
doesn't say much for you.
You are the most suspicious.
So you think the killer is Mr. Yasui.
Yasui.
I'd put my hand in the fire.
What's he saying?
Are you joking?
It's not me, the killer, really!
Sir, it's just a formality, but can we search the bag?
No, Inspector, of course not.
(Think) "So far, strange as it may seem,
Kogoro's deductions are correct."
"But if Mr. Yasui is the murderer..."
Inspector, look what I found!
This is...
It can't be!
This is impossible!
Now that's conclusive proof!
He must have had a spare in case the other one failed.
How clever!
I had never seen it before, me, this ball!
I still can't believe it.
What a simple case!
It was like taking candy from a small child!
It's so simple, it even makes you laugh.
(Thinking) "This is too simple to be true."
"Maybe Mr. Yasui didn't care what happened to him."
"It can't be."
"Something has passed us by."

"Something I haven't seen myself."
"Eh? Ball's still on the tee."
"Looks to me like you missed another swing."
"Wait a minute, if I'm not mistaken..."
(metallic noise)
"I thought it was Kogoro's ball,
the one that had touched the metal fence...
but now I see that it can't be."
"Well, what was that noise?"
"It smells like gunpowder."
"This means that the ball that the victim threw was this one,
and the noise was made by the ball when it hit the metal fence. "
"What are those fragments of the ball that exploded?"
"I've got it! I know how he did it!"
"Sure, he's the killer!"
He'll explain it to us at headquarters.
"Hell no! I have to hurry!"
"I'll use the usual tactic."
Oh!
Ooooooooh...
Inspector, you must believe me, please.
Please.
Seriously, I'm not the killer.
I swear.
(Kogoro voice) It's true... you're not the murderer, Mr.
Yasui.
Father!
Listen, Inspector Megure, the first mistake we've made today
is to think that the victim has bitten a ball containing a bomb.
Kogoro, what are you doing now?
We found a fragment of the ball containing the fuse here on the ground.
Exactly, that is undeniable.
But, now take a good look at this.
I found this ball behind the netting under the fence.
If you smell it, you'll smell gunpowder.
Yes, it's Vertières.
When the bomb exploded,
M.
Tachibana had thrown this ball,
the one with the blue stripe, which is from the golf club.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, Kogoro, I don't quite understand what you're saying.
That the assassin did not put the ball with the bomb in the machine.
The bomb was on the tip of the club from the beginning.
The assassin is a very clever man.
The explosion took place when Mr. Tachibana was biting the ball,
and the killer knew that if we found fragments of the bomb's ball,
everyone would think it was the ball that exploded.
(Kogoro voice) But after the explosion,
the killer left the ball at the site of the explosion.
But then, this means that the murderer is....
Mr.
Yasui, you have talked about repairing Mr. Tachibana's cane, right?
Yes, Minami told me that there was a crack in the handle.
Oh!
Minami... it was you!
Mr.
Minami, where did you take it to fix, the cane?
Ah, we fixed it.
We also repair golf clubs.
Well... And how did you fix it, this one?
We changed the handle.
The clubs with titanium heads are more common, but this one is special.
The president of the company had given it to Mr. Tachibana.
And he was very, very proud of that golf club.
So it was a club with a wooden head.
When the repaired club was returned to Mr. Minami?
Minami?
The night before last.
What?
You returned the cane to Mr. Tachibana this morning.
Tachibana.
Mr. Minami has had the cane for a day and a night.
Minami has had the cane for a day and a night.
During this time he may have tampered with it.
We will now go over Mr. Minami's actions again.
Minami's actions.
When you arrived this morning...
What's the matter with you?
Do you have a stomachache?
Always inconvenient.
Come on, hurry up, go to the bathroom.
This action was planned, even if it doesn't look like it.
Isn't it true that Mr. Minami always took the balls out of the machine?
And I made him put 10 golf balls
into Mr. Tachibana's vending machine?
Tachibana?
Yes, yes, but...
Today, he made it look like he had a stomach ache,
so he could go to the bathroom
and let him do this job yourself.
Also, to make Yasui look more suspicious,
you had to make him leave when the explosion occurred.
And you didn't need to plan it,
but rather you took advantage of the fact that Mr.
Yasui
was ordering coffee when Mr. Tachibana was picking up his cane.
Tachibana was picking up his cane.
And just to finish off the list of suspects,
Mr. Minami has placed near the site of the explosion.
Inspector, please think about how Mr. Minami was injured.
Minami.
Mr. Ohkubo had injuries all over his body.
Ohkubo had injuries all over his body.
and Mr. Minami, on the other hand.
Minami, however, was only hit on the left side.

Why has he received only from the external part of the left side?
Because as he was forewarned,
he protected his eyes with his left hand
and hid behind the pillar before the explosion occurred.
Mr.
Minami, today was the last day you could kill M.
Tachibana,
because they wanted to transfer him to the New York branch, right?
Hey, wasn't that a little reckless,
using the golf club as a murder weapon,
knowing that you had taken him to be fixed up?
I had long hated Mr. Tachibana.
I was very angry that he didn't recognize my talent.
And I hated Mr. Yasui for playing along with him.
And I thought he would murder M.
Tachibana
and I would pin the blame on Mr. Yasui.
Didn't it hurt you that you could receive other people, with this attack?
Are you aware, that you might have killed or injured innocent people?
It was all the same to me, Inspector.
All right, let's go.
I don't know if it's so true, what you said.
Conan!
He told me...
Child, don't come here, it's dangerous.
It seems to me that in Minami he said it so that I wouldn't get hurt.
You're right, Conan,
maybe in Minami he is a good person who became obsessed
and got a little upset.
Conan, look!
What?
We'll be late for school!

Now it's the turn of the great detective Kogoro Mouri.
Mr. Mouri!
Good luck to you!

I don't know if it will come out.
(Thinking) "Impossible."
