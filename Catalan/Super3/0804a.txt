Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.
We wish you all a very good 2016.
I am sure that, without you,
this year would not have started so well.
That's why I would like to thank you for your unconditional support
and your loyalty on behalf of the entire Conan family.
So, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.
You know what?
It's been 20 years this year since "Detective Conan" went on the air.
We could say, then, that it is the 20th anniversary of the series.
And I must say that we have very special plans
to celebrate this anniversary properly.
Would you like me to explain the first one?
We have prepared a couple of special one-hour episodes for you.
I'm sure you'll love both the first part and the second.
Next, I'll introduce you to a very, very, very special guest.
Attention, he's already here.
Hello everyone.
I'm eBiz Ichikawa, the eleventh of my name.
Now, then, let's leave you with the first part...
of this special New Year's episode.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
boys and girls who follow us from all over the world,
for us it is an honor and a great pride
to present to you a new episode of "Detective Conan".
"The feeling that we have always carried in our hearts
has made us take flight towards the twentieth anniversary."
"A legendary mask from the 'kabuki' theater will be the origin of a case."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The theatrical mystery of Conan and the eBiz (part one)."
(Genta) Ready?
I shoot the corner.
(Mitsuhiko) Oh!
(Mitsuhiko) Got it.
Where are you going so far?
You've gone a little too far, eh.
Don't complain so much, that was the best shot I've taken today.
You just had to pass me the ball.
Do you know why boys like everything about playing ball so much?
No.
Mitsuhiko.
Watch out, it's a long pass.
I've got it.
Aah!
-Hahaha!
-Oh!
It never misses.
(Horn)
(Wheels: squeaking)
Brake fluid!
(Ai) There's a level crossing down there.
Call the police.
Right away.
(Horn honks)
What are you doing, you idiot?
(Ai) Oh!
"If I don't hurry..."
(horn honks) - Oh!
- (honking)
-Hm?
What?
- (horn)
(Car: siren)
(Takagi) It's obvious that someone has tampered with the brakes.
I understand that you want to investigate, but I have a lot of things to do.
We won't be able to talk quietly here,
What do you say we go to the police station to clarify what happened?
I'm sorry, Inspector, but I don't have time for you today.
Will you let me open the trunk, please?
Conan!
(Kogoro) You bad piece of work.
You scoundrel.
What the hell have you done now?
I'm very sorry that the nano has escaped
and caused an accident, I should have kept a better eye on her.
I spend the whole day telling her to do her thing
and to stay out of other people's lives, but he's incapable of listening to me.
He never listens to me, this little devil of a boy.
Sorry, this child, I wanted to say.
Won't he forgive?
We don't have to forgive him anything, Mr. Mouri.
Eh?
But he threw himself behind this car with his skateboard...
and caused an accident!
No, and now!
I lost control of the car and he stopped me and saved my life.
Oh, did he?
Is that so?
It's just that Sonoko saw everything by chance
and she explained to me on the phone that...
Sonoko!
Where is she now?
Actually it was a provoked accident.
The brakes were tampered with.
Really?
This would be attempted murder.
We need to seal off the scene and notify Forensics right away.
-Oh, yeah, right.
-Yes, that's what we just did.
Sonoko.

Hello, Conan.
Good for you, kid.
Hey, making up stories again?
It's just... I saw him, and then, bam!
And I thought: "I knew it, me, that he was a wolf in sheep's clothing".
(thinks) "What did he take me for, this one?"
You are the daughter of President Suzuki?
The... Mr. Hoso!
You know each other?
Father is a big fan of kabuki.
Sometimes we meet at the theater after a performance.
A kabuki impresario?
I wouldn't have thought you'd like traditional theater, Sonoko.
Just so you know, I've been to lunch with the eBiz more than once.
You're kidding!
No!
The eBiz?
What is it, a sushi restaurant?
Don't talk nonsense, Father.
"Ignoring!"
We're talking about the eBiz Ichikawa.
The restaurant is in the Ichikawa neighborhood?
Please, Mr. Mouri, let it run, will you.
Mr. Mouri?
It's Mr. Kogoro Mouri, you?
The great detective?
Yes, the famous detective Kogoro Mouri, at your service.
How convenient!
-Why do you say so?
Because it just so happens that the eBiz is a great admirer of yours.
Gee, that's nice!
Anyway, I admit I've never heard of this restaurant.
I've never been there.
(Man) The brakes?
Are you sure it wasn't a breakdown?
The police are investigating.
Then I'll have to go to the police station to make a statement,
but first I had to go and take this.
You were the last one out of the garage last night, weren't you?
Yes, I was, sir.
And you didn't see anything strange before you left?
(Takahashi) Strange?
Like what now?
(Hoso) Such as any suspicious person that caught your attention.
(Takahashi) No.
I would have noticed.
Welcome, Mr. Hoso.
We've been waiting for you for a while.
I brought some acquaintances I just met.
It doesn't do anything to you, does it?
No, of course not.
I'm Mr. Yabusaki, the president.
(Sonoko) Ah, well.
It's nice to meet you.
The president of what?
Of a bank?
No, he's the person who represents the actors.
In the kabuki theater world, it's called president.
"She's quite cultured, for being a rich girl."
- (man 2) OK.
- (man 1) There is no light here.
(Home 3) We begin the voice tests.
(man 2) Go ahead.
Everyone gathered!
Oh, what joy my heart feels!
Oooh!
He's so handsome, the eBiz?
How do you say, this play?
"The Seven Masks".
It's one of the 18 main kabuki plays.
"The Seven Masks"?
It turns out that it was performed by the eBiz Ichikawa II as early as 1742,
but it's not one of the most performed.
And you know what the story is about?
It was performed in the late 19th and late 20th centuries.
And it was last performed by the eBiz itself 7 years ago.
"It is set in the residence of General Yoshida."
"The eBiz plays
the role of mask maker Akaemon Gagoze."
"Who is that?"
"He is waiting for Princess Sakura."
- (Sonoko) "Then the Akaemon arrives."
- (Kogoro) "And who is the Akaemon?"
(Kogoro) "Answer me."
(Sonoko) "Remove 5 masks from 5 boxes and dance a dance with each one."
(Sonoko) "Eh?"
"What masks are they?"
"Well, ah... Ah, yes."
"The old man's mask, the clown's mask, the demon woman's mask,
the old woman's and, finally, the evil old man's."
"These symbolize evil."
"And then, when a certain Zaemon I don't know what? It's the same, the enemy."
"When the enemy enters Yoshida's house to steal.
"the Akaemon with the mask of the evil old man appears.
"In Zaemon I don't know what he's afraid of...
and the mask boxes are locked and can't be opened."
You shut up, turkey.
You're reading the program, aren't you?
Anyway, it's very interesting.
If it's called "The Seven Masks," why are there only 5 boxes?
You too please shut up!
"The Seven Masks" is a very difficult play.
-Oh, so much so.
-Difficult, you say?
The original manuscript was burned in a fire during the Edo era.
There were no photocopiers then and the play was lost forever.
So, the story that is performed today is...?

It has been passed down orally over the years,
but we don't know if it is the same as the original.
Bah.
As long as it's fun...
There must not be anyone left who saw the premiere, no?
"No, there's no one left from the 17th century."
This time the eBiz has decided to
to perform a modern version of the play.
And it was a good job, really.
Aaaah!
Easy, girls, I won't bite.
-Hello, eBiz.
I'm Sonoko.
-We're waiting for you, Mr. Hoso.
Sonoko?
What Sonoko?
Yes, man, Sonoko Suzuki.
Don't you remember?
Of course I do.
Yeah, oh so much.
I can't believe it.
Sorry I'm late, kid.
Ouch, there you go.
Sonoko...
Oh, now I'm dead.
- (eBiz) The mask of the two faces.
- (man) Is it in here?
The real one.
I admit I'm very nervous.
Who wants to open the briefcase?
Only one person can do it.
This honor belongs to you, eBiz.
Wait a minute, not yet.
I want to change the angle.
-Yes, man.
-Hey. -Hey.
Be careful, huh?
I'll open it.
Ooh!
-It's beautiful.
-Look at it.
How wonderful!
It's fantastic.
Oh.
Look at it from here.
Oh!
"The mask of the two faces."
(EBiz) The expression changes depending on where you look from.
It is an extraordinary mask.
We know it was made during the Kamakura era,
although we do not know the name of the author.
It is made with the same wood
used to restore the Great Buddha Hall of Todaiji Temple,
between 1185 and 1195.
That is to say, it was built with the wood?
left over from the Great Buddha hall.
I didn't know that the wood also had DNA.
It was in the hands of a foreign collector
until Mr. Hoso bought it.
Eh?
And how much did it cost?
-Takahashi.
-Billions of...
The price doesn't matter.
We can't allow our cultural assets to go abroad.
Some time ago, Mr. Hoso...
showed me the two-faced mask...
and I decided that I would use it for the play.
For "The Seven Masks",
one of the 18 best kabuki plays, you mean, right?
And how is it that you decided to do a modern version, of "The 7 Masks"?
Conan, no.
Sorry, it's too small.
My name is Ran Mouri, by the way.
Taking the opportunity to introduce yourself, eh.
You shut up and stay out of it, father.
In Conan, Miss Ran Mouri and her father?
This can only mean that you are Mr. Kogoro Mouri!
EBiz, I brought her to you because I knew you were a great admirer of his.
-And now!
How can it be?
-What a thrill it makes me to meet him!
I can't believe that eBiz is a big fan of Mr. Mouri.
Come on, come on.
"You know what? I'm a big fan of mystery novels."
"When I went to perform in London,
I used to escape to Baker Street whenever I had a spare moment."
And Sleeping Kogoro's deductions have always thrilled me.
If you want me to be honest, it makes me very heavy, that everyone admires me.
"It doesn't suit you at all, false modesty."
Tell me.
And you, Conan...
Ah, yes?
I know you too, you know?
I remember as if it were yesterday the day you defeated the Kaito Kid.
You'll be a great detective too, I'm sure.
Are you serious?
Because I'd love to.
You asked me why I chose "The Seven Masks", right?
Yes.
As you must know, people have many faces.
Kindness, anger, envy...
I wanted to interpret them all.
To express the mystery of humanity.
It sounds so wonderful, put like that.
I'm sorry, but I have to go to the rehearsal room.
If you don't want to join me, Mr. Mouri.
Thank you, but we should go...
Of course we should.
Okay, understood.
Yes, I said yes.
About it, Ran.
He can't breathe.
Gee, what fun!
Hm?
(sighs)
Very well, then.
I'll carry the briefcase with the mask.
The rehearsal room is in another building?
(EBiz) No, it's the top floor of the same theater.
Here we are.
(Sonoko) Oh.
What a bright earth!
-Good morning.
- (eBiz) Good morning, everyone.
Put the briefcase away in the wardrobe closet.
(Sonoko) Yes, thank you.
(eBiz) -Hello.
Good morning to you.

-Good morning.
I saw that we have guests today, right?
Yes, Detective Kogoro Mouri is here.
In Kogoro Mouri?
You mean the famous Sleeping Kogoro?
And what has he come here to do, a detective?
Has someone been murdered?
No, man!
You've just come to visit.
When we get here, you turn to me and stand up.
Okay, okay, okay.
And when I say my text?
Before you say anything, you have to stand up straight.
And, by the way, this part should be more threatening.
-Okay, I'll keep that in mind.
-You make it too kind.
Kabuki plays are rewritten every time they are performed?
It's just that the actors are an indispensable part.
In kabuki, the most important thing is to highlight the grace of the protagonist.
Therefore, we have to adapt the text and the direction so that the eBiz can unfold
so that the eBiz can display all their talent.
Totally new, yes.
As if it were a new play.
Always respecting the line of the Ichikawa school, of course.
-(Takahashi) Yes?
- (Takahashi) President...
-I'm not a fool, me.
Try not to disturb the actors.
Come on, don't be so scrupulous, man.
I'm in deep now.
Don't make me beg you and speak at once.
It's always the same.
I can't tell you anything without the inspector's permission...
Hm.
Is it in Mouri?
Ah.
Ho-hello, inspector.
"I'm in Megure."
We have the lab results.
"In the car we found several prints."
"Do you want me to stop?"
Sure you can tell me?
No, no, and now!
Continue, please.
So it was the brake line.
Well...
If they were sabotaged, we're looking at attempted murder.
Yes, that's what we think too.
We should search his garage.
If you're with him, ask him to come with you.
All right, Inspector.
I'll be right with you.
Ah, Mr. Hoso.
I just talked to the police.
- (Yabusaki) Hurry, at the hospital.
-They want to talk to you at home.
-(Yabusaki) My God!
What happened, Iwami?
(Yabusaki) -Are you all right?
He's started to feel sick.
We have to take him to the hospital right away.
(Hoso) Understood.
Takahashi, take your car.
-He'll have too much pressure on him.
- (Takahashi) Right away.
Even though everyone says he's a promising young playwright,
he's incapable of writing a modern version of The Seven Masks.
The Iwami was chosen by me personally.
I want you to know that he has my full confidence.
Oh, he does?
Of course he does.
Forgive me, then.
You've already seen it.
For today it's better if we leave him here.
-See you tomorrow.
-All right. -Okay.
Hm?
Conan.
-I like it better than I thought.
-What do you say?
Do you like kabuki?
Would you like to come back another day?
Yes, I'd love to come back another day.
-Hehe!
Yes, of course I would.
-Won't you let me come? -Yes.
Whenever I want.
I'm sure we'll have fun.
Aaaah!
"You can tell it's the eBiz Ichikawa XI. It's got everything there is to have."
(Hoso) Last night I stayed at the office working
and then come back home.
Did you use the same car as today?
Yes, but drove in Takahashi, my secretary.
Tomorrow I have an appointment with the eBiz before going to work.
I'll take the car, okay?
You'll have to take the minivan.
Yes, sir.
When you accompany me home,
Takahashi stays at Takahashi's cleaning the car and then leaves.
Do you know how long he stayed in the garage yesterday, then?
I went straight to the office,
so I don't know what time he left.
-And the camera?
-Didn't you go in to say goodbye?
The camera that watches the garage is that one.
- (Hoso) Yes, of course.
- (Takagi) Is everything recorded?
(Hoso) Come here, please.
Can we take a look at it?
There are 72 hours recorded on the hard disk from a total of 10 cameras.
Conan.
It's better if you and I wait outside, we're in the way here.
"I knew it would end like this."
This house is a doozy, isn't it?
I'd love to live in it.
Yeah, but what a chore to clean!
Oh! (Laughs)
It's true.
I should have someone to help me with the housework.
"A 24-hour store. Maybe there..."
If I lived in a house like that, I'd have someone to help me clean.
"She hasn't given up."
(Mobile: buzzing)
(Ai) Di.
Yes, she was awake.

You already imagined it when you called me, didn't you?
Yes.
All right, you guys.
I'll look into it.
Don't worry, I've got plenty of resources.
Stop poking me, okay.
Do you want the information or not?
Yes, I'll look it up.
I'll look into the photographer.
Hm.
Understood.
And the playwright.
Tomorrow morning I'll send it to your cell phone.
What's that?
What do you say now?
I'm not the least bit interested.
Yes, you are.
Good night. Good night.
How shall I dress?
(Yabusaki) Good morning.
Ah, president.
(Yabusaki) Good morning.
You're very early.
There will be rehearsals from first thing today.
I have a lot of work to do before the technicians arrive.
Well, have a good day.
What the...?!
What?
Wh-what happened?
What's wrong with it?
O-oh... It's gone!
I kept it in here.
The two-faced mask is gone!
