And we hope to continue to do so at your side!
Ah!
Aah...
Father!
(He thinks) "It can't be. But I haven't done anything!"
Father, we haven't started investigating yet.
It seems to me that he's had a bit too much to drink and is sleeping it off.
Yes.
"Teary eyes go to the heart."
"Tears indicate the beginning of a tragedy."
"A mystery lurks on the tennis court."
"We'll solve it with a slam dunk of deductions!"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The demon hiding in the tennis court."
"The tennis coach of the Sonoko, in Takao Goto,
is participating in a tournament."
"Sonoko wanted to come and cheer him on,
and we decided to accompany her here in North Karuizawa."
Ran!
Are you ready?
L-listen, you mean we can stay here?
Come on, don't suffer!
Today there are only the preparatory matches for the championship,
and we'll leave before they start;
Come on, let's go!
Ouch... (slap)
(Boy) Ah! What?
(Boy) You've hurt me... Hm?
How could you think of inviting that girl from the Suzuki group?
I want an explanation!
(Boy) What?
But she just came to cheer me up.
Are you sure you don't want to leave me for her?
Come on, woman!
Do you really think I'll leave you for a teenager?
I'm just trying to keep her happy.
Her family is very rich.
I don't know...
I promise.
I swear I only have eyes for you, Yuka.
He-he!
Although... the fatter the fish, the better, right?
(punch)
If you betray me, I'll never forgive you.
What about Conan?
Where did he go? Hey!
You're the girl who was with Sonoko, right?
Ah... yes, I'm Ran Mouri.
If you're looking for the nano with the glasses, he's gone to the toilet.
Do you want me to go call it in? No.
I'll go, thanks.
I don't mind.
It's the men's room, you can't go in.
Well, thank you.
(thinks) "This place is huge."
Hm?
"Isn't that the guy from before?"
Of it... When will you give me back the money I left you?
Ah, the money!
Give me a little more time.
If you don't give it back to me, I'll have... a problem.
What's that?
If I've been able to enter this tournament, it's thanks to you, Chie.
Yes, but I...
Well, I...
I have to stop, I have a game.
"Let's play two."
I'm sick of it!
Let's see if he'll shut up and continue loosening the fly.
"This one plays both sides..."
If I don't get my money back soon... Ouch!
I don't know how I'm going to do it!
Aai...
Hey, kid!
Ran is looking for you, she's worried.
Ah, yes, she is.
That's good! -Bravo, Takao!
"But just a moment ago, they were throwing things at each other's heads!"
"I don't understand them, women."
(Girl) What a beating!
(Girl) Go ahead!
Go on, you've got it!
(Man) Game, Goto.
-Yes! Very good!
-Water with lemon and honey, as always.
In-Other, that's good.
(man) Thank you.
You always know what I need, Yuka.
You got it, Takao.
Want a towel?
Ah!
Thanks a lot, Chie.
Hey, hey, hey!
Here, coach!
For luck.
You're very kind, Sonoko.
How did you know my favorite color?
Because you have all the rackets in this color.
Ben played!
Good luck to you.
I'll try not to get injured like you, Azuma.
He's such a good person, Captain Azuma!
If he hadn't been injured,
he wouldn't have had to give up his position as first captain to Takao.

Hey, man.
You can't beat me anymore.
Why don't we do some mixed doubles?
I'll play with my student and then we'll be even.
All right, you guys.
Sonoko!
We'll play a mixed doubles.
Will you be my partner?
-Me?
You mean me? -Yes, please.
Lucky you, Sonoko! Yes, thank you.
-And we'll be damned, eh. And what a one in ten head carry?
Coach! (gasps)
(gasps) I'm about ready.
All right, let's go.
Let's go.
-Yeah! (gasps)
I'll do my best. Don't overexert yourself.
Sonoko!
You'll do better playing without gloves!
-What?
Really?
Thanks for the advice! -You'll do great!
Sonoko!
Go for it!
Sonoko, you're the best!
Whenever you want.
She has!
-You're on! -Well played, Sonoko.
She's very motivated, Sonoko, isn't she?
It looks like it.
You can do it, Sonoko!
-Ah! Huh?
Hm?
That's strange.
What's wrong with him?
She doesn't seem to be feeling too well.
Ah!
Coach! What's wrong with him?
Oysters! Ah!
-What's wrong with him? -Is he all right?
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Call an ambulance! Yes.
-Coach! -What's wrong with him?
(Chie) Ta... Takao!
What's this?
The man who has fainted is Takao Goto, 21 years old.
He is the second captain of the university tennis team.
Everything seems to indicate that she has been poisoned with a toxic substance.
From her symptoms, it could be a derivative of aconitine.
I see what you mean.
So...
Mr. Goto has harvested some toxic plant from outside
and ate it, right?
Clearly not.
Oh!
Hello, Ran, it's good to see you again.
Yes, you too, Inspector Yamamura.
"North Karuizawa is in Gunma Prefecture."
It doesn't appear to be food poisoning.
Doctors estimate that she was poisoned
between 10 and 20 minutes before she fell to the ground collapsed.
Hmm... So Mr. Goto was the killer's target.
Of that, he is not dead yet, Mr. Goto.
Apparently,
someone must have given him the poison during the game to kill him.
-But still... Wasn't it an accident?
A-assassinate him?
But... how did the murderer do it to him?
to act during the match in front of the world?
Come to think of it,
these ladies have given two objects to Mr. Goto.
-What...? - Really? -What...
Um... Maybe these objects they gave him were poisoned.
Hurry and ask the lab colleagues to analyze them.
Yes.
"He must be given everything well mastegadet..."
None of those involved had toxic substances on them,
but we did detect traces of poison in the canteen,
the towel and the handle given to the victim.
Right.
First this one, now this one... Let's see...
Inspector Yamamura, what are you doing now?
A sketch like the ones they do in the police series.
I was always looking forward to doing that one day!
"And he's a real cop!"
(Yamamura) Here we have a summary of the actions
that Mr. Goto has done during the halftime.
Before the match,
I saw Mr.
Goto and Miss Tsuchida arguing in the locker room.
Although it represents that they are dating,
Mr. Goto fooling around with Sonoko because she's from a rich family.
Hey, don't mess with me!
How interesting!
It could be that she's pretty mad at him for wanting to kill him.
What a curious little boy!
How can his testimony be taken seriously?
Hm, Miss, you gave Mr. Goto a canteen...
that contained a poisoned drink?
What nonsense!
The poisonous substance was only on the outside of the canteen,
the drink didn't contain any.
Oh.
Point taken.
"So, the irritation I had on the palm of my hand,
could it be from having picked up the canteen?"
And this lady also saw him
talking to Mr. Goto alone before the game.
It's just that I...
Yes, I know.
I know that Chie leaves money to Takao to keep him on a tight leash.
It's money from a student loan.
Hey, hey, hey!
Is this true?
Well... yes.
In fact, if I can't pay back the loan, I'll have to quit school.
And you...

you gave Mr. Goto a poisoned towel, didn't you?
He could have been poisoned through his eyes and nose when he was drying himself.
I didn't do anything!
According to the hospital report,
there were no traces of poison on Mr. Goto's face.
Ah!
Okay.
"It was a very easy match,
he didn't sweat at all and didn't use the towel."
"He took it off the back of his neck and left it on the bench."
If it wasn't us, it must have been the girl from the Suzuki group.
In Takao just fooling around because her family is rich.
And when she found out he wasn't planning to marry her ever,
she went ballistic.
It's not true!
I'm not in love with the coach.
I heard he was going to compete in the tournament and I came to cheer him on.
He said he was changing the grip on his racquet at every break.
that's why I gave him a new one.
He says that in Goto he changes the grip of the racquet at breaks?
Y-yes.
He-he-he!
I get it.
A flash of inspiration went through my brain.
A case that has happened on the tennis court
must be solved on the tennis court!
"Really?"
To attach the handle of a racket,
the film protecting the adhesive strip must first be removed.
If the film had been impregnated with any toxic substance,
the poison would have passed into the hands of Mr. Goto,
who changes the handle every break.
Inspector!
I have spoken to the laboratory.
The used films that were inside Mr. Goto's bag were found to be poisonous.
goto
they found traces of poison,
and also Miss Suzuki's tennis glove.
"Sonoko's glove too?"
Hm, hm.
I was already on the right track, me.
In fact, in Takao...
she said the film was hard to take out, and she was licking her finger.
He-he!
The killer has poisoned the film in advance,
kept it in the box and gave it to him.
That's why none of those present were carrying toxic substances.
Therefore, the murderer... is you, Miss Suzuki!
Me?
And now! "What are you saying?
It was you, who gave Mr. Goto the poisoned hilt...
with the intention of killing him.
Inspector Yamamura!
Sonoko would never do that!
Of course she wouldn't!
I told you I didn't do it!
When Mr. Goto took out the film, he licked his finger several times and swallowed the poison that was in it.
and swallowed the poison that was in the handle.
It was spread all over his body while he was playing
and, when he was about to pull out, he fell round.
-Oysters! -Oh!
"What's this? I got it!"
What a shock...
The motive for the crime was a love affair.
He told you he loved you and you believed it,
but then he betrayed you.
Love turned to hate and you thought of a way to kill him.
-Acompanyi'm a comissaria.-I tell you that I have not done anything!
She is very much in love, but she is innocent!
There are well-founded indications that point to her as guilty.
-You've got the wrong person! -Quiet!
"She will have to be herself, who will dispel the suspicions."
Ah!
Aah... aah....
(Suzuki voice) What's the problem, Gunma police?
What's he doing?
Is he imitating Mr. Mouri?
Sonoko!
You'll see, now!
Inspector Yamamura,
won't you allow me to tell you the truth of this case?
What is it?
I thought the case was already solved.
-Wasn't she the guilty one? -Oh, so much so.
It's you who poisoned the hilt of...
The match was resumed after Mr. Goto changed the grip of...
Goto changed the hilt.
There can't have been any traces of poison left in the canteen or on the towel
that touched them before.
Ah, good point.
Also, the protective film is removed with the fingers....
and Mr.
Goto's palm was irritated by the contact with the poison.
This means that he touched the poison with his palm.
I got it!
Mr. Goto picked up the poisoned object with his hand.
-So it was you. Me?
He gave him the poisoned canteen.
holding it by the ribbon so as not to touch it.
I did nothing!
If the poisoned object had been the canteen,
there would be no poison in the towel that Mr. Goto touched before.
Then it was you!
You were poisoned when you touched the towel around your neck.
-Why are you accusing me? -You're wrong.

If the poison had touched her skin, her neck would be irritated.
And she was not wearing gloves when she gave him the towel.
And then... where was it, the poison?
Of course it was!
To the tennis glove!
You shook Mr. Goto's hand with the glove on.
That's how you poisoned him.
I knew it.
Another clue to accuse you, Miss Suzuki!
Sonoko... Hey, Ran!
What's that? It couldn't have been her.
Just think, after you've picked up the cookies with your hand
and you're safe.
Ah.
Of course you are!
About that... What are you talking about?
When the coach invited you to play, we were biting hands,
"And she was wearing the glove."
"If I had been poisoned, I would have been poisoned too,
because afterwards I've been taking the cookies with the same hand."
Are you... are you serious?
Then where the hell did it come from, the poison?
We have no more suspects left!
Although there was another way to poison Mr. Goto
without making him leave the track.
Through a gesture that tennis players do without even realizing it
and that does not arouse any suspicion even if the stands are full.
Mr. Azuma.
It was you!
-Huh? -Huh?
The captain?
What?
No way.
I've been in the stands the whole time,
and I haven't given anything to Takao.
-How could I have poisoned him? -When he bit his hands with it.
At that moment he passed the poison in the palm of his hand.
What?!
(Suzuki voice) Mr. Goto shook my hand when he already had the poison,
that's why traces were also found on my glove.
And you...
are the only person who touched his hand before he gave it to me.
Nonsense!
If I had put poison on my hand, it would be swollen and irritated.
It was the glove that was poisoned.
The match was played with two balls.
The public usually returns the ones that go to the stands.
But you carried the poison in the palm of your glove,
that's why you bit the ball with the back of your hand.
When Mr. Goto chose me as his partner for the mixed doubles and shook my hand.
and shook my hand, you got scared.
If they found traces of poison on my glove
and began to suspect
that someone had introduced it from the stands,
the whole thing would have gone down the drain.
That's why...
Sonoko!
You'll be better off playing without gloves!
"...made me take off my glove."
It just had to be retrieved later, in the midst of the confusion,
and make it disappear.
A brilliant deduction, no doubt.
But I have to ask you a question.
Where is it, the evidence, eh?
This is the proof.
Huh?
Let's see?
When inspector Yamamura knocked down the basket of balls,
there was one that didn't bounce, and it caught my attention.
Oh, my goodness.
The white stripe looks strange, doesn't it?
Hm?
B-but it is...
Once the crime was committed,
Mr. Azuma took off the poisoned glove and stuffed it inside.
He then hid the ball in the basket so that it would go unnoticed.
He intended to make it disappear
once all the fuss had died down.
If we find traces of poison in this glove
and Mr. Azuma's fingerprints, we'll have conclusive proof.
Wait a minute!
Does this mean I can take credit for it?
Hurray!
I'm the best!
I'm a genius!
But you're the captain!
Why did you do it?
It was me, who should participate in this championship.
Takao was envious of me,
and, while we were training, he tripped me.
Aaah!
I will try not to get injured like you, Azuma.
I had to retire because I broke my leg,
and in Takao took my place as first captain.
That coward, that conceited one, took my place!
Because of him, my sponsorship contract and scholarship went up in smoke.
He's a bastard.
I can never forgive him for that!
"That's how Sonoko was cleared of all suspicion."
"Later on, Inspector Yamamura received a message from the hospital
where he was admitted to Takao."
"He had woken up and was out of danger."

(Yamamura) "Sonoko, the Queen of Deductions"!
It was fantastic!
Aah... Oh, was it?
Sonoko!
For a moment I thought she was accusing you.
I was so worried!
Ran!
You really are a good friend.
Well, I've closed the case, as it were.
-Vinga. -We crashed it!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Wow, what a pain!
You've gone too far, Miss Suzuki!
Oops, oops, oops!
Wow!
He says he closed the case.
You've got to have some nerve to say something like that.
"She'll be stung for a long time, Sonoko."
Aah!
A-a séance?
What they do to contact the spirits of the dead?
But what does it mean?
That the Kira was resurrected, just like it happens in the manga,
and that she committed the murder?!
Ah! "What's all this?"
Yes, it's true.
