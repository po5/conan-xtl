THE MIRACLE OF KOSHER
DO NOT SURRENDER TO THE INVISIBLE DEVIL, (PART 2)
(Announcer) In the second part of the second entry,
we find Nagashima with the bat now starring in the offensive game.
He throws his forty-fourth pitch!
Here it is!
In!
-He's hit towards third base!
- (audience: shouting)
It's a long ball...
This one that's chopped the ball is very fast!
The outside left fielder is taking his strength.
I'm sure the runner will make it all the way to third base.
To left!
To the left!
Run!
Run!
What do you think you're doing?!
Nagashima has passed second base
and right to third.
The left fielder catches the ball and throws to third base.
At Nagashima it's too close to third base and he throws!
The third baseman scoops it up and he plays it!
Salvat!
Salvat!
In Nagashima he's done once that's been good for third base.
They haven't been able to eliminate him at third base... What do you know.
I guess they'll make a run for it in the end.
No, we still can't be sure.
That pitcher's got some nerve...
We're in the first game of the Spring High School Championship.
The game has been extended and is now in the eighteenth inning.
Ohgane has run into a tricky situation.
At the bottom of the first half of the eighteenth inning,
they have a runner on base and in Yamamoto with the bat.
They will now make the pitch to en Yamamoto.
(Mobile)
(Ring)
(Ring)
A cell phone?
You mean it was here before?
Maybe it fell to the man who passed by a while ago.
Let's see...
I beg your pardon?
Is it you who dropped this phone?
(Man) "Yes..."
Then, come to the stand on the right and...
- "Are you having a good time?"
-What?
I'm asking you if this is a place where you have a good time.
Who are you?
"You don't need to know,
"Now we're going to play a game that's more entertaining
"And much more fun than the game."
We're going to do an exchange of lives that will get your blood pumping.
"Well, this is an exchange of lives,
"But it's really me who's going to die. (laughs)"
Shrike!
If you want to die, kill yourself!
Will you sit me down?
"Yes, I will..."
But I can't die alone...
Being alone is too much, too sad...
As it says ?!
"The rules are simple..."
"As soon as the third, sixth and ninth innings are over...
"I'll call the cell phones I've left...
"in different places in this ballpark."
I'll ring them to serve as a clue and you'll know where I am.
"I'll be near the phone rings when the tickets are gone."
Strike!
"I'll only ring 3 times."
"If you don't answer me,
"You will have lost all 3 games and will be eliminated."
And if you collect all the cell phones before the game is over,
you will be the winners.
So get a move on.
Hey!
You're joking!
Don't talk nonsense!
I'll hang up on you!
You'll find out if I'm joking or not when the second entry is finished.
Hey, what did he mean by this?
"Well, your first clue...
"It's the message you'll find written on this cell phone."
Ah, tell that cop...
"Tell him I'm looking forward to seeing him, too."
Well, we'll talk later.
Wait, wait!
At least tell me how to say it!
What's my name?
I am...
...the demon of the Koshien.
You can call me that.
(Heiji) The demon of Koshien?
Hey, wait!
Wait, wait!
Strike!
Batter out!
Very good!
-Still must strike out another!
-The second inning is already over?
What's the matter with you?
You didn't watch the game?

The strike the player struck out right now was a very fastball!
I found it!
96, 7, 13...
That must be it.
What's this?
The place where the owner of this phone is located.
It will be there and he's asked us to bring it to him.
What's this for?
He could come and get it himself!
Oysters, oysters... What's this 96, 7, 13?
It doesn't look like a bleacher seat number...
Whoa!
Enough with the codes.
Maybe it's another code.
Thanks to that strange code,
we've been unable to see in Takarazuka and we're the Koshien...
Mmm... If it were 8, 1, 2, it would be in the Alpine stands...
(Ran and Kazuha) To the Alps?
Eh?
Why, father?
Because in Japanese 8, 1, 2 is pronounced Heidi...
And Heidi just...
"...we could find her in the Alps, couldn't we?"
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Father, what a thing you have.
My God...
Very good!
It's just the same.
It is so much!
Please help us find it...
What?
But now comes the most interesting part.
Mr. Ohtaki, don't worry...
If you come with us, we'll be done in no time.
Eh?
Conan, are you going too?
Yes!
Because it looks like it will be interesting!
Well, don't worry!
We'll give it to the owner and we'll come right away...
(Kazuha) Coi, who catches them now?
We came here just because he wanted us to!
That's right... (Kazuha)
(Kazuha) What?
Commit suicide?
Is... is it true?
Heiji?
Yes!
He said that if we don't find him before the match is over, he'll die!
When he kills himself, he'll take everyone in front of him.
I think... it's no joke.
Maybe it was a bad joke.
He hasn't changed the tone of voice
and the phone manufacturer's stamp...
was also attached to the cell phone.
He doesn't seem to mind that it's known who he is after the fact.
To top it off, he's doing something like this.....
despite being aware that Mr. Ohtaki is a police inspector.
He is really desperate!
Please use your badge.
Let us go behind the safety net!
Why behind the safety net?
When we've talked on the phone, I've felt the referee shouting strike.
It is possible that he is still here...
Oh, no...
Heiji, we can't do it.
He won't die until the game is over, right?
He'll show us a proof after the second half of the second inning!
What... what did you say?
Mr. Ohtaki, we'll go through!
If those screams we heard were for the third inning...
He must have prepared himself.
Wrong!
Just as I thought.
The second part of the second entrance is already finished.
You, go downstairs;
I'll go up;
you, Mr. Ohtaki, search the central area!
The suspect is wearing a hat!
Damn it!
I knew he wouldn't be here.
But... but... but... nothing's happened yet.
Nothing at all...
(Megaphone: female) "To the third inning,
"The Ohgane School batter will be in Seki, number 9, right."
In Sakuraba makes the first pitch.
He hit it!
The third baseman catches it and passes it to the pitcher.
The pitcher sends it to first base!
And the first baseman...
Out!
En Nagashima, Kohnan's catcher, has played a magnificent game.
He caught it on the fly, gave it to the pitcher...
...and successfully struck out an Ohgane player.
Hey, Heiji... What's going on?
Nothing happened?
That's strange...
The man said he would give us a test
after the second part of the second entry.
I was telling you.
It was just a bad joke.
Who would do something like that at the Koshien finals?
What the hell must that be?
What is that?
On the other side of the highway.
Smoke is coming out...
Looks like a fire.
It must have happened around the town of Tekiryoku-machi.
He told me that a superior he was close to...
worked for the Hyogo police.
Would you mind calling him and asking him about it?
(Radio: female) "All units, be on alert."
"Repeat:" All units, be alert."
That's quite an alert, that area doesn't look good.
(Ohtaki) What?
A bomb?
Are you serious, Mr. Wakusa?

"Yes, as to the details,
"I can't tell you anything until the fire is out."
"But it was a bomb."
A company called Takano Transportation has been set on fire.
And from what the neighbors said,
they heard a loud explosion before the building caught fire.
"I understand."
"Fortunately, that company was on vacation today," he said,
"So there were no casualties, as far as we know."
They think they set off a bomb
because the noise was coming from a building that was supposedly empty.
"And do you know what time it was set on fire?"
Well, that's... Uh, NuMat?
Yes, sir?
They're asking me about the fire they're putting out.
Do you know what time it broke out?
Well, I think... I think it was chief 3/4 of 2. More or less.
When the second part of the second entry was finished!
I don't like this, Hattori...
If the warning that guy had told us about was the explosion,
it is possible that the method by which he wants to commit suicide is...
Shrike.
If he kills himself with a bomb in a crowded place like this..,
he'll cause a real disaster!
Hey, Ohtaki, weren't you supposed to go to the Koshien today?
"How did you hear about this fire thing?"
Uh, well... He... Heiji, what do you want us to do?
Explain to the police what's going on?
No.
The man who called said he would commit suicide...
when the game was over in the ninth inning!
If the game was cancelled and we caused a commotion,
it would set off the bomb instantly.
For the moment, the best we can do is to do what he has told us.
Decipher the codes one after the other,
track down where the 3 mobiles are and stop him.
We will have to decipher the codes before the third entry is over
and find the first cell phone hidden in the bleachers,
or we will be finished forever.
(Heiji) At the beginning of the third inning,
we have one out and runners on first and second base.
There is a shot of the bleachers
behind the protective netting at Gate 8.
We'll have to go outside, look at the map and try to decipher the code.
We'll see what the numbers 96, 7 and 13 mean!
I'll go ask for the radio at Kogoro!
We will need to know how the game is developing!
Yes, ask for it!
"INAO, number 3, pitcher."
All right!
It's time to clean up.
I think this game is going to be pretty long.
-Yes.
-Come on, Heiji.
Ball!
Ball!
The pitcher wants to shake it off,
but he doesn't quite control the pitch!
"(Announcer) If it continues like this,
"The runner will go to the base
"And they'll find themselves a player out and the bases loaded."
In Heiji and the others are taking a long time....
They must not have found the owner of the phone yet.
So why don't they just let him run and come right back?
It's the fault of the man who dropped it, not us.
Don't worry, don't worry!
I'm sure it is.
It's true...
We'll find that man, we promise...
Wait a little longer...
(Think) "Conan..."
Mr. Kogoro, could I have... your radio, please?
Eh?
While we're looking for that man, we can't know how the match is going...
can we?
Will you lend it to me?
What a mug... Don't break it, okay?
You got it.
Thank you. Thank you.
Ah, if you see a suspicious man wearing a white hat...
call Heiji on his cell phone, okay?
Eh?
Wait, Conan!
(Thinking) "It's identical."
"The face he was making on Conan was the same... that he made...
"...that time."
He got him!
What a good hit!
Back off!
Ben back!
The ball's going in!
It's coming this way!
Pushed by the sea breeze, the ball flies towards the right stand.
He's got it!
The runner at second base starts to run!
They pass the ball at second base.
(Yelling)
2 players out.
Despite the fact that the ball looked like a home run,
the breeze has blocked the trajectory of the ball...
"And it has scattered it to the Koshien's 2 wings, 96 yards."
(Think) "Two 96-meter wings?"
(Heiji) 96, 7, 13.... 96, 7, 13... Where is it, where is it?

I'm convinced it indicates seats somewhere in the stadium.
We should hurry or we'll run out of time.
Damn it!
Where the hell is it?
Heiji.
Heiji!
He's already left me the radio!
Like the game?
The first half of the third inning is over;
it's 0-0.
Now they have to eliminate 3?
Did you know that there is a wing to this stadium?
A wing?
Yes, I heard on the radio that the Koshien has 2 wings of 96 meters.
Hey, you don't know anything about baseball, do you?
They don't say that in other sports, that's why you're lost.
Vailet.
With "2 wings of 96 meters" means...
that from the goal base to the flag there are 96 meters.
Do not tell me that this code, the 96,
means that it is in the stand behind the flag?
But in which direction?
There are flags to the right and to the left!
So, is it possible...
that the number 7 in brackets means something.
(At the same time) 7... 7... 7...
This doesn't look good.
They've got 3 balls and 3 strikes and they've struck out a player!
Boy, turn your back for a moment!
Like this?
Like this?
-What do you mean by that?
-I got it!
The number on the shirt is a 55, it's not a 7.
That's right.
At tournaments, where does the player with the 7 stand?
The number 7 is the outside left.
Heiji, this means that...
Yes!
It is a seat at the end of the far left!
Then, what is the last 13?
Surely it's row 13!
The cell phone is there!
Yes, it's there!
(Announcer) The two Kohnan's batsmen have been knocked out
and now there are two players eliminated.
The next batter is Iwata, number 3, outside left.
The pitcher raises his arms above his head to throw.
(Announcer) Strike!
A straight up!
The pitcher throws the second ball at a good pace....
Strike two!
Another straight one!
27..., 26..., 25...
The pitcher raises his arms.
(Heiji) 21..., 20..., 19...
The third pitch!
15..., 14...
He has thrown it!
13!
(Heiji) It's here!
Strike!
You're out!
(Ring)
Don't answer, give it to me!
Hello?
Hello?
("Man: river")
Hey, you!
What's so funny, say?
"(Laughs) It's very interesting."
You are very interesting guys.
Try hard and make me have some fun, okay ?
"I love to see how people make useless efforts."
Ep, you, wait!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hello?
Hello?
Coi!
He hung up!
Hey, look!
The next code is on the screen!
47, 3 and a 4, right?
(Think) "47..., 3..., 4."
(Think) "Yes... It's a useless effort."
"It's not worth making efforts like this.... Not at all."
