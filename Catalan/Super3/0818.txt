Risa!
Risa Purple is a very famous star, isn't she?
Yes, she is.
He's an underground star with a lot of fans and a lot of charisma.
Everybody loves her.
And that's why it's become fashionable to dress like her.
She has a beautiful mole.
Like this one.
Look at this one.
How nice!
And thanks to Kogoro we could come to see the concert!
Yes.
Luckily, Risa asked him to be her bodyguard.
Otherwise, he wouldn't have given us these special invitations.
Oh!
It's like a dream!
All these people have come here to see me.
I'm glad that his fans are growing all the time,
but as a manager, I'm worried...
that, with so many people gathered here, someone might want to hurt you.
I'm here to prevent that.
If anyone tries to harm you,
I, Kogoro Mouri, swear... that I will protect her with my life,
if necessary.
(Man) Bianca, where have you been?
-Oh!
-Sorry, sorry!
Risa!
Bianca!
-All right, come on, Bianca.
Come on, let's go!
-Ris, what, let's go?
Shall we start?
(Audience: ovation)
Hello!
And thank you for your patience!

Do you want to help me call the Purple Laughter?

Eh?
Can you tell where he's going?
Ah!
Father, but what are you doing, man?
Iaaah!
Risa, come with me!
Sakuta, turn on the spotlight!
Attention!
They just kidnapped the Risa Purple in front of us!
Stop!
The Ran!
No, it's...?
"A black cloth splattered by crime
is filled with color with brilliant deduction."
"On the stage of a concert Ran is abducted by mistake."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

Hey!
Why are you taking my daughter?
Oh?
Wait!
Give me back my daughter!
Kogoro, hurry!
Nano, come down.
Listen, I'm worried about Ran too, you know?
Worrying about her won't solve anything, kid!
I'll get her back!
Kogoro, over there!
Aaah!
Damn it!
Eh?
Look at this here!
Risa?
I'm sure it's from Ran, who was trying to tell us something!
Sure, she's trying to tell us that she's been mistaken for Risa.
"I think it's a clue to the identity of the kidnappers."
I'm sure the kidnappers can't be far away.
I won't let them get away from me!
-Say.
-Excuse me!
Excuse me...
Have you seen the two men
who got out of that boat that's moored there?
Two men and a woman, exactly.
It's possible that the men were carrying the woman in their arms.
-Yes, exactly!
-Ah!
Her hair was lilac-colored?
I saw them get into a red truck, and they went there.
A red truck, you say?
Yes!
Please leave me your vehicle.
-It's a kidnapping!
-What?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's an emergency!
Okay, but wait!
"Kogoro..."
A red truck, a red truck.
Let me get this straight.
They've hijacked the Ran instead of the Risa by mistake?
Yes, probably.
The stage was almost dark
and Ran was dressed like Risa.
Even I got them mixed up, then.
I thought it was Risa, the one they were kidnapping.
Inspector, it seems that someone has activated the fire alarm...
and turned down the circuit breaker.
Mm?
Inspector.
Please take a look at this.
A Taser?
It's the light that a Taser makes.
Yeah, they probably used it on the Ran.

and knocked her unconscious.
Excuse me, do you work with the agency?
Well no, I'm a producer for Beika Cable Television,
and I call myself Sakuta.
Now I have been filming Risa's performances for 5 years,
almost since he started doing concerts.
Could you hand these images over to the police,
as material for the investigation?
Of course, inspector.
But you should know that I have already sent them
on several TV channels for their news.
Eh?
I'm sure it'll be all over the news soon.
The investigation has only just begun.
It's not in our best interest to get so much publicity.
(Mobile)
Hello, tell me.
Mouri, hello, what are you saying, where are you?
Where are you?
"I'm chasing the kidnappers!"
It seems that they have fled in a red truck by the side of the canal
and in the direction of the clock tower, inspector.
Okay, in the direction of the clock tower, huh?
Have you located the Ran's cell phone signal?
Surely this is it!
The vehicle Ran is in is heading towards the clock tower!
Contact headquarters.
Tell them to look for a red truck driving along the canal!
(Kogoro) Okay!
(Kogoro) Inspector Megure, Conan has been left at the wharf
where the kidnappers have left the boat.
(Kogoro) Right away.
Can you pick him up, please?
Conan has stayed at the pier.
Go and pick him up right away.
Okay, inspector.
"Such bungling men
that they hijack the Ran because they mistake it for the Risa..."
"I'm sure they've left some clues around here."
"Oh. This is..."
Look, Inspector, the truth is that last week...
we started getting threatening phone calls.
Threatening calls?
Yes, one who presented himself as a big fan of Laughter.
He demanded that we should not enslave him and that we should pay him more.
And he said that if things didn't change
something terrible would happen at the concert.
Wow, well... I'm sure it was a warning for today's incident.
But, inspector, there must be a mistake:
I have no complaint against the agency!
Surely... he's a fan who must not be very well in the head.
Yes.
Can you think of anyone in particular?
There's a man who always comes to the La Risa events.
Maybe he's been coming since the concerts started.
By the way, there is a suspicious man who often comes...
when La Risa does photo shoots or meetings with fans.
A suspicious man...
You have been very kind.
Thank you for your cooperation.
A red truck... A red truck...
- (car: crash)
-Where is it?
Where is it?
Is it wrong?
Ah, no, I rushed a bit because I'm late for work.
I didn't know I was in such a hurry.
Now I'm sorry I made you come.
(Speaker: man) "Breaking news."
"On the stage of the concert of the famous singer Risa Purple,
it seems that a kidnapping took place a while ago!"
"Right after the incident we have received these images."
"Attention! Risa Purple has just been kidnapped in front of us!"
That man's face rings a bell.
Stop.
Please zoom in on that man's face.
It is the same man!
I'm sure it is!
Where have I seen him...?
Eh ?!
Aaaah!
It's what brought me here!
It's this man!
It's what I was telling you, he always comes to all your events!
Mm...
I send you an image of the suspect.
Investiga'l, do you feel?
(Cars: horns)
"Ran!"
What you mean to say is that the kidnapper was in the truck...
that has taken Mr. Mouri by force?
Yes.
That's right, Inspector Takagi.
That gentleman said the Ran's hair was lilac.
Two men and a woman, exactly.
It's possible that the men carried the woman in their arms.
-Yes, exactly!
-Ah!
She had lilac-colored hair?
But I found the wig floating between the dock and the boat.
It must have fallen off when she was being disembarked.
As it was hidden there under the dock,
if it wasn't the kidnapper...
there's no way he'd know she had lilac-colored hair, right?
Of course he would.
Good thinking, Conan.
The message Ran left half-written got me thinking.
A message, you say?
I'm sure she meant to write "Recycle Shop" as it sounds....
and that she's been pulled off the boat
before she could finish writing the name of the company.
Recycle Shop.

Behind the van they were carrying a cooler.
It's big enough to hide a person.
A perfect place.
I'm sure it's inside the cooler, where they've hidden the Ran.
And the other man has hidden under the tarp.
Ran is probably tied up and with her mouth covered,
and the only thing he could do
was to turn on the cell phone to locate her.
Of course!
That's why the signal was going in the direction of the clock tower.
So, the red truck that Mr. Mouri was told does not exist.
Look, there it is!
Kogoro!
Nano!
We're not doing well!
I found out who the hijacker is!
The driver of the recycling truck, right?
Eh?
How did you know?
The Ran is locked in the cooler in the box of the truck.
What?
Inside the cooler?
Damn!
And to think that the Ran and the kidnapper were with me and I didn't notice!
Mr. Mouri, we can use the GPS to locate the Ran.
Get in the car, hurry!
Yosaburo.
Take the Risa very carefully, eh?
Yes, don't suffer.
This girl is not Risa!
-May I know who you are?
-Huh?
What are you saying?
It is you who have made a mistake!
May I know who the hell I'm paying, you two?!
Mm?!
Eh?!
Aaaah!
The cell phone.
I had the cell phone on!
Maybe the police have already located us.
If so... maybe it would be better...
No, Yosaburo, you don't mean...?
I feel sorry for her, but we have no choice.
Besides, she's seen our faces perfectly.
The Ran's cell phone signal has disappeared!
What?
Mr. Mouri, where were you headed, when did you leave them?
I don't know, but the bumper was hanging and it was scratching on the ground!
If we follow the line we'll get to their hiding place!
But, Mr. Mouri, couldn't you get back in the car?
(Mobile)
We have just identified the suspect.
(Takagi) "Hello, hello."
Takichi Takeyama, 43 years old,
owner of a recycling company.
He only has one employee who is 6'3" tall.
He is probably his accomplice.
His name is Yosaburo Ihara and he is 28 years old.
We'll send you the data now, okay?
Understood.
Mm?
(Mobile)
Hello?
Yes, understood.
Mr. Sakuta,
there's a lot of requests for interviews because of the kidnapping.
-Maybe you're right.
-Shouldn't we go back to the agency?
Do you have any more questions?
Wait a moment, please.
What is it?
There's something I don't see clearly.
The fire alarm that's been activated
is the hallway leading from the waiting room
to the stage door.
And this door leading to the stage is locked from the inside,
so it can't be opened from the stage.
Therefore, the fire alarm...
could not have been activated by the kidnappers.
Are you perhaps suggesting...
that it was activated by one of us, inspector?
No, that's impossible!
At the very moment when the alarm started to sound
all of us were on the scene.
It's true!
La Risa, her manager and Bianca were on stage.
Yes, he's right, he's absolutely right.
It's all recorded here.
So, the fire alarm...
was triggered by one of the kidnappers.
But how did they gain access to the hallway where the alarm is?
The only way they could gain access is if someone gave them access.
You mean that one of us has gone to open the door?
Well, I can't think of any other option.
Did someone come out into the hallway just before the concert started?
By the way, I didn't see Mr. Yamane for a while.
It's true, I went out to make a phone call,
but I didn't open the door of the venue.
This is the kidnapper's hideout.
Hey, Ran, where are you?
I've come to save you!
Apparently, the man is a real Risa fanatic.
Mr. Mouri, I received a call from the inspector.
The kidnapper's name is Takichi Takeyama and he's 43 years old.
He says the other man must be his employee, a Yosaburo Ihara.
That's him!
Takichi Takeyama!
The Facenet of Takichi Takeyama.
-Ris Shigaki?
-Your Facenet?
Risa Shigaki is the real name of Risa Purple.
It seems that the kidnapper and Risa were in contact by mail.

"Mr. Takeyama, please salvi'm me from this situation."
"Please help me run away from the stage on the day of the performance."
"Activate the fire alarm to cause confusion."
(Kogoro) The plans of the concert hall!
In other words. Purple Laughter planned her own kidnapping...
and asked Takeyama to carry it out?
Nonsense!
What's the point of a star and her doing something like that?
Because the fuss would attract the attention of the whole country.
-Of course, it's true!
-Attention...?
The case is all over the TV and on the networks.
His name is now known, not only to his fans,
but also to everyone in the country!
In Takeyama has sent him a message 15 minutes ago.
"Risa, we made a mistake and kidnapped another person.
What do we do now?
I am waiting for instructions.
If they have made a mistake, they should release the Ran immediately!
"Please, Risa, telefona'm as soon as you can.
We must take the cooler to the cemetery..."
Could it be that, the cemetery?
In the cemetery?
Of course it could be!
It's a dumping ground for televisions and computers.
These people are illegally dumping
recyclable material over the mountains, huh?
I'm sure the plan was to go there
and set the Risa free because someone found it.
Exactly, and with the Ran they will do the same!
"No..., the Ran won't be let go."
"On the contrary, they can't let her go....
because she will have seen their faces."
"People without a clear plan often commit irrational and impulsive acts
when they feel cornered."
"Even if it means killing someone."
("Futari no Byoshin," Takuto)

"Where am I?"
"What... What is this?"
"I'm afraid. Father, Conan, help me."
(shoveling sand: they don't stop)
Hey!
Where's the Ran!
"He won't call again. What shall we do now?"
"Save me."
"I'm sure my daughter is of no importance to you."
And even though she doesn't explain much of what she does,
I know that my daughter dreams of a future full of happiness.
And right now you are about to take her future away from her!
