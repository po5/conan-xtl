DETECTIVE CONAN
He has a strong heart with great powers of deduction,
goes to the essence of everything with intense pace.
Today we have two murdered in different places.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is Detective Conan!

THE BAY OF VENGEANCE, (PART ONE)
(Kogoro) Which setting...!
Wow, this really goes well to forget the problems of everyday life.
Of course it does!
We'll soon forget that, for a change, the father has broken down the car....
and we can't move.
Right, Conan? (laughs)
What's wrong with them?
This is the entrance to my property.
You can't park here...
unless they come to see me, of course.
Come on, I'm sorry!
We're on vacation, we've had some trouble with the car.
My name is Kogoro Mouri.
I wouldn't want you to think that we...
And now!
But you are a very famous detective!
Man...!
So you know me!
Look how well!
I beg your pardon.
My name is Kensuke Tachibana and I have a law firm in Tokyo.
Come on!
Go who talks about celebrities!
His name is linked to the most important trials in the country!
(Think) "One of those lawyers
"Who, for money, would sell his soul to the devil..."
I don't know what it is, I always get the dangerous cases,
and more than once they've tried to kill me.
Ah, may I introduce my secretary, Yuichi Sakuraba.
My name is Yuichi Sakuraba.
It is an honor to greet you detective.
Find the phone number of the nearest garage and tell them to come here.
Yes.
In the meantime, you could come home, if you like.
The chance to talk to a famous detective doesn't happen every day.
Thank you so much!
Wow!
You're guests, Johann! That's beautiful!
Bub!
Yes, you're handsome.
Your name is Johann, right?
What a long hair you have!
What breed is he?
Actually, I don't know.
The maid found him and now he's watching the house for us.
Actually, we're very happy with him.
Ah... Have you seen how well, Johann?
(Kogoro: drunkenly) Bufa, what a fine table God!
It's fantastic!
I thought I'd never eat good fish like this again!
This is a delicacy!
It's just caught,
and it's prepared by Yaeko, a top chef.
It's only popular cuisine, sir.
- (woman) Yaeko... Say... Tell me.
Bring a bottle of wine and a risotto, please.
I'll prepare it right away, ma'am.
Welcome home, I'm Mrs. Yuki Tachibana.
Weren't you so sleepy today, my dear?
When I was told that Detective Mouri was here, my appetite was whetted.
Will you have a glass of wine with me?
We'd better not mix, we've started with sake.
Which is still wine, but made from rice and Japanese!
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha!
(Think) "He-he.... How funny..."
(Ring: ding-dong)
Who's there at this hour?
Miss Sugimura.
Hmm.
Come in.
Come in.
-Hello. Is there anything urgent, so late?
It's for Mr. Tachibana.
Good evening, Mr. Tachibana.
Here you are.
The buffet arrived today.
Another letter.
I was afraid that nothing would happen
and I preferred to take you directly.
Ah, sorry Mr. Mouri.
Look, this is my accountant.
Noriko Sugimura.
You're not Detective Mouri?
Of course it is, Kogoro Mouri himself.
Why don't you stay for dinner Sugimura?
Gladly, thank you very much.
What do you say!?
They don't have the part!?
What do you mean, nothing until tomorrow?
Now we're really screwed.
Mr. Mouri!
You can spend the night at home.
Ah..., yes?
Sure, man, weren't you on vacation?
I'm Mrs. Tachibana.
No matter how long it takes, make sure it's brand new, eh?
Ready, Mr. Mouri.
No commitment.
They're at your place.
Thank you...
MAAA mine!
To make a natural wood bath like this one you must have long cal√©!

You know what lawyers do!
(Think) "This confirms the rumors
"that have been circulating lately about Tachibana."
(Tachibana: call) What are they, these figures!?
You're not doing an embezzlement ?!
For this is inadmissible!
Before you came in, that didn't happen!
Before you raise your voice and get so nervous,
maybe you should control your wife's expenses.
Rumor has it that he wants revenge.
(He thinks) "He wants revenge?"
Either he gets divorced at once and settles all of this
or he sends us the money he is pocketing under his hand!
He must save his firm!
Before that TK comes to kill him!
(He thinks) "I don't understand. Revenge, why...?"
"And who is that 'TK'?"
Sakuraba, have we been able to stop him, that one?
Not yet...
You're useless!
That's why I always fail in the competitive examinations!
Excuse me, sir!
You don't give me time to study.
-Besides, this is not my job! - (slap)
I do not tolerate impertinence, me!
Bad manners lead nowhere, you feel me!?
(snoring)
I'm fed up...
You were hungry, eh Johann?
Good morning! (snoring)
You're up already?
Good morning, Mr. Tachibana.
So, did you sleep well?
Very well, thank you very much.
I'm going fishing again today, let's see what we eat tonight.
I'm sorry to bother you like this.
Do not suffer.
Stay and rest until the car is fixed.
I really like to have home.
Sir, the food.
You stay as owner.
See you later!
(Dog: borda)
What a way to bark.
Is there anything wrong?
I'm sorry.
It's just that today we haven't taken him out for a walk yet.
As the lady said she was coming home,
we've been up and down all morning.
Well, I'm late, I have to go to Tokyo.
Hey, why don't we take him out for a walk ourselves?
Since we've been here, we've been doing nothing but work...
Oi, father?
Sure.
Anyway, we have to go to the workshop.
-Doesn't it hurt?
-It would be a great help to us.
So, so, so much, woman, all out of it!
(Johaaaaann, waitaaaaaa't!
You plan to run all the time!?
Aturaaaa't!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaah!
I told you to stop, dammit!
I'm fucking tired!
Pause, we make a pause!
Aaaah... I can't take another step!
Ha-ha-ha!
I see you've made friends, you and Johann, eh?
Are you kidding me?
Come on, come on.
For the record, I've taken her out of commitment!
-Oh... What's wrong with you, Johann? - (Johann: borda)
(Johann: borda)
Johann!
(Johann: Wait!)
Where are you going?
(Johann: Board!)
You like boats?
Surely it must be someone you knew.
Wow!
That sure works up an appetite!
Bon appetit!
Bon appetit!
Bon appetit!
What a beautiful view, by the sea.
Wow, look at that!
There's something wrong with the boat.
Oh, no...
No... It can't be!
It's Mr. Tachibana's!
Eh?!
What?!
Hey, hey, hey!
It's about to sink!
Gee, no!
Yaeko!
Call the police, hurry!
Yes.
(Man) Gee, what happened?
(Man) He says he's been in a boat.
(Man) I think it's that lawyer.
Let's see, gentlemen?
Do you recognize that this man is Kensuke Tachibana?
Yes, it's him.
No doubt about it...
The tide has begun to rise when we came to rescue him,
and, unfortunately, we didn't get there in time.
Inspector, Mr. Tachibana wasn't wearing a life jacket?
Now that you mention it, he was wearing it when he went out in the morning.
Was he really?
Why did he take it off?
Some people take it off when they get too hot.
That's why misfortunes like this happen!
(He thinks) "But it's winter. No matter how good the weather is..."
If he had worn the vest, by now....
Sir...
If we had talked, sometimes,
that at high tide, precautions must be taken.
Who would have thought it?
(He thinks) "All the more reason to doubt that he took off his vest by himself."
(Ambulance: siren)
Excuse me, and you are...?
Hiroshi Inuyama, I am the owner of the boat.
I have a rental business back here.
A boat identical to Mr. Tachibana's was stolen from me.

If you could look for it, by the way...
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure!
They say it was driven by a man with a red baseball cap.
Ah, then I've seen him too!
Near the head!
Did you see where he was going?
Well, I didn't notice.
I'd say he bent his head,
but when the rocks covered it, we stopped seeing it.
It was close to where Mr. Tachibana sank.
Therefore, the two vessels may have collided there!
I am talking about 2 hours before the incident, however.
There's something that scares me, in all of this.
I think maybe it's the same one who visited us once....
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
A couple of months ago a man came to the house
who was also wearing a red baseball cap...
He argued with the gentleman.
If it's the same person,
he stole the boat to get close to the victim.
We will find the boat, Mr. Inuyama!
Thank you very much!
(Johann: gunwale)
Bub, wow!
Bub!
Ah, inspectors.
How can I help you?
No one's back yet, but...
We have the autopsy results.
What do we do, Inspector Baba?
We wait for them to come back!
So we'll feel Detective Mouri's deductions.
Ah, very good.
Why do you want to hear them, Mouri's deductions?
Man, they are famous.
Detective Kogoro Mouri is quite well known.
He says that he finds the solution to the most bizarre cases
by dancing to music.
They call him the "Dancing Kogoro"!
(Think) "Yeah, man..."
(Kogoro) What?
A sleeping pill!
Have they found a sleeping pill in the body?
Yes.
We believe that Mr. Tachibana was in a coma
when he fell into the water and drowned.
Do you think he might have had a motive to commit suicide?
Any motive to commit suicide?
I don't think he committed suicide.
He was in a good mood...
I'm going fishing again today, let's see what we eat tonight.
He also said to me:
"Stay until the car is fixed."
"I like to have home."
I get it.
In this case, someone must have made him take the pill.
Good evening Yaeko, are you home already?
Yes, I've just arrived.
Excuse me, I'll get dinner ready right away.
Mrs. Kamei, what did you go shopping for?
Yes, the lawyers from the master's law firm are meeting here...
and I'll prepare dinner for them.
I know you are very busy, but...
could you answer a few questions, please?
Sure, uh...
What was there, to the master's lunch bag?
(Kamei) Some snacks and a thermos of coffee.
What were they, the sandwiches?
(Kamei) Hamburger and vegetables, lettuce, onion, tomato...
Hmm.
It matches the autopsy.
Yes.
The victim has eaten, that's quite evident.
The bag of food was given to you by Mr. Sakuraba, correct?
Yes, the lady had just called me with great urgency.
and I had to ask him to take care of it.
There are 3 people who have had the opportunity to put the sleeping pills.
Nobody has put anything in the bag!
Where did this sleeping pill come from?
Are you Mr. Sakuraba?
Yes, the same.
Have you heard about Mr. Tachibana's death?
Yes.
A policeman told me just now when I was parking.
By the way, may I ask what kept you so long?
Of course, Inspector.
Sir sent me to Tokyo, at the office.
There I was told that he drowned when the boat capsized.
But this sleeping pills thing is very strange to me.
Yes, someone has put a sleeping pill in the thermos of coffee he was carrying.
It can't be...
It could have been the mysterious man in the red baseball cap.
Of course, there is this possibility.
A strange letter arrived yesterday, didn't it, Mr. Sakuraba?
What's that?
What do you mean, a letter?
Well, yes, we've been receiving threats for a few days now.
Threats?
Why didn't you tell us?
You had to tell us!
As far as I can see, all 3 have the same text!
"If you don't want to lose the license, prepare 3 million yen. TK."
This is an obvious threat !
In the diary, it says: "He is a wretch and not worth dealing with."
"Look at that threatening lawyer.
"That he successfully defended against a crime he was guilty of.."

So, Mr. Sakuraba, do you have any idea who this mysterious TK might be?
No, I don't.
Don't run away from study, man!
The newspaper says that Mr. Tachibana defended this TK,
that he was guilty,
and managed to prove his innocence.
And it says you don't know who he is?
No.
In fact, when the letter arrived, I inadvertently saw it...,
y... Mr. Tachibana, angry, told me to forget it.
(Door: call)
Excuse me.
The lawyers from the law firm have arrived.
Very well, then, take the opportunity to question them.
We've come to look for Mr. Tachibana's body,
but they won't let us take it.
What's wrong?
No, but first we would like to check a couple of things.
Where is the lady?
She's waiting for us with her relatives at her house.
And that young woman, Sugi... whatever you call it?
Sugimura, you mean?
On Saturday and Sunday she has a party,
and we suppose it's outside like every weekend.
(Man) It's here!
Hey, look...
It's the red cap!
Inspector Baba reports!
Sorry to disturb the dawn,
but we've made an interesting find.
It's this baseball cap.
Have you seen it before?
It's the same as the one worn by the man in the boat I saw.
Is that so?
And you, Mrs. Kamei, what do you say?
Well... I think it looks the same to me too.
It turns out that this cap has a name, you know?
Look at it.
Have you heard it, the name Tatuy Kumada?
No... It doesn't ring a bell.
-Have you?
-No.
Didn't you say Kumada, the guy you defended in Tachibana...
about 5 years ago now?
The trial was the year you went to work.
Ah, yes, it was.
Is that him?
And he came out innocent, this Kumada guy?
Yes.
And in fact we had everything against him, it was an impeccable job.
I think... his name was Ku... Kumada Tatuy, in Japanese!
(Think) "In Japan, the first and last names reverse!"
"Therefore, the initials are.... TK!"
Sure, it's the TK signature of threats!
This means...!
In Kumada was to threaten in Tachibana,
but he did not fall, he did not relate it.
Or maybe it was the other way around:
maybe he answered him with another threat to chat everything.
That's why the murderer moved to the boat,
gave him the sleeping pill and took off his vest.
It all fits, Inspector Baba!
Let's go, Inoki!
We must find Kumada, it's very important!
It's very important!
Okay! (Car: siren)
(Car: siren)
Wow, it's unbelievable that he lived only 25 minutes away from the victim.
-I see it more and more clearly. -It's obvious!
Why did you have to come, you, huh?
Man, because I saw the man in the red cap.
(doorbell: ding-dong)
(ding-dong)
That's strange.
They say he works at night, this man.
He should be home now.
Look, he hasn't locked up.
Is it open?
Excuse me, Mr. Kumada...
-Oh, my God! -Ooooh!
(Thinking) "Co... How can it be...!"
"You mean the suspect...
"Has taken his own life?"
Sugimura!
How can you know this, if you've only been with the firm for 3 years?
Is it true that your father committed suicide because of your husband?
Look who's talking!
You, who are making a fortune with the firm's money!
That's a lie!
(Thinking) "Sure! That explains everything!"
And the next Conan: "The Bay of Vengeance, (part two)."
