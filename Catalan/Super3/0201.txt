The water that flows has no form.
The wind that blows is unseen.
Today we ride in an antique bus
carrying the secrets of a murder.
The truth comes out in the end.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is Detective Conan!

THE TENTH PASSENGER, (FIRST PART)
-Oh, it's so nice... -The air is so cool.
The best thing is that it doesn't have air conditioning.
This bus is one of those old-fashioned buses.
I don't know what the hell they find
to travel in this junk from the last century.
This is the charm of it!
I had never been on such an old bus before,
that's why I have such a good time!
What do they call it, one of these? Bonnet Bus!
I read that there were many of them in Japan 30 years ago!
Look at it.
It has a narrow nose, see?
That's why it's easy to advance one in a curve.
-You said it! -You said it! -You're a well of science, boy!
Yes..., I read it in a magazine.
Yes, of useless things, as many as you want!
No.
No way, master!
They are not useless!
At least not for those of us who live in Kagekuwa.
The bus is a very valuable tourist attraction!
Don't get me wrong...
My name is Takuro Yabe from Kagekuwa.
Oh!
Head of the Youth League!
On behalf of the bus and Kagekuwa, welcome!
Ladies and Gentlemen!
The nature that surrounds you is what our village has to offer!
Enjoy the extraordinary greenery of the landscape!
What energy!
Hey, Natsume, will you guide me, please?
Ah... Yes!
Excuse me.
(Whistle: two taps)
(Whistle blows)
Come on, have you seen what a rock?
It must have fallen from the top of the mountain.
-Ah!
Look at this!
-Will we be able to turn?
What for.
Hmm.
(thinks) "A cenotaph?"
Hey, you!
Follow me, the bus is empty.
Touch two!
This is my seat!
That's your !?
There are reserved seats?
Come on, Okumura, please!
Today is Sunday!
I know that, impertinent!
At the last assembly it was agreed...
that there would be no reserved seating on weekends!
This will be agreed upon by you: the mayor, you and your little group!
What a nerve!
What are you going to do?
Are you going to force me to obey orders?
Go ahead, let's see if you get out!
-And you vanished! -And you vanished!
-Hey!
I've been dry here for 40 years!
And so it will be until I die.
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
If you don't mind changing...
(thinks) "What's the matter with you people here?"
That's nothing, it's so crowded.
Of course, for the locals it's not a tourist attraction,
but a means of transportation.
(Snoring)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Eh ?!
What's wrong?!
Okumura!
What's wrong with him!?
What happened!
(People: scares)
-What... What happened? - Someone who is not feeling well.
-Let's go to the hospital! - (Kogoro) Too late!
Y-you mean he's...?
Yes, he's dead.
"Looks like someone must have poisoned the tea in this bottle!"
(Kogoro) Hold it!
Nobody comes down from here until the police arrive!
But why?
One... one moment!
I don't think this is necessary.
You go first, Yabe!
If it was a homicide, you will be the first suspect...
because you argued with the victim and because you sat behind him!
Lo... micidi...?
Who do you think you are, you?
My name is Kogoro Mouri and I'm a private detective.
Oh.
Mouri, the famous detective!
-Òndia!
You mean this is fat! -So fat!
It must be.
Who could it have been?
At your service!
I'm agent Hitoshi Shinkai, from Kagekuwa.
It will be an honor to work with the famous private detective Kogoro Mouri!
(Wringing his neck)

Yes, well...!
I'm glad to meet such a promising agent.
I hope I can be of help in this case.
I appreciate it, detective!
(Flux) By the way..., you say it was a homicide?
Are you sure?
If so, it could be very serious.
Ah... Well, before we conclude anything, we should...
You can go up on your feet.
You always stick your nose where it doesn't belong!
Look at that.
Just look at the blister.
Eh?
The bottle?
Can't you see it's leaking?
I'd say it has a pinhole.
You're right!
Maybe they have introduced the poison with a needle.
Very well!
We'll search everyone!
Whoever has a hypodermic needle is the killer!
I don't think so.
The windows were open,
the murderer could have thrown himself out quietly!
Besides, if he got off at a previous stop, he's not here anymore!
I think we're in for a storm.
No, more than a storm.
What we will have is war!
What is it?
The... war!?
-It's terrible.
-What a fright!
Blood will flow.
(Thinking) "What blood will run?"
(People: whispers)
You must warn me before making any decision!
Detective Mouri, we have found the hypodermic needle
on the side of the road where the bus passed.
There were traces of poison.
-And fingerprints? - (man) Agent Shinkai!
Inspector Hino.
You're not allowed to give this information to strangers!
You didn't find any fingerprints, did you?
Of course they didn't!
If they had,
they obviously would have taken ours for comparison.
Yes, you're right.
Who are they, these people?
Sir, this is Kogoro Mouri, a renowned private detective.
He was traveling on the bus.
With your permission, I, the "Sleeping Kogoro", will help them.
How ridiculous!
What's the gamble that, while you're at it, someone will solve the case for you!
(thinks) "Ha-ha-ha! You're not off track."
Look, you can do your as long as you don't get in the way of my work.
Grrr!
What a nasty guy!
Well, we'll do ours!
You can solve the case without the help of that wanker.
Of course I can!
You'll see, Inspector Hino!
He'll swallow his pride!
Detective Mouri, I don't know if I can do much, but he'd like to help.
"It won't stay that way!"
"No one commits a crime under my nose and walks away unscathed!"
"I intend to find the murderer alone, if necessary!"
If you would be so kind as to wait here
while the police finish questioning the witnesses...
This is the only available inn we have in town.
What do you mean, officer?
Are you implying that it's not worthy...?
Mrs. Koma!
No, it's not that...
Ha-ha-ha!
Just kidding... Welcome to the Koma Inn.
I think it's a beautiful guesthouse.
It has a lot of character.
Yeah, nothing like a nice wooden building!
They're warm, aren't they?
Thank you very much.
-Besides, the hostel is completely neutral.
Neutral?
I've been having a hard time keeping up with all these storms, wars...
and I don't know what stories.
It's just... the thing is...
You'll find out soon enough.
Now go into the rooms.
Wow, you can see Fuji-San from here!
What a view!
Look, you're in Conan, aren't you?
You sleep here?
And you're the bus guide! You live here?
Yes.
From here we have the best view of Fuji-San in the whole village.
Mr. Mouri!
I've got news!
-What is it? -Big news!
The police are questioning Mr. Yabe right now.
You see!
I was telling you, he was the main suspect!
This I couldn't tell you,
but the real news is where they are questioning him!
What do you mean?
Instead of taking him to the police station, they interrogated him in the village!
A group of sympathizers and one of the opposition have learned about it.
"Supporters and opposition?"
Go home!
The police have to do their job!
We don't trust them!
Give us in Yabe!
-The deputy mayor is dead!
-He's a murderer!
It's not true!
It wasn't him!
He is innocent!
Mayor, you ordered him, didn't you!?
Bastard!
Catch him!
Stop, I tell you!
Or I'll arrest you for resisting arrest!
What the... What's going on here?
(Men: shouting and hitting)
Stop it!
A little calm!
Everybody shut up!

Kogoro!
Father!
Mr. Mouri, have you drunk wrong?
Enough!
(Call) I said proooooou!
Yes, people start to disperse and things go back to their place.
Thank you very much!
Apa, that's it.
Mr. Mouri, the patrol car you were carrying in Yabe has arrived safely at the police station.
Look, I don't care about that.
What the hell is going on in this town?
In fact, we've gone a whole year without riots,
but ever since the assembly decided
that the bus had to be used to attract tourists,
the faction in favor of tourism development,
led by the Mayor and Yabe,
and the opposing faction, led by Deputy Mayor Okumura,
are at loggerheads.
The bus has always been the means of transportation for the people here.
It's a small town where everyone knows each other.
The people who were sitting in the same spot got used to it
to the point of making it their own.
But they decided that on the weekends....
the seats would be given to tourists.
And the deputy mayor and his people didn't like the idea?
Not at all.
And things are getting worse and worse.
But from that to murder...
(Man) In Yabe is innocent!
Sorry for the scene earlier, I'm Mayor Funaki!
And you are a famous detective, they say.
I would like you to work for us on this case!
I assure you that in Takuro Yabe the deputy mayor is not dead!
I don't want to speak ill of the dead,
but this man had enemies to give and sell!
Even in his own group.
I want you to find the real killer!
And if it turns out that the real killer is Mr. Yabe?
We will do whatever it takes!
But now things have to be put back in place immediately!
Now that people were beginning to forget
that tragic incident 7 years ago, this happens...
What happened, 7 years ago?
Ah..., nothing to worry about.
By the way, how would you like a million as a fee?
One... million?
Whatever it takes to bring this town back to normal!
I'm counting on you, Mouri!
Very well!
We start investigating!
All right!
I-I'll accompany you!
(Kogoro) Excuse me...
Do you know if the victim, Mr. Okumura,
always took the bus at the same time?
Ow, get out of here!
If I could ask you four questions...
Excuse me, I'm here to...
Hey, what's going on in this town?!
What's going on in this town?!
The mayor has more detractors than supporters!
And word must have gotten out that he hired him,
so the people... well... you know...
(thinks) "Shit! So we won't do anything!"
Hey, Ran.
You two go back to the inn!
I'll be a little longer here.
Oh, and I'm not expected for dinner!
Who knows what time I'll be done.
Officer, just a moment!
Ah... I'm here, Conan?
Can you explain to me what happened, 7 years ago?
Ah, that comment made by the mayor...
It was a bus accident.
A bus?
Like the Bonnet Bus, today's bus?
That's right, it was today's bus.
We had it fixed and it was as good as new.
What was it like, the accident?
Were there any deaths or injuries?
This was before I was transferred here,
but they say two people died.
Yes, that's right, exactly two people.
Why are you so interested?
No, not at all!
Curiosity and quite a lot!
-Hey, Shinkai!
That's for today! Yes, sir!
I'm coming!
(Think) "The same bus 7 years ago."
"An inconvenient mayor and too much money involved."
"There's a catch. Yes, sir! I'm sure!"
Wow!
What a presentation!
I hope you find it good.
It's traditional county food.
Toko!
Miss Natsume!
What are you doing, Conan? Hey, Toko, what is it?
Yes, say.
What is it?
I want to ask you something.
But don't shout from the balcony, man!
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.
What do you want to know?
It's about the bus accident 7 years ago.
Ah! Huh?
I'm sorry, Conan.
I only came here 6 months ago.
I've heard about the accident, but I didn't live through it.
Oh, wow.
Mind you, since we pass by there every day, it's hard not to remember.
It was where the cenotaph is! Ah, that's why.
Wow.
Look how scary that cliff is.
They say it all started...

with two drunken passengers who were fighting
and they destabilized the vehicle towards the cliff.
What the...?!
Excuse me!
It slipped out of my hands.
I'll be right back with another one.
Is it ok?
Is it bad?
No, I'm fine.
Toko, is anything wrong?
Oh... No, why?
Look, I have to go to dinner now...
See you later, Conan.
Damn!
I'm lonelier than one.
Not even the supporters are willing to open their mouths!
This town is a disaster!
Father, lower your voice, everyone will feel you!
And what?
What's the matter?
Who is not neutral, this site?
Why do they refuse to cooperate?
It is very strange.
According to Agent Shinkai,
they're torn between attracting tourists and kicking them out
because they say they are dirty people,
who destroy nature and make noise!
Because of them, people don't close their eyes!
It should make us reflect.
Reflecting does not help me to do my job!
(Think) "If we don't get information, we won't get anywhere."
Screw it!
Merdaaaaa!
Eh?
Father, what have you got?
The "Sleeping Kogoro" show's starting!?
(snoring)
Oh no...
It's just that he's trunk and has fallen asleep.
I already knew that!
Conan, tell them to clear the table!
And get the futons ready, too!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
"Eh? The mistress. Where should she go, at this hour with a bouquet?"
Conan!
Conan!
See, and now where does he stop?
What's that?
The shoes are gone!
He's gone out, then?
Forgive me... Forgive me... (cries)
"Eh?"
"The Toko!"
"What are you hiding from us?"
"I don't understand."
Conan, where have you gone?
Conan!
Kagekuwa Shrine.
What if this is it...?
Hey, you!
What are you doing?!? Ouch!
Is that you?
Conan, is that you?
What are you doing out here so late!
Ju... I was playing hide-and-seek.
Don't scare me, man.
Nothing happened?
In Yabe, they released her for lack of evidence,
and she was coming to tell Mouri.
(Man: call)
It's the mayor's voice!
Co... Conan!
But-but what is he doing!?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Raaaaaaaaaan!
(Think) "Straight to the heart, death has been instantaneous."
You are stopped!
Surrender!
Tell me what happened... on that bus.
What-what does it say?
What-that the killer is on the bus?!?
It can't be!
The brakes don't respond!
Hell, no!
