I see that, fortunately, you haven't noticed anything so far.
You can say that.
One day or another, the Japanese will eventually understand
what all this gambling is about.
Now would be a good time.
What do you think?
Shall we buy?
Don't worry.
We've already taken care of it.

"The bodyguard of the J.League."
(Male) We didn't do very well in the World Cup qualifiers.
Today's result will be key in deciding the second round.
Yes, he's right.
And the fans know it.
All the tickets have been sold out.
In addition, sales of the league's promotional products...
are up 30%.
-Don't you think that's pretty good, 30%? -Yes, we're confident you'll do well.
-Yes, we're confident you'll do well.
No.
I wasn't talking about the figures, now.
Yes, I was.
I was talking about today's game.
If the Spirits win, we'll hardly fill the stadium now.
We'll have to do something.
Nothing, nothing, you make sure that the players have a good game...
and that the fans have the best time they can.
Sure, don't suffer.
(Ouch) We can't get beyond this gate,
it's an access for the players and the stadium workers.
Besides, the locker room at the end of the hall?
only the players and the coach can enter.
And this door is now open,
but, when the players of the teams come in,
they close it and don't open it again until the game is over.
This way they make sure that the opposing players don't have a chance to talk to each other.
don't have a chance to talk to each other at any time.
What happens?
They can't use their cell phones either.
-It's not that, it's just that... -It's just that you talk a lot today, Ai.
No.
What's wrong with you?
She's very happy to have been able to come and see the stadium.
Don't get excited, guys, I'm the only protagonist here.
You are the companions.
It's clear to you, isn't it?
You're making me stand still.
You know everything about the stadium.
In fact, I don't know what else I can add that she hasn't already explained.
When she touches on a subject, you learn every last detail.
"You can say that now."
If Big Osaka and Ryusuke Higo were playing today....
"I didn't say anything."
(Iwasada) Would you like to see the locker room?
(Genta) Yes.
Can we?
- (Mitsuhiko) Isn't the match starting?
- (Iwasada) No.
We have time until the players arrive.
It's now or never.
-Who would have thought, huh?
- (Ayumi) Come on!
And if you can live this experience, it's thanks to one person.
(Ayumi) Me, isn't it?
(Ayumi) "Mr. Mouri is very satisfied, but tonight,
"Before the start of the match between Tokyo Spirits and Gamba Osaka,
is when he will have to prove his worth."
"She has been invited to take the kick-off of the game
for her merits as a detective."
"We'll see what he's made of."
(Children) Wow!
That's so cool.
That's so cool.
(Kids) - No.
-Is that the players' locker room?
It's a room where they get comfortable and relax before the game.
You'll find the locker room right at the back of this room.
Hey.
And we can go there too?
Shall we go in?
-And we can go.
-Well!
How cool!
Don't get excited.
I feel like a professional soccer player.
Yes.
Me, since I've been sitting here,
I see myself capable of being a soccer crack.
"And now, what nonsense!"
(Ayumi) I've found it!
The signature on Hide!
And... how do you know it's his?
Because next to it is the number 11, which is his.
Of course it is.
Number 11 is reserved for en Hide Akagi.

Hey, you like this player?
Yes.
And, besides, I felt that he's playing again today, right?
That's true.
He was injured, I think.
And I brought him an energy drink and everything.
-No way!
-What?
You brought him a drink?
Oh.
You can't bring them drinks before the game.
Yellow card for the lady.
Don't suffer, Mr. Tonozuka.
I was just about to tell him.
I hope so.
I'm very sorry.
Yes, I do.
What a temper!
A yellow card?
Did I do something wrong?
No, woman.
You haven't done anything.
But the drink you brought him can't be drunk now.
You have to drink it before the game,
it should give him energy to play well.
Yes, yes, I understand, but...
Look at her.
Can't you see she's about to cry?
If he drinks it now, he could test positive later.
He'd be sanctioned and he wouldn't be able to play for a while.
Yes, it's true.
He could be sanctioned.
-For doping?
-But I only put honey and... -But...
It's not that.
We all know that you wouldn't put anything strange.
But these are the rules before professional matches.
Don't you want them to think that Hide is cheating?
-I didn't say anything!
-He doesn't cheat!
Excuse me... You know how kids are.
They don't know how these things work.
Shall we go on, then?
Now we'll go to the infirmary,
which is precisely where the anti-doping tests are carried out.
After the matches,
the players have to pass and take some tests.
Today they will also pass the anti-doping control?
Wasn't it only after important matches?
What a mania to think that everyone cheats!
As they do not, it is better that they pass the tests.
It is exactly the other way around.
In Japan, no one has ever tested positive...
until now in the professional soccer league.
Yes.
That's good, isn't it?
-It's okay.
I'll take it home.
-That's not necessary, woman.
You can't give it to him now, but when the game is over, I'll send it to him.
-Of course.
-Really?
See how nice, Ayumi?
So he won't get sick during the match.
-No, woman, no.
-What do you mean?
That she's no good?
What does she mean?
In fact, here you have official and verified energy drinks.
-Official drinks?
-Look...
They're over there.
(Ai) They used them to celebrate the opening of the stadium.
It's a limited edition.
They're safe for the players, because they're unopened bottles.
(Mitsuhiko) Yes.
The goalkeepers often have them next to the goal.
(Mitsuhiko) Wow.
You guys know a lot.
Do I need to be your guide?
Maybe they don't, but I do.
I want one of these, one of these drinks.
Me too.
As a gift.
Now we had to go into the locker room.
You don't want to come, do you?
-Now I don't know what to do.
-Hey? -You do?
Can't we go later?
Think that the players will not be long in coming.
- (Genta) You should have asked earlier!
-If you want to see, it must be now.
What do you mean?
What should I ask you, kiddo?
Mr. Iwasada is right.
When the players arrive, we no longer have to be.
The two of us are going.
If you don't want to come, it's up to you.
-I want to see them!
-We're coming, we're coming!
Wait Contact us
(Iwasada) In the area where the players are we can't enter.
Before the match they use this board
to mark the positions and strategies, right?
(Iwasada) I can tell you know a lot too.
(Mitsuhiko) What a pity!
I wanted to talk to the coach to explain a plan.
You wanted to advise him?
In Maedono they change the underwear at halftime.
(Mitsuhiko) -Yes, I know.
-Deja-l'hi above.
You already know?
And if you know, why don't you do it?
Ah... Excuse me.
I wanted to say that understood.
Now I put you on the uniform.
Stop chatting and do it at once.
You tell me when I'm done with it.
You're just wasting my time.
-What?
-Hello. -Hello.
I see you're very busy.
We're here to see the locker room.
We'll try not to disturb you too much.
When you're done, check the drinks again, okay?
Sure. I'll check them now.
I'll check them now.
Check them again.
I don't want you to miss anything, I know you.
What do you mean by that?

(Shinichi voice) You can say it.
What an unpleasant man!
Yeah, and he said no way, didn't he?
It's quite normal.
Material handlers always take their work very seriously.
-Not a "loaded" one.
-What's this?
What's a "loaded"?
-A material "manager," he said.
- (Mitsuhiko) A foreman?
(Mitsuhiko) -And you're a foreman too?
-Yes, so am I.
Look, the players haven't arrived yet...
and they've already put everything in place.
(Ayumi) Yes, that's right.
(Mitsuhiko) I made it so that the players don't have to wear anything, right?
- (Genta) Why do you say that?
- (Ai) They take care of every detail.
Because they prepare their clothes, slippers,
the drink and even their favorite candies.
They do it to take away their stress and to help them concentrate.
-Yes.
-That's what it's all about, isn't it?
-Yes.
In you know a lot.
-And she knows where everything is.
-And she's never wrong?
-Yes.
She knows everything.
She rarely does.
What knows where everything is the guy from before.
In fact, I'm an intern at the moment.
Although I'm not in charge of material.
Don't take credit for it.
Earlier in Yuichi told me
that you practically know more about what the players need than he does.
-That can't be right.
-That, he told you?
I don't believe it.
-I can't imagine him speaking well of anyone.
-I'm sure he's hiding something.
-Don't be like that, guys.
He-he-he-he!
I'll tell you when we're alone.
(People: shouting)
A photo!
(People: shouting)
At Hide!
-Hide!
Hey, can you come here for a moment?
-Yeah, sure.
What's up?
This girl has brought something expressly for you.
I, uh... It's just that... Can I really give it to her?
Of a... okay.
A... This is a drink and...
If you drink it... well... you'll have a lot of energy and you'll play very well.
Thank you very much, thank you very much.
What luck!
It's the best present you could give me.
I'm sure we'll win today's game with it.
See you later.
Cheer up a lot.
-Ayumi.
Ayumi.
-Hey.
Yes, I've seen it.
Oh, wow.
Now he's fainted.
Oh, my goodness, I'm like a flan.
I can't stop shaking.
What nerves!
What a style, Mr. Mouri!
The truth is that it suits you very well.
Yes?
You're sure?
I was finally able to give the drink to Hide.
Normally you can't.
You gave it to him?
Did you?
We'll have one left over.
That's great!
I'll keep the one that's left over.
(Conan voice) You could buy it, couldn't you?
Ah... That's it.
All at once.
"He's euphoric, this one, today."
Eh?
Conan...
Ah!
Yasuhito!
I struggled to get distance, and the lack of practice showed.
Attempting a shot like you did is already a success.
Ah.
Mr. Mouri...
I'd say... someone called for me.
Yes, I did.
I'm a big fan of the Sleeping Kogoro.
May I shake your hand?
Of course you can.
I was told you'd be doing the honorary service for today's match
and I thought I might meet you.
-Don't exaggerate.
-I feel very lucky.
What? (Laughs)
You see?
See how people who know how to recognize someone who's worth it react?
-You can tell the Endo doesn't know him well.
-What does he say now?
-You mean?
-What a handsome man he is!
Mr. Mouri, the big moment has arrived.
Get ready.
-Ah.
Already?
It's time?
-Good luck.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
Let's go.
You'll see.
I'll score at least three.
"If you only do the service of honor!"
(Speaker: man) Come on, this is starting already.
Today's service of honor will be performed
the famous detective known as the Sleeping Kogoro.
Let's hear it for... Kogoro Mouri!
"Ouch... I feel terrible."
We will begin with a special service of honor.
A penalty kick.
Goalkeeper Masunaga prepares to stop the ball...
Aaaah... No.
No...
What's he doing?
He must think it's funny...
Oh, mother...
What a shame, my mother...
(Man: laughing)
It is more than evident that he has diarrhea.
There is no need to test him.
Ah!
Here we go again.
I'll be right back.
I'm going to the bathroom.
(Shinichi voice) Curry rice.
What must you have eaten?
Yes, I did.
Have you eaten too?
I'm fine.
Well... you know how you'll end up.
(Kogoro) How come there's no door to the bathroom?

I can't make any noise now.
It's the washroom for doping control.
There is no door to prevent cheating.
But that's no way to relax.
I'm sorry about that.
If you want one with a door, you can go to the ones outside.
"Sure..."
(Beep)
-Come on, let's go!
-Come on, guys!
-Don't let up.
-Hide!
In Kogoro has drunk one of these bottles.
Now what?
Do you want us to investigate it?
Who do you think it may have been?
(Music: covers the voice)
"Why did he do it?"
Goooooooool!
The first goal is scored by Yasuhito Endo!
Yes, I'm sure it was at that moment.
Can you?
Thank you very much.
You look like you've found something.
Yes, I did.
It was in the kitchen trash.
Someone has cut the neck of the bottle,
put it in hot water to soften it up.
and that's how they managed to get the plastic out
without deforming the cap.
With a bit of luck, he burned himself doing it.
What about you?
How did it go?
I found out what the components of the drink were:
rhubarb, aloe, senna and Bisacodyl.
I mean... all laxative elements.
Yes.
Laxatives.
Which are not lethal.
Is that all?
Maybe he doesn't like Kogoro.
I don't get it.
I threw it away.
You're sure?
And the bottle where is it?
Because we have no crime.
But why?
In Kogoro is not a victim of anything.
Man... We have a victim.
You sure?
You are very cruel, aren't you?
Soon it will be half of it.
And then the material guys will be going crazy.
Are you planning to do the Sleeping Kogoro routine?
Kogoro has been left alone in one of the VIP rooms.
The medication has made him groggy.
How is he?
This man is groggy in no time.
When the second part starts, I'll let you know.
Don't worry, he won't suspect anything.
The second half begins
with the score one-nil in favor of the Spirits.
Gamba Osaka must turn the score around.
Will they come out?
- (door: call) -Go ahead.
You called me?
Yes, I'm sorry I called you here.
That's all right.
It's no bother.
I've never been in this room before.
I'm the first to arrive?
Actually, I only asked you to come, Risa.
Just me?
Yes.
You've seen me before, haven't you?
What a way to make a fool of yourself...
3 days practicing the honor service for nothing.
Yeah, it didn't go too well.
And how is he now?
Is it over?
(Kogoro voice) You mean the stomachache, don't you?
When I went out to the field I felt terrible.
I tried to hide it a little,
but I didn't succeed, everyone saw it.
But you, you knew all this would happen, didn't you?
-Ris...
-What do you say, now!
No...
I felt very well how you were telling them:
"Quick, stop it. Don't let anyone notice."
"You were handing out the drinks."
"You were carrying that one for Hide Akagi, weren't you?"
"But you put it in front of me specifically."
You were told... to leave it in his locker, weren't you?
If I hadn't taken it in the end..,
would you have taken it with you or would you have left it with him?
It was a bet.
The truth is that I had bet everything that you would fail, Mr. Mouri.
I didn't bet money on anything, but...
This time I won.
-What do you mean?
-Yes.
It felt good.
It won't pay your debts.
You know very well that what you do is not right.
Is it all the same to you?
I'm surprised you guessed it.
It all started... two years ago,
when I was studying abroad to be a material manager.
"I became close friends with a guy who was studying the same thing I was."
"We each took out a loan and guaranteed each other."
And, since your friend has disappeared,
now you have to take responsibility for the two loans, right?
The truth is that you have guessed everything.
How could he have known, if we have just met?
What I will tell you now will surely surprise you.
This friend of yours that you say
and the man who has advised you in this whole affair,
Mr. Rodriguez..,
are part of the same criminal organization,
which is called Totocalcio.
It can't be.
Oh... But if Mr. Rodriguez...
- (door, open) -Mr. Mouri!
-Mr. Tonozuka!
-I'm sorry.
They told me what happened.

-Forgive me, please.
-I'm the one who should apologize.
You shut up.
I'm not apologizing for you, okay?
I... I apologize on behalf of the team and on behalf of the players.
I apologize because I've been such an ass...
to hire such an inept person like you.
I didn't realize what you were doing.
Mr. Mouri had to come and make me see it.
It's a good thing he noticed.
It's my fault, I didn't see it.
And now it's my turn to show my face.
Did you think we would be afraid of you, maybe?
Mr. Mouri!
Hide felt discomfort in his right boot during the whole first half...
And then we realized that it happened to him with all the boots
he had prepared for him.
And that... (cries)
only one person could have done it.
I'm sorry, because I'm out of my mind.
This has nothing to do with you, but it's that...
I... what... what I want to say is that...
I'm very sorry.
Everything she's done, deep down, is my fault.
So I... So... Please forgive me.
Please, please, please.
I'm sorry...
Goal!
-Hey.
-I've made up my mind.
No.
If she had wanted to hurt him, she had other ways to do it.
I'm sure she did.
In the world... there are a lot of very reprehensible attitudes.
We see it every day.
But here in Japan,
since the professional soccer league started,
we haven't come across any match
where the result has been fixed or manipulated.
Not once... not once.
And we should be proud of that.
And at this moment the match is over with the result of a 1-1 draw,
with a late goal by Hide Akagi.
Tonight's match... ended in a draw.
The players...
can now return to the locker room.

"No victim, no evidence, no case, they won't do anything to him."
"But what does this tell us about this criminal organization....,
the Totocalcio..."
(Ai) It's incredible, they have dismantled the gang in just one day.
If it weren't for the fact that Conan always likes to snoop around,
surely they wouldn't have succeeded.
Eh?

I had nothing to do with it.
(Kogoro) I had no idea there was a place like this in Tokyo.
Fresh air, great views... All I need is a good sake.

Not come?
Juri said the three of us had to come.
Come on, let's go.
