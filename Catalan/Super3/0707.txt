Mmm!
It's so good!
There's nothing like a nice fresh pitcher of beer!
"He-he-he-he..."
Excuse me, is that Mr. Mouri?
(Kogoro) Ah, you want an autograph?
I'll sign it right away.
-Ah.
Okay, thank you.
Tell me?
-No, you have a phone call.
(Man) "Hello."
"It's been a long time since I've talked to the famous Kogoro."
Eh?
But... but who is it?
"I find it a little hard to believe that he doesn't remember me."
-Himuro?
"I'm Reiji Himuro."
What do you mean?
That you're the Himuro bank robber?
Eh?
But...
"What are you doing, Conan?"
How nice,
"...spending time with the kids, so quietly."
What does he want?
"Someone is about to die because of you."
What do you mean?
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaah!
No... It can't be!
"To find the perfect solution,
you have to decipher all the mysteries and codes."
"A well-laid trap and a suspicious alibi."
"Kogoro is in the doldrums."
The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"Trap for a famous detective".
I can see it.
Don't move from where it is!
Kogoro, it's over there!
What's that?
Father!
Where are you going?
You haven't paid!
Hello.
I saw her looking out the window and I remembered the old days.
And I wanted to give you a call.
Will you shut up?
What did you say on the phone?
Who is it that is about to die and where?
Ha-ha-ha!
It's too late to save him, I'm sorry.
What is it?
What do you want to say?
(People: whispers)
Father, let it be!
Come on, talk.
What did he mean?
Yes, it's the famous detective!
(Man) He has lost control.
(He thinks) "Sure. This is what he wanted."
(Takagi) The dead man's name is Shingo Numa, 35 years old.
He was a mechanic and worked in the Tayo car workshop,
in Beika district 3.
He died instantly from the impact.
And he fell from up there?
What, how does this look?
"There is no doubt that he has plunged into the void
from this point on the ladder."
The railing is badly rusted and a piece is missing.
But there's no sign of a struggle anywhere.
Understood.
(Kogoro) Shingo Numa...
He meant you, huh?
Yes.
You know him, Father?
If I caught him in Himuro
it was thanks to the collaboration he offered me at NUMA.
Reiji Himuro.
I remember him.
He robbed several banks.
He was a bad piece of work.
Oh, shut up!
At NUMA wasn't he your...?
Yes.
He was their partner.
No, not exactly.
More like his errand boy.
I told him that by following that thief he had no future
and that it would end badly.
And luckily he listened to me and agreed to collaborate with me.
NUMA, you can change your life, start over.
Tell me everything you know about Himuro and I will help you.
-He's right, he's convinced me.
I've had enough of him using me as he wants.
I can't take it anymore.
And I don't want to be accused of being an accomplice to a murder because of him.
-No, no.
-Mm?
Murder?
I just thought, if I go on like this,
it could get really bad.
By the way, where are you now, in Himuro?
In the interrogation room.
Inspector Sato is interrogating him.
In Numa he was a poor bastard and a whistleblower like few others.
That's why he ended up being paroled...
and me, on the other hand,
I got a lot of years and rot behind bars.
I'm glad he's out of circulation.
Don't run away from studying, now.
He has died you, right?
-Mr. Mouri explained to us...
-Eh?
-Eh?
-And how did I do it?

"For starters, could you tell me what time he died?"
- "About 3:40 p.m., huh?"
- "Well, about 3:40 p.m."
"Well, look, if memory serves,
"At that time a famous detective was holding me by the lapels of my lapels
the Hokubu department store."
"And I was making a most frightful fool of myself in front of a lot of people."
I imagine people trust, detectives who are famous.
Thank you very much for the alibi.
Can you explain to me how you knew, that this man would die?
You can say telepathy, if you want.
Mouri, no.
But where?
-Mr. Mouri!
-Himuro.
How dare you!?
I'm sure you had it all planned
and you made him come to you so that he would fall and kill himself, didn't you?!
Please leave it alone.
May I know... what kind of authority do you have to fuck me like this?
-Mr. Mouri!
-What?
Please let go of me at once.
You have no right.
But you're pulling our leg!
Please, that's enough, Mouri.
Very well, then.
If you've finished the interrogation,
to which I volunteered, I'm leaving.
Good day to you.
(Himuro: laughing outrageously)
But what is this?
What comments!
Idiots!
Ah... Now it turns out that I'm a fool and incompetent.
(Kogoro: remember) "But we can't let him go!"
Come on.
Don't look so much and reflect a little.
Let's see, what crime do you want us to charge him with to arrest him?
He has died himself.
You have behaved violently in public
against a person who is not even a suspect.
And you're not a cop, now.
In the end we would have had to arrest you instead of him,
if you had continued down this path.
I didn't know, that you had such a bad opinion of me.
It's not true, Mouri.
But that's what people think right now.
He has provoked you and you have fallen on all fours,
and you've lost control.
Go home and rest.
I just can't believe it!
I know how you feel, but you drink too much.
"We were on that terrace."
"He didn't see us by chance, it's too far."
"I'm convinced he's been watching in Kogoro for a while."
(Ah, are you here, Conan?
And Mr. Mouri?
He had to go look at some things somewhere else...
and asked me to investigate here instead of him.
Ah, all right.
He had me very worried.
It's just that, in the press and in the social networks she has been criticized a lot.
Don't worry.
She will devote her heart and soul to clearing her good name.
By the way, Takagi, you won't have any problems if you help her,
now that he has been discredited so much?
No.
He thinks that Mr. Mouri has given us a hand in many cases.
The police are indebted to him.
It's this time, isn't it?
(Takagi) Yes.
I'd also like to see what happened a little earlier.
-(Takagi) I'm going back, then.
-Before?
Yes, here.
From a little further back.
And now we could also look at the floor below this one?
Yes, and so much.
(Takagi) About here?
(Takagi) It's in Himuro.
-The men's room.
-(Takagi) What's there where it goes?
(Takagi) Now go back.
And what's this?
This on the far right of the screen?
Ah, that?
It's probably a microphone.
They were doing a live radio show yesterday, in this department store.
Ah.
It's here, huh?
It looks like they're also doing a program here today.
Yeah, but what I don't quite understand is what he's here to do,
on this floor, in Himuro.
Ah, Kogoro asked me to look at something else somewhere else.
Somewhere else?
Thank you for waiting for me.
Agent Eguchi, Beika police.
Thanks to you.
About that... Conan, what did you want to tell him?
Mr. Mouri asked me to ask you a couple of questions,
if you'd be so kind.
Go ahead, say.
To begin with, why did you come all this way?
Ah...
I got a tip while patrolling the area on my bike.
They'd spotted a suspect hanging around inside the building.
He thinks it's absolutely forbidden to enter,
because there's a danger of it collapsing.
"And when he got there..."
Hey, what's he doing?
Where are you going?
-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
-Oh, yeah...
Aaaaah!
And who had warned about the intruder?
We don't know, because he didn't want to give his name.

And when they called that number, no one answered.
That's why I thought it was a prank.
I guess the call is recorded, right?
Maybe we could identify the caller from the voice.
Sure, we could.
Maybe it was Himuro.
I'm going to call the Beika police switchboard and also the lab.
"What intrigues me more is to know what he was doing here at NUMA."
He didn't see anyone else, around here, I guess.
-Good morning.
I'm Inspector Takagi.
-No.
I'd like you to look into a call I received at the switchboard.
Yes, that's right.
A call came in on a cell phone at half past one in the afternoon
reporting a suspect entering an abandoned building in Beika.
A cell phone?
A cell phone!
Yes.
I just remembered.
"I thought he was talking to someone on his cell phone."
Well, that's strange.
If she had a cell phone in her hand at the time she fell,
it would have been found near the body.
He could have pulled it before he fell.
Yeah, because maybe there were calls recorded...
that he didn't want anyone to see.
So we're looking in a wider area.
Yes.
"He's rusty."
Ah!
Aaaah!
"Phew. It's gone from me."
"Eh?"
"This is...?"
"Sure! It went like this."
(Eguchi) Look at it!
I found it!
It was here land!
Even if we get lucky
and we can find the fingerprints of NUMA,
we'll still have to see if the data is intact,
because it was thrown very high up and after such a strong impact...
I have just received a call from Kogoro asking us to take a good look at the
that we take a good look at the part of the railing that was broken
and caused Numa to fall into the void.
"Wait. In Himuro also had a cell phone."
"Shut up, I know where it could be."
Conan, where are you going?
"Look at it!"
(PA: woman) "Attention, customers."
"Today we will also be hosting the equipment of the popular 'Radio Afternoon' program..."
"Surely the record of incoming and outgoing calls
has also been destroyed."
"I have to find another piece of evidence."
"If you want to play the audience of the program, you know."
Attention.
When I give you the signal, start clapping very loudly, please.
"Maybe..."
(Inaudible)
(Mobile)
"Hello, inspector. Soc in Mouri."
Megure, hello?
(Kogoro voice) I'm calling to ask you a favor.
Father.
It's Inspector Megure.
You will say.
What can I do for you, Inspector?
In Himuro?
Yes..., I see now.
It's because of this man, I've been dragged here without a warrant.
What's that?
But if I didn't...
Why have you gathered us all here, inspector?
But what the hell are you doing, Mouri?
It was you who called me...
to ask me to take him to prove he was guilty.
Mouri!
Eh?
Au!
Aaaaah...
Father!
Caram.
So this is the famous Sleeping Kogoro!
I'll give you a summary of what happened.
In Himuro used the mobile to manipulate in NUMA
and make him fall down the fire stairs.
And you have way to prove that it was not an accident?
Yes.
Obviously.
There's a big hole in the fire escape
between the third and fourth floors.
"When at NUMA he wanted to dodge it, overwhelmed as he was,
he instinctively grabbed his hand on the left handrail."
"But it was too rusty,
it couldn't take the pressure and broke."
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
You really like to accuse falsely.
He can't tell me it's my fault, that the railing was rusty.
-What?
-Well, it's his fault.
Chiba, explain it, if you'd be so kind.
Yes.
We saw that the railing had a very powerful corrosive agent
a very powerful corrosive agent.
According to the lab, in a matter of a week...
it leaves the metal very brittle, on the verge of breaking.
-Himuro had Numa on the ropes.
Go ahead, Takagi.
Yes.
The other time we stopped in Himuro there was an offense
that we couldn't prove in any way that he had committed it.
Two robbers robbed a bank in Beika's district two
and, during the robbery, they killed one of the security guards...
guarding the institution.
Come on, now it turns out that I am guilty...
of the cases that have remained unsolved.

The two robbers of that bank in Beika
were you and NUMA, right?
Yesterday you had Numa come to this building.
"And he called you to tell you that it had been discovered
that you two had killed the security guard."
"And all that was missing was that at that moment
a police officer arrived shouting for him to stop."
"I'm sure in Numa he ran scared to death."
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
We have found both the cell phone you threw away in NUMA
as well as the one you abandoned in the cistern
of one of the toilets in the department store.
By comparing the call records of both mobiles, we will prove that it was you who called him,
we will prove that it was you who called him.
-Inspector Sato, tell me?
- (cell phone)
Yes.
Yes.
Understood.
It didn't go well.
The data of both mobiles are corrupted.
Can't extract the call log.
(Kogoro voice) What about the voice of the caller
reporting that Numa was in the building?
(Takagi) They used a scrambler.
It was quite entertaining.
A very, very good fictional story.
I guess his hand is broken,
at keeping people's interest with his deductive reels.
But without any tangible proof of anything he has claimed,
you can't accuse me of anything, can you, Inspector?
You should give this incompetent detective friend of yours
to this incompetent detective friend of yours.
Apa, have a good time, then.
What now, Mouri?
Father!
-Eh?
-That's not over yet.
Today we will also do "Radio Afternoon" outside our studio.
And we've moved to a peculiar scenario
in which the very famous Sleeping Kogoro
will fight to regain his good name.
"It's late."
(Kogoro voice) Let's not waste any more time, let's get down to business.
Can you tell me what you were doing yesterday at 03:40 in the afternoon?
(Woman) I was getting ready to do the live program
from the Hokubu department store.
(Kogoro voice) OK.
Can you play us the recording
that you let the boy I sent you listen to?
(Voice Kogoro) Sure.
Go ahead and play it, Takahashi.
"(People: enraonadissa)"
(Woman) "Test, test. Mic test. Does it feel good to me?"
- (man 2) "Yes, strong and clear."
- (man) "Tanaka, does it feel good?"
- "Yes, perfect, too."
- "And the rear mic?"
You can't hear anything, just a lot of fuss.
Now, please, please take out the ambient sound.
Yes.
"(Enraonadissa)"
"The police are behind you. Now you have them in front of the building."
- "Hurry up, Numa."
- "Tanaka, are you feeling all right?"
"Yes, loud and clear."
- (man) "And the back mike?"
- (Himuro) "Hide on the roof."
"If you get caught now, you'll get life imprisonment."
"Or even the death penalty."
(Himuro) "Goodbye forever, you fucking traitor."
You bastard!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
You'll see now.
(Himuro) What?
Ran!
You're such a...
"Then, in Himuro he ended up confessing....
"Both the crime of the day before
"as well as the one he had committed long ago in that robbery."
"And in Kogoro he was able to regain his good name."

Wow, have you seen the father?
I thought we could have a little party to celebrate.
But, you see, he's been toasting all by himself.
You know what?
You want the two of us to celebrate?
To famous detective.
To famous detective.
To famous detective.
(Kogoro) Cheers!
(Kogoro) Cheers.
(Ayumi) What a danger, fighting up there!
This hasn't been a suicide.
It has thrown her off balance!
It wasn't an accident either.
Someone else pushed it off the roof.
We've seen it.
Well, the numbers don't add up.
We saw that man being pushed off the roof!
-And it was two o'clock.
-That's right.
That means he's been falling for 10 minutes, a slow fall.

"Don't miss the next episode: 'The Slow Fall'."
