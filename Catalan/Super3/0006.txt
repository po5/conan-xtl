DETECTIVE CONAN
The Valentine's Day Murder Case
And what do you plan to do, Ran?
What do you mean?
With Valentine's Day chocolate!
It's only celebrated once a year.
Steal the heart of the guy you like with some chocolate.
Ah... that's right, Sonoko.
You seem to be hiding something from me.
What's that?
Why do you say that?
I know that!
It'd be a good match, Ran.
Who do you mean?
You already know.
Those who felt like talking to us in the cafeteria.
(Girl) "Medical students at Beikai University,
especially Katsuhiko."
"He's gorgeous!"
"And the other one, wasn't his name Toshihide?"
"You'd make a great couple!"
"Go on, Ran, he seemed to be really into it!"
Hey!
Hello!
Ran, I was looking for you.
What a coincidence, right?
What a coincidence, isn't it?
(Ayumi) We can solve the most complicated cases!
If you have a problem... trust the "Child Detectives"!
(Ayumi) Oh!
Conan!
Stop getting distracted and hand out leaflets!
(Thinking) "I'm Shinichi Kudo, a great detective."
"I'll pass on childish games."
Hey!
The Ran.
Ran!
I've been looking forward to meeting you to tell you something.
You were?
Yes.
Will you be my partner?
Your... partner?!
If you want to be my date for Valentine's Day.
-Valentine's Day, you say?
-Exactly.
The girl gives chocolate to the boy she likes...
and if the boy is the same, he eats the chocolate.
Hey, will you go, to the party, at Katsuhiko?
Sure... the party is at her house!
Then we'll come!
Sure we will!
Me and Ran will come to the party!
Sonoko!
Wow!
Are you sure you're coming?
That's good!
I'm so glad!
It's not funny at all, the party.
He's a donkey.
So, tomorrow I'll pick you up.
Good bye.
Why did you say yes? I thought so.
You're in love with Shinichi, aren't you?
If someone comes after you, you'll give him a pumpkin.
Why should I be interested in a guy like him?!
Now it turns out I'm a nutcase!
So, you'll come to the party, right?
Of course I will, Sonoko! That's great!
Katsuhiko Minagawa, you can get ready now!
I'll steal your heart with the sweetness of my chocolate!
Boy, how she packs it in, Sonoko...
I am and always will be a great detective...
Hey, Ran, what are you doing here?
I'm trying something... This smells, chocolate!
It's Valentine's Day tomorrow.
Ran, are you doing it for someone in particular, the chocolate?
Of course I am, man.
If it wasn't for someone, I wouldn't make it.
What if by any chance in Sinichi I came to see you tomorrow?
In Sinichi?
Now that you mention it, this name rings a bell.
I'm going, father...
Hey!
If you want to catch one, make sure it's rich!
That's strange.
I don't see Conan anywhere.
Ran!
Ran, what are you doing?
We'll go without you!
(Thinking) "I have to find out who the chocolate is for."
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Let's go!
-Cheers! -Cheers!
Members of the Beikai University Tennis Club,
we must introduce Ran Mouri and Sonoko Suzuki!
Katsuhiko, start.
Okay!
I'm Captain Katsuhiko Minagawa... and I'm pleased to meet you.
Oh, how nice!
We're nice to meet you too!
Come, come, you don't need to see me.
Kaori Sekitani.
Just because you're young, you don't need to get so excited, Sonoko.
I'm a danger.
It's always the same with me.
My beauty always makes my rivals envious.
Come on, Naomichi... now you.
Come on, man!
But don't be like that!
My name is Kohm Watabe, it's nice to meet you.
And finally, myself.
I am kind and strong....
Tears come to my eyes and I'm a great romantic.
And I call myself Toshihide Wakamatsu!
Come on, what I was missing.

What a great time, Ran.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
You can start eating now.
Mrs. Minagawa, you didn't have to do so much.
Are you his mother?
You look very young.
I'm sure you're just saying that to make yourself look good.
Hello, do you want to come and play with me for a while?
Susumu!
Go to your room.
Don't be a pain!
Ah... is that your little brother?
How cute.
I find he's nothing like you, Katsuhiko.
Coi de Ran, how long do you plan to stay at this party?
It's cold and I'm hungry.
A-aaaaatxim!
Ouch!
He's seen me!
But Conan?
What are you doing here?
I was going to a friend's house, but I got lost.
You know him, this child, Ran?
Yes, he spends some time at home because they can't take care of him.
Come on, come in, it's cold outside.
Thank you!
Very good!
And now, somebody tell us some jokes!
Naomichi!
Explain some!
Naomichi, can't you hear me?
Make us laugh!
N... I don't know, make us laugh.
What are you trying to say?
You won't do what I told you to do!?
I get sick just looking at you!
Sonoko, isn't that a bit arrogant, in Minagawa?
It's okay for a man to be overbearing.
Hey, have you brought the chocolate? Hmm.
If he tastes my chocolate, he'll fall on his ass on the floor!
(Thinks) "What did he put? Poison?"
It's time for the Sonoko Suzuki!
Ran, you must have some hobbies like tea ceremony....
She does karate.
Ran would never do a wild sport!
I do karate.
A sweet girl like you?
I don't believe it!
Kaori...
Please Katsuhiko, stop martyring Naomichi.
(Katsuhiko) It makes me angry.
Always martyring for life.
What about you?
Anyone would say you're cheerful.
What did you say?
You've changed, since that incident, and you've become aggressive.
But what do you know?
I know many things!
I am not a child!
Control yourself!
You'll accept him, won't you?
It's...
Au, go Kaori, I want us to remain friends.
Understood... that's kOhm, right?
What's wrong with you?
(Think) "It's okay, if I hold his hand?"
"Come on! You have to!"
What a nice handle.
It's... oh... it's... Oh, Ran!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Get off of me!
Oh!
Conan!
Hey, Ran! Yeah, say...
Let her be!
Coi de chiquillo!!
Stay away from Ran!
But Conan...
Susumo!
I've told you a thousand times not to eat sweets!
They still haven't fixed your cavity!
Mother, don't be angry, Kaori gave it to me.
Kaori...
It's Katsuhiko's fault, isn't it?
She's been bad!
You don't have to do anything.
Katsuhiko is a bastard!
You mustn't let him insult you like this, Kaori!
Leave me alone!
(Thinking) "At Katsuhiko..."
Katsuhiko, come on, hold on!
It seems to me that you won't be able to challenge for another 10 years!
Everyone is born with some virtue.
It must be a cross, right, Ran?
to have a guy who has more brawn than brains fall in love with you?
Shall I make you a new face?
What's wrong with telling the truth?
What do you say?
You always do the same!
Why don't you think about other people's feelings?
I thought you had no feelings.
You're asking for it!
Come on, come on, don't fight.
Assereneu's-e a little, guys.
Let go of me!
Ah... Katsuhiko...
What's the matter?!
You're going to lecture me too?
Eh?
But I didn't want to tell you...
Come on, now we can make desserts.
How nice!
I love desserts!
It's a homemade cake!
I hope you like it.
Don't suffer, I'm sure I'll like it.
It's good, this cake, Ran?
Yes, the cake and coffee are delicious.
It's bitter...
You can't drink it, this lady's coffee.
Here, eat cake.
Katsuhiko... You don't eat cake?
No, I don't like sweet things.
Don't you smoke too much?
Maybe... you should control yourself.
Shut up!
You're making me nervous!
I feel like I'm drunk.
I'm going to get some air.
Wow, it's empty.
Here, I'll give you my package.
I thought so,
KOhm's on his ass for Katsuhiko.
Hey, Ran, shouldn't you be giving me chocolate?
Eh?
(shouting)
At Katsuhiko!
At Katsuhiko!
Katsuhiko!
Katsuhiko!
Katsuhiko!

Call the police and the ambulance!
Katsuhikooooo!
Mrs. Minagawa...
Katsuhiko died a few seconds ago.
And the most likely cause of death is poisoning.
Miss Katsuhiko, you ate chocolate from her and fell down, didn't you?
Yes...
It's a very simple case, isn't it, Inspector?
Isn't it?
But what are you doing here?
My daughter told me.
And the great Kogoro Mouri is already at the scene of the crime.
And the murderer...
...is you!
You poisoned the chocolate and murdered the boy!
A story of unrequited love!
Everything will become clear when the chocolate is analyzed!
You're wrong!
It wasn't me!
It wasn't me!
KOhm...
(Thinking) "If kOhm is the murderer,
it's the easiest case I've ever seen."
"Everyone has eaten the same thing, apart from the victim."
"If the poison was sushi,
the killer couldn't guess what the victim would eat."
"Everyone has drunk coffee..."
"Only the cake is left."
"No, the victim hasn't eaten."
No, I don't like sweet things at all.
"That the kOhm is the murderer?"
Ah!
I've got it!
Hey, mister...
There was a cigarette butt at the crime scene, wasn't there?
A cigarette?
Yes!
There is also this possibility!
This is what we found at the crime scene.
The poison could be the cigarette, but...
I've seen it!
In Naomichi has given him the cigarettes!
Na-Naomichi... Did you... did you do it?!
Au, speak up!
Analyzing the cigarette will confirm it!
It's, it's true!
It was me!
I always hated her to death!
She always made a fool of me and...
she always insulted Kaori!
That's why... I put the poison in the filter of the cigarette and...
To the filter ?!
(Thinking) "It can't be!"
"It's not him, the murderer..."
(Susumo) Mother...
...I have a toothache.
"Are you washing the coffee cups at a time like this?"
"Sure, I've got it!"
It's a wristband anesthetic gun.
You can put a person to sleep who is close to you.
"The number of your voice is 59."
(Kogoro voice) Wait, Inspector Megure.
It's not him, the murderer...
What t'empatolles, you, now?
You have not seen that he has already confessed.
Yes, it's true inspector,
he has planned a crime, but failed.
Look at this cigarette filter.
The butts of the victim have one thing in common.
They are unfiltered cigarettes.
The victim, who has accepted the cigarettes from Naomichi,
but has torn off the filter.
The victim smoked without the part containing the poison.
So who is the murderer, Father?
In this case the murderer is...
...Katsuhiko's mother!
It's you!
What nonsense!
This is nonsense.
How do you want me to have murdered him, me?
By poisoning them with your food.
But we've all eaten the same thing.
It's true, but Katsuhiko is the only one who has died.
He has died because he has not menjat.
Why didn't he eat?
Mrs. Minagawa, it has booed in Susumo
when he ate some chocolate.
But afterwards, you have let him eat cake.
Why did she do that?
It's because there was poison in the coffee and an antidote to the cake.
And when he saw that Susumo drank the poisoned coffee,
you rushed to give him the cake, or should I say the antidote?
You knew that Katsuhiko wouldn't touch the cake
because he doesn't like sweet things.
That is why you conceived this plan.
You also took advantage of how you felt in Katsuhiko about kOhm.
He knew in Katsuhiko would end up eating the chocolate,
if he gave it to kOhm.
She was the first to leave,
she took the chocolate that Katsuhiko had,
and replaced it with one that contained poison.
in order to make kOhm dead.
This is false!
You have no proof!
I have proof!
In the coffee cup!
He has taken the coffee before the police arrived.
No matter how well he washed the cup,
the lab technicians will detect the poison.
And if it's not in the cup, they'll detect it down the drain.
Ma'am, it looks to me like you're starting to unravel...
the kOhm's chocolate,
the one that has changed and has hidden under the clothes.
I could not know if Katsuhiko would eat the chocolate!
Why should I kill my son?
He is right!

Katsuhiko's parents died in an accident 7 years ago,
and you, who was his aunt, adopted him.
Katsuhiko fell in love with the kOhm...
because she looks like his mother.
And you already knew that in Katsuhiko he would eat the chocolate,
if it was KOhm who gave it to you!
KOhm, I'm sorry!
I saw you buying chocolate in the center of town...
and I came up with this plan.
I had no choice!
My husband's business is bad,
and I needed the farm I had in Katsuhiko.
I wanted to protect the family!
This house... the happiness of Susumo.

DETECTIVE CONAN
What a busy day, isn't it, Conan?
What do I do with this chocolate?
Hello, Ran!
You're here!
I would have taken you home.
Well, don't suffer, Toshihide.
Aah!
The chocolate!
Will you give it to me? Well, it's not for you!
Thank you very much!
I'm so excited!
Aaaaaaaaah!
I'm starting to get fed up with you!
Oh, forgive me!
Ran...
You can eat it now.
If you eat it yourself, I'm sure Shinichi will forgive me.
Because you wanted to protect me, didn't you, my friend?
Thank you very much.
What a mystery.
They're sending 25 million in toys and cash.
That's a lot of money for a joke.
(Thinking) "And what must it mean, the letter?"
"What were they supposed to come looking for?"
Shinichi can figure it out.
Woman...
The threat of the monthly gift
