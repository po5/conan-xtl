Today's story is about Momotaro.
It clarifies the mystery of the legend.
A dog, a peasant and a monkey on stage.
He looks like a child but has the brain of an adult and is Detective Conan!

Momotaro!
Momotaro!
(Chanting) I want a cupcake of the kind you're carrying...
(See)... around your waist!
Give us-in one, please, please, please.
(Singing) Eh?
Momotaro?
Uoh!
"The legend of Momotaro went like this:
"In the middle of the 7th century, in order to defeat Ura,
"a demon who had come from a foreign country
"And who had carried out a myriad of atrocities,
"The court of the Yamato sent a warrior of great valor
"Who was named Kibitsuhiko-no-Mikoto."
"This story is based on the battle between the two of them.
"But it is not true."
"The fact is that in the year 663, as stated in the" Chronicles of Japan."
"The Yamato army lost the battle of Hakusukinoe...
"And they built all of fortifications one after the other
"To prepare against the attack of the enemy forces."
"This story seems to be related
"With one of the fortifications, Kinojo,
"also known as Ogre Castle,
"and to Kibitsu,
"the place in Okayama prefecture where the castle is located."
"At Kibiji, there are many ancient tombs."
"There buried there, are the cultures of those ancient times.
"As well as the memories of many people."
"The journey to solve the mystery of Momotaro. Part 1."
Surprise!
When you think of Okayama,
the first thing that comes to mind is the legend of Momotaro.
-Millet cakes!
-The one Momotaro reminds you of are....
Always thinking about food.
Hey, and a dog, right?
A peasant!
A monkey!
(At the same time) The defeat of the demon on the demon's island!
Yes, that's true, but this is a weekend outing
to study history...
We have studied expressly for the trip,
so you can refer to more concrete facts.
Well you said that, but I want to take Kurashiki's confit.
My goodness!
You too with the food?
Ah, excuse me!
(PA) "Okayama. Okayama."
We've arrived in Okayama!
Now we have to transfer to the Sanyo Main Line!
-Children, we don't need to mail so much.
-Hurry up!
Which way is it?
(Mitsuhiko) Wait for me, don't mail so much!
(Acoustic signal: ring)
(Mitsuhiko) The train has already arrived!
Kurashiki is famous for being a district that has a beautiful view,
with all white walls.
It's what we girls who like to travel love.
But before that I want to go somewhere else.
-Hello!
-Hello!
The Tivoli park.
Seiko, stop it!
Hey... Saruwatari, do you think you can talk to me like that?
You were able to become independent because I wrote that article
and you used it for publicity.
-Exaggerat.
-How much do you think I paid you?
I gave you a discount because you were a classmate.
You must be kidding!
Ayumi, are you all right?
-Excuse me!
-What have you done to Ayumi?!
-Are you all right?
-Excuse me, please!
I'm very sorry.
Did you hurt yourself?
(Agasa) Thank you very much for everything.
You're welcome.
We are ashamed of such childish behavior.
(Agasa) -Yes, me too.
-I feel so bad.
He-he!
"I don't think so."
Hey, you!
Have you already apologized?
Ciao!
Hey, girl, the ice cream we invited him to is good, right?
Yes, it's great!
I'm so glad!
This is no way to apologize.
You are all friends.
It's not right to fight.
Ha-ha... Friends?
Ha!
It's true that we were classmates since elementary school.
Now some of us live in Osaka and others in Tokyo.

This is the first time we have met in 15 years.
The last time we met we must have been your age.
Does this mean that this is an alumni reunion?
More or less.
My name is Agasa and I am the chaperone of these children.
Or, depending on how, their bodyguard on this trip.
I am the Ayumi.
The Ayumi Yoshida!
Me in Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya!
And I'm Genta Kojima!
Eh... Ah, and I'm Conan Edogawa.
From the Junior Detective League!
That's right, I'm in Naoto Momoi!
I'm Naoto Momoi.
I'm Yayoi Kijima.
Nice to meet you.
And on this side, in Kengo Saruwatari, Seiko Inui
and Mamoru Onitsura.
The Junior Detective League, eh?
We also did something similar in our group.
-I'll tell you!
-And we've gathered...
We have gathered together to support Momoi,
who will run for the elections
and also to congratulate him because he will soon marry Yayoi!
Wow!
He will run for the elections?
-Congratulations!
-And he's getting married soon?
Thank you.
(Mitsuhiko) Momotaro and the peasant are getting married.
Mitsuhiko, have you noticed it too?
You're the ones from the Momotaro legend, aren't you?
What are you talking about?
It's because of your names, isn't it?
The first ideograms of your surnames
are the characters of the Momotaro legend.
(Children) Momotaro, the peasant, the monkey, the dog and the demon.
You can tell they form a Detective League.
Yes, that's why, when we were little kids,
(Kengo) "We made the Momotaro legend play repesentant."
(Kengo) "What an old story."
What memories...
The staging and performance was quite good.
Shunyi's, of course.
"Shunyi?"
We shouldn't dwell on the past.
By the way, what can we do now?
A lot of things come to mind.
Tomorrow we can go treasure hunting, right?
-Treasure hunt?
-Yes.
-I'll explain it to you at dinner time.
-I don't know what you mean!
We have plenty of free time until then.
Well, I'll come by, too... Bye, see you now!
(Agasa) I think we should get going too.
(Agasa) Oh!
This is... this is Kurashiki.
(Ayumi) How beautiful!
The scenery of the Edo era
has remained unchanged all this time.
Oi, doctor?!
Yes, most of these warehouses were empty.
They were built by the old merchants.
They used to sail their boats up the Kurashiki River
carrying all kinds of goods.
The tiles and the stoneware on the eastern side
of this archaeological museum in Kurashiki
are the most beautiful work in the whole district.
All the objects exhibited here
have been extracted from the tombs and ruins of the
the districts of Kurashiki, Kibitsu and the Seto region.
There is much to learn.
Getting in touch with ancient cultures...
It can be very useful.
-It's great.
-But that's what's worth it!
Mmm... Pickles are the best.
Ordering is worth it, even if you run out of money.
"He'll be back again."
A peach?
A peach?
-Great!
-Momotaro's peach!!!
"This is impossible."
-We're almost there!
Genta.
- (Genta) Come.
(Genta) -Yes!
Guys, take me make me strong!
-Cheer up!
Be careful!
-And in here there's...
-I didn't think it was real...
What are these works?
Inside the envelope.
What's this?
-A code?
-It must be a code in code! -If that's what it is.
If that's what it is, it shouldn't be that complicated.
This is easy for elementary school students.
But it's something worth studying.
We will solve this code and excavate the tomb.
Maybe we can find the treasure of Devil's Island!
Are you serious?
Unravel the mysteries of Momotaro's legend!
"Come on, stop the cart."
Let's do it!
Then I'll go rest nearby.
Good job.
Shinichi, I leave everything in your hands!
Doctor, did you do this?
No.
I don't know where it came from.
But above all, studying should also be fun.
You have some great material to study.
Ha-ha!
I'll see you around.
"What a face."
The Junior Detective League initiates operation "Treasure Hunt"!
(At once) Yes, yes, let's go!
(Genta) Hey!
(Genta) What is it, this drawing?
An eye... with this eyelash?

Could it be fire?
Hey, Conan, say?
It's normal to see it as an eye and as fire.
And the fire and the eye lead us to...
Fire-eye, fire and eye.
(Genta) The fire and the eye!
The Hinom Yagura watchtower!
-No.
- (Genta) You found something?
Have you found something?
This is...
It is.
Conan, what, you've found it?!
-Obre'l!
-The treasure!
What is it?
It's all full of stuff!
This no longer has a battery.
At least, it doesn't look like a treasure, right?
Conan, what are you looking at?
"Six fun-filled years. Except for that one incident."
I don't know.
What do you mean, the incident?
This must be a time capsule.
-Are you sure?
-Really?
- (at once) A time capsule?
If this is someone's time capsule,
I don't think we've done right to take it out.
Yeah, maybe we've done the wrong thing.
He-he!
It's obvious that someone has dug it out before us.
(Ayumi) Maybe they are...
Our rivals..., looking for the treasure?
If so, we can't let them defeat us!
Conan, afanyem's to it and we decipher the next code!
He-he!
(Mitsuhiko) The drawing of a house
and the letters of the alphabet "p", "y", "b", "t", "y", "j".
What is that supposed to mean?
I don't understand anything at all.
So what is it?
These are very basic codes.
We just have to go back one letter to the same alphabet.
(Ayumi) What's before the "p",
(Ayumi) Exactly!
(Genta) It's an "o", right?
(Ayumi) The letter before the "y" is the "h".
- (Genta) Ohashi, chopsticks?
- (Mitsuhiko) Next.
Are they the ones used for eating?
No, it's probably the name of a place.
A place near Kurashiki.
What is it?
Vailets, what are you doing?
It's the girl from before!
We're trying to solve a code word.
(laughs)
What's she here for?
Not with the rest of the group?
Well, none of them can see me.
You've already been able to check.
Why not?
You were classmates, weren't you?
As a child, I was already incapable of lying.
And when I wrote an article
that was to advertise Mr. Onizuka-san's company,
in the end I gave it the title
"The dual aspects-the facade and the racks-the lenders."
When in Saruwatari he opened his own beauty salon,
I wrote sincerely about how I thought it was.
As for the Yayoi,
I fought against her to get into Momoi.
Lately we had...gone out together.
"Now I understand. There was something about them that didn't do the weight for me."
And en Shunyi didn't come?
Oh!
How clever you are, great detective!
Earlier you said that he had scripted and staged the script and staging
of Momotaro's play that they performed.
We would have told him to come, if he... were alive, of course.
(Mitsuhiko) He died?
In a traffic accident, 15 years ago...
We couldn't graduate together.
Poor thing.
He had a great sense of justice and was truly a good boy.
Ah!
Excuse me, excuse me, I've started to say sad things... Cheer up!
See you, Junior Detective League!
Ah!
It's here!
We've found it!
Ohashi.
Ohashi.
And what's more, it's a house!
(Genta) It's like we're in a samurai movie!
The Ohashi residence became a landowner's house
in the times of the great development.
This house is about 200 years old.
That's nothing, Mitsuhiko!
Well, it's no big deal either.
"I'm glad I took it home with me to study."
All right, let's start looking!
(Genta) I found it!
"Not again. It's been dug up before!"
-An old comic book.
-A new one?
An old notebook...
"That again?"
(Mitsuhiko) Someone's one step ahead of us!
(Mitsuhiko) Very good!
Next!
Next!
The square face of a clown.
What was that called?
Cell phone symbols.
I got it.
The pictograms, right?
That's a "t," that's a "u," that's a "t"
y... this is an "a",
but I'd like to know why it's upside down.
"T", "one", "t", "a".
Does this mean "ivy"?

You mean ivy, the plant?
Ivy is called "ivy" in English.
And the other word is "square".
Hey, guys, I got it, it's there!
It's over there!
The Kurashiki Ivy Square!
It's here.
-You see it?
-It's ivy!
How big it is.
Guys, this used to be a yarn factory.
It looks like they kept the buildings as they were
and turned them into hotels and museums.
Very nice!
All right, let's get started!
Let's get started!
(At the same time) Yes!
There's nothing here that looks like a treasure.
(Genta) What on earth is going on?
Ha-ha!
I've got it.
The "a" is not the one on the reverse, but the square.
That means it's behind this Ivy Square.
(Mitsuhiko) Sure!
Last one!
Hey, I've found it!
I've found it!
You found the treasure?
"Again?"
-I'm already getting depressed, it can't be.
-Gee, this again?
This is a bore
Ahh!
(Mitsuhiko) It's... it's that girl.
"I don't like it. She's not breathing anymore."
(Genta) Let's call an ambulance!
"A message."
"O," "n," "y."
Oni.
(Genta) An ogre?
-Oh no!
-Like Momotaro?
(Man) Ah, then you're the ones who found her...
The Junior Detective League!!!
"They're coming back."
-We'll be Momotaro.
-And if the murderer is an ogre...
We won't punish him, we'll stop him!
"What group!"
Excuse me, sir, are those the victim's belongings?
What?
There's something strange.
What is it?
Yes, it's these.
This seal.
Why is this seal upside down, huh?
I don't know. I don't know.
What does it mean?
Ah... well, nothing.
Sorry to have bothered you.
"So the four of you were questioned by the police
"As friends of the victim."
(Police) This means that none of the four of us had an alibi.
(Kengo) To be more specific, I was alone.
There were a lot of people in Tivoli Park,
so maybe you'll find someone who remembers seeing me there...
(Kengo) Anyway.
I was in the lobby of the hotel where I am staying.
There were also a lot of people.
Well, unfortunately, it is very difficult to verify your situation.
I guess with us there is no problem.
We were together at that time.
And you have been around the Bonavista district?
Yes, we have been together all the time.
We have only been alone when we went to the toilet.
We weren't apart for more than five minutes...
I don't want to be rude,
but I can't believe the testimony of a fiancé with closed eyes.
Our investigation has shown that they were also with the victim.
This is...
And it seems that the other two
had also had problems with the victim.
(Door: sting)
Investigator Tsuyama, they're here.
Yes.
Is it the peach-shaped container?
Maybe it has nothing to do with it,
but I contacted you because I wanted to tell you.
We had no intention of informing you,
but we felt we had to cooperate with the investigation.
That's not...
Were the time capsules coded?
Oh, what a surprise!
"Indeed... the key codes specified the locations
"where they had buried their time capsules 15 years ago."
"Fifteen years ago, they all placed objects precious to them,
"They were exchanged, and each buried a capsule."
"They did it this way to prevent the owners of the capsules
"from knowing where they were buried."
"So they would be able to leave their feelings behind."
Last night someone broke into the school where they studied.
This is evident, by now.
And we have discovered that this container with this shape
is one of the objects that have suffered the most from the raid.
Later these children told us that they had found it.
It must be fate that we ran into them.
What were they supposed to be doing stealing this?
That's why he got rid of it, because he saw that it wouldn't give him any money.
So, it seems to have gone like this, officer?
Seiko, being the journalist that she is, found out who it was,
has entered the school and has murdered her.
(Police) No!
This is unthinkable.
"No."

We are looking at it from a different angle.
Mr. Onitsura!
No!
I didn't do it.
I am innocent!
(Police) Don't misunderstand me.
You're still a witness for the prosecution.
Then why am I the only one being held?
How can you explain this message to me!
You had a grudge against the victim
since you wrote an article you didn't like!
Hey, do you really think Mamoru has done it?
Shut up, Saruwatari!
-You say so, too, Momoi?
-It could be.
Nowadays it's not surprising that someone would kill someone else.
Nowadays there are no more treasures to search for.
(Ayumi) So, the murderer was indeed the ogre.
Yes, I wish we had caught it.
(Genta) Ouch!
What a fool you are.
You're using the cutlery upside down!
You have to hold the knife with the right hand and the fork with the left.
I am left-handed.
What's the difference?
I want to hold the fork with my right hand.
Ha-ha!
Do you want us to order some chopsticks to eat?
Why didn't you ask them from the beginning?
"Sure, I got it."
"This way the content of the message would change."
"Now I'm sure."
"The murderer is one of the four!"
"But to specify who it is,
"We'll have to solve the other two remaining codes.
"And try to find the buried time capsules."
(Seiko) You're the only one who knew I was going to dig up the capsules.
Why did you do something like that?
He told me that he wanted to check something
and that he wanted to go to some bookstores.
I thought this might happen.
Ha!
I, at Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya, made a note!!!
Very good, Mitsuhiko!
"Mitsuhiko, good job."
And the next Conan:
"The journey to solve the mystery of Momotaro. 2nd part."
(Song in Japanese)
