Coi!
They have already advanced me again.
This is what he gets for renting a tartan instead of a car.
I think the same.
We should have taken the train, right?
-Yes. Oh, of course we did.
Quiet!
The client asked me to take you, too.
And that's why I had to rent a car that would fit all of you.
-Five seconds to go. -What?
If you don't turn the wheel now, we'll hit the wall in 5 seconds.
What?
(People: exclamations of joy)
(Shouting)
(Ayumi) Oooh!
How cool!
(Mitsuhiko) It's just like a castle!
What do you mean, a king lives here?
What do you mean, a king lives here?
Don't be an ass!
No king lives here.
It's just a hotel.
In fact, it's right in front of Miraclelàndia.
It's possible that there's some millionaire who lives like a king
and is squandering his fortune at the amusement park.
By the way, I hear...
that this hotel is about to welcome its 100,000th customer.
Wow!
Looks like they're doing pretty well, business.
It looks like it is.
I'm sorry about that.
That's Detective Mouri, you?
-Yes. We're waiting for you.
Excuse me, I'll introduce myself,
I'm your client's secretary, my name is Takada.
Come with me, please.
Park the car.
Understood.
(Festive music and shouting, from afar)
Go ahead, you can come in now.
-Oysters! -Come on!
-How cool! -How cool!
I bet you can see the whole amusement park from here!
Yes?
Let's see?
Sorry, guys, but I should wait for you sitting down.
What?
Ow, sit down and don't make a fuss.
-Okay... -Okay...
Wait a moment, please.
Oh!
How cool!
- (Mitsuhiko) It's so nice. (children: laugh)
(children: laugh) Oh.
What's wrong with you, Conan?
Well, these chairs look out of place in this room.
What do you mean?
Ah...
Now that you say it, it's true.
-Maybe they were short of calés. -Come on, don't talk nonsense!
Can't you see it's a luxury hotel? Oh.
- (door, open) - (Takada) Sorry to keep you waiting.
We asked you to bring the children so we wanted to give them this.
What is it, this artifact, sir?
An identifier that will allow you to enter Miraclelandia free of charge.
What is it?
Oh!
We want them to spend the day at the amusement park,
our intention is for the children to have a great time
while Mr. Mouri works.
Well, don't tell me my client owns this hotel.
No, he doesn't own it.
But he has a lease on this suite that he renews every year.
(Kogoro) Caram... Not bad.
Put the bracelets on your wrist, and make sure they don't fall off.
If you lose them, we won't be able to give you a new one.
You too, Mr. Mouri.
No, that's not necessary.
I won't have time to go to the park.
Don't worry, don't suffer for it.
If we're lucky enough to finish the job first,
you can go and have fun with the rest.
Okay, well... Oh...
The accreditations are valid
for a whole day at Miraclelàndia until 10 p.m.,
which is the closing time.
Food and drinks are included,
so you can enjoy everything without worrying about anything.
Viva! Thank you, very kind.
Come on, Conan.
Yes.
You should stay with us, young man.
How? I'm sorry, miss.
But why?
Maybe because you've won a prize for being the 100,000th customer!
Yes?
Well, we could say that you're on the right track.
-Really? -Lucky you!
Well, guys, we should get going.
I think to get on the SuperSerp you have to stand in line for two hours.
Yeah, right.
See you later, Conan.
Have a good one.
Yes.
Hey, what do you think you'll get, for being the 100,000th customer?
(Mitsuhiko) I'm sure it won't be 100,000 eels.
(Children: laughing)
Wow, lucky you, nano!
I bet they're offering you a special deal for being the 100,000th customer!
- (CLEC) -Huh?
-I don't want anyone to interrupt us?
The 100,000th customer isn't me, is it?
When we arrived there was already confetti in front of the entrance.
Ah... Is this true?
Yes.
It's true, Mr. Mouri.
The 100,000th customer arrived at the hotel about an hour ago.

-Then why did you make him stay? -Because my head asked me to.
(Pip)
What? Hey!
(Pip) What's going on here?
What's the meaning of this?
"Thank you for coming, Mr. Mouri."
"I'm your client."
"Forgive me for hiding my face, but I have reason to do so."
"I asked you to come... because I want you to solve a case."
A case?
What case is it?
"You'll have to find out for yourselves, that's what. It's your job."
"How?"
From a series of clues I'll give you.
You'll have to decipher them and then you'll have to solve the case.
But why... why did you call me?
"You're not the first, you're the fifth detective I've hired."
And how have they been doing, the other 4?
"There's one still investigating."
"I dispatched two, and the last one couldn't solve the case."
"He's still here."
Oh!
At Ryu! Who knows him?
He's a detective I worked with a long time ago.
"I already gave him the investigation report!"
"How long do you plan to keep me locked up here? Let me go!"
Detective Ryu, you haven't been able to solve the case.
"What do you mean?"
Incompetent detectives have no right to live.
(Pip, pip, pip, pip)
"What... What is this?"
It's a bracelet like ours.
Yes.
"Gee, what's wrong with this thing?"
Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit.
I assure you it will be quick.
"Are you responsible for the disappearance of Mogi and Soda?"
Goodbye, detective Ryu.
"Hey, hey, stop... W-wait a minute! Oysters!"
(Pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip)
"Composition 4."
"That's the name of the plastic explosive that just exploded."
Detective Ryu was carrying a charge
Miraclelandia access bracelet.
"And what was it, the detectives Mogi and Soda you mentioned?"
Yes... They both had a reputation as good detectives and were well known.
"But they were just two idiots
who wasted valuable time."
"They'll have time until 10 o'clock tonight."
"You'll have to solve the case before the deadline."
"If they haven't found the solution by the deadline," he said,
"your bracelets will also explode
and follow the same path as Detective Ryu."
What?
"Leave it."
"It won't come off so easily, Mr. Mouri."
"And if you managed to take it off without my permission,
the identifier would explode immediately."
Miserable!
Oh... Ran!
It's true!
And the Ran and the children?
They're wearing bracelets too!
The bracelets the children have put on
are almost the same as the ones you are wearing.
It can't be! (Thinking) "Almost?"
"The difference is that theirs
have an additional function incorporated."
"This is a blueprint of Miraclelandia."
"We have placed several sensors around the perimeter."
"When you first enter the compound,
the sensors will detect you and the countdown will be activated."
"And when they finish their visit
and want to cross the park boundaries to leave, the bomb will explode."
It was too complicated to have to keep an eye on them as well,
and that's why I came up with this system.
(Shinichi voice) Ran!
Haibara!
How do you feel me, Haibara?
Wow!
Haibara!
Haibara!
(Haibara) "What do you want?" Haibara, don't enter the park!
(Haibara) What's wrong?
"Listen to me and pause! Don't enter the park!"
I'd like to...
But we're already inside.
(Pip)
You're VIP customers, right? What?
This bracelet you're wearing is only given to very special customers.
(Pip) Really?
I hope you have a great time.
We'll try, thank you.
"What happened?" I'll tell you later.
And the Ran?
Damn!
"If he solves the case before 10 o'clock tonight
"and find the real culprit,
I'll pay you whatever you ask for."
"But... if you don't find the key to the mystery in time,
I'll blow up the bracelets."
Take me to see this guy, I want to tell him four things!
It's impossible, no matter how much I want to, I don't know where he is either.
How can I not ?
"Mr. Mouri. All your movements are monitored."

"The bracelets have a built-in GPS."
"It won't do you any good to go tell the police."
Why?
It will set off the bomb, if I go?
You bastard!
"The longer we keep talking, the less time he'll have left."
"The first clue is...
"--and listen to me well, because I'm only going to say it once--:
T-A-K-A, three minus eight."
What does that mean?
Let's see, say it again.
"I have warned you that I would not repeat it."
"It's 12 hours to the end of time."
(Wall clock: strike the hour.)
"And now, solve the case."
"Do it for my sake... and also... for the sake of the children."
What the...!
Mr. Mouri.
Take this away.
You have a direct line to your client.
But I must say that you will not be able to get in touch with him,
it's only so he can give you instructions.
If you manage to solve the case,
call my number, which is in the phone book, and come back here.
We will listen to your reasoning very carefully.

DETECTIVE CONAN: THE DETECTIVE'S REQUIEM
My name is Shinichi Kudo and I am a teenage detective.
One day, I went to the amusement park with Ran Mouri,
my best friend and classmate,
and I witnessed a suspicious exchange
between two men dressed in black.
I was so focused on watching those two men,
that I didn't notice another one behind me.
He made me swallow a poison and, when I woke up, I was so focused that I didn't realize there was another one behind me,
(Conan voice)... my body had shrunk!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
they would want to kill me... and the lives of those around me would be in danger.
That's why Dr. Agasa advised me
to hide my identity.
When the Ran asked me what my name was,
I randomly told her my name was Conan Edogawa.
Since her father is a detective, I went to live with them...
to try to get information about the men in black.
The only people who know who I really am are Dr. Agasa;
my parents;
Heiji Hattori, the teenage detective from the west,
and Ai Haibara, my classmate.
Dr. Agasa has created many inventions
adapted to my new stature.
The Haibara had been a member of the Men in Black.
To escape from the organization,
she shrank by swallowing the same poison...
that they had made me take.
And he also knows who I am in Kaito Kid.
And when the Kaito Kid comes into the picture, something big always happens.
Soc small, but I have the brain of an adult.
A detective who solves all mysteries!
There is only... one truth!
Wow!
Only a traffic jam was missing, now!
Listen, my daughter's life is in danger!
Move!
That's why I'm telling you not to let them leave Miraclelandia!
If one of you leaves the premises, your bracelet will explode!
"And don't climb the SuperSerp."
"Part of the roller coaster ride
leaves the perimeter of the park and passes over the sea."
"Hey, Haibara! Do you feel me?" Yes, I do feel you.
If you don't solve the case before 10 p.m.,
both you and I will be blown up, that's it, isn't it?
Look how funny! "Fun? But what are you saying, now!"
(Genta) Haibara!
What are you doing standing here?
Come on, hurry up!
Anyway, our lives are in your hands,
"...Mr. Detective."
I don't understand anything.
What does that mean, T-A-K-A, three minus eight?
Also... it could read "three-slash-eight."
Mm?
Put like that, it sounds like an address in some neighborhood.
Yes.
And three minus eight equals minus five.
If we draw even, we're left with "three-hyphen and eight-hyphen and five."
I've got it!
Takashima!
The 3rd ward of Takashima district!
Uh, where do I know, district 3?
It doesn't exist.
What?
There is no district 3, in Takashima district.
What are you saying, now!
Let me go!
Reco!
We'll have to start over from the beginning...
Maybe there won't be.
Didn't you not long ago redevelop this area
and changed the name of this neighborhood?
Number 5 in block 8 of Takashima Ward 3?
Isn't it true that they changed the name of this neighborhood, after the redevelopment?
Yes, that's right.
Now it is called Minato Mirai.
There used to be a Ward 3.
Can I have the map? Yes.

You mean it has something to do, this place?
with the case we have to investigate?
We have to think so, what can we do!
And, come to think of it,
how come that guy makes me go everywhere with a guy like you?
I guess he didn't trust you very much.
Ah!
Oh, oh!
Ah!
(Thinking) "Indeed, it is strange."
"He has commissioned me to investigate with Mr. Mouri."
"Why precisely me?"
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What-what-what is it now?
Who... who are you?
You can't be here.
They're tearing down the building next week.
What? I wouldn't want to be in your place, with such a little boy.
I wouldn't want to be in your place, with such a little boy...
What do you mean?
No, it's not that... (thinks) "Of course not."
And you, who have lived here for a long time?
Yes.
Two years ago, since the hotel went bankrupt.
And you haven't seen anything strange lately?
Even if it doesn't seem important.
Let's see, let me think...
Shut up, now I'll fall!
The other day I saw a very big white bird pass by.
A very big bird, you say?
It flew past the sun.
What day was it?
Well, for my birthday, April 4.
That day I also saw a suspicious car parked in the driveway.
Then a real estate agent came to close the basement.
A suspicious car?
I say that because nobody usually parks here.
"When I went out in the morning,
"There was a new car parked in the front yard.
"In the evening, when I came back,
they had replaced it with an old, beat-up car."
But someone had dismantled it during the night
and left only the bodywork.
What do you mean they came to close the basement?
The basement is where the machines are.
I guess they wanted to sell them to make money.
What time did he come, the agent? Towards the night.
(rumbling)
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
What-what was that?
(Squeaking)
Hey, man!
What was that?
Oh, man!
How did you get in here?
You gave me a scare!
AAAA!
What's this?
What's the matter? Look what I found.
What is it?
Oh, my gosh!
A ski mask, some gloves... and a Colt Government!
It's a toll receipt.
April 4th, Yokohama City.
April 4th is not the day
that suspicious car was parked in the driveway?
Yes, which was later exchanged for another car that...
It was swapped?
I get it!
Someone made a car swap to get away.
Someone who had committed a crime
with these gloves, the ski mask and the gun.
Now we'll have to find out what happened on April 4.
The rest will be a piece of cake.
Oh!
Who are they, these guys?
They are armed!
They're obviously not locals.
Could it be that they have come to retrieve this bag?
(Thinking) "Probably."
(Inaudible)
I know what we'll do! What?
Look, you go out first and distract them in any way you can...
And I, meanwhile I go to the car,
I come to pick you up and we play the two here.
Don't suffer, man!
They won't dare to shoot a kid who doesn't lift an inch off the ground!
What's the matter, don't you trust me? Not at all.
He gives me!
Au, go!
Hold it!
Stop!
(Wheels: squeaking)
Get in!
Aaaaaaaa!
"It was coming."
And it had to be just now?
Coi de tartana!
-He's in custody! -Arrested?
Who are you, you?
Cops?
It's the bird I saw that day!
What? It's him.
It's him.
He flies through the darkness with his white wings.
It's the Kaito Kid! The Kid?
Inspector, we've seen the Kid!
It's on the roof of the Miyama building, on the head of a gargoyle.
Understood.
President Miyama, the Kid has appeared.
Very well, understood.
Let's go then.
In any case,
even the Kid won't be able to bypass the new security system.
Mi-te!
Oh, man!
Attention.
Soc in Yokomizo.
The Kid is heading for the Landmark Tower.
I repeat: The Kid is heading towards Landmark Tower!
Go there!
I see that the police surveillance device has been useless.
Good luck with the new security system!
(Mobile)
Inspector.
We have arrested a man who could be an accomplice.
-We're taking him to the police station. "Understood! I'll be right back."

I have already told you that I am not Kid's accomplice!
Soc Kogoro Mouri, that's my name!
(Thinking) "This doesn't look good at all. If we go on like this..."
"All his movements are monitored."
"The bracelets have a built-in GPS."
"It won't do him any good to go to the police."
(Female voice) "Bracelet number 1 and bracelet number 2
are approaching the Kanagawa Prefectural Central Police Station."
(Shouting)
When I feel these shrieks, though I get more urge to go up.
Yes, but I'm getting tired of waiting in line.
How much more time will we have left?
Let's see...
If 3 people fit in one meter and there are 150 meters,
that's 450 people.
Each trip on the SuperSerp holds 22 people.
450 divided by 22 gives 20 trips.
If each trip lasts about 10 minutes counting getting on and off,
that's 200 minutes.
That's about 3.5 hours.
You're a crack, Mitsuhiko!
So long, do we have to wait?
I'm hungry...
If Dr. Agasa were here, I'm sure he'd give us some riddles.
That's true.
How about if I tell you a riddle today?
-What? -You know riddles?
You don't want to? Yes!
Tell me, tell me.
Okay, come on hi.
Vinga, go, say!
We'll solve it.
Tarama!
The riddles of Miraclelàndia!
You all want to get on the SuperSerp, right?
All right, well, I want you to tell me:
which of the four of you most likes the name of this attraction?
Mmm...
I know!
It's in the Ouch, right? Mm?
Why do you say that?
Because you seem to like snakes.
I can't stand snakes.
Well, you can't!
Then it must be me, because I'm always being kept waiting for everything.
-Like now at SuperSerp. -Why do you say that?
Well, because when I pick you up in the morning to go to school,
you always make me wait in front of your house.
Wrong answer.
What are you saying, Genta?
Maybe it's me... Snakes look like eels.
And my favorite dish is eels.
Not much!
And what happened to him, Genta, from eating so many eels?
-What happened to him?
What do you mean? -I don't know, but he looks hungry.
SuperSerp in Japanese is called "Cho Hebi",
which in English means "very heavy".
So, the answer is in Genta, which is heavier.
Correct!
I thought it would be different with the Ran, but....
-You see... -Yes...
Hey, Conan!
Hello, Conan!
How are we doing? Inspector Megure!
What's the trouble you're in, in Mouri?
I see they've arrested the Kid's accomplice.
Hello, Nakamori.
Crafty old Megure.
What are you doing here?
I'm told you've been arrested in Mouri by mistake.
Is that right?
Mm.
So you mean Kid's accomplice... is the Sleeping Kogoro?
AAAI...
"We detectives have a duty
to protect the secrets of our clients."
"If your client is the Kid, then you are his accomplice."
What were the Kanagawa police doing, guarding that building?
We were guarding the building because the Kid tipped us off.
It happens to be the headquarters of the Miyama Company.
And on the top floor of the building are on display the jewels
that the president of the company, Mr. Miyama,
collects as a "hobby.
But this time he didn't take anything, unlike last time.
Had he already broken in?
Yes.
On April 4, he stole a huge diamond.
That's why the president decided to
to reinforce all security measures
and he does not stop bragging about his new surveillance system.
"On April 4?"
But Inspector Yokomizo belongs to the First Division.
Wasn't it the Second Division that was in charge?
Yes, but recently in Kid he had to run away from someone who wanted to kill him.
A few policemen were injured during the chase,
so now we're working with them.
Ah... so someone wants to kill him.
(Mobile)
He-he-he-he!
Oh, they're calling me on my cell phone.
Will you excuse me?
(Mobile)
(Customer) "Detective Mouri... Or are you in Kudo?"
"I knew it was you, teenage detective Shinichi Kudo."
"I was surprised that you came with Detective Mouri."
In fact, I also wanted to entrust you to investigate the case.
I looked for you, but I couldn't locate you.

You have not been able to solve the case and have notified the police?
(Shinichi voice) No, it's not what you think.
The police have arrested Detective Mouri by mistake at the abandoned hotel.
"You sure are sincere."
(Think) "This guy... I knew it! I knew the police were."
Never mind.
And what did he find, in the abandoned hotel?
A ski mask and a gun
that could have been used to commit a crime.
Congratulations, Kudo.
I'll give you the second clue.
Look for the "Coffee Terrace at Night."
"The 'Coffee Terrace at Night'?"
"Surely you know where it is, being you."
I will solve this case, have no doubt.
"Please take the bracelets off Ran and the children there."
"Hey, don't sit down?"
Oysters. "It's very hard."
It's very hard to lose a loved one.
You'll have to try your best to keep it from happening to you, Kudo.
(Communication is cut off)
(Thinking) "How does he know? How does he know my real identity?"
"And where did he come from?"
"Who is he, this mystery customer?"
Ah... The queue doesn't move forward and I'm so hungry that I'm dying....
It's true.
In fact, we haven't even eaten yet.
How about if I stand in line while you guys go get something to eat?
while you guys go get something to eat?
-Sure you don't mind? -I'm sorry, leaving you alone...
Me too.
Don't worry, I'll stay and keep you company.
-I'm staying too! -I'm staying too! -So am I. -So am I.
Don't be a jackass!
It's not funny like that.
Let's see what you think:
we'll queue in turns, half an hour each, and the first one will be Ay.
Agreed? I got it!
-See you here for half an hour. -Yes!
See you now!
Let's go!
Thank you, sweetheart.
You can come in now.
Ah... I don't know how long I can hold out.
I could try to get it out of you somehow,
but I can't guarantee it won't explode.
Here, I can't do anything.
Entesos.
Ah, look.
I've increased the power.
Thank you. Thank you.
Ah, by the way, have you figured out where is the "Terrace coffee at night"?
Yes. And where is it, may I ask?
"Terrace of coffee at night" is a painting.
A painting that Vincent van Gogh painted in 1888.
It's a night scene where the terrace of a cafe is lit by the warm light of the sun.
illuminated by the warm light of a gas lantern.
The reference is evident.
Ah...
This brings us to the first street in Japan illuminated by a street lamp,
the Bashamichi.
Aaaaah!
Aaaaaaaah!
It's a little overdone, with the power!
- (clattering) - (shouting)
Haibara!
It has.
-Thank you. We are here!
I see you haven't made much progress.
I must have miscalculated.
Now it's our turn.
Understood. (Sonoko) You're a case, Ran!
All day long with these creatures!
Sonoko!
What are you doing here?
Actually, I've come to the Red Castle Hotel.
Today they plan to receive the 100,000th customer,
and they've prepared a party for tonight.
It was my father who financed the construction of the hotel.
And now, I've come to the park to make time until it's time for the party.
Ah... Eh?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where did you find this?
I didn't find it, it was given to us by one of my father's clients.
Come on!
It's from a VIP client, I see.
It's just that I lost my bracelet,
and I thought you had found it.
I have an idea!
You're all invited to the party tonight.
In the meantime, how about you and I go to the hotel?
The kids wear the bracelets, they'll be fine if they go alone.
Especially if they go with her.
She seems very responsible.
It's just that...
(Flow) Now the hotel restaurant has a free cake buffet.
With the bracelet you can go in and out of the park as much as you want.
(Think) "What does it represent that I have to look for, in this street?"
Don't move.
(Shinichi voice) Hattori! What?
Did I scare you?
Ow, shut up.
You've reached the ideal moment.
Will you give me a hand?
I can't believe it!
You too?
What?
That you've also been...?
Yes.
They've taken the Kazuha hostage.
Although she has no idea, of course,
and she's probably having a blast at the amusement park.
(Female voice) "This phone is switched off or out of range."
(Female voice) "Please call back later....

Or leave a message on voicemail."
Ah.
It's... unbelievable!
"I'll be right over. Wait for me here and have a good time," she said to me in Hattori.
Now I feel like the Ran, who is always waiting in Kudo!
Kazuha!
Is that you? Oh!
If it isn't the Ran!
Kazuha, it's been a long time!
I didn't expect to find you here!
And in Hattori?
Working.
As usual.
Of course, of course.
What a drag, isn't it?
-Goodness! -Hey, Kazuha!
Hello, Kazuha! -You too, Sonoko?
Yes, I am!
La Ran and I were at the free cake buffet.
Do you want to come along?
Yes!
I love cakes!
-Well, come on, let's go! -Yes, let's go.
You're not coming, Ran? Yes, I am.
(Heiji) I get it.
So, she's been taken hostage too.
Yes.
And not only does she have Ran, but she also has the children.
Also, for some reason I don't know,
the client is convinced that I'm Shinichi Kudo.
You mean he's discovered your identity?
It seems so, but I'm not sure.
Hey!
I hope for your sake that the men in black haven't figured out
that you became a child... when they gave you the poison.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What's the matter with you?
A ski mask, a gun and a getaway car.
Right! (Laughs)
An armored car heist.
Yes.
Is this what you want us to investigate? Looks like it.
(Conan voice) Excuse me, senyora.
Say, boy.
Do you know if that armored car has ever been robbed?
Yes, it was held up.
It was... April 4th, if I'm not mistaken.
That day you also had the stop here?
The police must have asked you a lot of questions.
Would you mind telling us what happened?
No... Well, it would be the same time as now, more or less...
Don't move!
Everybody freeze!
Everything happened so fast...
I didn't know if it had really happened or if it was a dream.
The thieves knew very well what they were doing.
Thank you very much, senyora.
Oh.
Just a moment!
My friends, I warn you...
that today will be the worst day of your lives.
Go home and get into bed.
Yes, we will.
When we've made it the best day of our lives.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Let's see, how many times do I have to tell you to stay with me?
I can't breathe! Come on, let's go.
This is not the time to argue.
Eh?
Oh, my...
What are you doing here, the noodle from Osaka?
I came for the same reason you did. Huh?
Hey, Mouri.
Give me back the phone the customer gave us.
It's about time you told us the truth, isn't it?
The truth?
I wouldn't even know where to start...
This case requires more means than are available to a detective.
Leave it to us, Mr. Kogoro.
(Mobile)
Soc at Mouri.
(Customer) "This time it's you, Detective Mouri?"
-How? - "Never mind."
- "It's on Bashamichi Street, isn't it?" - Exactly.
"You shouldn't be talking to the police."
Miserable!
Who's watching me?
Over there!
Do you plan to break the agreement we had, Mr. Mouri?
(Kogoro) "No way! It wasn't my doing."
Mouri, who the hell are you talking to?
You idiots!
You idiots!
We make out incompetent cops!
What's this?
-Is this a joke?
What the fuck is wrong with that dummy?
Idiots!
Idiots!
We do out incompetent cops!
Hey, hey!
This is a trap.
Watch out! Watch out!
Everybody get away from the dummy!
It's about to explode!
Ten seconds to explosion.
Nine, eight, seven, six, six, five, four...
-Oh, no! -... three, two, one...
Mom! Yokomizo!
Send an ambulance, it's an emergency!
You bastard!
"Next time it will be the children, who will be blown up..."
Mm?
What's wrong with it?
It's the bracelet, it's been flickering for a while.
Me too.
Do you know why it's doing that? No, I don't.
This is the first time I've seen it.
Maybe the guard at the entrance can explain it to us.
Wow, you.
Now that's a shame!
The police can't even defuse a bomb like this.
What a nerve!
But it was your fault, this just happened!
Let me go, inspector.

You have no proof of what you say.
You are more of a nuisance to me than the police.
Please don't follow me everywhere, being ?!
As you say ?!
I was right to leave the police.
I'm too young to die.
-Let's go, guys. Yes.
Inspector.
Is everything all right? (Kogoro) Everything's fine.
(Kogoro) "La Ran and the children
are being held hostage at Miraclelandia."
"The bracelets they are wearing will explode if they leave the compound."
"I ask you to protect them with the utmost discretion. Thank you. Mouri."
I have asked the inspector to look after Ran and the children.
From now on, the success or failure of the mission...
will depend only on our brains.
What?
Have you been able to find out anything else?
Yes.
On April 4, an armored car was held up on Bashamichi Street.
The police have told us that, on the same day,
the Kaito Kid stole a diamond
from the Miyama Building's jewelry collection.
Understood.
Well..., from now on I'll take care of the investigation.
Don't get into any trouble.
What do you think, Conan?
(Shinichi voice) That we won't find any more clues on Bashamichi Street.
What to do, with so little to go on?
Well, we have another clue we haven't solved yet.
What clue?
The clues you have given me are these:
"Terrace cafe at night" and "You cry".
Which means "you cry".
So he gave you a different clue than us.
Yes, it seems so. "You cry."
Which is spelled Y-O-U-C-R-R-Y.
Hey, isn't Y-O-U...? Yes.
It's an acronym for a university just outside the city,
Yokohama Ocean University.
And what does C-R-Y stand for? I haven't been able to figure that out either.
We'll have to go take a look at this university.
This looks like it.
Ran, hurry up!
Excuse me.
How can I help you?
Do you know why there's a little red light flashing on the bracelet?
I don't know, it's very strange.
It's the first time I see it.
(Loudspeaker: woman) "... Ran Mouri, from Beika,
"And Miss Kazuha Toyama
to go to the infirmary immediately."
Why are they warning us? I don't know.
I hope the children are all right.
Hurry, let's go.
Sorry, Sonoko.
We can't come with you.
That's all right.
Hurry up, you must be very worried about the children.
I'm sorry, Sonoko.
Ah.
I'll stuff myself with cakes.
What's the matter?
He fainted in the park.
It looks like heat stroke, but it's not serious.
Understood.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
And now, don't suffer.
But how come you also called Kazuha?
It's the first time I'm talking to this girl.
-Ah... Because... - The reason is obvious, isn't it?
She feels better with two adults than with just one.
Of course she does!
It's better if she rests for a while.
You'll stay with her, won't you?
Yes, Esclar.
Don't leave me alone.
I thought she was a repellent child,
but the truth is that she's very pretty.
(Thinking) "I'll end up exhausted, with so much comedy."
"Cry... Cry... Cry..."
It could be the abbreviated name of a subject.
Or a club.
Maybe yes.
Other than that, what else could it be?
The Yokohama Criminal Investigation Club.
Those are its initials in English.
This club is the closest to what you're looking for.
Who are you?
My name is Saguru Hakuba, and I'm in the same situation as you.
-In more ways than one. In the same situation?
You're the son of the police superintendent and a teenage detective, right?
Yes.
You, as a child detective, are second to none.
My father is also a superintendent,
and that's why we're in the same situation.
Yes, but also because of that.
Don't tell me you're also...
One of the people I hold most dear is being held in Miraclelàndia.
But I'll almost tell you that as we walk.
If we waste any more time, the ones who will end up crying will be us.
He is right.
(Door: call)
Hello, anybody there?
Hello!
(Heiji) We're coming in.
(Heiji) There's enough stuff to stop a train, here!
Guys, look at these pictures.
These must be the club members.
I think we should take a picture of this mural.
(Heiji) You're right.
(Mobile) The customer?
Yes.
What does he want?
"You're smarter than I thought, Heiji Hattori."

"You've come a long way, with a track that just said 'You cry'."
"I'm surprised you've made it this far."
Hey, if you really want us to solve this case,
"Why don't you give us some simpler clues?"
It wouldn't be any fun for me to make it easy.
Besides, I'm testing your detective skills.
That way I'll know if you have the talent to solve the case.
What do you mean by that?
"From now on there will be no more clues."
"I trust you, young detectives."
- (cut off) -H... hey, wait a minute!
Wow, he hung up.
There won't be any more clues?
Well, what do we do now, guys?
(Someone types in a phone)
Who are you, you?
Can we help you?
It's just that we, uh...
We were planning to enroll here next year.
-We are visiting. Ah!
You're welcome in our club, if you want to join.
Well, thank you.
May I ask you something?
Who are the people in the pictures up there?
What do you mean?
Ah!
The club presidents in chronological order, from left to right.
And do you know why the photo of the third president is missing?
What?
There, look.
Next to the last photo there are some empty nails, see?
And from the third one on, there are some small marks on the wall,
as if faded by the sun.
This means that, for some reason,
they took down the photograph of the third president
and then they moved the next ones.
Right?
Look, the third president, the Ito, was kicked out of the club.
Ah!
If I'm not mistaken, his name was Jiro Ito, right?
No, his name was Suehiko Ito.
Do you know him?
I'd say so.
It's... this one here, isn't it?
-It's not this one.
It's this one. Oh, yeah, right, right.
(Thinking) "Ah... What a role he plays."
Excuse me, this must not be the same Ito that I know.
(Man) Suehiko Ito?
(All) Eh?
Listen Heiji, who is this Ito you're asking me about?
"I have no idea."
"That's why I'm calling you, Agent Otaki, because I investigated him."
-Is your father aware of this? -No, it's a secret.
- "U... a secret? But..." - Call me when you have something.
Hey, hey, Heiji!
(All) Eh?
I'm going to make a cigarette.
Guys, what do you say we go eat at the cafeteria?
My blood sugar is low and I can't think straight.
You idiot!
We can't waste time.
I'm waiting for a call.
A samurai never lets his guard down, they say.
Yes, but they also say you can't go into combat on an empty stomach.
Besides, I already have the answer to that thing you want to find out.
(Shinichi voice) What?
(Shinichi voice) The Tokyo police headquarters
is closer to Yokohama than Osaka.
I can't stand him, this guy.
Yes, that's right.
Next time we meet, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
Yes.
Thanks for doing me the favor, Aoki.
I owe you one.
-What's up, Otaki? -Sir!
About that...
You were talking to your cousin Aoki, from the Kanagawa Police Department?
Yes, look, it's just that we had a long-overdue call...
You don't need to pretend.
Heizo's son asked you for a favor, didn't he?
-He asked me too. -Ah... Oh, he did?
He also called you?
Gotcha, Otaki.
-What did you do, my son? -Ah... Superintendent!
Let's go to my office.
I want you to tell me everything in detail.
Ah... Yes.
It'll be a load off your mind, when you tell me.
I suppose so...
(thinks) "It's a pain in the ass, this playing sick."
All right, well, I appreciate it.
Inspector Megure!
I'm going to greet him, I'll be right back.
Wait for me, I'll come with you.
He's always been very nice to Heiji.
You know what, guys?
I'm going to see if I can get on the SuperSerp now.
-What?
What? (Genta) See you inside. - (Genta) See you in a while!
-Don't go! -Where do you think you're going, you?
Go fetch, please! -(Genta) Yes, okay!
Inspector Megure! Mm?
But it's Ran and the Kazuha!
What are they doing here?
What happened, Inspector?
Are you investigating a case?
No, and now!
We're having a party today.

And I take the opportunity to go out with Shiratori.
Eh?
You've come to spend the day in Miraclelandia together?
What a surprise!
Wow!
Look, Ran!
These kids...
Inspector.
Mm-hm.
(Genta) What?!
(Genta) I don't believe it!
This is what you get for wanting to go up alone.
Come on, let's go back to the infirmary.
Sorry for the inconvenience, gentlemen!
For your own safety I can't let you through.
We'll be handing out tickets in queue order.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Thief!
A thief!
Stop help us
Ayumi! Hey, Ran!
(Think) "Inspector Megure! What should he do here?"
Hey, Takagi.
What are you doing?
I... nothing, it's just... Ha-ha-ha!
Ah, wow!
I caught you looking at some pretty girl while I was gone, didn't I?
I-I-I-I-I would never do that to you, this, woman, I...
Don't take it like that!
It was just a joke, man.
Ah... ah, yeah, right... Ha-ha-ha!
(Thinking) "I'll-make-look like I haven't seen the inspector..."
Wow!
How good it looks, this curry!
Bon appetit!
Au, Tasta'l.
Great!
What must be in it, that it's so good?
Ecs!
What a disgusting curry!
It's full of lumps.
(Conan voice) Listen.
Who is this, this Suehiko Ito?
Apparently,
he's wanted as a suspect in the armored car robbery
that was on April 4th on Bashamichi Street.
They have been trying to find him ever since.
Now I understand... That's why they took down his picture from the club.
But this is not the most interesting thing.
When he finished his degree,
he set up a company he called Far East Office.
And soon after, a murder was committed in the offices.
Really? What do you say?
Interesting, isn't it?
Very good!
Let's take a look at this company called Far East Office?
"So much he grunted, and he's eaten it all up."
-I'm already here. W-welcome, Mrs. Kisaki.
Excuse me, Miss Kuriyama.
Could you bring me something to drink?
Sure.
(Mobile: melody)
Lawyer Kisaki.
Ah, it's you.
What happened?
Weren't you supposed to go to Miraclelandia with Ran and the kids today?
Just a moment!
Information about a case?
"What kind of trouble have you gotten yourself into?"
(Kogoro) It's just that a lot of things have happened,
and now I'm a bit stuck.
All right, people in the know.
The April 4th armored car robbery case, you say?
I'll look into it and tell you something, okay?
Thanks, you'll be doing me a favor.
-Kogoro? - "Hey, Eri."
Do you think I'll be able to solve it, this case?
To investigate, you have to walk.
Isn't that what you always say, former inspector?
It's true, you're absolutely right.
Will you do me a trick?
Yes, so be it.
Come here.
-Come in. (door: knock)
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oops!
I thought you were on the phone.
Yes..., I got a call.
From a very nasty guy.
Isn't that right, Goro?
(Think) "It must have been her husband."
The more they forbid us.......
...the more we'll want to go in.
Detectives are like that.
The man who was murdered was named Masaharu Nishio.
He was the business manager of Far East Office...
He was shot with a rifle.
In college, he was a classmate of President Ito.
Hm?
This means...
...at Nishio he also belonged to the Criminal Investigation Club.
That's right.
See.
What?
Like "look"?
What are you doing, with my cell phone?
When did you...?
Look at this.
In the row in front of the picture.
The one in the middle was the club president, in Suehiko Ito.
And on the right is the man who was killed, in Nishio.
Hey, and who is this girl sitting on the left?
Ah, this girl is Reiko Shimizu.
It looks like she also worked at the company,
but she committed suicide on May 15.
She committed suicide?
She committed suicide
shortly after the police took her in for questioning.
She was questioned about Nishio's murder?
Yes, and apparently they put a lot of pressure on her.
This is the crime scene.
There's dust everywhere, but...
...no one has entered since the day of the murder.
In fact, on that day,
both the windows and the shutters were open.
They killed in Nishio
by shooting him from a washroom in that building up ahead.
"The weapon was a Charter Arms AR-7,

With telescopic sight and silencer."
"On the floor of the sink they found 8 bullet casings."
"The shooter fired the 8 bullets he had, one after another."
"One hit the back of Nishio's head, who died on the spot."
Later, on his desk they found some papers written by the Ito,
detailing the armored car heist.
It was then that the police issued the search and arrest warrant.
If so, how did they interrogate Reiko Shimizu?
I don't know this yet.
Look, Hattori.
Don't you find that there is too little blood from being shot in the back of the head?
That's true.
Under the chair, however, there is a much larger bloodstain.
Where does this lead us?
The blood dripped and dripped to the floor through the seat.
Look at this.
One of the bullets hit the wheel and blew it out.
Now I get it.
I know what happened.
Yeah, now so do I.
(Mobile)
Soc at Hattori.
(Customer) "I see you've made it to the next stage, Hattori."
Yes, but it hasn't been easy.
You know what it is, the case you have to investigate?
"The murder of Masaharu Nishio, I suppose."
Yes.
-Hey.
Don't tell me you're...! - (communication cut off)
(cut off) What's wrong? Motorcycles!
I don't know what's going on, but it doesn't look good.
That's for sure.
Who are they?
Some people who want to liven up the investigation.
-You already told us, the client. -You already told us.
W-Well, it's happened a bit.
We won't go out!
We separate Contact Us
-All right! -All right!
Come on, let's go!
You and me alone, face to face.
(Motorbike, gas strokes: ruum)
Whenever you want, I'm ready.
You could have told me, you're so ugly!
Oops!
I didn't say anything.
(thinks) "Fucking hell!"
Don't be a coward!
Come and fight hand to hand!
"I hope Kudo was able to run away..."
What bad luck!
I just got yellow paint all over my polo shirt.
(Moto: ruuuum)
Hey, stop!
(Xof)
- (festive music) - (shouting)
It was a man wearing a cap and a jacket?
Yes, but he must have changed.
I guess so.
Why did you stop? Do not you find it suspicious?
Ah!
The one in the yellow T-shirt?
Look, he's got his hair a little flattened on top.
That means he must have taken off a cap.
Yes, and he must have hidden it with the jacket and the stolen bag.
I can tell you're Shinichi Kudo's girlfriend,
the teenage detective from the east!
You know I'm not his girlfriend.

While running away, did you stain your sneakers with Coca-Cola?
Yes.
I did it specifically so I could identify him.
Aaaaah!
Give me back my bag, thief!
He's got it!
-What a good idea, Genta! -It didn't go like that, Ayumi.
And don't be a liar, Genta.
A thief!
I saw perfectly well what happened.
You did?
I didn't remember...
Look!
No.
It's a woman.
Over there!
Hey, Ayumi!
-Is that him, Ayumi? -Yes, it's him.
Look closely, he's got a Coke stain on his left sneaker.
He keeps looking around, it's very suspicious.
-It must be him, for sure! -Yes.
Let's follow him!

I don't like this.
Now where did they go, the children?
- (Ayumi) Thief! - (Genta) Stop!
You won't escape!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

Get out of the way!
Let me through, get out!
I'll give it back to you right away!
You won't escape!
Fucking hell! Surrender!
The security guards are on their way.
You don't go where you're not wanted!
(People: exclamations of admiration)
-Oh, no! -Ayumi!
Ayumi!
Everybody freeze!
Nobody lift a finger, or this brat has drunk some oil.
(Female voice) "Number 5 is approaching the main entrance."
Who is it?
- "Number 5: Ayumi Yoshida." - (female voice) Okay.
(Pip, pip, pip, pip, pip)
Everybody freeze!
If anyone comes near me, this girl will die.
(Speed up: pip-pip-pip-pip-pip)
Hey, you!
Let go of the girl!
Take me hostage, if you want!
T'enrius of me, grandfather? Then take me!
No, let him take me.
It's my fault, that I took the girl.
No way, no way!
I mean... we can't allow anyone to play the hostage.
Enough talk!
I'm taking the girl, and that's it!
Everybody freeze!

No one is to move until she has left the park.
The girl's life is at stake.
(Speeds up: pip-pip-pip-pip-pip)
(Thinking) "No! If she takes it out of the park..."
What do you do?
The exit is on the other side....
-That's the entrance! -It gives me, get out of the middle! -It gives me, get out of the middle!
Don't yell at me!
I didn't make the rules.
(Pip-pip-pip-pip-pip... pip... pip)
It seems unbelievable that at your age you don't understand something so basic.
Catch him! What?
Get out of the way!
Ha-ha-ha!
There are envelope hostages in this park!
Get out of the way!
If anyone comes near me, this woman...
-What will happen to her? -What will happen to her?
What will happen to you?
Yes, what will happen to me?
Tell me about it.
Excuse me... May I come in, please?
Excuse me... excuse me.
Finally, I've got the ice cream... Sato?
Inspector Megure!
What a surprise!
What are you guys doing here?
This is something we should ask you.
Yes, of course we should!
It's just that I, look...
(Thinking) "Kudo..."
(Heiji) Kudo!
Kudo!
Hey, Kudo!
Kudo!
Ah!
It's about time, man!
(Shinichi voice) Where am I? In Dr. Agasa's car.
Doctor!
Ouch! Don't exert yourself.
I've bandaged your leg to get out of the way,
but it's very likely that you broke it.
(Conan voice) You rescued me yourself? No, in Hakuba.
It was him who called the doctor.
When the doctor arrived, you were wounded and in Hakuba he carried you in his arms.
Then he called me and I came running here to look for you.
In Hakuba...! Yes.
But he also told me that he had to check I don't know what,
and when I got to Hakuba, he wasn't there anymore.
What time is it?
How long have I been unconscious?
Two hours.
Now it's two and a half of nine.
Only one and a half hours to go...
In fact, we're heading for the Red Castle Hotel now.
Well, if we're going to the hotel, then you've already discovered the culprit.
No, but we're going anyway.
If we sit idly by, we won't make any progress.
By the way, while you were unconscious,
I received a call from Agent Otaki...
He passed on quite a bit of information to me.
He found out a very interesting detail
about Nishio's murder.
What was that?
That night, there was an accident at the port.
"A car overturned among the containers and was wrecked."
"The driver was Suehiko Ito."
"He survived by a miracle,
"But he was seriously injured
and was in the ICU for almost a month."
"When the police examined the car,
they discovered that the brakes had been tampered with."
"In addition, they found a rifle with a silencer in the trunk."
They had wiped off the fingerprints,
but there was no doubt that it was the same rifle
with which they had killed in Nishio that day.
Well... I guess they arrested the Ito, didn't they?
No.
Two months after the accident,
the doctors cleared him for visitors.
"But when the police went..."
May we come in?
"The Ito was gone."
As... he had disappeared without a trace,
they issued a search and seizure order.
While he was in the hospital, they also declared him a suspect
of the armored car robbery.
And what does this mean?
That this Ito is the murderer?
Yes, there is no doubt that he is the one who shot Nishio.
"At the crime scene they found his fingerprints,
and the clothes had traces of gunpowder on them."
"On the ground there were 8 bullet casings,
which was the capacity of the magazine of the rifle he was carrying."
"And the caliber of the bullets also matched the rifle. But..."
Mascara?
It's very little,
but we found traces of mascara on the rifle scope.
So the shooter was wearing mascara on his eyelashes.
That's right.
It was mascara of an exclusive brand.
They pulled the thread
and investigated all the women in Ito's entourage,
and they found one who wore that same brand of mascara.
It turned out to be Reiko Shimizu.
(Shinichi voice) The one who committed suicide after the interrogation?
She was the darling of the Yokohama Criminal Investigation Club.
She had a very good relationship with Nishio and Ito,
who disappeared without a trace.
When she finished her degree, she joined Ito's company,
where she also worked at Nishio.
She was the general manager.
The men who held up the armored car

were in Ito and in Nishio, right?
The Ito may have had a motive to kill in Nishio,
but what was Reiko's motive?
According to her co-workers,
in Nishio he was after him, but the Reiko wanted nothing to do with him.
"The police subjected her to a grueling interrogation.
"For the murder of Nishio,
"because of the traces of her mascara on the rifle scope,
but they didn't get a word out of her."
"And finally, on May 15..."
Hmm?
Eh!
He threw himself into the sea!
(Heiji) "Reiko Shimizu's body never turned up,
but the police believed that she could not have survived the fall."
"That's why they considered that she had committed suicide."
And then, after 20 days, the Ito escaped from the hospital.
As the two main suspects in Nishio's
of Nishio's murder had disappeared,
the case was closed for lack of evidence.
Needless to say, the Ito's company went bankrupt after the departure of its president.
after the departure of its president.
It was then that the Miyama company bought it.
And all this is related to the jewelry that Kid stole?
Exactly!
The president, Mr. Miyama,
had been a member of the Criminal Investigation Club,
just like Ito and the rest, but 4 years before him.
It seems that Ito decided to follow in Miyama's footsteps.
Hey, now that we are talking about Kid,
Otaki told me that he had discovered something interesting.
What was it?
On April 4th, when the Kid stole the diamond from Miyama's gallery,
he used the same escape route
as the men who robbed the armored car.
They met and there was a shootout.
A shootout?
In fact, the KID doesn't use guns,
so it was the robbers who shot him.
And do you know why they wanted to kill him?
Because in the KID he had seen their faces.
Isn't that right?
Yes.
And you know what they found at the scene of the shooting?
Well, the bullet casings from the pistol and the rifle.
How?
Since then, every time the Kid shows up to commit a robbery,
there's always someone chasing him to kill him.
What?
Interesting, isn't it? Yes.
But this is not enough
to be able to identify Nishio's killers.
You're right.
There are still many unanswered questions.
Come to think of it, a while ago he called me in Mouri...
to tell me that he had found a very important testimony.
From what he told me, on the day they killed in Nishio,
someone heard a metallic noise, a "clanga-clanga"...
coming from the washroom where the shots came from,
and then this same person
saw the Ito running out of there, carrying a golf bag.
Surely the metallic noise
would be the shells of the bullets falling to the ground.
And inside the golf bag must have been the rifle,
the Charter Arms AR-7.
We have the solution, doctor.
On is Mr. Mouri?
He told me that he had solved the case
and that he was now going to see the client
to explain his reasoning.
But it could be that... Yes, if he's wrong, we're lost!
-Yes?
You mean? -Speed up, doctor!
Full speed ahead!
Roger that.
I knew you'd come, Kaito Kid.
This morning you cut a hole in the roof...
and finally managed to sneak in.
But you're not taking any of my jewelry.
Look, I never steal any jewelry without warning.
How-how do you say?
Tonight I've only come to say goodbye.
I don't intend to gamble my life for another day.
You haven't let me down, Kid.
Did you find out everything?
Yes, you might say so.
But there was something I didn't understand.
Why did he continue to pursue me
when I had already returned the diamond I stole from him that night?
And today, finally, I understood.
He cares a lot about his old college buddies.
You brought this on yourself.
Because that day you had the misfortune
to witness their games.
Since when is killing a security guard a game?
Sometimes, playing games can lead to an accident.
Like when you saw them.
If my friends come to me for help, I can't refuse, can I?
Mm?
(laughs mischievously)
What... what are you bragging about, now?
You thought I'd show up here without having anything prepared?
Who do you think I am?
Watch out!
Matthew in Kid!
(Coughing)

What... what is this?
Don't worry, it's just sleeping gas.
You hadn't noticed?
Well, I've been coming here many times, since that April 4th.
What's that?
If you want to know why I came here this morning..,
and why I broke the roof,
it's because I wanted you to know that I was coming tonight,
with the intention of attracting you and your gorillas.
-By the way, I have sent word to the POLICE. -No way!
If you have any complaints, they will hear them with pleasure.
(Police: sirens)
(Coughs)
The same goes for your precious companion,
who sleeps behind the curtain.
(Coughs) Oh!
Gee, she's been smarter than you.
Well, I'm convinced that these two will confess everything.
Even the origin of the stolen jewels you have here.
It's in the Kid!
It's at the Kid's again!
- (gunshots) - (brittle)
You have finally managed to score a goal in the last minute of the match.
Unfortunately for you, it was an own goal.
- (man) Police!
Open the door! - (door: banging)
(Wheels: squeaking)
(thinks) "Hang on, Ran..."
Hello.
Welcome, Detective Mouri.
Your client is waiting for you.
Come on in.
Detective Mouri has just arrived.
"I know you're tired, but we don't have time to waste."
"What are your conclusions?"
He asked me to come all the way down here,
to investigate the events that occurred on April 4th,
that is, the robbery of the armored car on Bashamichi Street...
and the murder of Masaharu Nishio,
which is related to the robbery.
(Wheels: squeaking)
(Wheels: squeaking)
In the meantime, I'll go to Miraclelandia to see if I can find the children.
Yes! Take care of Kazuha.
(Wheels: squeak) Take it easy.
The two men who held up the armored car
were Suehiko Ito and Masaharu Nishio.
But... one of the security guards stood up to them...
and Nishio killed him.
Interestingly, after 4 days, he was killed in Nishio.
"The police were suspicious of his co-worker,
Reiko Shimizu, whom he was chasing day in and day out in Nishio."
"But I don't think it was her."
"The killer's motive was revenge,
since his plan had gone to the dogs because of Nishio."
Yes.
Masaharu Nishio's murderer was undoubtedly It....
-(Kogoro) Wait a minute! - (Kogoro) But it's you!
I'm sorry, but Detective Mouri is stating his conclusions... (Kogoro) Oh!
"Oysters!"
Hey, hey, what's wrong?
Are you all right?
"Detective Mouri, please continue."
What was said is that the man who killed in Nishio was... Ah!
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri.
Geez, no!
The screen's turned off! Damn it!
Geez, what button could it be?
Oh.
What-what happened?
You think the customer might be in there?
You do?
Just before, when I was on the phone with Takada,
I heard a noise in the background.
It's the same noise I heard
while Kogoro was talking to the customer.
I understand.
We're running out of time.
Let's go!
It's dark as a rain bucket.
We're not wasting time.
Let's go!
Welcome, Shinichi Kudo...
...and Heiji Hattori.
Yes... At last we meet.
(Heiji) You must be the president of the Far East Office...
At Suehiko Ito.
I'm not disappointed at all.
I wasn't wrong when I put you to investigate the case.
(Heiji) I see we got it right, then.
Forgive me for not getting up to say hello.
(Ito) I don't have much freedom of movement.
-For the accident at the port? -Yes.
When I knew I wouldn't fully recover,
I came here.
I left my opaque investments in charge of an acquaintance.
Miraclelandia is one.
You mean Soichiro Miyama, right?
Magnificent!
Even this, have you discovered?
Want to feel the rest?
We don't have much time.
Have you been able to... find out the truth? Yes.
I don't have much time left either.
That's why I needed a detective capable of uncovering the truth.
One who wasn't just smart, but a really strong detective.
Come on, talk.
Explain to me what you have discovered.
On April 4, Masaharu Nishio was murdered in his office.
The person who shot him
from the front washroom window was...
Reiko Shimizu!
You manipulated the evidence so that the police would suspect you.

And then tried to kill him by sabotaging the car's brakes.
That's bullshit!
It was me who killed Nishio from the toilet!
You and the police are incompetent!
It's true that you fired the rifle from that toilet.
-But Reiko had already shot him. How?
"You didn't kill him."
(Ito) "None of the 7 bullets you fired hit him."
(Ito) "How 7? There was room for 8 bullets, the rifle's magazine!"
(Heiji) "He left the washroom in such a hurry,
that he forgot to pick up the shells of the ground bullets."
"No wonder he doesn't know how many shots he fired."
"But when you shot him, he was already dead in Nishio."
(Ito) "This is impossible! I saw him!"
"I saw him collapse when one of the bullets hit him."
You saw him fall because you blew off one of the wheels of the chair
one of the wheels of the chair where he was sitting.
For the same reason,
one of the bullets could also have killed him by chance!
Don't be an idiot!
Who sits quietly in a chair while being shot?
But... maybe I killed him the first time!
(Shinichi's voice) The blood on the chair
where Masaharu Nishio was sitting when he died...
"...goes dripping down the back and formed a puddle on the floor."
This is how we have deduced...
"That it was an expert marksman
who killed Nishio with a single shot to the head..."
(Heiji) "And on the other hand,
an amateur shot crooked and straight when the blood had dried up."
But with this we did not have enough
to know which of the two had been the murderer,
but after listening to the statements of the witness
that Mr. Mouri has found, we have seen it clearly.
The witness says that he felt a "clang, clang!
a metallic noise coming from the sink,
and then he saw
you came out loaded with a golf bag.
This noise was the shells of bullets falling to the ground.
He felt it several times,
therefore, the amateur shooter was you.
That is, the expert was Reiko Shimizu.
"You shot him blindly,
"You blew out one of the wheels of the chair,
"caused her to fall to the ground and was thought to have killed her."
"In the golf bag was the rifle, the Charter Arms AR-7."
"It was Reiko who gave you the bag before the crime, wasn't it?"
It's... it's true, it was.
But how do you know she killed him?
On the scope of the rifle they found traces of mascara.
It was of an exclusive brand and it's the one used by Reiko Shimizu.
This doesn't make any sense!
"She gave you the bag and you shot from the sink."
"Then she went to the port to get rid of the rifle and the car."
(Heiji) "It was probably her, too,
who sabotaged the brakes of your car and caused you to crash."
She had every intention...
to keep all the money from the armored car robbery.
She also participated.
So she was waiting for them in the car, right?
But as they fled with the car, they found Kaito Kid.
"Since he had seen them, he chased after him to shut him up."
But he ended up cornering them in a dead end street
and so they shot him.
"In the alleyway they found several shell casings
from the pistol and rifle bullets."
Even if you're a very good driver, it's impossible....
"Driving with one hand and with a rifle or pistol in the other,
shoot at the Kaito Kid as he runs away."
In the car were two more people:
"One with the rifle and the other with the pistol."
"That is, at Masaharu Nishio and Reiko Shimizu."
(Heiji) In fact, most of the clues were given to us by the police.
Surely it must have been them too,
the ones who found Mr. Mouri's testimony.
And, of course, with all this information,
it's only natural that they suspected Reiko Shimizu.
Exactly.
There was no need for anyone to reinvestigate this case.
Neither a good cop... nor a good detective.
Anyway, mystery solved.
Deactivate the bracelets of Ran and the others.
That's a lie.
It couldn't have been her.
It's a lie.
It's a lie, lie!
It's not a lie.
We thought so, that she was alive.
Reiko!
Is it you?
I couldn't trust you.
As a couple, you're a disaster.
And so was Nishio.
He was too impetuous.
If I'd stayed with him, I'd have put my life in danger.

Besides, you're a coward...
And besides, you spent the whole day showing off.
I had no fun with you.
I left you alive because...
I saw you recruiting detectives
to try to defend my innocence, but this ends today.
These days I've been talking to Mr. Miyama
to give me control of your investments.
Miyama too...?
Yes, him too, but he is finished.
In Kaito Kid has unmasked him.
In the end, the only survivor... will be me!
(Heiji) Wait a minute!
Kudo.
Don't move.
It's a Walther PPK.
It holds 8 bullets.
When I've emptied the magazine, I'll attack you for disarming it.
-Six... -(gunshot)
Seven... and eight.
(Conan voice) Now!
(Conan voice) Hattori!
Sorry, I happen to be ambidextrous.
(CLEC, CLEC)
Use it, Kudo!
You don't need legs to fly!
(CLEC, CLEC) Sure!
(Ito) Reiko!
Reiko, what happened?
What happened, Reiko?
Reiko!
(Shinichi voice) Deactivate the bracelets, please.
I have to click "cancel", right? Yes.
We need an ambulance, it's very urgent.
(Acoustic error signal: mucus!) What?
What's wrong?
Error?
We've fixed something to mess up another one.
Hey, Kudo.
Do you understand?
(Conan voice) Not all are blocked.
I'm looking for what works.
I guess I must be worse than I thought, Kudo.
Your voice sounds like a child's to me.
(Laughs)
(Shinichi voice) Hattori!
Even though the error message comes out?
Yes, it keeps coming up.
I knew it!
They're set to explode at the scheduled time.
And what time is it, this? Ten o'clock.
(Thinking) "Damn! What do you represent that I should do now?"
Wow!
I was so anxious to go up to the SuperSerp...
They still haven't been able to fix the breakdown.
What's taking them so long to bring me my desserts?
Come on, don't complain so much, man!
And the inspector invited us.
You have a big heart, Inspector Megure.
-And the panxa. - Yes, too...
Hey, Inspector Megure.
Nothing happened?
Mm... Why do you say that?
Because... all your agents are here.
Ah, no... Inspector Megure.
Hey, hello, Shiratori.
I'll be right back, Ran.
Yes...
Any news?
Both the restaurant's customers and staff
have been evacuated from the building.
The only ones left are us... and the children.
Understood.
(Thinks) "What's taking so long, Shinichi?"
(Types quickly)
(Snot!)
Fuck!
The bond that unites a man and a woman is strengthened
when there is a shared secret.
And the greatest secret you can ever share
is that of having committed a crime with the woman you love.
That's why... I'm going to hold up the armored car with Reiko,
to show her that I loved her.
But when in Nishio decided to shoot the security guard,
my perfect plan went down the drain.
(Conan voice) Nothing is perfect.
There is always a time when things go wrong.
It's up to you to decide whether you go ahead and shoulder everything
or you reset yourself to start from scratch.
You have to work hard to make up for everything you've lost.
But you were afraid...
...to go back to the beginning.
(Appliances: stop)
Maybe you are right.
Will it work?
What does this mean?
If I don't stop the countdown, the bracelets can't be removed!
Oh, man!
What's wrong with you?
Are you unwell? No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
If anything happens to you, let me know right away.
Yes, don't suffer.
Conan, in the end, couldn't come.
He must be investigating with detective Mouri.
It's not fair, always to her!
(Mitsuhiko) Yes, this is Conan's specialty.
He hasn't told you anything, Detective Mouri? No.
Understood.
When it's one minute to 10 o'clock, go in.
I can't leave the kids alone at a time like this, can I?
Mmm... (Heiji) That's right.
(Heiji) 4 minutes to 10. Time's running out, Kudo!
(Shinichi voice) Sure!
Use a wireless connection!
Yes...
It must have disconnected from the network.
If I try to connect the cable, it might work.
(They talk at the same time and laugh)
Something else.
Now it is!
The cable is coming through!
Yes, it works!
Finally! Countdown..., stop!

(Female voice) "Please enter the password."
Uh, the password... Hey, Kudo, it seems to me that...
Don't worry, he just fainted.
It must be an aftermath of the accident.
"What's the name of the person you love the most?"
One minute to go.
Mm-hm.
You stay here, okay?
Ah, um... Yes.
(Mitsuhiko) People were really scared, weren't they?
(Genta) I was calm.
What, guys?
Did you have a good time today?
Yes, but we couldn't get on the SuperSerp.
(Genta) But the one that looked like a rocket was really cool!
(Mitsuhiko) That's right!
I'd love to go up again.
(Heiji) Ito is in love with Reiko Shimizu!
- "Wrong password." - How?
Isn't Reiko Shimizu, the person he loves the most?
- "Wrong password." - Time is running out, Kudo!
"If you re-enter an incorrect password,
the system will shut down."
(Think) "Who could it be? Who is it, the person Ito loves the most?"
(Pip, pip, pip, pip, pip)
And besides, you spent the whole day bluffing.
(Pip, pip, pip)
But when in Nishio shot the security guard,
my perfect plan went down the drain.
I got it!
What are you doing, Kudo?
(Pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip)
"Countdown disabled."
It's over already? Yes, it's finally over.
The nightmare is over.
Well done, Shinichi.
I stopped the countdown, but I couldn't deactivate the sensors.
"Collect all the bracelets and don't neglect any of them, okay?"
Yes, we'll do it right now.
(Ito) Kudo.
And you too, Hattori.
You're the best detectives I've ever met.
And you, the worst person I've ever met.
(Ito) Hey, guys!
Are you all right?
All right, take off your bracelets and put them in this bag.
-Come on!
Do we have to take them back? -The park is about to close...
Ah... What a pity.
Mmm... where should I keep the handkerchief?
Wow!
I thought I'd already lost it.
What could this be?
Looks like a paint stain.
-Where did it get dirty? -Where did it get dirty? -Can I have the bracelet back, please?
It's just that...
(Speaker: female) "Attention, we apologize for the inconvenience."
"The SuperSerp maintenance work has been completed."
"Although the park closes at 10 o'clock, the ride will make one last trip."
"We kindly ask visitors who wish to ride
to make their way to the attraction."
Hooray!
How nice!
Are you okay, Hattori? Don't worry, it's just a scratch.
By the way, how did Ito know that you are Shinichi Kudo?
That's why. What do you mean?
Because of the footprint?
Do you remember the chairs where we've been? Yes...
I remember because I thought they were out of place.
Well, the arms of the chairs caught my attention.
There would be a device... capable of scanning fingerprints.
(Female voice) "These fingerprints belong to Shinichi Kudo."
In Suehiko Ito is blind.
Therefore, I imagine he must have thought I was Shinichi Kudo.
Now I understand.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Oysters, oysters, it's the 10 touches!
It will explode!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Conan voice) You can unbutton now, Mr. Mouri.
Eh?
Unbutton?
-The bracelet, man! -Eh?
It's true!
What a break!
Thank God!
-I'll wear it. -What?
Just a moment!
Aaaaah... Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Shinichi voice) Ha-ha-ha!
It's a case!
It's a sign that everything's back to normal, right?
By the way, you can put me down now.
You don't have to exert yourself, your leg must still hurt.
See how good it is?
To heal a broken leg
there's nothing better than riding on the shoulders of a girl.
(Conan voice) Shut up, you idiot! You creatures...
Inspector, we have already collected all the bracelets you have been given.
There's no cap missing.
Mm-hm.
Take them to the explosives unit, but do it very discreetly.
Yes.
All right!
It's time to go up to the SuperSerp, or anywhere else!
(Speaker: female) "Bon voyage!"
What luck!
We've got it all to ourselves!
Don't worry, Heiji.
We'll buy you some spare underpants.
I'm not going to pee my pants!
Come on, everybody, hands up!
Yessssss!
Nervous, aren't you?

If you are afraid, it is not necessary to let go.
Who says I'm afraid?
Of course I can let go, I don't even need the safety bar!
AAAAAAAAA!
-Come on! -No!
No!
Noooo!
Don't make me laugh, Heiji!
(Heiji) Eeei!
Nanooo!
Genta!
Gentaaa!
What are you doing with it on?
Take it off right now!
We're going outside the perimeter of the park to go over the sea!
Genta!
Hey, listen!
What's wrong with you, now?
-If you move, you'll die! (Armband: CLEC) -All right.
(Bracelet: CLEC)
(shouting)
I've got it!
(shouting)
(shouting) Oh!
Kudooo!
It's behind!
(Pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip)
(Thinks) "Reco!"
(Shouting)
(Shouting)
Catch it!
(Haibara) Stop!
Don't let it unbuckle!
Stop it!
The security bars are connected!
If in forces one...... will open them all!
(Pip, pip, pip, pip, pip)
How cool!
We have even seen a fire castle!
-We are VIP customers! -Well, I didn't have any fun....
What was he doing here?
In fact, I think... he's always been with us.
What do you mean?

He pretended to be dead so that she had been paid to do it.

they hadn't disappeared either.
Mmm...
There are those who will do anything for money!
Ah!
It's quite pitiful.

To appear in an advertisement, you say?
And... what kind of ad would it be?
What kind of ad?
An ad for sleeping pills?
That it won't cost me anything because I always sleep?

For whom did you take me, if I may know ?!
No matter how much I get paid, I will not do it.

So much money?
Oh, sure, you can count on me!
