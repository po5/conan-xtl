Oh!
We have a problem.
The culprit is still in the house.
Oh, my goodness!
We must get out of here at once!
But first we should rescue that child.
Listen to me, all of you: don't separate from me at all.
Exactly, think that, if we get separated,
maybe we'll end up like that poor child.
(Trona)
(Children) Aaaah!

Oops, oops, oops!
This makes a bad face.
Since the engine was leaking oil, now it's all burned up.
Oh!
If we don't take it to the workshop, there's nothing to do.
For the moment, we'll take it away with the tow truck.
Oh, but they'll take the car and leave us all here?
I'm sorry, but yes.
Normally, we tell drivers to take public transport,
but they won't be able to here.
There are no buses on this lonely road and they don't sell cabs.
What? !!
Does this mean we'll have to walk back?
Our house is far away, eh?
Couldn't you give us a ride with your tow truck, please?
There's only room for one more person in the crane.
We can't take all of you.
Why don't you go with them, Dr. Agasa?
Eh?
I could go with them
and take a rental car to come pick them up.
I don't think it'll take more than an hour.
Yeah, that's right.
All right, stay here, I'll come and get you as soon as I can.
(Thinking) "It's been an hour and a half since Dr. Agasa left."
It's very strange.
-I think he's lost his way. -Yes, surely.
Oh, I'm hungry.
I'm hungry.
With how well it went, the excursion to harvest bamboo shoots!
-Yes, of course!
We have harvested molts.-Ostras!
The doctor promised us that we would eat rice with mushrooms at his house.
Oh!
Oh!
Now it's raining.
That's all we needed!
We didn't carry umbrellas or anything because of the rain.
Now that I remember,
we passed by a housing development a while ago.
We could take shelter there. Yeah, good idea.
Let's go.
Hey, Conan, nobody lives in these houses.
People must only come here for vacations.
(Mitsuhiko) Sure.
It's getting dark already, huh?
We could take shelter under a balcony.
What, you haven't been able to talk to the doctor, though?
No.
I've tried several times, but he tells me the phone is turned off.
(cell phone ringing)
-Oysters! -Oh!
(Mobile)
It's the doctor's landline.
"Hello, doctor. What happened to you?" (Agasa) Excuse me, guys.
As I didn't want to lose my cell phone or my wallet while I was colliering bamboo, I put them in the Ai's backpack we left behind,
I kept them in the Ai's backpack that we left at home,
and then I didn't think any more.
I had to stop by the house to pick them up,
but I'll be right back, don't worry.
Now I have already found a rental car.
I figure I'll be there in a couple of hours.
You can count!
-What?
Even if there's enough for two hours? -Of course!
That's a lot.
And now it starts to rain harder.
-What's that noise? -Huh?
I don't know if it's trona or it's your belly snoring.
(Gut rumbling)
-Ha-ha!
I do know. (piano, from far away)
("Aria on the G string", by J.S. Bach)
-I can feel a piano. -Eh?
Yes, I feel it too.

It's coming from the house over there.
This music sounds familiar.
Does it sound familiar to you too?
-Oh, it does? -I've felt it with violin.
I'm sure of it.
But I don't know what it's called.
You do, Conan?
I'm sorry, I don't know much about music.
I'm sorry, I don't know much about music.
It's a work by Johann Sebastian Bach.
Eh?

It is from the suite for orchestra number 3, in D major;
the second movement,
the aria, known as "Aria on the G string".
It sounds familiar to me, this title.
It is very famous.
What he plays must be a professional pianist.
Listen, we could ask him to let us in.
Yes.
Maybe he could give us a plate of rice.
That would be asking too much.

(doorbell: ding-dong, ding-dong)
- (music: stops) Oh!
-The piano player has stopped. We hope he's nice.
Yes.
No one's coming. And they don't say anything over the intercom either.
It's very strange.
(Ringing: ding-dong, ding-dong)
-Oh! -Oh!
The door is not closed.
What is there?
Please, can we come in so we don't get wet?
Oh!
It's so dark.
I don't understand why the lights aren't on.
-AU!
I crushed something! -What? -What?
Oh!
Potato chips!
There's a scattering of potatoes on the ground.
There must be some kind of pig kid.
Oh!
Oh!
Hey, come here, come here!
-I found the piano. -Ooh!
But if there was someone playing the piano,
why didn't he come to open the door when we knocked?
I see that there is a stereo and a lot of CDs.
Maybe what you felt was a CD.
I already told you that it seemed to me that what was playing was a very good pianist,
a professional.
No, no, the piano we felt was this one.
And I know that because...
just this note is a little out of tune.
Well, for not understanding music, you have a very fine ear.
Are you sure?
Attention, because Ayumi will play you a song.
Would you like me to play "The Cat Song"?
Don't play the piano, I'll give you a kidney.
What we have to do is to look for the owner of the house.
(Noise)
Aah!
Mitsuhiko!
Look through that glass!
There was a tall man spying on us!
What's that?
That's the owner of the house.
We should say hello.
Oh!
This door is stuck.
Aah!
Eh?
A wheelbarrow!
Hey, didn't we turn on the hallway lights?
We did.
That means there's someone in the house.
Wh-who could it be?
Maybe it's someone who wants to close us in here!
No, man, no!
Eh, who sits us down?
Excuse us.
We're not here to do anything wrong!
Get out, please!
Oh!
There's a room over there with the light on.
-It's true. Maybe there's someone in there, isn't there?
(Mitsuhiko) This must be the kitchen.
But what happened?
Look at the table.
There are crumbs of fried chicken, bread, ham....
It's so dirty it looks like a dog ate it.
The owner of this house must be a bit wild.
There's a glass of wine lying down and tot.
Eh?
(thinks) "A notebook. Maybe it belongs to the person who lives here."
"After talking to him, I see he's a very nice boy.
He's very eager to laugh and play,
but I don't know if he's very aware of the situation
he is in at the moment.
All I know is that this child seems to have always been quite oppressed.
Patience, there are only two days left, now.
April 22nd.
A cloudy day ago.
Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven?
they all have melodies that touch the heart.
How I envy the great genius born in the same era!
It is not a suitable piece to play in these circumstances,
but at least it allows the time to pass.
Only one day to go.
Please let it be quiet.
April 23rd.
It's raining today.
That's a bad sign.
Looks like the boy knows who I am, really.
What a danger!
If he were to make my name public, it would ruin my future.
I'm sorry, but I have no choice but to kill him".
Kill him?
What-what-what-what does it all mean? -There's been a kidnapping here.
I'm sure someone kidnapped a little boy
and hid him in this house.
-I-it can't be! -C-va-va-va-va-va, go on.
How about later? The pages are glued together.
I can't separate them.
(Thunder)
(Thunder) Oh!
-The light's gone! -Oh, oh, Conan!
Have you seen it?
On this page there's something red.
Maybe it's blood.
And it also says: "I'm so sorry, little one. Forgive me."
(Piano)
-The piano again! -It's the same song as before.
Oh, how scary!
The bad guy is still in the house!

De-hurry!
Mail!
We must run away from here!
Hey, hey, we must save the child! Wait, man!

Hold on, man!
We can not separate.
Exactly.
Just think, if we were to split up,..,
we could all end up like that poor kid.
(Mitsuhiko) Oh!
A box of dead people!
Oh, listen, didn't the aria on the G string become famous...
...until a hundred years after Bach's death.
Maybe the person who kidnapped the child and wrote that diary...
also wants to make him sleep a hundred years... in this box.
Co-Conan, what-what do you want to do?
The only thing you can do, right?
Open this box.
No, please, wait.
Remember what we read in the newspaper we found.
It said that someone would kidnap a child and lock up in this house.
And on another page, the kidnapper said that...
since the child knew who he was, he had no choice but to kill him.
Yes, and also, on the last page of the diary there is a big red stain...
and a sentence that says: "I'm so sorry, little one. Forgive me."
This can't mean anything good.
That is to say, in this box of dead people...
...maybe there's the corpse of a child.
Yes, it is very possible.
(Thunder)
No.
What do you want to do?
Please, Ay, take these three.
It's not a children's show.
All right. (Thunder)
-Hey, you're a kid too, Conan. Whatever.
We put aside selected ones.
It's empty.
There's nothing in here.
Oh, what luck!
This means that the child is alive, still.
If they had killed her, they would have put him in the box.
Besides, I'm sure that after killing a child,
no one would entertain playing the piano.
Either way, we need to call the police.
Does anyone have a cell phone handy?
I don't have one on me because I left it in my backpack.
-I did the same thing. -Me too.
So have I.
You did?
So we all left it in the first room we entered.

-Here we go again! -It's the same song.
Yes, the aria on the G string.

Why did you have to leave your backpacks in the piano room?
Because you left it too, Conan.
-So they were all together. It doesn't matter, it's done.
There is only one solution:
We all go back to the piano room together to look for the bags.
-Yes, it's true. No, man, no!
We still don't know what kind of weapon this kidnapper might have.
Standing up to him with our faces uncovered is too dangerous.
Yeah, but we have to do something fast, otherwise the child...
I estimate that Dr. Agasa will be here in an hour or so.
We could leave the house and wait outside,
but it's raining cats and dogs.
But waiting won't do any good.
I think we'd better look around the house for the child now.
-Yes! Yes!
Isn't it too dangerous?
The kidnapper is still back here.
Ah!
Do not worry.
Think that, as long as the piano sits,
the kidnapper is in that room.
Yes, but what if it turns out that the kidnapper has some accomplice?
I think he has none,
because the diary is written in the first person
and, besides, there was only one glass of wine on the table.
This is the work of only one person.
But, just in case, nobody should split up and go on their own, eh?
Oh, so much!
I don't understand why the kidnapper doesn't come looking for us.
Maybe he does not come because he does not want us to see his face.
If we would just run away and explain to the police what kind of face he makes,
he'd be in big trouble.
I imagine that's why he's playing the piano in the dark.
He wants to scare us because we leave this house and do nothing else.
But he doesn't know everything:
he doesn't know that we found the paper and read it,
and that's why we know he's a kidnapper.
Anyway, since we know the house,
we can always tell the police to locate its owner.
Maybe he is not the owner of this house.
Eh? They're summer houses.
I wouldn't be surprised if the kidnapper came here expressly,
broke into the house by forcing a door,
and made it look like it was his

and that he was a very rich man before the child he wanted to kidnap.

What, is it still playing, the piano? Yes, it hasn't stopped playing.
I don't understand how he can play in the dark.
His fingers already know where all the keys are.
He thinks there are a lot of blind pianists in the world.
What is it, this room? It looks like a child's room.
I'd say it's a girl's.
Wouldn't you?
There's leftover food in here, too.
Yes.
"Oh! A video game!"
"And what's this?"
"The back of these booklets is all full of drawings."
"Looks like a cipher diagram."
Hey, Conan, this is a treasure map from Monster Getter III.
Huh?
If you don't draw somewhere the pieces of map
the game gives you, then you can't find the treasure.
The kidnapper must have kept the child locked in this room,
and he must have entertained himself by playing.
Yes.
It's half an hour before Dr. Agasa arrives.
We are back in the kitchen where we were before.
It seems to me that we have already surrounded the whole house.
No.
There was a hallway that branched off.
I'm sure there are places we haven't been yet.
That's right.
We haven't gone, that way.

Hm.
Wow!
There's something shiny here.
It's water.
And it's hot.
And why is there water, here?
Oh!
A picture.
(high chair)
How strange!
The dishes are all clean
and the scraps well sorted for recycling.
The person who has been here is tidy.
If she is so tidy,
what are these scraps doing on the table?
Oh!
Hey, hey, hey!
The Ayumi is gone.
Maybe the kidnapper has taken her too.
No, man, that sure doesn't, because the piano still feels, doesn't it?

Yes, but now it doesn't sound the same as before.
Eh? All the notes are in tune.
Maybe the kidnapper put on a CD that played the aria nonstop
to make us think that there was someone playing in the piano room.
and, in the meantime, he's been following us around the house.
How scary! We must look for Ayumi.
Maybe she just got lost by herself.
Yes.
(Trona)
You didn't find it? No, it's nowhere to be found.
Maybe the kidnapper has it, poor thing!
Or even worse: maybe he's even killed her.
-Nooo!
Really, he killed her? -I don't know.
I'm just saying it's a possibility.
Oh, you poor thing!
Eh?
-Ayumi, where have you been? -It was next door.
But don't you see that we were looking for you?
Were you looking for me?
I thought he was looking for the child.
As I saw that we were all running out of the kitchen...
Oh, by the way: look at the photo I found on the ground.
What's that?
It's of a family.
It must be a family of musicians.
Here's a date: the photo is from a year ago.
Hey, one thing: what if this girl in the photo was the one who was kidnapped?
No, Genta.
We said that what was kidnapped was a child.
This man in the photo must be the owner of the house,
but it could also be this kidnapper we're looking for.
-You mean it could be him? -Oh, no!
"The key to the case must be hidden in this diary...
and I intend to find it any way I can."

to the point where someone would have wanted him not to be born.
