(Vodka) The Mystery Train?
Ah, the Bell Tree Express.
I find it hard to believe that Sherry wants to go, on this train.
It would stand out en masse.
(Woman) "Well look, don't rule out that she chose it precisely because of that."
It's a train with individual compartments.
If she wants to escape from the Kanto region without us noticing,
it's the most ideal way to do it.
"Maybe so, but it's not clear to me."
"And it's not clear to me that he would hide in the Gunma Mountains either."
Already.
Bourbon is the one who got the information and thinks the same as you.
We only know what she herself has told
to the people she has come in contact with,
it's not very reliable information.
Now, if it were true that Sherry gets on the train,
that would be the perfect place to catch her, wouldn't it?
"Yes."
"If we can keep her from getting off, it'll be like having her in a moving prison."
We'll just have to pretend we want to hunt a deer.
If we scare him enough, maybe he'll want to give himself up on his own.
"And I guess you understand why I've decided to
to leak this information to you, right?"
Because keep me out of it until the steel snake goes back to its burrow, I guess.
Just to feel like calling you the Sherry after all this time,
I'm happy already.
I was beginning to suspect that, being a woman,
you might have taken pity.
"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! What nonsense!"
"It seems unbelievable that you still don't know me!"
Very well, then.
I'll call you back when the hunt is over.
"Very well."
(Thinking) "OK."
I've lost, I admit it.
I'll leave Sherry alone, I promise you.
"I'll leave her alone."
"Because the one who will kill her will be in Bourbon."
"We can't let her continue in this world."
"Don't hold it against me, Silver Bullet."
"To find the perfect solution,
you have to crack all the mysteries and codes."
"A train sets off
as the shadow of the Men in Black flats over the Haibara."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The Mystery Train, (the exit)"
(Ayumi) It's awesome!
I've never seen a steam locomotive before!
-It makes quite an impression, doesn't it?
-Me neither.
Yes, although it's not a real steam locomotive.
It's actually a more modern diesel train.
-Yes.
-You still got a cold, Ai? -Yeah.
The one who entrusted me stayed rested.
You should have slept over at your place.
(Sonoko) Come on, come on, guys, let there be peace.
What wait to thank the Suzuki consortium,
the owner of the train?
Whoever you think has reserved the seats for you?
Thank you.
By the way, I have to inform you that we won't be sitting together,
because we will be traveling first class.
Ah, that's right,
it's in this carriage that the Kid announced that robbery.
Yes, that's right.
It is a very special occasion,
because this train only makes one trip every year,
but this time Uncle Jirokichi is making another one
to exhibit a jewel in the first class carriage,
and the Kid seems to have liked the idea very much.
So this time I decided to go ahead
and hide a love letter among the first class seats.
Woman, what do you want me to tell you?
What, what do you think?
It seems to me that he won't have time to read it.
Besides, what do you want?
That in Kyogoku offends, or what?
In Kid is a special case and does not count.
(Sera) To me this thief gives me.
I'm much more interested in the contest of deductions
that always organize the train.
You also come?
What are you doing here, Sera?
Soc detective.
What did you expect?
By the way, you are not accompanied by your father this time?
Ui.

You were here a moment ago!
Good to see you, Mr. Ando.
It's been a long time!
Would you like me to carry your luggage?
No, it's not necessary, thank you.
It's an object of great value from a client
and it's actually a bit heavy.
Well, what's really heavy is the frame, which is gold.
The painting was a reproduction.
I have finished the appraisal and now I have to go back to my client,
who lives in Nagoya.
And now!
But the Mystery Train doesn't know where it's going!
How do you know it will arrive in Nagoya?
Good morning to all of you.
It's not so difficult to know where we're going.
And we are not dupes.
We all know that we only have to check the trains
that have had to change their schedule today.
-Yes, of course.
-It's relatively easy to know.
For us, what stimulates us intellectually...
are the mysteries of travel, basically.
Isn't that right, Sumitomo?
Yes, ma'am.
Co... as you can tell you're regular customers!
I beg your pardon.
Hey, you!
What's going on here?
I booked compartment B in car 8, the first class,
as I always do.
Why did you put me in car 7?
I'm sorry, Mr. Murobashi.
As we explained to you a few days ago when we called you,
we made a mistake and had a double booking.
That's why we had to change compartments, I'm sorry.
I always book the same compartment because I like it very much,
and it's a bit of a tradition now.
May I know who will take my place this time?
-Eh?
- (Kogoro) Well, look, it's yours truly.
And I'm sorry, really.
But since my daughter is a friend of the owners of the train...
And I'm telling you now that you can rest easy.
So that whatever the case that awaits us on this trip,
Detective Poirot Mouri
is at your disposal to discover the truth.
Nothing.
Father!
But what are you doing?
I am greeting the passengers who will be sharing a carriage with us.
Smoking is forbidden here.
And since when is your name Poirot Mouri?
What do you represent that has been done, of Kogoro?
What-what have you heard me?
Come on, run, they are waiting for us in car 6.
We want to take a photo together before leaving.
Ah, very well.
"I sense a certain tension in the air."
"What do you do? What do you know in Kogoro? Or maybe it's that...?"
That's great!
-Of course not.
-And it doesn't stop at any station, how strong!
This train won't stop until we reach the destination.
Oh, really?
Is that so?
Yes, and we don't know where we're going to stop either.
Eh? (Shinichi voice) To Nagoya.
(Shinichi voice) To Nagoya.
Looking up train schedules on the internet
it's easy to deduce the route this one will take.
"So excited I was about the Mystery Train
and now this one has to spoil it for me!"
Here's something I'm really looking forward to doing.
Participate in the deduction contest
that is organized during the trip.
(Sherry voice) Because I've been told, what they usually do?
is to choose randomly among the passengers
who will play the victim and who will play the murderer.
They simulate a crime and the other passengers are the detectives
who have to solve the case before they get to the destination station.
-Yes?
Who is it?
- (door: knock)
Ui.
Well, there is no one.
"A letter?"
(Train: whistle)
(Conan voice) "Congratulations.
You have been chosen to play the role of detective.
In 10 minutes there will be a murder in compartment B of the train car number 7.
of car number 7 of the train.
(Think) "Didn't you represent that the detectives were all the passengers?"
(Mitsuhiko) Compartment B of car number 7....
Compartment B of car number 7...
(Mitsuhiko) Here.
This must be it.
(Conan voice) Excuse me.
Don't come in!
(Conan) What are you doing?
Can you come in?
Ouch!
How strong!
It seemed real!
-Yes!
-Pursue-lo.
Come on, let's go.
Conan, Ai, mail.
It's like playing touch and stop.
I don't know where they see it, the mystery.
Gee, we've lost sight of it.
Since it's all compartments and there's a lot of them,
she could have gotten into anyone.
Hello, my pretties.
Is this your first time on the Mystery Train?
-Well, you better not be on it too much.
-Yes.
And, if you're interested,
the deduction contest will be announced over the loudspeakers.
What's that?
You mean it hasn't started yet?
No.

Ten minus an hour, at least, or more.
"It can't be. Then it was..."
-Where are you going?
Don't run!
-It's... Hold on, Conan.
- I'm coming.
-Come on, let's go.
(Ayumi) Ouch!
You're not coming?
Come on, let's go.
Yes.
"Oops! What if it turns out...?"
Hi, Conan.
What's wrong?
Before you go into a girl's compartment, you could knock on the door, right?
It's just that... This is car number 7, isn't it?
-What are you talking about, man!
It's number 8.
-What?
I've just arrived, I've come to pay a visit.
I don't understand anything.
I was convinced I hadn't miscounted it.
Yeah, but it's normal,
because the number of each carriage is only written on the outside,
and on the door of each compartment there is only one letter of the alphabet.
-Hey?
-Guys.
How was the deduction contest?
Doctor Agasa, is this our compartment?
We're in car 6?
What? -What?
Yes.
Look.
If there's still the potatoes you were eating a while ago.
-It doesn't add up.
-Hey, Conan...
But this car is what comes after car 8!
"Car 7..."
"Car 7... has disappeared while the train was running?"
(Reviewer) That car 7 has disappeared?
What nonsense, man!
(Genta) Just a moment ago we saw somebody
who was shooting a man in this car.
The culprit ran away and we chased her immediately,
but we ended up losing sight of him.
And when we went back to car 7 to see the victim, we went straight to car 8,
we went straight to car 8.
What... he was shot?
But why didn't you come and explain it to me right away?
to me or to some other conductor?
Because we thought what we saw was part of the contest.
Please, you'll have to check.
Car 7 has vanished.
Along with the victim.
What you need to do is talk to every conductor on the train one by one.
You'll find one in each car, sitting at the end of the aisle, just like me.
Don't worry, I'm sure you've got confused.
The carriages do not have the number written on the inside of the carriage
at the express request of the owners.
From the owners?
Yes, but it is also true that, because of that,
many passengers get lost,
and that gives all the inspectors a lot of work.
Have they called me?
Do you need anything?
I see that you can alert the conductor by pressing a buzzer
that turns on the light on the compartment door.
How cool!
Then I want to try it myself!
But first we have to find car 7. Come on, let's go, let's go.
Yes, of course.
-It's nothing...
-What's wrong?
You don't feel well?
-Come on, let's go.
-I've already taken the medicine.
"The man just a moment ago had a burn."
"But what about the burn? What's going on here?"
Car 7?
Is this really car 7?
Yes, it is.
Now it will turn out that it has reappeared as if nothing happened.
-It's just as well, that, now.
-But how can it be?
Of course it is.
We're going back to compartment B, quickly.
Yes.
I open it, eh?
What the...?
Listen, are you sure it's not in...?
No, it's not, it's car number 8, heavy!
Please don't make us more dizzy and go back to your car.
But how can it be?
Such is the conductor, he's confused.
Yes, he sure is.
Don't you see how he yawns?
"No, wait. Wait a minute." I'd say before..."
"Oh... What if...?"
You're a pain in the ass, you know that?
Whatever you say, this is compartment B of car number 7,
isn't it?
No, man!
Because you also received one, didn't you?
One of these letters.
And I suppose that now you are representing what you have been asked for.
You had to exchange the compartment temporarily
with the man who played the victim
and trick the detectives who came to mislead them.
Isn't that right?
That's right.
That's awesome.
All right, Conan!
Someone knocked on the door
and, when I opened it, I found an envelope on the floor.
I read the note and it said:
"Congratulations. You have been chosen to play the role of an accomplice".
And then everything went just as you said.
We were told that it was compartment B in car 7 who was playing the victim,
and they asked us to swap roles.

To make the contest more exciting.
"You're mad at me because I got it right?"
Yes, I was passing by when the Ran and the Sonoko?
exchanged with the man who played the victim,
and I thought I could join the little group.
Anyway, right now the victim...
must be relaxing in the compartment of car 8.
And in Kogoro?
Where is he?
He talked to the victim and went to the restaurant car.
Why, in the restaurant?
Because I wanted him to play the detective at the end
and explain the solution of the contest.
That's why she asked him to wait there.
Ah.
Changing the subject, nice to meet you.
You're the Haibara, right?
What's that?
You don't know how much I've been looking forward to talking to you for once.
"So... what if it's...?"
"No... It can't be."
Who are you?
What's the matter?
It seemed to me that someone was looking at us through the crack in the door.
I must have guessed.
Wow, excellent wine and food.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Mm?
What's burning?
(Reviewer) You've already solved the disappearance of the corpse?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
But if the contest that we will do has not even been announced yet!
But I have received this letter.
-Let's see?
-And we got this one.
Yes, they are the same as the instruction cards we use,
but... as far as I know,
the contest we're organizing this time is not this one.
Gee, I don't understand anything at all.
What we can do is go to carriage number 8
and talk to the man who plays the victim and see what he knows.
-I have to go there too.
-I have to go to the toilet first.
(Shinichi voice) What's the matter, Haibara?
(Sherry's voice) Don't you feel a strange presence?
I don't know, some kind of threat.
This only happens to you for reading so many Agatha Christie novels.
"I notice it, and it's not just one, there are more."
Mr. Noto, do you need something?
Mr. Noto.
Mr. Noto.
-What do you want, heavy?
-Ah!
-What?
-I didn't call you for nothing.
-It wasn't me.
-Ah.
It's just that... it seemed to me...
Gee, boy, when you ask for them, they don't sell, and when you don't fly them at all, they sell to annoy,
they sell to bother.
(Reviewer) I'm very sorry.
Yes, yes, it's nothing.
It's the side compartment;
it seems that the conductor has confused the door.
-Ah!
Yes, I'm coming!
- (compartment: bell)
Miss Idenami.
Let's see if we can react faster!
-Don't you feel it, you, or what?
-But... but what do you mean?
There's a noise in this compartment.
Ah...
-A moment ago, you could feel it.
-Do... Well, I don't feel anything.
What's the matter?
Are you accusing me of lying now, or what?
(Reviewer) No, I would never think of it.
(Acoustic signal: pip-pip)
-Yes.
-You see?
That's it.
Do you feel it or not?
It must be a cell phone that someone has left behind, or some electronic device.
Excuse me...
But don't go in, man!
I'll look for it.
- (pip-pip)
-All right...
What I would like to know is how is it possible
that I didn't find it before I put the train in motion, this mobile.
I don't know.
And I apologize.
Excuse me, what's wrong?
Here we are.
Our compartment.
Listen, sir.
The whole scam's been exposed.
Come out and show your face.
What are you doing? What are you doing?
What do you want to bet he's put our...?
What's going on?
What's going on? Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?
Please wake up and open the door for us.
What's going on? What's going on?
Am I being or not?
That the very ill-mannered man has taken a nap.
And there's blood coming out of his head.
You'd think he was dead.
But I guess it's because of this contest of deductions.
(Let me through.
(Sera) Gunpowder.
Smells like...
(Sera) Come on.
Let's open the door.
(Conan) What?
One, two..., three!
-Is that part of the contest too?
That's loud!
No, guys... Now he's really dead.
What?
"A murder...
in a locked compartment."

I will personally see to it
that the truth about this cruel murder case comes out.
Vermouth just sent me a message.
She confirms that Sherry is inside the train.
(Ai) "What do I do?"
"If it turns out that the Men in Black are the train and they come looking for me,
maybe... maybe not anymore..."
"Don't miss the next episode:
The Mystery Train, (The Tunnel)."
