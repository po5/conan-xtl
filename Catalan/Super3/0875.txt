Ahem!
Let's get down to business.
Why don't you show me this mysterious Buddha statue?
so mysterious?
Yes.
Come with me.
Inside this altar is the statue of the 11-faced Kannon.
And does it say that, just like that, and without anyone touching it,
the statue turns sideways or backwards on its own?
Yes.
If this is true, it is quite a mystery, there is no denying it.
-Mm?
-Of course it's true!
Besides, it has been proven...
that every time he turns around some misfortune happens.
Very well, let him take a look.
Right away.
-Oh, it can't be!
What are we going to do now?
-Ah!
Does this mean that a misfortune will happen again?
(Shinichi voice) "The curtain rises and the main character appears."
"He solves the mysteries by doing a beautiful dance."
"We are facing a very strange case: a statue of Buddha that spins by itself."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult...
and he's... Detective Conan!"
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
Why?

"The mysterious prophetic Buddha statue"
Mm... Well, I don't see anything strange about it, really.
But this time you don't need to worry,
because you're lucky that I'm here and, if something happens,
I will be able to solve it.
(birds: chirping)
- (all) Oh!
- (man) I don't want to see you again!
-(man) Ah!
-Get out!
You spend the day loafing, instead of working.
And now, on top of that, you're dressing me like a thief?
-It was just a loan, damn it!
-But what did you think?!
And, anyway, it's the money of the faithful of the temple.
Don't think you're the one who knows what.
-Of course!
-If it was a loan, return the money.
As long as I get them back, everything's fine, right?
I don't want to see them anymore either!
What do you think you're doing?!
I'm sorry you had to witness this scene.
It's my father and my brother.
Your father said that your brother spends all day loafing around.
He went to the main temple to train
so he could take over for his father when he retired,
but after less than a month he was back here again.
After that he has not resumed his studies nor has he looked for work.
The only thing he does is to go with bad company.
(Yuka) It's in Junko.
He does ascetic practices.
(Water murmuring)
Hello, Junko.
I'd like to introduce you to Detective Kogoro Mouri, Ran and Conan.
How do you do?
They're from Tokyo.
My name is Junko.
How do you do?
Welcome to the temple.
Junko, we just looked at it...
and the statue has turned its back.
-Oh!
-I hope there's no misfortune.
I hope so, too.
(Crickets: rich-rich)
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
How nice, thank you very much.
But I'm sorry to start the meal before the priest comes.
Father will dine only after he finishes reciting the sutras.
As if you were at home, please.
You cook too, don't you, Junko?
It's part of the training as a priest.
In fact, I have to admit that you cook much better than I do, actually.
You're right... but it's nothing to be proud of.
Oh, Father, may I present Detective Kogoro Mouri,
who has come all the way from Tokyo.
He will investigate the case of the 11-faced Kannon.
For Buddha to warn us that a misfortune is about to happen
does not require any kind of investigation.
There was no need for a detective to come here specifically.
So you can go now.
Yuka..., Junko...
It's already decided, your wedding will be in September.
I'm going to recite the evening sutras.
-No, that's not necessary.
-I'll go with you, then.
Talk about the wedding with Yuka.
Ah...
Eh?
Come on, Conan, Ran, eat.
I'm sorry...
He's not a bad person, but he's stubborn as a ram's horn.
Ah...!
Ha-ha!
What a feast!
You've been given to us by a temple worshipper.
Thank you, Conan.
Conan, take one.
Don't you want one, Ran?

No, it's just... I can't.
If I eat more, I'll get fat.
Young girls worry about these things.
I did too, when I was your age.
What's the matter?
Mother, you're not giving her any food today?
Oh... Yes.
I'll come later, we have guests today.
No, it's not a pet.
Do you have a pet?
But later, if you come with me, you can see it.
Eh?
Well, what will it be?
And a question:
what misfortunes has the Buddha statue warned you about so far?
Last year, a person went to harvest plants and a bone attacked her.
Yes.
And she was lucky, because it didn't kill her.
They say that it had probably just woken up from hibernation
and, as it was still snowy, it couldn't find food.
Before that, after a typhoon,
when we thought we were safe,
there was a landslide and a house collapsed.
And both times the statue had turned?
(Gong, from a distance)
Right now I will prepare the mattresses for you so that I can sleep.
Hey, father, shouldn't you stop drinking and eat something?
Don't worry, just watch TV for a while.
Come to think of it, if the next evening, Father....
Maybe he's entertained praying for the happiness
of this wonderful young couple who are getting married this year.
(Both) Oh...
Mm...
Aaa...
Father...
Come on, go, you should bathe and go to bed.
Tonight I'm not horned...
You see what happens, if you drink so much?
How should I tell you?
You don't know how embarrassed you make me feel sometimes!
(Woman) Aaaah...!
Come on, go to bed.
(Woman) What's the matter?
(Woman) Eh?
(Woman) Eh?
(Woman) Mm.
Everybody get back!
Kogoro...
She's been stabbed, not too long ago.
It's been a few minutes and that's enough.
Ran, call an ambulance and the police too.
Yes!
(Shinichi, thinks) "There's no sign of a struggle."
(Conan voice) Kogoro..., look.
It looks like she's been moved recently, doesn't it?
(Shinichi, thinks) "And this here, what is it?"
Mm?
It says, after the priest came here to recite the sutras,
they've been all the time together, right?
Yes.
Until 8 o'clock, when the bell rang, we were all together.
Most likely someone forced the door,
broke in and killed him.
The Scientifics have checked the front door and the windows,
and they couldn't find any indication anywhere that anyone broke in.
I see.
I'm not surprised either.
Because, if a stranger had entered,
the priest would have stopped reciting the sutras
and would have reacted in some way.
What's that?
What is that?
I would say that in this golden light there is something stuck.
Stop it!
How should I tell you, don't interfere with the investigations?
Well, yes, it's adhesive tape.
It was stuck to the inside left side.
(Motorcycle: stops)
(Boy) Who are you?
And who are you?
What are you doing in my house?
-I am the son of the priest of the temple.
-And what is your name?
-What's the matter?
Have you come in to steal?
- Eizen!
The... the... the father...
Can you tell me what happened?
I'm sorry to inform you that your father has been murdered.
Would you be so kind as to explain to me where he came from?
Where have you been?
I was meeting a friend...
-My name is Kogoro Mouri and I'm a detective.
-Who are you, by the way?
Could you tell us the name of this friend you say you've been with?
And why should I tell you, as they say?
This afternoon we saw how your father rebuked you.
He told you to give him back the money, you said you would do it,
and he left in a rage.
If he couldn't pay you back, I'd have a good reason to kill him.
He said it in jest, that's what!
I borrowed some money, but only 300,000 yen.
You want me to kill my father for such a ridiculous amount?
-Manami Sakurai.
-What's your friend's name?
She works as a waitress at a place called Romance.
After I went there for a few days, I accumulated a debt...
and I borrowed some money that was for repairs to the temple.
(Shinichi, think) "The duct tape was to the left of light."
"And on that band..."
What's wrong, Conan?
What was that?
I just saw an animal go by.

Ah, it's a raccoon, the animal we were talking about before.
The mother comes to feed it every day, when it gets dark.
Ah, it looks like it lives in the mountains.
It looks like it lives in the mountains,
near the waterfall path, in a thicket area.
Oh!
(Gong)
So much so.
Isn't it?
Oh, what a surprise!
It's an automatic hammer.
Father and Junko, from time to time...
Eh?
From time to time they would meet with the temple faithful and....
(Shinichi, thinks) "Mm?"
"What is this?"
Yes, thank you very much.
Goodbye.
I just got confirmation that Eizen Fukuhara
has been at a place called Romance until about 30 minutes ago.
You see?
I was telling you, I had an alibi.
I don't know why they suspect me.
Mm?
Kogoro, look at this for a moment.
I found it near the raccoon's den.
Conan, stay out of it, now, man!
Let me be, now, I'm busy.
But I think it's important.
Eh?
Come on, let's go!
The raccoon comes to look for food every day by the bell.
Eh?
What does that mean?
It turns out that this bell rings automatically.
Before, when we were in the dining room, we felt it, right?
Yes... And what's the significance of that?
Well, I think that the raccoon has found the sausage here
and has taken it to its burrow.
Yeah, right, so what?
Of course he did!
Wow, you, now I understand!
The person who killed Mr. Fukuhara
did not have to enter the main building to commit the crime.
Therefore, in this case, having an alibi is useless.
The Eizen Fukuhara could also have committed the crime.
-What do you mean by this?
- (all) Eh?
I'll tell you now.
The murderer has placed the sausage on this side of the chain,
in the direction the hammer moves to ring the bell.
He has passed the string through the hole,
stretched it out to the window and brought it inside the temple.
Then he passed it through one of the canopies of the lamp,
and taped a knife to the end with adhesive tape.
When the automatic system pushed the hammer forward,
it pulled the string and automatically the knife fell out.
When the sausage fell, the raccoon took it to the fall....
and eliminated the evidence that gave away the strategy that had been used.
With this method, it would not be necessary for the murderer to be present.
That is to say, both those who were in the temple and those who were not,
all are suspects in this murder, without exception.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Yes, of course, he's right."
"But..."
But... the person who has killed Mr. Fukuhara is....
Junko Wakuda.
Yes, you!
Can you tell me how you are so sure?
It can only have been someone who has constant access to the temple,
to prepare the sutra books or make offerings, for example.
So, it must have been at Junko.
Mm?
Yes, it was me.
And I did it just as Mr. Mouri explained.
What are you saying?!
And why, why did you kill her?
Because... I happen to be engaged to a girl.
But he insisted and insisted that I had to marry Yuka.
At first I wanted to refuse, but considering...
considering everything he had done for me, I didn't dare.
As time went by, and seeing that I didn't object,
she understood that I agreed,
and today he has already set a date.
It was all my fault, then.
I could have refused too, I should have refused the wedding.
I suspected that Junko didn't agree, but...
but all I wanted was for the father not to get angry.
Well, you could have said no!
Even if he was angry, you could always leave the temple!
I had no intention of killing him, really.
I just wanted to scare him and then tell him that,
since there were misfortunes happening in the temple...,
I had decided to stop my training here.
That is why I myself have turned the statue of the Kannon.
It was me!
And I also moved the tablet a little bit from its place
to prevent the knife from touching it when it fell.
Mm?
Listen...
Kogoro told me to ask you if I could...
Mr. Mouri?
He says he wants me to make a knife fall
from the exact spot where the duct tape was stuck.

Well, if Mr. Mouri asks me to do it...
I guess we'll have to do it.
Attention...
(Shinichi, think) "I thought so."
"With this trick it was impossible to kill him."
Officer, is this white powder from when they dusted for prints?
No, it's not.
We just examined it and it's rice flour.
Ah.
Huh?
Mr. Wakuda, you'll just explain it to us at the station.
-(Yuka) Huh?
- (Yuka) Junko...
The other times did you turn it, too, 11-sided Kannon?
No, not the other times.
Just today.
(Yuka) Mm?
Bah...
Eh ?!
Oh..., ouch, ouch...
(Kogoro voice) Wait a moment.
It's true that Junko has used the trick we've said
to scare off Mr. Fukuhara.
But it can't be said in any way that he killed her.
-Oh...
-What are you saying now?!
In fact, it is impossible to kill a person with this method.
Even if he had been right, he would have been wounded at best.
So, who is the murderer?
Who killed her?
Explain yourself!
(Kogoro voice) Mrs. Masako Fukuhara..., his wife.
You saw how Junko was preparing her trick, didn't you?
And he wanted to take the blame for the crime on himself.
May I know what's going on now?!
Liar!
(Voice Kogoro) Near the body, on one side of the tablet,
the police have found rice flour.
At dinner time, the only ones who have eaten a "mochi" for dessert?
were you and Conan.
If the tablet had been soiled
before Mr. Fukuhara started reciting the sutras,
I'm sure he would have cleaned it.
The murderer is the only person who could have left the flour.
-Oh!
-She's right...
I was really fed up!
I couldn't stand it anymore!
That's why I killed him!
He always called and grumbled
when things didn't go his way...
He always had to pass his,
even in the most insignificant things.
He complained about everything, like he was who knows what!
He treated us like slaves and wanted to control absolutely everything.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I finally got rid of him.
I'm glad he's dead!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-Others, father...
-But, mother...
(Masako: laughter)

I'm sorry for involving you in all this.
Don't talk nonsense.
It's you, making us suffer, now.
And we haven't helped you much, either, because we haven't been able to solve...
the mystery of the statue that turns by itself.
Ah!
Well, I've known it from the very beginning.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
The statue only turns around after an episode of heavy rainfall
or when the snow melts, right?
"Well, it's because when the amount of water in the waterfall increases,
"the low-frequency sound waves it generates,
"cause the air inside the altar to vibrate
and gradually displacing the figure."
Wow, that's why!
Ha!
You know a lot of funny stuff, you, man.
It's just that I made a call to Shinichi
and he said that's probably why.
Wow, Shinichi!
And why didn't you solve the case here, instead of talking on the phone?
(Shinichi, think) "Mm.... That's just what he's done."
-Ah!
-Here we have the laboratory.
It's the... It's my poor robot.
Poor thing.
I'd rather say.
No one really understands what he's up to.
-I think it's Mr. Tanizaki.
-Who do you think is more suspicious?
(Alarm)
Kazuomi, turn off the gas tap.
-Next.
-Fumika, call an ambulance!
Don't miss the next episode: "The mechanical witness".
