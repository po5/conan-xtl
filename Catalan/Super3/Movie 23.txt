(Waves: murmur)
(Seagulls: shriek)
-Thank you.
-Here, the towel.
Have you been waiting long?
It's a strange place to have a meeting.
We'd better not talk too loud, I wouldn't want anyone to feel us.
In a public place like this you won't do strange things, will you?
I don't know why you say that.
Anyone would say I want to hurt you.
Wouldn't they?
You and I have built a good relationship of friendship.
I wouldn't say we're friends.
I just want to know your answer to the proposal I made to you.
Is it yes or no?
Before I give you an answer,
let me try to guess what you ordered to drink.
Not an iced tea.
More like a glass of champagne.
Or maybe wine.
You ordered white wine.
A chilled Meursault.
Your Meursault, mademoiselle.
H... how could you guess?
Because I read your mind.
-I don't want it anymore.
-Mademoiselle.
-What do you want?
-Oh, by the way.
The answer is "no."
Thanks for the help.
(Elevator: female voice) "Closing doors."
"Ground floor."
(Elevator: acoustic signal)
Hey, are you all right?
(Woman: shrieks)
- (Woman: shrieks)
- (man) What happened?
-What?
- (alarm)
- (panicked screams)
- (alarm)
(Man) Stay calm, please.
Follow instructions.
(Shouting)
(Woman) What's going on?!
- (woman) Help!
-You, wait!
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm preserving the crime scene before they step on all the evidence.
Is that all right with you?
(Police: sirens)
-Where's the man I sent for? -Where's the man I sent for?
-Inspector.
-Thank you.
-He's here, he's inside.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Rishi.
Inspector Aidan!
Thank you for alerting me.
The incident took place in the shopping mall up ahead.
Everything indicates that it's going to be a complicated case.
The person who found the body is him, Leon Lowe,
Ah, Mr. Lowe!
If I understand correctly, you were his favorite student.
Could you ask him not to interfere in the investigation?
I can't ask you that, Inspector.
I'll go say hello.
-Gosh, Rishi! -Mr. Lowe!
-Mr Lowe!
-Oh, so long.
-I haven't seen you in a while. -Okay.
-Okay.
-We don't draw attention to ourselves.
I hear you're now working for the police as a backup officer.
I see you've come a long way.
You were my teacher
and taught me everything I know
about criminal psychology, Professor Lowe.
You don't need to call me "professor".
He thinks I'm just a random civilian now.
Oh, by the way, it looks like the culprit also exploded a bomb.
The car that exploded belonged to the victim, Miss Sherilyn Tan.
I know her, she was a brilliant lawyer.
There must have been a lot of people who envied her,
and she had dangerous acquaintances.
(Aidan) Excuse me.
Will you let me through?
(Aidan) What happened?
There's something on the elevator wall.
(Aidan) What?!
(Aidan) What is it?
(man) Come in.
Come in, Mr. Lowe.
(Woman) What is it?
(Woman) Oh!
It's blood!
The Merlion is spitting blood!
(woman) My God!
But how can it be?!
(Pen: opens and closes)
(Shinichi voice) I beg you please!
It can't be.
Please! I said it can't be.
I said it can't be.
What's wrong with you two?
He wants to use that medicine again to get his looks back.
Don't you remember what happened last time,
during the school trip?
Yes, but we turned out pretty well in the end!
It's all right.
I said no!
Give me the medicine!
-A Singapore.
-Where do you want to go, may I ask? -Where do you want to go?
Look, doctor!
The man of 400 consecutive victories will participate!
Oh, so much!
In Makoto Kyogoku!
Do you know who I mean?
Sonoko said she's got tickets for the tournament.
The Ran and Mr. Mouri are going too, of course,
and they've invited me to accompany them,
but with this passport I can't leave the country.
Of course, the passport is issued in Shinichi's name.
What a pain in the ass!
Do me this favor, Haibara!
Come on, let's go!
I think you'd better let it go.
It's just that I wanted to go!
Don't take it like that, man!
If you want to have fun, here's a riddle!
The Asian riddle!
Eh?

We are off to an early start!
Let's see if you can guess what is the most popular ceremony in Singapore.
One: The singing of the anthem.
Two: The raising of the flag.
Three: The Lunar New Year.
Four: The Marina Bay fireworks competition.
The answer is very easy.
I don't understand what he's dressed up as.
It's three, the lunar new year.
So that the Singapore flag has a moon on it.
(Agasa) Correct answer!
I knew the correct answer.
Enough.
Come on, want another riddle?
Eh? (Agasa)
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
What happens is that I get bored a lot, when the children are not...
Coi de Haibara...
(Conan voice) Ran... Uh... Hey, hello, Ran.
What are you doing here at this hour?
(Conan voice) Eh?
Ran... What's wrong with you...?
Nothing's wrong with me.
I've been waiting for you for a while.
"Where am I?"
(From afar) It's huge!
"It's the voice of the Ran! Where did I end up?"
"I'm locked up somewhere! Shit!"
"This'll do me."
The... Merlion?
Soc... in Singapore!

DETECTIVE CONAN.
THE BLUE SAPPHIRE FIST
"I am Detective Shinichi Kudo."
"One day, I went to the amusement park with Ran Mouri.
"my best friend and classmate,
"And I witnessed a suspicious exchange
between two men dressed in black."
"I was so focused on watching those two men,
that I didn't realize there was another one behind me."
"He made me swallow a poison,
"And when I woke up...
my body had shrunk!"
"If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
they would want to kill me and the lives of those around me would be in danger."
"That's why Dr. Agasa recommended that I hide my identity.
to hide my identity."
"When the Ran asked me what my name was,
I randomly told him I called myself Conan Edogawa."
"Since Ran's father is a detective,
"I went to live with them
to try to get information about the Men in Black."
"My big rival is this man, in Kaito Kid."
"He is a thief of unknown identity
and a virtuoso of disguises."
"He is very cunning and, although I don't know how, he found out who I am."
"Someday I'll catch her!"
"In Makoto Kyogoku is the Kid's worst enemy."
"He is a high school student
and a karate pro who has won 400 fights in a row."
"He's madly in love with Sonoko Suzuki,
Ran's classmate."
What are you looking at?
Come on, say what you always say!
I'm small, but I have the brains of an adult.
A detective who solves all mysteries!
The truth... always comes out in the end!
"My hands!"
"I'm not wearing the doctor's inventions. Wait a minute!"
"I heard the Ran's voice."
(Conan's voice) Ran, wait for me!
It's huge!
What?!
Ah, Shinichi!
Come, come!
Excuse me, girls!
I know I'm late.
Where have you been?
We've been looking for you for a long time.
Your father couldn't stand the heat anymore
and I've taken him to the shade of a tree.
Ah!
How nice of you, thank you.
Your father is a case, he will never change!
Ran, beautiful!
Will you buy me a bottle of water?
Hm?
Eh?
Yes, what a remedy.
Will you come with me?
Yes.
Come on, hurry up!
Mi-te, this pair!
They're well in love.
"He'll pay me back!"
Ah!
I'm a new man!
Hey, hey, hey!
What's this around your neck, father?
What's that?
Ah, that?
It's a cover to protect my passport.
To keep it from getting lost or stolen.
It's a good idea, isn't it?
You're exaggerating!
You didn't have to take so many precautions.
Singapore is a safe country.
What, you woke up already?
I knew it was you!
I'm intrigued: how did you get out of the suitcase?
With it.
I used the tip of the pen.
If you put it between the zipper, you can open it from the inside.
If I knew that, I'd take your pen too.
I can't lose track of you for a second!
That's more like it, Kaito Kid!
Look, it's here.
And now, tell me, what's a head door?
It seems to me that it's crystal clear.
I want to go there.
What is it?
"The tournament of the Sonoko!"
At the end of the 19th century,
off the coast of Singapore, a pirate ship was shipwrecked...
"...which was carrying a legendary treasure:

the world's largest blue sapphire,
called Blue Fist."
"Last year,
in Zhonhan Chen recovered the great jewel from the bottom of the sea."
"In Zhonhan Chen? The most powerful tycoon in Singapore?"
"Yes, and also a big fan of martial arts."
"He's organized a karate championship in which the winner will take away
a belt with the blue sapphire embedded in it."
"You mean the champion will get the legendary jewel?"
The rich don't know what to make up anymore.
I see you haven't understood.
I intend to sneak into the championship
and camouflage myself among the crowd to steal the jewel,
but with the Kid's identity they wouldn't have let me into the country.
But if you just wanted to steal the jewel,
you didn't need to bring me here.
This time I will do it a little differently.
Anyway, I'll tell you about it little by little.
What?
How can you...!
Shinichi, where are you?
I'm leaving, they're calling me.
Gee, he's disappeared again.
Wait, Kid!
If you hurt the Ran, I assure you, you'll regret it.
I'm sorry, but I can't guarantee the Ran's safety.
Oh, you can't?
Then I'll tell on you in front of everyone right now.
If I were you, I would think it over.
I remind you that you were able to enter the country
because you were traveling hidden in this suitcase.
"It's made of a material that blocks X-ray detectors."
"In addition, it's equipped with an oxygen dispenser.
"With 12 hours of autonomy
"And a specially designed inner lining
to comfortably withstand a long trip."
I'm sure you know what that means, this..., detective.
Since you don't have a passport,
you'll need my help to get out of the country.
Otherwise, you won't be able to return home.
Shinichi, you were here!
What a skill you have for making tea vanish when you least expect it...
Oh!
The... the little boy with the glasses!
What are you doing here?
I ran away.
Conan!
(Shinichi voice) Yes, they look very much alike, don't they?
But this is a Singaporean boy, he's from here.
Really?!
How strong!
"They're very easily fooled, these two."
Ep, boy.
What's your name?
By the way, do you speak my language?
Well, my name is...
This boy...
Arthur!
My name is Arthur Hirai, nice to meet you.
Arthur Hirai, you say?
Yes, it's just that my mother is Japanese and my father is...
And I'm Ran Mouri.
My name is Sonoko Suzuki.
And that gentleman sitting down there
is my father, in Kogoro Mouri.
Yes... Yes, likewise.
Nice to meet you.
Ran.
I have to go, I'm meeting someone.
I'm sorry.
Yes, it's okay.
About that... What aren't they, your parents?
Is that... are traveling in Japan.
What?!
They've gone on a trip and left you home alone?
Mm-hm.
But don't worry, I'm used to it.
You're used to it?
What do you say?
Do you want to come for a ride with us?
Oh, I'd love to!
Can I come along?
Oh, by the way.
I'm going for a moment to see what the father is doing.
So far.
(Sonoko) Wow, he's really late!
At least he could have sent me a message...
We were supposed to meet here, so I didn't go to the wrong place.
(Man) Come on, get out of the way.
-What are you looking at, huh?
-Out, out.
Who must be those guys?
I swear the one in the middle is Reijiro Nakatomi.
Nakatomi...?
Ah, yes, the president of the shipping company!
They say he's a great businessman, but he's got a bad reputation.
Hello, beautiful.
Did you come to Singapore alone?
-Do you want me to accompany you to...?
-Mm?
I don't have time for sightseeing now, leave me alone.
Are you sure you want me to go?
If you feel like it,
just get in my car alone and I'll take you wherever you want.
Sonoko!
You won't need anyone to help you.
Shinichi?
Eh?
Oh!
Hey! (man: call)
- (man: call)
- (punching)
This girl had a date with me.
(man) All right?
But... what's with you?
You could check your cell phone once in a while, Makoto!
You're right, I should pay more attention to it.
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
Ah!
You're lost!
It won't stay that way!
Makoto!
I've been scared to death!
Sorry I was late, Sonoko.
Man, that was awesome!
I want to grow up to be like you!

He has, he has, he has!
-You are very brave.
-I congratulate you, karateka.
Come on, go for it!
Mm?
Are you all right, Sonoko?
Yeah, lucky Makoto got here just in time.
It's good to see you again, Makoto.
Me too, oh, so nice to see you.
Who are you?
It's nice to meet you.
Soc Shinichi Kudo.
Makoto Kyogoku.
-Oh...
-Mm?
What's wrong, Makoto?
What's on your mind?
Nothing, it's just that I had the feeling...
that Kudo and I already knew each other before.
And now!
You must have guessed.
Ha-ha-ha!
We've already seen the Merlion, right?
Well, we can go to the hotel now.
-Mm?
-Do you know what's wrong?
Like, you won't be able to participate in the championship?
(Sonoko) Gee, but we came to see you specifically!
(Makoto) I'm sorry.
I was able to enter the championship
because I had received an invitation from a certain person, but...
-(Makoto) Yes.
- (Kid) A sponsor, you mean?
I decided to participate because a lawyer, a certain Sherilyn Tan,
had agreed to take care of travel and accommodation.
The problem is that this woman has died unexpectedly.
Just today I spoke with someone close to her and she told me that in the end
and she told me that, in the end, they have decided to withdraw my sponsorship.
How unfair!
It is clear that in this championship
the strongest karateka in Singapore.
The truth is that I would have been excited to face him.
Let's not talk anymore!
I'll find you a proper sponsor!
-I'll fix it in a jiffy.
-Huh?
"You can tell he comes from a rich family."
That's it, problem solved!
I've got you another invitation so you can participate in the tournament.
-Mm-hm!
-Do you really mean it, Sonoko?
I've booked you a room at the hotel where we sleep.
Yes, how nice!
It'll be like a double date!
(Kogoro) If it's all arranged, we'd better go back to the hotel.
- (man) Mr. Mouri!
-I'd like a cold beer!
-Well... yes.
-You're Kogoro Mouri, right?
Soc en Rishi, police reinforcement officer.
It's a great honor for me to meet you.
Well, you're very kind.
From that... you say you are... a backup officer?
Yes, I'm a specialist in criminal psychology,
and I'm called in from time to time
to assist in some investigations.
Oh, I get it.
Actually, I heard that you were scheduled to come to Singapore...
and I was expecting you.
-Yes.
-You were expecting me here?
Most tourists come here.
Yeah, but why were you ageing for me?
Look, I would like to ask you to give me a hand with a case.
Mm?
Yeah, man!
No thoughts!
I'm on vacation.
About that, Mr. Mouri,
I think you'd better stay close to this man.
Oh, you do?
Why do you say so?
If he befriends a police reinforcement agent,
I'm sure he can take you to the best and cheapest taverns.
Or the casino.
Don't you understand me?
Well, then.
I might be able to help you.
He-he.
Ahem... Okay!
In Kogoro Mouri will make an exception and give you a hand.
It will be a great honor!
"Here we are..."
In Japan, the mother's home country, you are quite a hero,
and I also admire you very much.
Let's get to work.
It turns out that a businessman in town has received this.
Mm?
(All) A notice from the Kaito Kid!
I've just been told that the Suzuki business group
has offered to sponsor at Kyogoku.
-Yes, don't worry.
-Can you defeat him?
Soc can defeat any opponent with one punch.
- (door: knock)
-That's good to know.
-Excuse me.
-Come in.
Mr. Ramanathan has come to see you,
wants to introduce you to someone.
He is early.
Show him into the drawing room, please.
I will.
And where is the Kid?
Sorry, we are still investigating.
In the case of the Sherilyn Tan,
there are also problems with information management.
-Ocupa-te, then.
-I suspect who is responsible.
(Kogoro) Oh, no!
It's extraordinary!
Please behave yourself, Father.
(Kogoro) Father!
(Kogoro) Oh!
Look at that armor!
It's a beauty!
Eh?
Oh!
-No...
What's wrong?
Stop it.
Flights stop at once?
Forgive my father.
I'm very sorry, boy.
He didn't do it expressly.

By the way, what does he do, Leon Lowe?
Professor Lowe is a renowned psychologist specializing in criminal behavior.
specialized in criminal behavior.
He helped the police arrest a group of dangerous criminals.
Wow!
So, he is Singapore's renowned detective.
Two years ago he disassociated himself from the police,
and now he is the president of his own security company.
Professor Lowe taught me everything I know about criminal psychology.
I'm taking over.
And the Kaito Kid ad was addressed to Mr. Lowe?
No, I'll tell you from the beginning.
First of all, look at this.
This is the jewel that the Kaito Kid wants to steal,
the sapphire that everyone calls Blue Fist.
And that's Zhonhan Chen, its owner.
The Kid's warning was addressed to him.
Well maybe we should have gone to talk to this end Zhonhan Chen.
It turns out that the jewel is kept in that mansion,
under our feet.
-Yes.
-The blue sapphire is down here?
At the express wish of the owner.
Here's a state-of-the-art safe
individually designed safer than any...
State-of-the-art, eh?
If so, maybe even the Kid will have trouble getting in.
"This is what the others usually say..."
What do you say, you, now?
For the Kid there is no impossible safe,
even if it's the most modern in the world!
You know what I'm talking about, Ran!
Hey, Sonoko...
Her sophisticated stealing technique.
She's stolen the hearts of every woman in the world that we've had a chance to...
Eh?
Sonoko, stop!
Oysters!
Well, stolen from my heart and Ran's, of course!
Isn't that right, Ran?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, of course I do.
(Shinichi voice) Now you know how you'll end up if you screw up.
You shut up, you feel?
Yeah, that's right.
What a beautiful courtyard!
(Lowe) Welcome to my home.
Soc at Leon Lowe's.
If you don't mind,
I will be accompanied by my bodyguard and head of security,
Mr. Heazry Jamaluddin.
Makoto Kyogoku.
-Thank you.
-I was looking forward to meeting you.
-And was Hoping to see you.
I'm a karateka too.
I've always wanted to fight with you.
I have a gym...
Hey!
Aren't you the famous detective Kogoro Mouri?
Myself, at your service.
Wow!
I didn't imagine you'd know me so far from home.
"How strange."
-I don't notice anything.
-Huh?
Don't they say hello like that here?
Do they?
Oh... No, that's impossible.
And you must be the famous teenage detective Shinichi Kudo.
That's me.
You don't look like a detective, you look more like a magician.
What?!
I'm talking about your fingers.
They're slender and nimble.
That's because we detectives don't fight with our hands,
but with this one we have in here.
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, boy!
And that lady down there must be Sonoko Suzuki.
"We can't let our guard down against them."
(Rachel) You can't go in.
Please wait.
It's all right, don't suffer.
(Rachel) Gee!
The great Kogoro Mouri!
Both my wife and I are big fans of his!
Ah, yes...
-A photo?
-May I take a picture with you?
I'm sorry, he just showed up unannounced.
Don't worry about it.
I'd like to show the safe to the guests.
Good idea, I'll be happy to accompany you,
so they'll have a chance to see the Blue Fist up close.
Behind this door is my great pride and joy, the safe.
There are very few people who are authorized to access it.
The walls are covered with a heat-resistant alloy and are indestructible.
and are indestructible.
-Nothing, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
-What?
And each safe is programmed to change position periodically.
This safe is unique in the world
because I designed it myself to my ideal.
-Stand back a little bit, please. -What?
-What... what is it?
This is the jewel called Blue Fist,
the badge that credited the king of pirates.
Do you see it well, Arthur?
It's a huge blue sapphire!
Yes, thank you.
There's no doubt about it.
As long as the jewel is in here, not even the Kid will be able to take it.
Yes, but it won't be long.
During the karate championship, which begins tomorrow,
the champion's belt will be displayed before the public.
Therefore, it will be kept in one of the rooms of the stadium...
for the duration of the tournament.

There will be strong security measures, but not as many as here.
Of course there will be.
But there will also be security measures at the stadium.
Oh, sure, we will protect it at all costs.
If the Blue Fist disappears,
you will have to pay me considerable compensation.
He said that, in the stadium, the sapphire will not be as well protected as it is here.
Do you think the Kaito Kid will wait for it to be moved to try to steal it?
-That's right.
-What do you think?
Trying to steal it here would be too risky.
You're right.
I offer to do whatever it takes to help you protect the jewel.
Oh... Thanks, kid.
"That's easy!"
"I have your fingerprints."
It all seems too easy.
(Leon) I've been waiting for you.
The Kaito Kid thief.
I'm not surprised to see you here.
I've been expecting you.
You do trust yourself.
I'm sorry to tell you,
but I won't give you what you came for.
I don't want to have to pay compensation to Zhonhan Chen.
It's my job to steal treasures as valuable as this one.
As it turns out,
the harder the goals I set for myself are to achieve,
the more motivated I am!
Ah!
Ah!
Aaaaaaaah!
That's it.
I hope you like Singapore water.
"I didn't expect him to taser me."
(Gunshots)
- (man) Kid!
- (alarm)
(alarm)
I don't believe this!
What?
(Mobile)
- (man) "It's the Kid!"
-What happened?
Nothing will happen, because I'm always going....
Having class is to plan things
always taking into account the worst that can happen.
...one step ahead.
Hurry, we touch the two here.
It's over there!
Ah!
"What a lunge!"
"If I hadn't had room to back up, I would have stayed."
This is breaking and entering.
Am I wrong?
Am I?
Then what are you doing here?
I came here because I was invited to train at the gym.
I didn't think I'd end up practicing with you.
-I didn't ask you!
-No, no, I don't want to practice!
Hold it!
Get ready!
He's got it!
Oh... A ball?
Where did it come from?
Thank you very much, detective!
It's fantastic!
I can fly even if there's no wind!
I'll have to thank Jii.
Anyway, a moment ago it wasn't so clear...
You saved me!
I see I've done well to return your arsenal just in case.
(Shinichi voice) I didn't save you because I felt like it.
It doesn't matter, but tell me the truth!
At least I want to know why you brought me here.
(Kid) Businessman Leon Lowe had been looking for the Blue Fist for many years.
When he was about to take it from the bottom of the sea,
Zhonhan Chen beat him to it.
Apparently, someone leaked Chen?
the exact location of the wrecked ship.
"The prime suspect is the Sherilyn Tan."
"She had worked for some time
"as a consulting attorney for Lowe's firm,
but they weren't getting anywhere."
"Rumor has it
"that Ms. Tan wanted to sponsor Makoto..."
...to stop Jamaluddin from winning the karate tournament
and the blue sapphire ending up in Leon's hands.
If this part is true,
it would also be Sherilyn Tan
who leaked the information about the shipwreck.
The Sherilyn Tan who has been murdered to death.
If the rumors about the leak are true,
Leon had a motive to kill Sherilyn Tan.
What do you think, police?
Unfortunately, the police have eliminated Leon from the list of suspects.
Why?
Because they have another more likely suspect.
Another suspect?
Although they haven't made it public yet, at the crime scene,
the place where Sherilyn Tan was killed, a note was found.
A notice from the Kaito Kid.
Now I understand it all.
"But... why do I have to contemplate these sights with en Kaito Kid?"
"I would prefer other company..."
It's about time you played the role of Arthur Hirai again.
By the way, I guess the name "Arthur"...
you got it from Arthur Conan Doyle, but where does "Hirai" come from?
Ah.
It turns out that the real name...
in Rampo Edogawa is Taro Hirai.
Of course it is!
You know, don't you, that you were set up and fell for it?
Yes, I know that.
That's why I decided to take you to Singapore, detective.

These things are your specialty.
I understand your motives,
but I don't like the methods you use.
I want to make one thing very clear:
The Kaito Kid has not yet said his last word.
It's about time, isn't it?
I've been waiting for you for a long time.
Have you seen this?
(Shinichi voice) I know, sorry.
What a beautiful view, isn't it?
It's so romantic!
Eh?!
Come on, don't turn red!
It represents that you and I are dating, right?
Yes...
"What? You're together?"
"You bastard!"
"Damn it, Ran! Why don't you realize, he's an impostor?"
"But if I tell him, I won't be able to go home! AIII!"
AAAAAAAAA!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ah!
I couldn't leave Singapore without having tried the "singapore sling".
Another one.
-Huh?
Ah... Who the...?
-Mr. Mouri?
Who are you?
Do you... do you mind if I sit here?
Oh!
No, and now, sit down!
We'll have a little drink together.
-Ah...
-The truth is that I...
-Mm?
-Oh!
Oops!
-What serious!
-Carai!
I don't know how it could have happened.
I'm sorry, really.
No, it's not important.
It happens.
-Mr. Mouri...
-There he is!
-Mm?
-You have a call.
-Mouri, call for you.
A call?
Go get on the phone, Mr. Mouri.
Is it for me?
Who is it?
-What?
-Mr. Mouri!
I have to explain something to you without fail.
-But... but... but... hey!
-I'll wait for you here tomorrow.
Go on...
Let's see...
What a rage, they hung up!
It doesn't matter!
I'll go on drinking!
What about you?
Who do you think will win?
-He hasn't lost a single match!
-In Makoto Kyogoku!
Yes?
Is that so?
I've never heard of it.
If you know how to make the right effort in the right place
and in the right direction, it will pay off.
-Yes!
-Boy, didn't you get it?
(Loudspeaker, woman: Malay words)
(Audience: ovation)
(Sonoko) How cool!
Wow, this Jamaluddin looks like a very strong opponent.
He has the strength of a heavyweight.
He is also fast and has a very good technique.
He will be a tough opponent.
I can tell you're the captain of the karate club.
I analyze all the fighters with a magnifying glass.
Hey, if in the end it's Makoto, who ends up winning the sapphire,
I guess you'll have to write it off, won't you?
Unfortunately.
In fact, I will do my best to stay well away.
Look!
It's already on Makoto!
Come on, cheer up a little!
By the way, what's with this kid, accompanying us everywhere?
(Shinichi voice) I just can't shake him off, girl!
Say hello to each other.
(Shinichi voice) -Start!
(Shinichi voice) -Huh?
-Brutal.
(Voice of Shinichi) -Viva!
- (mobile)
-Makoto, you're the best!
I'd love to come down and say hello!
(mobile) Oh!
It's the father.
I'm telling you, I don't have any dangerous objects on me!
Eh?
Father!
Ran!
What's happened?
You explain to them, see if they understand you.
I have left in the tray all the metal objects.
But look what happens.
(Bow: alarm)
(Bow: alarm) -Not yet?
-It can't happen.
-Bullshit!
-No!
And what happens, that I will never be able to enter?
Mr. Mouri!
Is there a problem?
-It's from the organization.
-Ah, Rishi!
-Yes, sir.
-Let them through.
-It's a pleasure to have helped you.
-Thank you very much, Rishi!
We brought out the sapphire for the opening ceremony...
and now we have it in a room in the basement.
If you'd like to come with me, I'll accompany you to see it.
By the way, what have you been doing so far?
Me... me?
No nothing, I was doing the surveillance round.
"You mean you were sleeping it off."
(Rishi) The secret code changes every 10 minutes.
It updates automatically and we receive the new code by email.
Only Inspector Aidan, myself and Professor Lowe receive it,
the administrator of the safe.
No one else.
(Kogoro) Another completely empty room.
(Rishi) It's not completely empty.
There are motion sensors on the floor and cameras on the ceiling.
Also, the stadium is surrounded by security guards.
(Rishi) Ah!
If that's the case, then that thief won't be able to do anything.
Excuse me, smoking is forbidden.
Ah!

Sorry, I didn't know that.
Eh?
Mm?
I was drunk and had completely forgotten.
He gave it to me last night at the bar.
He wanted to talk to me.
(It was... Mr. Leon's secretary, wasn't it?
(Laughs) What?
Are you serious?
The truth is I'd had too much to drink and I don't remember.
How did you guess, you?
Because on the card is the symbol of Mr. Leon's company.
The symbol, of course.
"At three o'clock, behind the national stadium.
I'll wait for him in front of gate number 3."
She wrote it.
And then she added: "Don't tell anyone."
Understood.
We'll meet again at 3 o'clock, then.
- (Rishi) Mr. Mouri!
-But it's already 3 o'clock!
Keeping a lady waiting is rude!
-Mm?
- (door, open)
A great match, congratulations.
I can't wait to see you in the semifinals and the final tomorrow.
-You have extraordinary strength.
-Thank you very much.
What do you say?
Would you be interested in being my personal bodyguard?
I've got to go now.
Wait, Makoto.
It was a joke, of course.
What I wanted to ask you was something else.
Answer me:
for what purpose do you train them, these fists?
What motivates you to be stronger every day?
What is it that pushes you to continue on this path?
You don't know what to answer, do you?
Immature fists that have no purpose are dangerous.
Not only for yourself.
You will also end up making those around you unhappy.
Those around me?
You mean...?
Yes.
The person you love, for example.
Well, you must have someone.
A girl you love.
You know your fists attract danger,
and your darling could end up taking it badly.
Are you able to imagine it?
Tell me, how would you feel?
I really want to see you fight tomorrow.
-Huh?
What else do you want to tell me?
- (door: knock)
-Hello, Sonoko.
-I wanted to congratulate you.
Since you didn't come, I came to see if you were all right.
I'm sorry it took me so long.
Hey, why don't the three of us go eat together?
There's a restaurant I'd like to try.
I'm sorry, Sonoko.
I won't be able to come eat with you.
I'm sorry, kiddo.
You know what's wrong?
How come?
What's the matter?
Shinichi is guarding the sapphire and can't get out of here.
Of course he can't.
Anyway, what can we do!
You and I will go.
-Yes.
-Right, Makoto?
-See you in a while.
-See you later, Ran!
I want you to eat well and not stay hungry.
- (Sonoko: laughing)
-How you take care of me!
I want you all to keep your eyes open.
If you see anything strange,
let me know and act immediately.
Y... Ah!
Have I done you wrong?
I'm very sorry.
It hurts me too.
Inspector Aidan!
Sorry, I noticed and I could not help it.
Ah... I don't know what it says.
Au, that's it.
Go on with your work.
Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, sir, it's all under control. -Yes, sir.
-Everything all right in the room? -Yes, sir.
-What happened? -What happened?
-Excuse me!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Inspector Aidan says he wants you to go right away.
-I'll keep an eye out in the meantime.
-Now? -Yeah.
But if...
Understood.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back. Thank you.
Let's go, then.
It's time to go treasure hunting.
Oh!
It's already mine.
Eh?
My cape is stuck.
A corpse?!
And it's...
...Rachel!
- (alarm)
-Punyeta!
I've got to get out of here.
(alarm)
"There's some letters in here..." Eh?
Shit!
-Atura't!
-Stop!
Drop the gun, quick!
Kid, you're under arrest!
What?
Boy, you're late, Rachel!
I've been waiting for her for a long time.
(Alarm, far away)
We waited 10 more minutes and... What... what happened?
-What... what happened?
- (alarm)
Hey, wait for me!
It must have been the Kid!
(Alarm)
It's here!
They've got me cornered!
But now lightning!
Once out in the open, I'm already saved!
(Men: shouting)
Blow, there was everywhere!
(men shouting) Eh?
Hey, come back here!
Fucking hell!
-Yes, Inspector!
-Come on, follow him and take me!
Oops, I don't know if they'll come out...
At last!
Mr. Mouri!
He was looking for you!
Yes, my boy!
It took me by surprise too.

Nobody expected the KID to show up in broad daylight...
But don't worry.
I, the great detective Kogoro Mouri, will start looking for him and...
I didn't mean the Kid!
Something much more serious has happened.
I need you to come to the blue sapphire room.
What do you mean?
Look!
There's a huge bird flying in the sky.
They won't be able to follow me here.
Wh... but it's...
The victim is Professor Lowe's secretary, Rachel.
-Mm-hm.
-Rachel, you say? -Mm-hm.
Got it.
Have you checked all the cameras?
No, there's nothing.
They were hacked and they were broadcasting all the time
the same frozen image of the empty room.
-Yes, of course they did.
-Too bad.
Do you have any suspects?
We've committed all our manpower to chase him.
You're already pursuing him?
You mean...?
We are convinced that the culprit is the Kaito Kid.
"On this occasion,
hacking into the security cameras was a serious mistake, Kid."
Something.
At the time the Kid entered the room,
Miss Rachel had arranged to meet Mr. Mouri after the stadium.
How did she end up inside this room?
Yes, that's a good question.
According to the policemen who were guarding the door,
you came to give them an order from Inspector Aidan.
It seemed very urgent, and the inspector's orders are a priority.
Right after that, all that commotion started.
(Kogoro) It's strange.
As far as I know, in Kid had not killed anyone.
Hey, you!
Who gave you permission to enter?
I don't know who you remind me of...
Look, there are some letters written in blood!
Oops!
Come here!
This is not a children's show!
- (Kogoro) Mm...
- (Rishi) What do you think?
"You've fallen on all fours again, Kid."
(Kogoro) Excellent.
Th-this is getting... more and more interesting.
(Makoto) I can tell it's your choice, the restaurant!
I must say, the chicken rice and watermelon juice were delicious.
Wasn't it?
Mm...
Mm?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
No-nothing, it's just that I'm really fed up and I need to go for a walk.
There's a place I'd like to go, you want to join me?
I'll walk you anywhere you want.
Ah! (boy)
- (boy) You're out of food, man.
-Punyeta!
You, girl, at least I hope you'll pay for my lunch.
But... but it was you who bumped into me!
What are you saying!
I don't know what you're saying.
Come here, come here!
(People: exclamations of admiration)
- (man 2) What are you doing?
- (man) What's going on?
(People: scares)
(Shouting)
(Shouting)
They may have more accomplices hiding out there.
-(man) Ah... Yes...
-Sonoko.
Don't move away from me, okay?
Ah! (Lowe) "You know your fists attract danger.
(Lowe) "You know your fists attract danger,
and your darling could end up drinking badly."
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Sonoko!
Uuuuuuuuah!
Son here!
Help, please!
Oh!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Iiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Sonoko!
- (man) She looks alive.
- (woman) Is she all right, the girl?
-Is she a foreigner?
-I'll call the ambulance.
Sonoko!
Sonoko...
-Sonoko!
- (ambulance: siren)
Sonoko!
Sonoko!
What did they tell you?
Are the injuries serious?
The doctor says she's out of danger.
She's sleeping now.
She'll stay in the hospital tonight and tomorrow she'll be examined.
Yes.
Phew!
I'm much calmer now.
Anyway,
when I catch the bastard who ran over her and ran away...!
It was my fault.
Because of me... the Sonoko...
(Rishi) I'm here!
-And now, don't suffer.
-I'm sorry I'm late.
What, the investigation?
Well... it all happened in a quiet alley.
So, there are no witnesses.
Well, there is one witness:
Sonoko, who caught them stealing the patrol car...
and they ran her over.
Oh!
I didn't mean to intrude.
Professor Lowe!
I didn't expect to see you here.
The Sonoko hasn't woken up yet.
I came as soon as I heard.
Give this to her for me when she comes to.
That's very kind of you.
I see my worries were not so unfounded.
Today was a test sent to you by the god of war.
You do not yet possess the mental and physical qualities
necessary to use your fists.

Look, I'll give you a protective amulet.
It's like a lucky bracelet.
When it breaks,
it will be a sign from the gods to tell you that you are now a complete fighter.
But... if you take your fists out for a walk before it breaks,
you know what will happen, don't you?
(Kid voice) Oh, what a pain!
Phew!
(Shinichi voice) You've been badly bruised.
It could have been much worse.
I've been shot without a hair's breadth.
This time I could have stayed.
The police are already saying that Rachel's murder was your doing.
It was all a set-up.
In order to take the fall for you.
Now that would be some real magic.
How could I have killed her if she wasn't there?
But it doesn't matter.
If you tell them I'm the killer,
the public will end up believing I was.
You mean, if you change the point of view,
maybe you'll end up discovering the trick?
Yes.
A magician's job is to
to make believe he's hiding something inside the clenched fist.
The detective has to guess what he's hiding before he opens his hand.
Isn't that right?
Right?
You have to guess what's hidden inside the closed hand, detective.
You have to find out what's inside this so-called "killer" fist.
Come on, look!
Hey, Arthur!
I thought you'd already left.
(Conan voice) Of it... that I could sleep over with you, today?
(Conan) What?
A... in my house, you mean?
It's just that the parents are away and I'm alone.
And, with the things that are happening, I'm very afraid.
The parents will be calmer,
when I tell them that tonight I'll sleep at your place.
"The truth is that I could stand another night sleeping next to you."
(snoring)
How cool!
You say that all these things were given to you by your father?
Yes, sir.
The father was an oceanographer.
He died 5 years ago, unfortunately.
During his scientific research
he found a lot of treasures at the bottom of the sea.
Mm-hm.
You must be very proud of him.
I still have work to do, Arthur,
but you can go to sleep now, if you like.
Yes.
Oops.
Hey, Rishi.
What are these red crosses that are on the map?
Oh, they're for marking...
the places where pirates have attacked a ship.
Oh, of course they are.
There are, though, pirates?
There used to be a lot of them, off the coast of Singapore.
Today, however, what worries me most are not the pirates, but the most recent ones killed,
but the most recent murders.
And in Kaito Kid, of course.
Inspector Aidan has just sent me some documents.
It seems to me that today I will spend the night in white....
(Dart: it sticks)
"Sorry, Rishi, but you'll have to take a nap."
(Sonoko) -Huh?
- (Sonoko) Makoto.
What's this?
-Sonoko!
You woke up!
-I've never seen you before.
-Phew!
-Yes, but it's been a while.
-What's that?
-I'm so glad!
I really mean it.
-Well, yes, we could say so.
-A lucky charm?
Au, come on!
You can't take it off!
You have to replenish, you feel?
I'm not sleepy at all.
I want to take advantage of the fact that I'm in Singapore.
If you force more than necessary, it will be worse.
Tonight you have to stay here.
About that..., I've been wanting to ask you for a long time.
Why don't you ever take this band-aid off your left eyebrow?
The... the band-aid.
The... the band-aid... it's nothing, it's really not.
I thought we weren't supposed to see each other again
until we were all set.
You said your plan was perfect.
Are you absolutely sure?
Mm-hm.
You look tough, but you're really a coward.
Watch what you say or you'll regret it.
I always keep a promise, no doubt about it.
(Camera: Shoot)
(Camera: shoot)
If I'm attacked, fight back.
You could say that's my motto.
(PA: man) "Attention, please."
"In this second semifinal in Makoto Kyogoku has withdrawn."
"And in Tan Lee will go directly to the final."
Shit.
That's not what I wanted.
(Sonoko) You've withdrawn from the tournament?!
(Sonoko) Why?
Because of me?
We have no assurance that the men who attacked us won't return,
that's why I'd rather not move from your side.
Ah... I knew it was my fault.
Go back to the stadium!
Wasn't there a wrestler you wanted to compete with?
Yes.
You know what's wrong?

That yesterday I was not able to protect you,
and now I feel that I'm missing something.
-Huh?
-You're right, you're missing something.
-Secretary?
-You only have secrets.
Tonight I asked you about the bracelet and the band-aid...
and you didn't want to explain.
It's just... It's not important, woman.
It really doesn't.
-What?
-Go away.
I don't want to be protected by a person who only hides things and lies!
You know you made me suffer a lot yesterday?
You didn't answer the phone even once!
(Shinichi voice) You're right, sorry.
I was chasing after the Kid and I couldn't get distracted.
You can tell he's the Silver Moon Wizard.
Not even the great detective Shinichi Kudo was able to.... Aah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Hello, good morning.
Arthur!
What are you doing here?
I hope your friend Sonoko is feeling a little better.
Yes, I stopped by the hospital a while ago,
it looks like the tests have all gone well.
This afternoon she will be discharged and will be able to return to the hotel.
Thank you for asking me about her.
That's great, I'm very happy!
We should go to the hotel.
I'd like to pack my bags.
And you'll leave Sonoko and Makoto alone?
Yes.
It's better if we leave them alone for a while.
It seems to me that they've been arguing about something.
It looks like Makoto has withdrawn from the championship.
You guys!
Shinichi!
(Kid voice) What, detective?
You're going to seize the time last night?
(Conan voice) I looked at the missing investigation reports Rishi.
According to the witness statements,
Sherilyn was not stabbed at the mall where she was found,
but probably in the elevator of Tower 3.
Why did the killer choose an elevator?
In case of necessity, she had no escape.
The victim went all the way to the mall
with the knife stuck in her back.
"Just after he fell to the ground,
his car exploded in the subway parking garage."
"Because of the explosion, the hotel went dark."
If there was no light,
the hotel's surveillance cameras couldn't record any images.
The curious thing is that Leon was the scene of the crime.
It was he who booked his and Sherilyn's room.
But there are many witnesses who claim
that it was in another elevator at the time the lawyer died.
Since he had a confirmed alibi,
he was removed from the list of suspects.
Fair enough.
By the way, how come he was carrying such a big suitcase in Leon?
Ah, the police searched it, of course,
but there was nothing in it.
He said he'd left it to be fixed up
and that he had just picked it up.
The store, which is very close to the hotel,
has confirmed his story.
He has a perfect alibi.
Another thing: this.
Why did the culprit leave a note from me at the crime scene?
What need did he have to implicate me?
And with a bloodstained leaf, to boot.
Besides...
he also wanted to take Rachel's death upon himself.
The murder weapon was the same knife
he'd killed Sherilyn with.
Rachel was already in the cabinet underneath the display case
before I entered the room.
But to get into the room you have to get past the security guards
and overcome many other security measures.
It was someone who was able to bypass the security guards
and sneak in without being detected by the sensors.
It was not me.
Most suspicious, without a doubt, is Leon Lowe.
"He is the administrator of the safe
and knows the security system inside out."
"Also, the belt was moved to the stadium yesterday morning."
"And we know Rachel was alive until the night before last."
"Therefore, he must have killed her...
"Between the night before yesterday and yesterday morning,
before wearing the belt in the stadium."
But for what purpose?
He could have no motive to kill his secretary.
It is possible that he did have a motive, and a strong one.
Rachel wanted to tell Mr. Mouri something.
The only clue we have is the word written in blood.
This "she" means "she".
Who must be "she"?
I can't.
It looks like something extraordinary is about to happen...
But I don't know what.
The great detective can't solve the mystery?
Why don't we take a break and sort out the ideas?
Let's see if you know which hand I've hidden the treasure in.
In the left hand, and it's coconut water.
Because you bought it before.
That's right!
How did you guess?
You got me.

"Magic..."
(Kid) "A magician's job is to make people believe
that he is hiding something inside his clenched fist."
"A detective must guess what he's hiding before he opens his hand."
"Isn't that right?"
Oh!
Now I've got it.
And what's wrong with the Sonoko, then?
You can tell.
Have you had a fight with your karateka?
(Kid) "Being on a trip,
he gets in the middle of a bar fight and gets hit by a car."
"She must feel insecure."
How?
This was the target.
When Sonoko was injured,
Makoto was psychologically unbalanced.
And in Makoto was the only one who could prevent
Jamaluddin from winning the karate championship.
I see where you're going with this.
You mean en Leon caused the accident?
If he wanted en Makoto to withdraw from the tournament, he succeeded.
Now, in Jamaluddin will win the championship belt.
But technically the owner of the trophy will be his head, in Leon.
The belt with the blue sapphire embedded in it.
What I don't quite understand
Is why in Leon is so obsessed with the Blue Fist.
I got something that may serve as a clue.
In Leon has met with this one in the early hours of the morning.
Can you find out his identity?
Well, not that I can't, but....
(Mitsuhiko and Genta: laugh)
(Ai) You call the doctor and tell him that you're going to Hokkaido all of a sudden.
(Shinichi voice) "I'm sorry, Haibara."
What the fuck are you doing?
Guys, please don't call so much!
"It's too long to explain."
-I can't believe it.
- (all) Yes...
Don't tell me you're involved with some case again.
"Yes, as a matter of fact I am."
"He just sent you some pictures he took at the Kid."
In Kid?
You said you're with the Kid?
How cool!
In Kaito Kid has come again?
You're talking to Conan, aren't you?
Didn't you tell us he's gone to Hokkaido?
What did he steal, the Kid, this time?
-A plate of "Sapporo" noodles!
-L'statueta of a wooden bone?
-Ouch!
-How do you want me to steal noodles?
-I want too!
-Let me talk to him!
Ouch!
Excuse me, it's just that the children have come to play there doctor.
"Ah, very well. When I come back I'll tell you everything point by point."
"Now I need to know who the man in the pictures is."
Okay, I'll try to find out.
By the way, tell me the truth: are you sure you're OK?
"Yes, we could say yes."
I know it won't do any good to tell you, but don't be silly.
Thank you. Thank you.
Ah...
What else are you going to do now, detective?
Well, see what he says.
Well, I'll wait.
I want to know what he'll do in Leon once we get the Blue Fist.
But first we have to find Mr. Mouri.
Hey, hey, wait for me!
(The winner of the Zhonhan Cup Karate Tournament is...
...Jamaluddin!"
(Cheering)
Well, gentlemen, what do you think of my urban plan?
We can't accept a proposal like this.
Why not?
They lose nothing, with this plan.
And it also benefits the whole country.
It is hasty.
If we continue to grow at this rate,
some citizens will be forced to leave home.
So we can give them another one.
My plan is perfect!
You're still very young.
Go see the world and come back later.
(Lowe) You old fool.
Your era is over.
I'll build a new city.
(Lowe) Hands up!
I'll build a new city.
(Lowe) Understood.
(Lowe) The bond that unites us is very strong.
When this plan has been successfully implemented,
we will be able to say that we are partners.
It will be an honor for me.
You have done me many favors, over the past few years.
"First, you saved me that day when I was accused of stealing...
and the police were about to arrest me."
"And then you have helped me many times."
I couldn't let them arrest Reijiro Nakatomi.
The son of Juzo Nakatomi, the king of shipping.
I don't want you to mention my father's name again.
Oh... Sure, sorry.
Anyway, tonight will change everything.
Would you like to come and watch the big moment approach?
Well, come on, let's go together.
A new page in Singapore's history will be written today,
and we will be witnesses.
(Conan voice) Excuse me, Mr. Mouri!
(Conan voice) What?

I... may I know what you do?
There's him in it!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Stop it, stop it!
Don't grope me!
It's here!
(Shinichi voice) Nakatomi, you say?
The shipping company?
(Kogoro) How did it end up in my bag?
This looks like it.
Mr. Mouri, I'll take that!
This nano reminds me a lot of someone and I don't know who... Hip!
(Woman) "How come you left Japan all of a sudden?"
(Reijiro) "It's temporary, I'm on vacation."
(Woman) "But you've been living in Singapore for 5 years already!"
- "President Nakatomi..."
- "Yes, it must be 5 years. So what?"
It's the guy from Merlion Square.
Yeah, the karateka beat him up pretty good.
(Mobile: vibrates)
Yes?
Tell me, Haibara.
"You know who he is, the man in the photos?"
Yes, I think I do.
He's Eugene Lim, and hold on tight: he's a pirate.
A pirate?
"Lately he's been spotted off the coast of Singapore."
I congratulate you!
There are no two like you.
It's strange to me that I lather.
This is because you'll want to ask me another favor, right?
"Yes, yes..."
Have you heard of a certain Reijiro Nakatomi?
"Yes, I know who he is."
From Nakatomi Transportation.
I want to know the position of the ships your company has.
I'm interested in the ones that sail near Singapore.
(Ai) "Near Singapore there are two cargo ships and an oil tanker."
(Ai) "The oil tanker is the only one that has deviated
(Ai) "The tanker is the only one that has deviated from its planned shipping route."
This is it!
Pass me everything you have on the tanker.
Thanks.
"Okay. I'll send it to you right away."
What's the problem, with the tanker?
The word "she" that Rachel wrote.
In English they use it to refer to ships.
(Rishi) Is it true what you told me on the phone?
Everything that has happened so far is part
of a plan designed by Professor Lowe?
Tell me in a way that I can understand.
(Shinichi voice) It all started
when in Zhonhan Chen found the sapphire, the great Blue Fist.
"He embedded in a belt,
the trophy of the winner of the karate championship."
Mr. Lowe entered Jamaluddin into the championship
with the intention of obtaining the precious stone.
But someone else interfered with his plans.
The great Makoto Kyogoku received an invitation in order to compete.
She had been invited by lawyer Sherilyn Tan,
who was later murdered.
Even if he had a motive, the professor has a good alibi.
He was in another elevator
at the time the young woman was killed.
-Oh!
-It wasn't exactly like that.
Having seen Leon at the Poolside restaurant,
the girl took the elevator back to her room.
Now, the room she had booked?
was on the 16th floor of Tower 3.
"The structure of the hotel forced her to change elevators on the 34th floor to continue down.
to continue down."
"While the girl was trying to get to her floor,
someone made her go into another room."
"It was Rachel, the secretary."
Rachel was an accomplice?
No way!
That day, Leon had booked a room on the 34th floor...
in order to get into the Poolside,
where only hotel guests have access.
"After the meeting with the Sherilyn,
he went down to her room and killed her."
"He hid the body in the suitcase."
"Rachel and Leon then continued downstairs...
in different elevators."
"To make the trick work, they used a magic knife..,
but the blood was real, Sherilyn's."
(Elevator: female voice) "Ground floor."
"Rachel collapsed as if she had been stabbed."
"Immediately after,
"The explosion left the mall in darkness.
and they were able to make the switch without witnesses."
I... I don't... I can't believe it!
Then Rachel, who knew of Leon's plans firsthand,
panicked and was tempted
to tell Mr. Mouri the whole truth.
But en Leon caught her just in time.
Rachel who walked into the room where the blue sapphire was in
was in disguise Kid.
In Leon used in Kid to carry out his plan.
"The real Rachel was already dead
and was hiding in the cupboard under the glass cabinet."

"In Leon he guessed that the Kid would come in disguised as Rachel."
"That's why he put her in there,
to pin it on the Kid and leave him without an alibi."
But how could he guess?
Who would you pretend to be, you,
if you wanted to be sure you wouldn't get caught?
Me?
Let me think...
If you want to impersonate someone else and that person shows up,
the disguise goes down the drain.
You have to pick someone who knows where you'll be at a specific time.
Of course you do!
Rachel was meeting Mr. Mouri at 3:00 p.m., right?
Yes.
Then maybe...
The Kid pretended to be her
because he knew it would be somewhere else.
And he fell into the trap of the Lowe, who had foreseen it.
Shut up!
And now what?
You still haven't told me what you intend to do, the professor.
It's all part of a crazy plan.
In Leon he contacted the Eugene Lim,
the captain of a group of pirates.
"Rachel wrote on the glass case
with her own blood the word 'she'."
In addition, she secretly gave Mr. Mouri
the medal of the Nakatomi shipping company.
-I still don't understand anything.
It's all related to a ship.
Look.
This was sent to my colleague Shinichi from Tokyo.
It's tracking the shipping routes
Nakatomi Transport's ships.
There's an oil tanker that has deviated significantly from the planned route.
If it does not change course, it will reach Marina Bay.
At Lowe, with the help of the pirates,
he will crash the tanker into the city.
Wait a moment!
What motive could the professor have for doing such a thing?
It has neither head nor tail!
We still don't know the motives behind his plans.
All we know is that destroying this city and rebuilding it
would move a great deal of money.
"Mr. Leon needed the Blue Fist as a bargaining chip
to get the pirates to obey his orders."
But, even so, the pirates are scattered all over the place,
and we don't even know where they are.
Thanks to the Merlion.
How did he find them?
Remember when it started spitting red water?
The news went around the world
and I'm sure it got the pirates' attention.
It would be the signal to take action.
If we don't hurry, it will be too late.
We can't waste any more time.
Anyway, I can't do anything alone.
And to mobilize the police I need more evidence.
Is there no other way?
We won't make it in time!
Maybe I can look into talking to Zhonhan Chen.
He has contacts in the military and the police.
I'm sure he can give us a hand.
Yes, say.
Rishi!
One last thing.
If the tanker arrives in the city as planned,
where do you think he'll be watching from, Mr. Lowe?
Let me think.
The professor is very cautious,
so he's looking at it from a safe distance.
It is even possible that he has already left the country.
I'd better hurry!
Understood.
And thank you!
The father won't answer the phone.
Where will he be?
The show will start soon.
And Shinichi has also been missing for a while.
(Kid) I can't understand why they had to drag me, me,
in all this mess.
Do you really think that it was Leon who left my notice
to the place where they found Sherilyn?
Mm?
No.
By the time the notice showed up on the elevator,
they'd already been analyzing the crime scene for a while.
(cell phone vibrates)
Have you wondered why?
Oops!
It's the last prediction of the tanker's route.
(Mobile: vibrates) What?
Oops!
Warning!
The tanker will crash into the hotel!
("Moonlight", Claude Debussy)

(People: exclamations of admiration)
(Woman) Louigi, you've turned yourself inside out.

Ran!
(Mobile)
"Take it, please!"

(Woman) It's coming this way!
(Exclamations of surprise)

(Shouts of panic)
(Mobile)
"Father! May I know where you are?"
Ran, my daughter!
Are you having fun?
The truth is I have no idea.
But from here I see a huge ship.
Father, listen to me for a moment, please!
It will be on the hotel terrace!
"Do you feel me? Father, answer me!"
-I think so.
Shall we go out?

Sonoko, open up!
Sonoko!
-Something has happened outside.
-What do you want?
I think we should leave the hotel.
(Phone)
(Sonoko) Yes.
Yes, understood.
-A guy from the police.
-Who was it?
He says, if I leave the room, I might be attacked again.
I'd better stay here and be alert.
"They've sent me a bodyguard."
-Remain calm, I'll stay here. -But...
-But...
As you wish.
What do we do?
With these people we can't go near the hotel!
We have no choice, we have to take a gamble!
(Woman) Oh!
Look, it's in Kid!
We just saw the Kid!
The Kid's back!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-(Woman) Hey!
All reserved for us.
What's up now?
What is it now?
In... Sleeping Kogoro!
(snoring)
Oh... I really don't get it, this man.
"No matter how much I call him, he won't pick up the phone."
(snoring) Hey!
The cell phone!
Father!
I wonder where the hell you've gotten to?
(Lowe: laugh)
You see?
This city will soon be reborn.
Thanks to me.
(Lowe:) Huh?
What... what are you doing here?
Oh... Don't-don't shoot!
I'm in awe.
I didn't think you were capable of mobilizing so many people.
I didn't count on this...
Rishi.
Okay, I'm willing to confess everything.
It's true, it was all part of my plan.
Why don't we sit down and talk?
Put the gun away and I'm sure we'll understand each other.
It's impossible, Professor Lowe, so you haven't understood anything at all.
-Quiets!
Nobody move!
-What?
There's nobody here.
We'll stop the ship.
Kid, the tanker has stopped!
Can you see it?
Yes.
Let the police take care of it.
The tanker!
What happened?
Ah!
I-I won't do anything foolish, don't shoot, please!
AAAA!
Help me!
I'm too young to die!
Rishi!
I didn't expect it from you.
Jamaluddin!
Wait!
May I know what you do, Jamaluddin?
I agreed to work for you to fight against Kyogoky.
So now I no longer have any motivation.
- (Rishi) Professor Lowe.
(Rishi) - How?
I mean no disrespect, but you look a little rusty.
It wasn't you, who was pulling the strings of the world.
It was me.
You can't be.
Are you...?
A... stop!
Don't shoot!
Take the case.
Here's the jewel inside.
It's a good deal, Rishi.
Ah!
It's the Kaito Kid!
What... what are you doing here, Arthur?
To get up to the terrace, you had to change elevators on the 34th floor.
-Hey, you!
- "34th floor."
Just a moment.
Where are they going?
Moving towards the Marina Bay Sands?
Can you tell me why you've tied me up?
I was about to stop these two men, the culprits!
You don't need to keep doing comedy, Rishi Ramanathan.
We already know it was you who was pulling the strings.
The first thing that has made us suspicious is the note from the Kaito Kid
that turned up at the crime scene.
I was surprised that the police had not seen the note
until you arrived
and told them it was taped to the elevator.
And when we asked you if you knew where Mr. Lowe was,
you just confirmed what we suspected.
How could that be?
A man as vain and narcissistic as him
would never flee abroad without seeing his project completed.
He would want to see it all from the front row, with the best views.
And it was impossible for you not to know that.
So everything before was just to test me.
It all started five years ago.
Your father's death in that accident triggered the plan.
The suspect first denied the crime,
but then confessed to being the perpetrator.
I understand... that Mr. Nakatomi
also came to live in Singapore 5 years ago, right?
No, no, I didn't do anything...
Mr. Lowe discovered the culprit and Sherilyn Tan,
his lawyer, advised him to confess.
I don't think it was a coincidence.
What are you getting at?
It was all a set-up to get
your company's tanker, Mr. Nakatomi.
"It was all set up."
And something else happened that was also a set-up.
You had figured it out, hadn't you, Rishi?
At first I thought it was an accident.
"But...going through the father's papers, I realized it."

"While exploring the seabed,
"Father happened to find a shipwrecked vessel
"where the Blue Fist was most likely hidden,
the insignia of the pirate king."
So they plotted the father's assassination,
to prevent him from finding the blue sapphire before they did!
Help!
They have made me fall into the water!
-Hurry, pull him out of the water!
-Hold on, they are coming!
(Rishi) "The father had such a strong sense of justice,
that they were sure he would throw himself out to rescue him."
Hold on.
But... what does all this mean, Leon?
Do you...?
Don't touch me!
Rishi.
This has all been a grave misunderstanding.
The man who killed your father is still serving time to...
I suspected that this was no accident and I came to Singapore...
"...to become your disciple and join the police."
So I started investigating the case.
I approached the lawyer, Sherilyn Tan.
"I proposed to her to blackmail en Leon.
"With the information she had on Nakatomi...
and she immediately told me all about it."
"Later, Rachel."
"Through your secretary I got directly..."
information about all of you.
Then why stick the Kid's notice in the elevator?
I want to know, too.
The Blue Fist was a lure.
That's also why I implicated him in the murder.
I thought, with these two enticements,
the Kaito Kid would come for sure
and, with a little luck, I would end up spoiling his plans.
I didn't count on that teenage detective coming too,
but in Kid he did what I expected.
Nakatomi, in Leon saved you...
when the police were about to arrest you for robbery.
Do you think it was just a coincidence?
Think about it.
Do you think it could all be...?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
You bastard!
I see you've investigated thoroughly, Rishi.
(thump)
(Yawn)
(Yawning) Huh?
I don't know where I am.
I'd say...
(yawning) Eh?
(yawning) Father!
Ah!
Ay, ay!
(Sliding)
"Ran!"
What's the matter?
Father...
what's this?
Ran...
Stand down and stand down!
Alert the helicopter!
Who are you, you guys?
(It's over, Rishi.
Sorry, but you've got the wind against you.
And, Eugene, it looks like the plan has failed.
You can keep the jewel,
and take care of everyone here.
-Don't move.
-What? -What?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Aaah!
Aaah!
Help me!
Now that you've given me the blue sapphire, I don't need you anymore.
Co-how do you say?
I don't have time for your palaver.
And I'm notorious for not keeping anything I promise,
especially when I've received a more lucrative offer.
Your goal must not be not to...!
You're very smart, for being so small.
Exactly.
"In this hotel is the girl from the Suzuki group."
"She's kidnapped and we'll demand an exorbitant ransom."
Not for nothing, but she's probably been evacuated by now.
No, it's still her suite.
I called her a while ago and insisted that she not come out.
(Knock)
-May I?
-Makoto, what's wrong?
There's not a single elevator that works.
-We have to get out of here.
-What?!
Over there!
Follow them!
Don't shoot, you'll touch the girl!
Ma... Makoto!
Who are these men?
Don't you realize?
In the end, everything is going as I planned.
The city will die and I will rebuild it!
(Lowe: laughing)
You won't get to see any of this!
-What?
They're firing missiles at us?
- (coughing)
(coughing) Hey!
(coughing) Father!
(coughing) Shit!
Stop it!
Aaah!
Get him!
Makoto!
What are you doing? What are you doing?
What are you doing, what are you doing, what are you doing?
(Man) We're still the same!
-Ah!
They're coming, they're coming, they're coming!
- (man) Open the door!
-I don't know, sir.
-What's going on, down there?
(Aidan) Most of the pirates are in the hotel.
(Chen) What should happen, in there?
(Aidan) It's dangerous to stay here, please go away.
(Chen) Ah!
Aaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Aidan) Oh!
(Aidan) Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Yes... Yes.
Are you all right?
If we don't do anything to stop it, the city will be a ruin in the end.
"Shit! I can't think of any ideas."
Mm?
What?!
Maybe it'll... work!
Kid!

Of course you do!
You can't be serious, can you?
(People: shouting)
-Abatem help us
-It's him again!
-Naughty Ocellet...
-We can't touch them.
Hey, before you put your plan into action,
we must get rid of the pirates!
Wait, it's not over yet!
And I only have one card left.
We have an ace up our sleeve to change everything.
Yes, you're right.
Come on, then!
Come on, then!
Ah!
Aaaaaaaah....
Makoto...
Take them!
(Jamaluddin) Get out of the way!
This man...
is mine.
(Jamaluddin) What?
Kid!
Let me land on the bow!
Okay! (grunts)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ran, ajupe't.
Raaaan!
Get out of here!
Got it!
It was Shinichi's voice.
Who did it?
(Conan voice) Arthur!
(Conan voice) Are you all right?
Did they hurt you?
What are you doing here?
I came because I was worried about you.
You're a sunshine!
Wow!
Where is he now, that one?
"Phew! Thank goodness nothing happened to him."
What?
Ah!
Thank you!
Makoto!
(Eugene) "En Kid has taken my jewel. Will you be able to bring him down?"
No problem, Captain.
Hold still, you little bitch!
Entoma-la!
(Eugene) "It worked!"
-Be calm!
Are you all right, Sonoko?
-Aaaah!
Gee, no!
Eh?
-Yes!
-Kid!
It's you!
(squeaks) Wait!
(squeaks)
Oh, it's moving too much!
We're going down!
Makoto, you've got blood!
Sonoko..., may I?
(squeaks) Huh?
Hey, what are you doing now?
You mean it's time, Makoto?
Makoto?
I said no!
Ah!
Oh!
I'll carry you tied on my back.
Sonoko, promise me you won't get separated from me this time.
"As it is, I couldn't separate even if I wanted to..."
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Eh?
Where is he now?!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Téééééééééé!
(Sonoko: cries)
Makoto!
Find a place to fuck you!
Are you alright?
-(Kid) Huh?
- (Kid) I'll give it back to you.
It turns out this isn't the precious stone I was looking for.
(Makoto) Sonoko, please sit here for a moment.
Gee, I'm sorry, really.
Maybe I hit on you too hard.
Look, that's it.
(Makoto) Hey!
L-listen!
That this...
-It's just... a memory.
-Oh! -Oh!
Oh, my God!
You've worn it all these years?
Yes...
I didn't want to tell you because I was ashamed for you to know.
"Wow, I thought it was him, the one who was always protecting me,
and it turns out I've been protecting him."
-Come on, come back to me, please.
-I got it out of you!
-Come on, please.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
I don't want to.
They've already made up.
Tell me the truth, come on.
Who are you, really?
You're not just an ordinary kid, are you?
(Conan voice) Soc Conan Edogawa.
A detective.

It's the best thing for him.
After all, Makoto needs to have a place to fight.
-And where did that one come from?
-Me-te, they're already here!
(Shinichi voice) You don't need to hold me so tight, woman.
Give me!
I can hardly walk!
Ah, that's good...
I won't let you go anymore.
You know I've been waiting for this moment for many days.
Kid!
We've been waiting for you!
Eh?
I knew you weren't Shinichi.
(Kid voice) What?
You're serious?
I've had it clear from day one!
Do you know why?
Because Shinichi would never try to father you!
(Kid voice) "Eh? But he's always..."
"I'd say he's never treated her about you, in front of Ran..."
And woe betide you to impersonate Shinichi again!
Ran, don't let go until we've stopped her!
Catch him!
Kid!
Catch him!
I won't let you go!
You won't get away from me!
(Kid) Doctor!
