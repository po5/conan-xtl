We ate well, didn't we, at the restaurant?
Yes, and it was very good value, it was a bargain.
Wasn't it, Conan?
Yes.
Ah!
Oh!
The car! Huh? (Laughs)
Ah! (Wheels squeal)
(Wheels: squeaking)
Ah! (tires screech)
Ah! Eh?
Are they all right? Uh... Yes.
Thank you very much.

"The riddle of the Palau of the Red Leaves (part one)."
No need.
What we have done, we have done with pleasure.
It is not necessary to invite us home, we appreciate it, but it is not important.
I have phoned the owner and I have explained to him
that we were saved by the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
And the owner told me that he is very interested in thanking you personally.
Eh?
But this way... I don't know about the Palau de las Hojas Rojas?
-Yes, he's at my grandfather's house! -What?
What do you mean?
That this girl here is the real estate king's netta,
the Ozaburo Katayose?
Well, she's not exactly the clean one, she's adopted.
The girl's parents died recently in a car accident,
and the owner recently adopted it to a relative of hers who lives in Hokkaido.
That's right.
My name is Kaede Nakakita.
I am 8 years old!
What about you?
What's your name?
Conan Edogawa, and I'm 7.
Hm.
Wow!
Oh...
Come in, please.
Oh!
Ah!
(Think) "There are red leaves everywhere."
Who are they, Suzaki?
And what are they doing here?
Miss Nobue, these people saved our lives.
-They almost ran us over. (Nobue) Eh?
Yes, a madman's car ran over us!
Luckily, this kid warned us and was able to avoid it.
He-he!
Mmm... So a madman's car.
Wow.
(Yawns) I didn't know we had visitors.
Hello, little brother.
The Kaede and the Eiko have been hit by a madman's car.
Oh, really?
What did they do?
Drive through without looking?
Anyway, who are all these people?
Meet the person who saved us.
He is a detective.
He is the famous Kogoro Mouri.
-In Kogoro Mouri!? - What?!
Oh!
The car of a madman.
What have you got to do, you, with it?
Answer me!
What?!
You don't know what you're saying!
The car is the garage!
You're a resourceful man, you sure know how to steal a car.
The hole in the fence, that's your business, isn't it?
What the hell are you talking about?
The fence by the ravine.
At Kaede's you really like to go play there.
Isn't that right?
Eh?
H-we do!
H-let's!
Ah.
Ah, yes.
Excuse me.
We're siblings, but from different mothers.
We were adopted as children when our mothers died.
Our father is not our biological father.
In a family like that, it's normal for problems to arise.
I'm sure that's what you were thinking right now, right?
Don't worry, don't worry.
We're lucky that Detective Mouri is here.
He'll help us find out who made the hole!
Or rather, the madman who was driving the car.
I'm sorry for this spectacle you've had to see.
-I beg your pardon. Ah, don't worry.
Anyway, the owner of the house is waiting for you.
Would you be so kind as to accompany me, please?
Au, come with me, Conan! Ah, yes.
Oh!
Wow!
How big!
This mansion is huge.
Inside, you can't even see the end of the hallway.
Ah! Eh?
What-what is this?
Well, it's a painting.
What a ?!
Curious, isn't it?
It's one of my master's hobbies.

Yes, my grandfather calls "trick art".
Eh? Yiih?
He has a red maple grove inside the house?
Ooh!
Huh? (Laughs)
No, not exactly.
Only the front trees are real.
The back ones are painted.
What?!
Mmm.
Wow, you, it's true.
It's really impressive, isn't it, Ran?
Huh?
Where did it go, everyone?
I don't know, but let's keep going.
Mm?
What is it, this door?
Another painting?
Come on, open up! Maybe it opens backwards.
Ah, right.
Open up!
This must be "trick art" too.
Maybe it's a sliding door and it opens sideways.
Mm.
It has opened!
Mr. Katayose is waiting for us here? He probably is.
This garden is real, isn't it? Yes.
- (Man) Endavant. Mm?
(Man) Come in, please.
(Man) Eh? (Man) Eh?
(Man) Oh!
Hello.
-I've been waiting for you, Conan. But... and Mr. Katayose?
(Door: creaks)
(door squeaks) Eh? (door creaks) Huh?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Seguin, please.
I'll introduce myself.
I am Ozaburo Katayose.
Well, how should I put it?
He has very extravagant, oh, I mean, very refined tastes.
Grandpa's "extravagant" tastes are all fake.
The Kaede did live in a truly natural environment.
I am very envious of her.
For reasons that are beside the point, now,
I took care of her when she lost her parents.
But if I have to tell the truth, I regret it now.
Eh?
Here, Master.
You're in danger again today, aren't you?
I'm sorry about that.
Most of all I'm sorry for her.
No, don't apologize, it's not your fault.
It's me, who planted the seed.
Me, who caused the rivalry between my children.
Ah, excuse me, I'm back to rambling like an old man.
Please, help yourselves.
The milk is brought to us directly
from a farm in the place where Kaede was born.
No spoon?
I'm sorry, but I don't use a spoon.
I like to see how the milk slowly mixes with the tea.
-Yes, it is one of my plaers.
I don't put more sugar in the tea either.
But it's the guests.
Please help yourselves.
Detective Mouri, I hear you're very fond of sake.
Yes.
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha!
I'm glad it's here, I'd like to ask you a question.
Unfortunately I have a meeting at 3 o'clock.
What do you say we have a little chat afterwards.
with a glass of sake in front of you.
It would be an honor and a pleasure.
Ah!
It's very sweet!
Please join them in the guest room.
Yes, sir.
We'll be right there.
Look, this is all for real.
What a beautiful garden!
That's why they call it the Palace of the Red Leaves.
No, wait, I'll take it, the cup.
No, that's not necessary.
Let me do something, it cheers me up.
It can't do any harm to my body, it won't last long.
The owner is sick with cancer.
He's known it for a long time, and he's... resigned to die.
I'm sorry.
Follow me! Wait for me!
What?
Just a moment.
What's wrong?
No, I thought this hill was farther.
I must have been mistaken.
It's my grandfather's pride and joy, this here.
The design is a copy of the Kamakura shrine.
Ah, the elevated road.
The path narrows little by little,
and the perspective effect makes it look much farther than it is.
Hey, Conan, look at this.
It's my tree house. Grandpa had it built for me.
Kaede, you look like a big boy and not a girl.
I know I do.
Look what I'm doing.
Come on, Conan, you come up, too.
Yes!
"It's cut with a knife."
"It's obvious that someone wants to harm the Kaede."
But aren't you related to the Katayose family?
No, I'm not.
Grandfather told me that he and my grandmother had been close friends,
but I don't know, because I don't remember her, my grandmother.
And how is it, that you were adopted? I don't know.
Grandfather decided and he is very stubborn.
My uncle from the farm didn't want me to be adopted,
he wanted me to stay with him.
I'd like to go back.
Hey, will you teach me how to play soccer?
What?
Earlier you made a ball appear as if by magic.
I'm surprised you saw it at that moment.
But that ball deflates very quickly, after 10 seconds.
Mm.
Ah!
Shut up!

I have one at home too!
Go ahead, shoot, I'll be the goalkeeper!
You're not in a very good place.
Behind you there is a pond.
I won't let it fall!
I'm not saying it for that, I'm saying it for you.
I won't fall in either!
He-he!
"She's stubborn!"
Hit harder! Eh... As you wish.
Nail her a good shot!
Show that you're a kid.
All right! (Laughs)
Ah! No!
I'm sorry.
Sorry, Grandpa.
We didn't mean to.
It's a meeting, isn't it? Yeah, it's after 3.
(Man: groans)
Xxxt!
What's wrong?
I heard moaning.
I go inside.
Avi.
"The cup is still smoking."
The killer can't be far.
Eh?!
Ran! Ran!
Did someone just come out of this room?
What? What?
Where?
From here?
No, I haven't seen anyone.
Where is he, in Kogoro?
He's sleeping in the guest room.
Nothing happened?
Tell him to come here!
What-what's...?
Oh.
Oh...
The poor guy's dead.
Eh?
Aaaavi!
Aaah...
There was someone here with him, wasn't there?
Yes.
Look at the cup on the table.
It's still smoking.
The poor guy died of poisoning, with cyanide.
Hey, what's all the fuss?
-Mm? -Ah!
Father!
What's the matter?
What's happened to him, Father?
Oh!
-No!
Master! -Stay away from the scene of the crime.
"Crime"?
She's been murdered?
-Nobue!
It was you! -It's not true!
It was you!
In the end you did it, eh?
Don't talk nonsense!
I haven't moved from the room the whole time.
On the other hand, you got here first.
He killed her, the father!
Eiko, Grandfather is dead.
Oh, Kaede...
Where were you when the murder took place?
In the garage.
Cleaning and maintaining the cars.
Is there anyone who can confirm what you say?
No, there was no one in the garage.
The person who had a meeting with Mr. Katayose at 3 o'clock,
you have no idea who it was or who it might be?
No, unfortunately, no.
As the meeting was of a private nature,
I haven't really dared to ask the owner who it was.
Is there any possibility that this meeting was with either the Ogito
or the Nobue?
Yes, of course.
Or even both at the same time.
Do you have any idea what they might have talked about?
If they met, it must have been to discuss the owner's inheritance.
Eh?
Hm.
- (Mobile) - Huh?
(Mobile)
Yes?
Hello?
No, sure.
Next month I'll pay you.
What? (Cell phone ringing)
That you can't wait that long?
But it's just that...
I'll find a way.
Yes, don't suffer, I'll find a way.
Ah!
And now what faaaig!?
Ah!
I can't wait to collect the inheritance, I need the money!
And now what do I do?
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
tell me which dress... is the prettiest, to wear to the funeral?
And now what?
I can't declare myself insolvent now.
If only they would give me a month.
Both at the Nobue and the Ogito,
the only thing they've always been interested in is the owner's inheritance.
If Mr. Katayose knew he was going to die soon,
he must have planned to talk to them, I imagine.
But one thing we don't know is who he had decided to talk to first.
Mm... It was the scientists.
The milk poison test came back positive, Inspector.
Eh?
Sure, I got it, case solved.
Both the son and the daughter of the late Mr. Katayose
knew he liked to drink tea with milk.
The only thing he or she has had to do,
is find the time to put the poison in.
Yes, now all that remains is to find out which of the two sons did it.
But, Mr. Kogoro, how did the murderer get away?
Mm? Eh?
What do you mean, escape?
"Yes, I was already about 20 minutes ago...
"I was in the garden when the incident happened...
and I didn't see anyone leave the room."
"Kaede and I were playing in the garden."
"We had the room right in front of us and we didn't see anyone come out."
But this is impossible.
What do you mean?
That the murderer didn't flee the room?
Hm.
It is possible that there is a secret chamber.
That's right, Mr. Katayose had a secret room.

"It's behind the door of the hut painted on the wall."
"Then, when Conan left the scene of the crime,
the murderer has taken advantage of it to get out and run away."
But the Kaede was still there, in the meeting room.
The Kaede was in a state of shock because of what had happened to the grandfather,
and he didn't see her leave.
It's possible, but there's something else, too.
The door to this room squeaks a lot, when it opens.
(Door: creaks)
The door squeaks so loudly that it's impossible
that someone in the hallway didn't hear it.
Ah!
No...
"But then, where the hell did he escape, the murderer?"
Miss, what's wrong? What's wrong?
No.
I was wondering if Kaede would be awake now.
She's cried so much, she must be sleeping now.
I'm worried about her.
Inspector, can I go see her?
Hm.
Yes, I don't need to, go and see what she's doing.
What do I do now?
Miss! Ah!
Can I come to see the Kaede with you?
Mm?
This key, which door is it from?
I think I should have told that to the inspector.
You shouldn't have told him where I kept the money.
Why did you have to give it, the key, to the police,
instead of giving it to me, eh?
H-let's go!
It's private information.
It's only of interest to the family.
Once we know this has nothing to do with the case,
you can take possession.
But remember that it was your father who entrusted this key
to Ms.
Suzaki with very precise orders.
The owner told me that he wanted me to keep it, the key,
and indefinitely, if possible.
What?
Now that the father is dead, the house and everything inside will be mine.
I remind you that I'm here!
Shut up!
What are you waiting for?
Come on, open the drawer!
Ah, yes.
-There's something in there! -I'm sure it's a check!
And the father wanted to give that to this woman?
-No, it's not true. Let me see what's there.
-I'll see!
Ah! Oh!
-You, do'm that! -Woman-me to me!
Wow, there's a few sentences written inside.
Sentences? Let's see.
"Close the umbrella and, when it dries,
"Watch the sun set in the east.
Check the two poles holding the red maple tree
And look for whichever is longer.
My dream sleeps under the red-leaf maple."
-But what is this? -A riddle?
It could be the location of where to hide his riches.
Mm...
"A riddle."
"It might indicate the location of where to hide the riches?"
"Why did he give it to her, the key, the Suzaki?"
"Who must it be, the murderer of Mr. Katayose?"
"And what is it, this secret chamber?"
But I know
Namida wo koraeteru su Zutter.
Sono Mune ga kowaresouna Kurai.
Tsuyogatteitemo kimi no hitomi wo mireba.
Wakaru yo Sugus ni su
you're my boyfriend,
sound you can lean on me.

I know your heart soba ni iru yo!
Ima wa tooku hanareteiteitemo,
Mune no koe wa kikoeteru yo.
Kotoba ni dasanakutemo wakaru yo,
Zutter you're my best friend.
I need to collect the inheritance, now, right now!
If only I could figure out the riddle.
Shut up!
What did he mean by...?
Ha-ha!
Of course you did!
Gee, you, that's scary.
But it seems to me... he's discovered something.
I have an idea, I'll let the Ogito solve the riddle.
Then I'll take it to him even if it's just for me.
Apart from solving this riddle,
what we have to do is to protect the Kaede.
This is where the property ends on the east side.
"There is something shining." (Woman) Aaah!
Come, hurry! It can't be!
Another murder!?
Inspector!
I've already solved all the mysteries of this case.
Have you?
The murderer is... you!
