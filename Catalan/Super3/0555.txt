"I was in the hot spring town of Kinosaki,
"where I had gone to treat my sprained ankle...
when the Ran disappeared."
"Thanks to a photo that Mitsuhiko and the others had taken,
we were able to discover that the Ran was accompanied by a little girl."
"In the photograph, there also appeared....
the silhouette of a suspicious person spying on them."
"We met by chance at Heiji Hattori,
"who told us that the girl's name was Haruna Tabuse...
and that her father had commissioned him to find her."
"The day before, from the museum owned by the Haruna's father,
"a sculpture, 'The Rainbow Boy,' had disappeared,
and also his daughter."
"A dolphin trainer, a friend of the Haruna,
"showed us a photo album
"And she explained to us that the sculptor of 'The Rainbow Boy' was Haruna's mother
was Haruna's mother, who was now living separately from her."
"We had as a clue to locate the girls.
the letter the mother had sent to the Haruna."
"Unfortunately, before we found them..."
Ah!
Ran, no!
"Love is magic and triumphs over mystery."
"Connect with Conan at the time of suspense."
"We're looking for Ran and the solution to the case."
"With Heiji we will solve the riddle."
"The truth always ends up knowing!"
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The Mystery of the Stork (Chasing the Haruna)."
"At the funicular station at the top of the mountain,
"Heiji and Kogoro have found the Haruna unconscious on the ground,
"But there is no trace of Ran,
nor of the mysterious man with the dark glasses."
"Sorry, Ran, if only my ankle wasn't like that!"
We've gone to the police, just in case.
Mr. Tabuse and the others are at the hospital.
(Shinichi voice) Yes, thank you.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.
Don't worry, it's not your fault.
I should have guessed it.
If Haruna didn't go to the Art and Literature Center,
as she was supposed to, it's because of what her mother wrote in the letter:
"I happened to find my friend Michiko, the straw artist,
the Kinosaki Art and Literature Center."
He remembered the word "straw" but did not retain the name of the place,
and that is why it was the Traditional Straw Art Museum.
And for the same reason he has taken the funicular railway
to go to the top of the mountain.
The Haruna read the letter the word "station",
"Kinosaki Hot Spring Station",
then, when she saw the word "station"
next to "mountain funicular",
he thought that's where he had to go.
We were watching the Kinosaki Hot Spring Station,
and by the time we got to the funicular station, it was too late.
Ouch!
Children do the most incomprehensible things sometimes.
Hey, Heiji, did you find anything important?
in Haruna's backpack?
No, but I doubt very much that the sculpture "The Rainbow Boy"...
is in the suspect's possession.
I doubt it.
If he had it, he wouldn't have kidnapped Ran.
Haruna most likely hid the sculpture somewhere.
Yes, and I imagine that she must also be the one...
who took "The Rainbow Boy" from the museum.
- (footsteps: approaching) MM?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I'm a friend of the hospital director and he told me that Haruna was here.
How is she?
That I stole "The Rainbow Boy"?
Please don't talk nonsense.
How could I have stolen it, huh?
Please don't call.
I remind you that this is a hospital.
-Where have you been all this time? -All this time? -At Michiko's place.

Mom?
I want you to return the sculpture you stole to the museum.
"The Rainbow Boy" is not yours, it belongs to the museum!
Are you deaf, or what?
I told you I didn't steal it, the sculpture!
Would you keep it down, please?
Will you shut up!
Do not interfere!
It's none of your business, that.
Oh, and so much, it is.
Because of this none of my business, my daughter has been kidnapped!
What-what do you mean?
Please, would you mind telling me your side of the story?
Mm?
No!
Oh, shit!
"Haruna! Wait, please."
Leave me alone, and stop following me!
Look, I've already turned off the cell phone like you told me to...
and I won't tell anyone that I've seen you,
but please, listen to me and let me take you home to her parents.
In my house... there's no one, now.
What?
Mom got divorced and left and abandoned me.
She left me, huh?
And the father just works all day long.
I'm sure he won't miss me.
I know what you mean.
You don't know this, of course,
but my parents also split up when I was little
and now they live far away from each other.
Do they? Yes, Haruna.
That's why... I can understand a little bit how you feel, I mean....
...so if you don't do what I tell you to do,
this girl will have a really hard time.
Ran, don't...
Great!
Haruna's already showing signs of life.
Okay, I trust you, Hattori.
Don't lose her, now.
"The suspect has kidnapped the Ran
because he couldn't get 'The Rainbow Boy'."
"The Haruna will do whatever the suspect tells her to do,
as we had assumed."
-Oh, oops!
I think she's seen us.-Frene a little.
Now that's a job for the Junior Detective League.
I swear on the shield we'll rescue Ran!
Mm-hm.
No way!
No!
I've lost the shield!
I don't have it!
That's because you dropped it in a spa.
No!
And now, what?!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Mm?
(Think) "What's this?"
"It's the shield that fell from the Ayumi!"
(Shield: acoustic signal)
-Oops, it's my shield! -But who could be signaling you?
-In Conan, for sure. It could be my shield!
-Wait.
I feel something.
(Conan voice) You say the shield feels some gongs?
Eh, it could be the Ran!
Yes, of course!
Where is it?
One o'clock in the afternoon.
I've got it!
The clock!
Every day at one o'clock noon they ring a gong.
It's the Ran.
The Ran is Izushi!
A statue of a mother with a child?
Has the Haruna stopped to pray?
Yes.
I don't know what it represents, the statue, it looks like a goddess.
I'll describe her to you.
It is a rather fat woman with a child in her arms.
Kinosaki had stopped
before the goddess protector of mothers and children.
Yes, and at the mountain station of the funicular...
...there is the beloved mother Kwan Yin.
And now a statue of a mother and child.
And can't it be that...?
I don't know why,
but I think you're thinking the same thing as me, Kudo.
Yes.
We know why she does all this, Haruna.
(Thinking) "There's no understanding them. What the hell are they talking about?"
-No! Go around back!
Have you lost her?! What?
Have you lost her?
What salary?
A bunch of useless? Calm down, Mr. Kogoro.
These stone stairs never ended, did they?
-No.
We could have counted the steps.
How many there must be?
-I don't know, but a lot.
Hey, look,
it says that this place where we've been, it's called "Gonbei", did you know that?
-It's called "Gonbei"?
"How interesting."
"Gonbei."
-What's the matter?
Do you feel something? -Gonbei?
That you want to go to Gonbei, maybe? Yes.
That you know where he is, Gonbei?
Of course you do!
Can you take him? Sure.
(Thinking) "Ran, hold on!"
"Sure! I know!"
"Yeah, I got it, I seem to have already solved this case!"
(Mitsuhiko: gasps)
Go on without me, I can't take it anymore.
-I'm hungry, I can not moure.-You are cowardly brevas.
Well, we are already in the shrine.
And who was he, this Gonbei to whom it is dedicated?
Ah, he was a samurai of the Sengoku period, and of the Edo era.
Gonbei Hidehisa, he is also known as Sengoku Hidehisa.
Ah!
So that's why.

It is possible that Kogoro Mouri's daughter is not far off.
The Haruna!
Oh!
These women again!
-Where, this girl like that? - (Heiji) Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
(Heiji) Get in!
-Where is she, Ran? -Go on, get in!
He's escaped us!
What?
Follow that car!
(wheels: screeching)
- (horn) Hey, you!
Get out of the way!
Get the truck out of the way! (Thinking) "I can't stay here."
(Kogoro) We're in a hurry!
Go, please!
(Kogoro) "This time you do not have m'escapar√†s!"
Coi as a kid!
(Shinichi's voice) Where the hell has he gone?
- (door, open) - (Haruna) Michiko!
Haruna!
Michiko, you got what mom gave you?
Who?
The Kaho?
(Haruna) Ah!
You mean this here?
-I've finally found it! -But, you were looking for her?
But what's this?
I told you that what I wanted was "The Rainbow Boy"!
May I know who you are?
I know, but you can't separate them.
If he took "The Rainbow Boy", he took the mother.
What do you mean?
What do you mean? (Conan voice) What you felt.
Wh-who are you?
Haruna, this is what you haven't stopped looking for, right?
The child and the mother are two parts of the same statue.
But who, who are you?
Conan Edogawa.
A detective.
A detective?
Is this a joke?
-Hi, Michiko.
What's up? -Yui!
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
Nooo!
(Heiji) We finally found you.
-Sorry we've been so busy. -Oh!
Ran, are you okay?
(Heiji) Stop it!
Let go of me!
Stop it!
Let go, I said!
Let go of me!
Conan!
You wanted it! Let him go!
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Are you all right, Conan? Mm-hm.
I'm fine.
How are you? Fine, just fine.
Yeah, I can see that.
Ran!
Raaan!
Hey, father! Ran!
You don't know... how you've made me suffer.
Oh, have I? I thought I'd never see you again!
Come on, father.
Don't cry.
Come on, it's no big deal.
Mother, what's wrong?
Ko-chan!
Ko-chan!
Have you gone crazy?
Oh!
I've been looking for you everywhere!
But how did you think of that?
Answer me!
Answer, how did you think of that?
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry too, what happened.
But you're a donkey, or what?
How could you think of doing this, no matter how many debts you have?
I'm sorry, Yui.
He's not a bad boy, a little silly, but he's not a bad boy.
Please forgive me, he won't do it anymore.
I beg you please.
But why did you do it?
How did you think of it, huh?
Actually, it wasn't my idea.
(Ko-chan) "Mr. Mouri didn't want me to do an interview with him,
and I didn't know what to do."
This person you're talking about is Kamachi-san?
Eh?
But how do you know?
Mr. Kamachi?
You mean the museum director?
There's no need to hide, Mr. Kamachi.
We've seen him.
What you're saying is a lie.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Mr. Kamachi-san!
I only know Mr. Yumoto
because I commissioned an article from him some time ago for the museum.
That I happened to drop by now was purely by chance.
Look at the photo.
The man on the left is not Mr. Yumoto.
At the time,
Mr. Yumoto was interviewing Mr. Kogoro.
-It's you, isn't it? -Come on!
Don't talk nonsense, man!
Mr. Kamachi, you're the director of the museum,
surely you must have known...
that the statue... "The Rainbow Boy"
was part of another statue, the statue of the mother..,
and that the Haruna wanted the statue of the mother and the statue of the child
to be together.
She took advantage of the fact that they were rearranging the museum's exhibit
to make the Haruna steal "The Rainbow Child".
He just had to follow the Haruna... to find the statue of the mother,
and thus have the two parts together, right?
But today, when they appeared in Heiji and Mr. Kogoro,
he started to get nervous, didn't he?
So he asked Mr. Yumoto
to at least find the statue of the boy.
Yes, that's true,
but the Haruna wasn't carrying the "Rainbow Boy" statue,
and that's why I kidnapped the girl afterwards.
This is all nonsense.
You won't be able to prove anything.
Oh no?

What is it, this stain on your pants?
What is it?
What's wrong with it, the stain?
Genta, the man with the dark glasses bumped into you, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
"He threw my crab ice cream on the ground."
Yeah, but what's that got to do with it?
Hey, Genta, how come you have such a gross shield, huh?
Because I spilled ice cream on me.
Of course, the stain on your pants must be from the shield!
-What? -Eh?
Hey, what are you doing?
Yes, the stain smells of my crab ice cream!
Look, it's a match!
Which proves that you are the man with the dark glasses
who crashed into them.
You'd better come clean.
I took some money from the museum and couldn't get it back.
I thought that by selling the "Rainbow Boy" statue
and the one of the mother, which had not yet been made public,
I could cover the deficit.
(Cries)
"The Rainbow Boy'
"It was in a locker in the locker at the Kinosaki Hot Spring Station,
where the Haruna had left her when she had arrived in the city."
(Ayumi) Ah!
How beautiful!
-Yes, it's beautiful. -Yes, it is.
Very.
Ah...
She's very pretty, isn't she? Yes.
Watch what you show her, then see what she does!
How dare you say that to me?
You, who have never taken care of yourself!
-What?
Who is she, the one who left home and abandoned her?
-I wouldn't have left home if you had paid any attention to me.
Will you stop it at once!
Haven't they understood yet?
Even if they don't see it, why did she steal this statue, the Haruna?
She was lonely because her mother had left home
and her father was always too busy with work
and had no time to be there for her.
She thought that, if she could reunite the two statues,
maybe she could also reunite her parents again.
That's why she was walking with the statue back and forth.
It was like...it was like a stork going from house to house....
carrying happiness.
Mom.
Papa.
Haruna.
Haruna!
Haruna, forgive me.
-Haruna! -My...
Mommy.
Haruna.
I'm so sorry.
-Sorry. -Dad.
Dad, Mom...
Haruna.
Dad, mom, I love you.

Look how many there are!
I hope one day we'll be as happy as them, too.
(Haruna) Oh!
They're leaving!
(Haruna) Ah!
No!
I can't rescue him!
The two cars we saw at the supermarket earlier
completely wrecked.
(Think) "The front of the car has a front guard."
Come on!
Where are you going?
The father will tell you, if you disappear again, you feel?
All right, then, case closed.
(Think) "Now don't let me down, Ran."
"Don't miss the next episode: 'The crossing of fear."
