"My name is Conan Edogawa."
"I used to be Shinichi, a young detective,
until they made me drink a potion that made me shrink."
"To protect those around me I must hide it."
"I will prove to you again that there is only one truth."
(Tune from "Mune ga doki doki")
DETECTIVE CONAN
The kidnapping of the Ayumi
I believe that there is no such thing as a perfect crime.
I'm very sorry, but I've figured you out.
This time you made 3 mistakes.
First of all!
The empty cans scattered around the garbage can.
From the amount on the outside, you can tell there's something inside.
Second!
The ice cream you were eating is on the floor.
Because you had to hide it and threw it away, leaving it half eaten.
Thirdly!
The most decisive proof is...
I see your huge ass in the middle of all the cans, Genta!
Do you know you're repellent?
Ayumi!
I've already found Genta.
You can come now!
(Radio) "So fast? It's no fun, let him find us in Conan."
"A detective finds us right away."
(Think) "I'm not having fun either."
"A high school student, playing detective."
It's pretty, the badge, isn't it?
Huh?
"Kids Detectives, Junior Detective Squad!"
We're the only kids in the world who have such nice badges.
Yeah, that's for sure.
It's a microcommunicator.
With the dial on the back you can adjust the frequency
and it serves as a communicator!
(Think) "It's a good game, but leave me alone."
"If these little guys hadn't come,
I would have gone to the university campus festival with the Ran."
(Kogoro) I'll keep an eye on them for you, the college girls!
Now I'll be the detective and you'll be the criminals!
Again?
I'm a delinquent again?
With a detective there's plenty to go around!
Well, well!
What a drag.
(Genta) One, two...
I love, play the;
and you?!
Conan, hurry up, hurry up!
(Thinks) They handle me like a doll.
Let's see if I'll become stupid.
Excuse me a moment, sir.
99... 100!
All right, the chief of the junior detectives, in Genta Kojima,
will prove to you that he is a detective!
(Thinking) This Genta... Look at him, how he's looking for me.
"Serial murders of little girls !?"
"The criminal hasn't been caught yet."
(Ayumi) How scary about that.
Ah..., ah... Ayumi?
All the girls he kidnaps are pretty, huh?
I'm sure I'd be at the top of the list.
But look, I'm not worried at all,
because if anything happens to me, you've got my back, right, Conan?
Huh?
Man, you know what I mean, you and me, Conan, we're made for each other.
Hey, hey, wait, Ayumi... Eh?
You're already mine!
I got you!
You're a specialist in finding people, but you don't know how to hide.
I don't like running to hide.
I thought I heard the Ayumi.
(Quietly) Go!
Run and hide!
What's here?
What's here?
A cat, it's a cat!
Let's see, a place to hide, a place to hide...
What's taking him so long, that asshole?
Lucky you!
I've got you!
Mitsuhiko!
I've got you!
That's weird... scientifically, he couldn't find me.
(Thinking) "What's so scientific about this?"
Very good!
Now I only need the Ayumi!
This Genta...
Who knows how long it will take him to find a fucking girl!
The Ayumi is not a fucking girl, Conan!
Mmm?
Ah... it's the same...
(thinks) "I'll adjust the skateboard the teacher gave me."
Hey, can I ask you a question?
Let's see... Hmm.
Come on, Conan, tell me how you feel, for the Ayumi.
Don't get confused, now.
How do you feel about Ayumi as a woman?
B-but we're just friends.
Ah!
You're sure?
Just friends and that's enough?
Mitsuhiko... maybe you're in love with the Ayumi?
Eh?
Of course I'm not.
I wanted to know the chances I'll have when I grow up.
Grown up?
You mean marriage?
Professor Agasa does a lot of great things to you!
(Think) "It's very good that these kids nowadays..."
(Man) Will it take you much longer?
Don't be a pain!
Can't you see I'm apologizing?
We'll be late if we stay much longer!
You still haven't found the Ayumi?
Genta, give up and make her come out.
You idiot!
You think I'd humiliate myself before...

...before the Ayumi?
(Thinking) "Wow! So, in Genta is also..."
Man, you know what I mean, we're made for each other!
It puts me in a compromise..."
Hey, Ayumi, you feel me?
The game is over.
It comes out.
-Maybe he's gone home.
(Thinking) "What if something had happened to her?"
"We'll try to turn up the volume."
Ayumi!
Ayumi!
Conan?
Ayumi?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Radio) "Ayumi!"
Conan!
"Ayumi, where are you!?"
I don't know.
It's a dark and small place.
(Radio) "What am I doing here?"
This is the noise...
"...from a car!?"
Ah!
Of course!
I hid in the trunk of a car in the park,
I covered myself with a blanket and fell asleep.
(Thinking) "In the park..."
"It's that car!"
"Wow, what is this? Holy cow!"
Money!
A whole sack full of money!
There's got to be 10 million yen!
10 million yen!
Wow!
It must be a millionaire's car!
"So much money... and all inside a sack?"
(Genta) -Is there anything else? -Mmmm, let's see...
Yes.
There is a plastic bag, but...
What's inside?
(Radio) "Ah... it's a saw!"
A saw!?
(Radio) What is this?
It's very slimy...
Don't you feel like a child's voice, behind it?
Do you think it can talk, that thing?
You're absolutely right.
(Genta) There is only the saw?
And another thing... round and it's wrapped in paper.
"And inside there is..."
(Genta) Wait!
Ayumi!
Don't open it!
Aaaaaaah!
It's... An end... a girl's head!!!
-A head!? - An end!?
(Think) "My God! What if the Ayumi had put...
...the car of those murderers of little girls?"
Something strange is going on, behind.
Yes, I heard a voice.
Let's look in the trunk.
-Come on, open it.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
(screams) Eh?
(screams)
So that's what it was all about.
We heard these people.
What a fright that has given me!
(Radio) "Don't cry!"
Ayumi!
You don't have to cry!
They'll feel you, if you cry.
(Radio) "I got it! Think of fun things!"
Co-funny things?
(Laughs)
A... Ayumi?
At Genta fell,
and with the two horns she got, she looked like a bear!
Ayumi, that's enough.
What?
"You shut up and be quiet.
I'll come and rescue you!
Ayumi, I'll come and rescue you now!
And how will we catch them, us?
They're going by car!
What's the use, a skateboard?
This skateboard of Dr. Agasa's isn't a normal skateboard.
It's a skateboard with a turbo engine.
But since it's solar-powered, it will only work during the day.
The sun sets here for an hour..."
Eh?
What?
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait-e here, you two!
Those men are murderers!
We can't stay here if the Ayumi is in danger!
We boys have to protect the girls!
Hey, hey, hey!
Ah, well...
Well, come on, let's go!
Ayumi, where is the car now?
I don't know, Conan.
They stop and start.
Something's wrong, the car.
And there are strange noises.
Come on, turn up the volume on the board!
(Forging machine)
"This is..."
"I know!"
"They're stuck in a traffic jam because of road works!"
"They're only doing road work at the second avenue intersection."
Let's go!
Agafeu's-e strong, guys!
(Think) "Ayumi!"
(Radio: man) "But we didn't have to murder her."
Her parents had paid the ransom in full.
She was a little girl.
She had seen our faces!
We couldn't leave her alive, even if she was a child!
"You bastards! Easy, Ayumi, we'll be right back!"
"Where is it, the car of those men?"
Ayumi, even if it starts and stops?
Yes, but we're not in the same place as before.
I don't feel that noise anymore.
We've moved a little bit.
Come on!
"Just a moment."
"If there's a jam up ahead, it must be..."
"I've got it!"
"Oysters no! On the highway we won't catch them!"
"What shall we do now?"
-Many POLICE cars pass by. Yes, and this is the fourth one.
(Think) "Inspector Megure!?"
(TV) "According to the security forces,
the kidnappers of girls are two men
who are in the Beika area."
Ayumi!

Did you feel any police cars?
"Yes. When we stopped, I felt 3 or 4 go by."
Those guys are stranded at a police checkpoint!
They must be near the entrance to the highway,
where the road narrows, at the Beika bridge!
By the Beika bridge, we had to go straight ahead!
Do you think they would risk going through a checkpoint?!
They will avoid the bridge
and try to leave Beika by a secondary road.
-Aaaaaaaaaai! -Aaaaaaaaaaaai!
Run! Run!
(Thinking) "They'll pass this way for sure."
(Ayumi) Oh, we've moved!
We're moving!
(Ayumi) "Okay! I'm waiting for you."
We've been waiting for 5 minutes, they won't come this way.
Hey, Conan!
What's up, huh?
Strange...
Ayumi, has the car stopped, or is it moving?
Hey, hey!
Ayumi!
What's wrong with you?
Ayumi!
Answer me!
"Maybe it's so far away that the transmission has been cut off?"
"No, this transmits within a radius of 20 km."
"They're not far away."
What if they were inside a tunnel?
Beika's tunnel!
They are...
No, they'd have to go through the checkpoint and across the bridge, to get there.
They could be in a building blocking the radio waves.
But... maybe they are to their hideout.
This would be too risky!
The police would catch them!
Idiots!
They would discover the Ayumi before the police found them!
She had seen our faces!
We couldn't leave her alive, even if she was a child.
If something happened to me, you'd protect me, wouldn't you, Conan?
(Think) "Ayumi!"
(Ayumi) Conan, Co...
(Interference)
Conan!
Where are you!?
Hey, hey, Ayumi?
You big shot!
Why didn't you answer me?
"Calm down, Ayumi! Don't talk so loud, they'll feel you!"
"How do you want them to feel me? The car makes a lot of noise."
And you don't know where you are, Ayumi?
No idea!
The noise outside has changed and you weren't answering me.
"The noise has changed? What if it's a tunnel?
"They've gone through the checkpoint? How can it be?"
Anyway, we'll soon catch you.
You be quiet!
(Think) "Hurry up! Hurry up!"
"If we don't hurry, the skateboard will stop!"
(Ayumi) "The car has stopped at some kind of tent."
A tent?
I heard a voice saying "hello" and a strange noise.
A noise?
(Think) "A gas station? What?"
"Ayumi! Let me hear the noise outside!"
Look, today we're giving away towels or Yaiba T-shirts.
(Man) No, thanks.
We are in a hurry.
The ones giving away Yaiba stuff are the ones at the gas station in Yotsuba.
We've passed them!
Let them get ready!
(Man) What?
Conan!
I heard once!
"The Ayumi is in this trunk!"
"With the girl's head and the ransom money!"
"These men are the girls' kidnappers!"
Didn't you hear a strange noise, behind?
It's some guys acting crazy.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ouch!
Oysters... what's going on?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ayumi, what's wrong with you?
"Ayumi! Answer me! Ayumi!"
Something strange is going on.
It must be some cat that got lost.
(Thinking) "You bastards! I won't let you run away."
Oh, no!
-What's the matter? -That won't run!
"The solar power is running out!"
"Before it's all gone we have to..."
I've got it!
Hey!?
What are you kids doing?
Stop the car or I'll pay for it!
What?!
Hey, hey, hey!
Fucking kids!
What the fuck did he want, that kid?
How should I know!
We don't have time!
Get out of the way!
"Geez, my hands are falling asleep."
"I can't take it anymore... I don't have the strength..."
Ayumi!
Ayumi!
Ayumi!
Ayumi!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Hey, it's those kids!
-Deixa'ls!
Come on, let's get the stuff out! -Yes now!
Eh?
But who are you, girl?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
-What are you doing in here?
-No!
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me!
What did you say?
(Think) "Ayumi! I'm coming!" No!
Help me!
Hey!
Be still!
Ayumi!
Run!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ayumi!
Ayumi! Ayumi!
Hello!
I'm so glad you're okay! Ayumi!

We were very worried, Ayumi!
All right, and now...
sign in, you murderous kidnappers!
What?
Murderers?
No need to pretend!
We heard the conversation you had in the car!
It was not known any serious killing little girls like me!
He has the bag with the money and the girl's head!
What? What?
You idiots!
Look at it well!
All this is fake!
They are theater props!
What?
Theatrical props?
The conversation was the rehearsal of the dialogue of the play we do!
The rehearsal of the dialogue?
We're doing a play, here, this afternoon!
"Come to think of it..."
Conan, they're doing an interesting play at the university festival.
Come on, let's go!
Besides, they've announced that the police have caught the murderers!
Inspector Megure!
So... the real killer of the girls has just passed by...
And what do you plan to do with him?
Look, he's unconscious, he's broken his head!
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't move!
What? What?
Now you must take responsibility!
-What does he say what?
-Responsibility?
What does this mean?
(Tune of "Step by step")
DETECTIVE CONAN
(Voice countermanded) Her parents had paid the ransom.
And she was just a child.
(Countermanded voice) She had seen us!
We couldn't leave her alive!
Father, this actor is a bit strange...
Oh, is he?
He walks like ducks, and you can't understand him when he speaks.
Hello, my queen!
Do you want to go for tea?
Come on!
No, thank you very much!
Come on, don't be shy!
I'll tell you about my adventures as a famous detective...
Father, will you please do me a favor, please!?
Genta, the next sentence.
I don't know what it says, they are very complicated words.
Genta, it says "fiercely".
"Well, yes, we were forced to do the play's papers."
"Who replaced the head?"
"It was Ayumi's turn."
I don't like it at all, playing the!
It's death!
My name is Masami Hirota.
I beg you please!
Find my father!
Okay, Miss.
I'll find your father.
Hurry up!
I have to find him soon!
Ran, where are you going?!
Where is she, Masami?
What have you done to her, say?!
The clue to the next Conan: "10 billion yen"
