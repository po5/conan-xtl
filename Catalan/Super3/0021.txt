DETECTIVE CONAN
A movie murder
Impossible...
I didn't want to kill him.
I didn't want to do it...
Noooooo!
(Man) Cut!
That's enough, we'll call the scene good!
Great performance, Yoko!
What fun, shooting a movie!
Yes!
Thank you all so much!
A big star like me, the very famous Shingo Nachi,
is never wrong.
Yoko!
You have done very well!
And now, thank you, Mr. Mouri.
But you gave a great performance!
This film will be a work of art.
Thank you, but we have you to thank for being our advisor.
Yoko is right.
It's an honor to have you.
We've signed the best detective of the century.
The film is guaranteed to be a success.
Come on, it's no big deal!
(thinks) "Look how he swallows it all."
"Here, here and here."
"It's so easy..."
(Child!)
Leave that alone!
Oh, please forgive me, Mr. Nachi!
He should have kept a better watch.
Eh?
You know, you know what?
Since you're so cute, I'll forgive you.
What a thing to say!
Thank you.
(Think) "What a snobby guy!"
Mr. Nachi, is it your hobby, making matchstick figures?
More or less.
A star like me also has intellectual hobbies.
(Thinks) "Ay caramba, caramba..."
Mr. Nachi, you've done very well.
Here's your towel.
Ah... thank you.
Taeko, do you want to have dinner today?
I'm sorry, Taeko.
Come on, woman, we'll be back early.
She won't go.
Don't insist, she's marrying him next month, right?
Yes, well, yes...
You're really getting married?
Congratulations, Miss!
Thank you very much.
The best thing about getting married is not getting married.
So you keep dreaming how wonderful it would be to get married.
You're a scoundrel!
Yuji, no!
He's always making sarcastic remarks, this bastard!
I was just talking in general... I wasn't talking about you two.
Come on, don't get so angry, Yuji.
(malicious laughter)
It's the alarm on my watch. (laughs)
That's a weird noise, isn't it? (laughs)
I bought it last month in the United States.
I can see I'm in the way, so if you'll excuse me....
(thinks) "That's disgusting."
Let's see, this is the footage of....
Taeko, have you finished filming?
Hello grandpa.
Please do me a favor and clean it all up.
Especially this stuff.
Yes, Grandpa, don't suffer anything.
Okay, I trust you.
I didn't know that the priest of this temple was your grandfather.
Yes... I used to live here, when I was little.
Ran, didn't you have to get Shingo's autograph for someone?
The Sonoko will kill me!
Where is he, in Shingo Nachi?!
She's gone to change.
Ostres!
Wait, Ran, wait!
(Enough, accusations!
It was the voice of Mr. Nachi.
Do you have proof?
Of course I do.
You know what I want in exchange for the photos, don't you, Shingo?
A lot of money.
What's the matter with you?
Eh?!
Ah, ah, no, no, nothing!
We're leaving now.
Mr. Mouri, we'll sleep here, tonight.
Do you want to take a bath and have a drink?
I'll go with you!
Father, you'll never change.
Ran and Conan, come with us! Thank you. Thank you.
How awful!
I'm a star, I can't stay in a shabby hotel!
(Think) "I'm a star," is the only one who says."
Gentlemen, I will stay at the Teitan Hotel.
But... Mr. Nachi, come back, don't go away, man!
Come on, Mr. Mouri, drink it all!
Here's your beer.
Hey, Anzai!
Where are you going?!
To clean the cameras, Mr. Gondo.
Go, man, you're a bore!
Yuji, I have to go to Grandpa's house, you don't mind, do you?
Of course not, I'll take care of it.
Ran, you're still young.
You don't need to put on makeup.
Is that so?
(Think) "Mr. Shimazaki..."

Hey, Shimazaki, buy me a pack of cigarettes, please!
Okay, okay, okay.
Come on, Ran, let's go buy something.
But... A star like you shouldn't go out at night.
Don't suffer, that's why.
With a different hairstyle and a hat, they won't recognize me.
(Thinking) "My goodness, I've seen her change."
Are you sure we can do this? Don't be afraid, woman.
(Malicious laughter)
Well, Mr. Anzai is coming out too.
Come on, Ran, don't worry, it'll be fine.
Isn't that...
...Taeko?
Taeko?
Taeko!
Ah, Ran, it's you.... Is there something wrong?
Ah, no, it's nothing.
What's wrong with her?
She looks like she's seen a ghost.
Goodbye and thank you very much.
I told you, that nothing would happen.
You were right.
Nobody recognized you.
What was it, this noise?
A thief who wanted to steal the offerings?
Oh!
Look, look, there's someone on the ground!
Mr. Anzai...
Wow, he's dead!
Quick, call the police, Ran!
Hurry up!
(Thinking) "The hat must have jumped off when he fell...
but this jacket..."
"Eh?"
"Gee!"
"It's the knife they used during filming."
"So, the killer is someone from the film."
"Oysters!"
"The victim's last message."
"Komainu."
"It's a clue to identify the killer?"
Let's see, Ran, have you seen a suspicious figure in the gardens?
Yes... but I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman.
And it was around 2/4 of 11.
The crime must have been committed between 10 and 2/4 of 11.
Inspector, this case will be very easy to solve.
What are you trying to say?
Firstly, the knife was the same as the one in the film.
Secondly, "komainu", guard dog, refers to the shrine!
Based on these two clues, it is obvious...
that the killer is Taeko Mamegaki.
She would be incapable of killing anyone!
Isn't it true that she left the party about an hour ago?
I wanted to go get something from my grandfather's house.
Can anyone confirm this?
No, no one can confirm it: Grandfather wasn't there...
Father, Taeko returned to the inn when Mr. Anzai was leaving.
What do you say now?
So, when she came back, she didn't move from the hall.
Therefore, she can't have done it.
(Thinking) "Let's see if she's perceptive."
Did you find any prints, the murder weapon?
No, it looks like it's been wiped clean.
"That's strange..."
"If he was able to wipe the prints off, why didn't he take it with him?"
Let's see, did any of you leave the hostel between 10 and 2/4 of 11?
-No, I didn't... - No...
Inspector, I went out to buy cigarettes.
What time did you go out? About...
It was 3/4 of 10.
By the way, I looked at my watch when I left.
What time did you come back?
After half an hour.
That means about 1/4 of 11. Yes.
Mr. Nachi, you're the only one at the Teitan Hotel.
I'm a star.
I can't stay in such a low class place.
Of course you can.
But where were you between 10 and 2/4 of 11?
I have been the hotel bar until 10.
And then where did you go?
Well, to my room. Any witnesses?
No, none, I was alone!
"The murderer is someone who works in the film."
"The key is in the word 'komainu',
which the victim supposedly wrote."
"Taeko has the most affinities with the watchdog,
but she came back to the inn when the victim was leaving."
"Come to think of it... why was she so surprised?"
"In Yuji he has gone out at 3/4 of 10 and returned at 1/4 of 11."
"He could have committed the crime himself."
"But we have seen a person in the temple at about 2/4 of 11,
and at that time he had already returned."
"Mr. Nachi has no alibi as of 10 o'clock."
"And you can see that Mr. Anzai was blackmailing him..."
"There's a good chance that the figure we saw was him."
Inspector!
We found this in the victim's room!
Mm?
These are...
Photographs of Mr. Nachi and a woman leaving a motel.
It's Ritsuko Hagiyama, the famous actress!
What's she saying?
Doesn't she know she's married?!
Pictures of an infidelity, huh?
Hey, now that they say this...
Do you know anything?
I think I do.

I've seen the one about Anzai blackmailing Mr. Nachi.
What?
Blackmail?!
Are you sure?!
So you're the murderer, eh!
I didn't do it!
What sense would have, then, the word watchdog?
-Isn't that your nickname? -Idiot!
I'm a big star.
Do you think I would have such a ridiculous nickname?!
"What the hell do you mean, 'komainu'?"
"Just a moment."
"What was the need to write it down?"
"She was killed right in front of the dog?
You could have just pointed it out."
"I got it!"
Besides, the fact that he came clearly proves it!
Look at this!
This handwriting is strange!
It's misspelled!
You're already meddling where you're not wanted!
How many times do I have to say... He's misspelled the letters.
You say he's misspelled them?
Look carefully: this letter should be joined together,
and instead, he has written it separately.
What are you saying?
Mm... You are right.
And the lines of this one here are not connected either!
He may have added later the vertical line of this one
and the horizontal line of this one.
Big star!
Of course, you mean...
to Shingo Nachi!
It seems to me that we have irrefutable proof!
What?
I haven't done it, that.
I admit that I have come here at 2/4 of 11
to meet the Anzai,
but I found him dead!
You are lying, and you know it perfectly well!
It is the truth!
The Anzai was dead!
I got scared and ran away, but I saw "big star",
and in my fright I added lines, as in the match game!
Why did the Anzai write "big star" before leaving?
How should I know?
"One moment...
A person who camouflages a message would try to have an alibi."
"Could it be that it was written by the murderer, this word?"
"I've got it!"
"Maybe... But it's impossible."
"That person couldn't..."
"Eh?!"
"What's this?"
"No blood, on the clock!"
"Yes... now I understand! I've already solved the case!"
It wasn't me!
I am innocent!
You're embarrassing yourself, Mr. Big Star!
You'll tell us your side of the story at the police station.
(Kogoro voice) Wait a minute!
(Kogoro voice) What?
Inspector Megure, the murderer is not Mr. Nachi.
What do you mean?!
It's not because the crime was committed before 10 o'clock.
This is absurd!
What's wrong with you, Father?
We saw Mr. Anzai leaving the inn!
And we felt the alarm on his watch!
Inspector, look at the victim's watch.
The watch?
Let's have a look.
His left arm is covered with blood, but the watch isn't stained, is it?
Oh! Oh, you're right!
You're right, you're right!
It's very clear...
Inspector, this means...
someone has taken his watch right after the murder.
Took his watch?
He wanted to make it look like the time of death was after the murder.
That's why he took it from her at the inn
and set off the alarm in the victim's room.
But to keep it from dripping along the way,
he wiped the blood off the watch.
The person we saw was not...
That's right!
You didn't see Mr. Anzai.
This person sounded the alarm in his room,
put on Mr. Anzai's hat and jacket,
and went out dressed up as Mr. Anzai.
He went to the temple,
put the watch back on
and left the jacket and hat behind.
To imply en Nachi, he wrote "big star".
If he wanted to imply Mr. Nachi, why didn't he write "Nachi"?
There would have been no misunderstanding.
He could not write "Nachi"
because the victim had written letters
that identified his murderer.
Another word ?!
That's right.
He wrote "Nimaime" by adding letters to the original word,
which is the one we're interested in.
What word had the victim written?
The word was...
"Mame."
Taeko Mamegaki...
it's you, the murderer!
What are you saying?!
It wasn't Taeko!
It's unbelievable...
It can't be, this,
because Taeko and the person disguised as Anzai have crossed paths.
It was me!
I killed her!
And I tampered with all the evidence!
I didn't write "Mame"!
Mr. Shimazaki, I believe you tampered with the evidence,

but you didn't kill her.
There was blood all around the crime scene.
The murderer was probably also stained with blood.
And on the other hand, there's not a drop on your clothes.
Taeko was the only one who had enough time to change.
I'm telling you I killed him!
-Yuji... Come on, let him run.
-Taeko!
Mr. Mouri found out the truth.
I murdered her, Mr. Anzai.
No, Taeko!
It's not true...
You didn't know that Mr. Shimazaki had tampered with all the evidence?
No... I didn't.
"That's why I stood so still
when I saw the Anzai leaving the inn."
But why, Taeko ?!
Why did you do that?
(Kogoro voice) Mr. Anzai was blackmailing you too, wasn't he?
Yes.
My parents died in an accident when I was studying,
and I had a hard time.
"I was up to no good."
"I made bells and went with bad company, like the Anzai."
Avi, remember that some very expensive priestly objects went missing
and there was a big scandal?
Eh... Yes...
Well, it was all my fault, grandfather.
I had talked about those objects to the Anzai,
and he and some friends of his...
What are you saying?!
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to tell you... but...
"Mr. Sugiyama, who was in charge of the warehouse,
committed suicide when he found out about the robbery,
and I got so scared...!"
After that, I decided to stop hanging out with them
and went back to class.
I hid that abominable truth....
I thought that Yuji and I would get married and live happily!
And then he showed up again!
And blackmailed him.
Yes, he kept on telling me that I was in the gang
and that I was also responsible for Sugiyama-san's suicide.
I thought he'd ruin my wedding if I didn't do something.
I had arranged to meet the Anzai here at 2/4 of 10
to give him his money.
But I took a knife and threatened him.
I told him I never wanted to see him again!
But he got very angry and attacked me,
and in my fright, without meaning to, I stabbed her.
I didn't want to kill him.
I swear!
I was worried about her because of the face she was making.
And I pretended that I was going to buy cigarettes.
I came to the temple to see her and found the dead Anzai,
with the word "Mame" written on it.
I thought that Taeko had killed her,
and in desperation, I tampered with the evidence.
I erased the fingerprints and took the watch.
The rest is just as you explained, Mr. Mouri.
I remembered that I had seen the Anzai blackmailing in Nachi
and I added a "ni" and a "y" to "Mame".
Forgive me, Yuji, please forgive me!
Taeko...

Oysters!
The room is locked from the inside!
Maybe he committed suicide!
You're wrong!
Kogoro, it's murder!
You again, boy?!
Look, this is the passage of the door!
I firmly believe that the murderer is one of you 7!
