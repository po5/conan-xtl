DETECTIVE CONAN
The art museum murder case
(Man) How scary it is!
The last thing I wanted to do was to guard an art museum at night.
You can't be a security guard, with this attitude.
(Metallic noise) What was that?
Hey, don't scare me, you now!
Don't scare me, you now!
It's coming from that room...
W-who is it?
Is anyone here?
(metallic noise)
A suit of armor from the Middle Ages has moved by itself!?
Two security guards saw it!
The whole neighborhood is talking!
It can be fun.
Let's take a tour of the museum?
The museum invented it to attract visitors.
You're absolutely right, Ran.
It's a children's attraction!
(Thinking) "Well, you're a child..."
Well, let's get to work.
Yes, I'm going to do my homework.
Just a moment!
You're coming with me, right? Yes.
Wow... Ran!
He always uses this technique...
I shouldn't have let him do karate.
Wow!
It's full of beautiful paintings!
Are you glad you came?
The colors are so beautiful!
Miss, do you like this painting?
I like it very much too.
Well looked at, I like all the works of the museum
as if they were my daughters...
Ah, well... and who are you?
Oh... Oh, excuse me.
My name is Ochiai, I'm the director of this museum.
Oh, my goodness!
The director!
Now I understand.
Go quietly and enjoy the paintings.
Kubota!
What are you doing?
Didn't I tell you to wear gloves, to touch the works?!
Ah... I feel bad.
Don't do this job!
Ijima, take care of yourself!
Yes, sir!
As always, empty as always.
Ssenyor Manaka...
10 more days and we'll finally close the museum.
Until then, take good care of the building,
and these balances that they call art.
Mr. architect, let's see the plans.
That they will close, this museum?
Yes, the company of the former owner went bankrupt,
and has sold it to the new owner, in Manaka.
He sold it to him
because he promised to keep the museum,
But when he was headquartered, he announced that he would build a hotel!
(Think) "How badly he treats the works."
You must be in Kubota, right?
I've already heard about you.
You'd better start preparing me a percent of everything.
"Again."
Well, gentlemen, have a good time.
Eh?
"So angry I was..."
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
No trespassing.
That's funny...
There must be another room, this way.
Well, let's see the others.
I'm exhausted... Ran, let's go home.
I'm starving.
It's hopeless.
Are you tired of seeing so many wonders?
Eh?
Wow!
It's gone, the no trespassing sign.
Come on, let's take a look at this last room.
Let's take a look at this last room.
Eeeeh? Eeeeh?
Or go home, but you won't have to prepare the food.
Majadero... turkey...
What a scary room!
It's the hall of Hades.
Oooooh!
What a huge painting!
You can tell it's a painting from hell!
Let's see, it's called "The Heavenly Punishment".
It's about the knight of justice imprisoning a devil.
(dripping)
Eh?
Aaaaah!
It's Mr. Manaka!
You again!?
Yes, sir!
I haven't let anyone touch the victim's body.
Well, has anyone seen the killer?
I've asked everyone myself, but no one has seen anything.
Maybe the security camera must have filmed something.
(Kogoro) Ah, look at him, look at him.
What an idiot he must be.
She doesn't even know she's been filmed by a camera.
Ah, in Manaka.
Come on killer... reveal't!
We'll treat your face well and then... Eh?
Wait a minute!
It rings a bell, this composition.
It's like the painting!
The painting?
It is exposed in front of the victim.
It's called "Heavenly Punishment".
You see, he committed the murder inspired by this painting.
He's a reckless killer.

People would have had a fit if they had seen her wandering around like that.
There was a no trespassing sign in the hallway.
What? Wasn't it around 4 o'clock?
Yes, father, I looked at the clock and it was 4:5.
The time of death is 2/4 of 5!
I'm sure the sign was put up by the killer.
He kept people away with the sign,
put on the armor and waited.
He then warned in Manaka and has murdered her.
The killer is someone who knows the museum well.
In short,
I have to tell you that I think the murderer is one of you!
Look at this!
Manaka does something!
Have you rewound the video without permission, Conan?
It stops when he sees it,
and as the killer makes a leap forward...
...he notices something and pulls the label off the wall!
And picks up the pen from the table!
He writes something!
Did he throw the pen away?
And the label?
He crushes it with his hand!
Couldn't it be...? Even if he had it in his hand?
The victim has this paper in his hand.
This could be it!
Ku... Kubota!
What are you doing, my name, here?
You have put on the armor to hide from the camera,
but the victim realized who you were.
No!
It wasn't me!
Then tell us what you were doing at 2/4 of 5, when the murder was committed.
I was alone in the office
I was alone in the office, doing the work the director had asked me to do.
Yes, that's right, I gave you a job to do.
So... if you were in your office, no one saw you.
Please, just a moment.
I had no reason to kill the owner.
Mr. Kubota, don't pretend anymore.
I was sneaking the artwork in,
and the owner was pressuring her
to give her a good portion of the money!
Is it true, all this?
Listen, one thing has nothing to do with the other!
It doesn't matter.
If my men find the armor,
we'll have a clearer picture of everything.
Inspector Megure!
There's a pen, here on the ground!
What do you say?
I congratulate you, kid!
Mmm!
It's a very good pen.
It's the commemorative pen
of the fiftieth anniversary of the Beika Art Museum.
All the members have one just like it.
Well, Mr. Director, there's one to lose here.
The color and the stroke are the same.
Surely the victim has used it.
(Think) "How strange."
"In Kubota must have known that the camera was there."
"Why did he choose this room,
if here he had to hide who he was and put on the armor?"
"Why should the scene have looked like the painting?"
"No, it didn't seem to interest him, the art."
"Would he make life so complicated, a person like him?"
Oh!
What anguish!
It's like watching a scary movie.
Ah, excuse me, gentlemen....
But child, you can't enter this room!
It's just that Inspector Megure says you have to go and help.
Eh?
Maybe they've seen us watching the video.
-What do you say, now!
Shall we go?
-(Adult voice) Yes!
(Adult voice) Start here.
What do you mean, this face?
You look at the label, and you're so surprised?
He just wrote and throws the pen?
Yes, because this noise surely gave him away a lot.
Wait a minute...
When I found the pen...
...the tip was hidden!
(Thinking) "How strange..."
"It's not normal that a person who sees that she's going to be murdered coming
would bother to close the pen."
"Or maybe..."
I leave it to your hands.
Yes, sir.
Aaaah!
Eh?
"There's a mark on the paper!"
"I was right!"
"Now I've solved the mystery."
Hey, you!
What are you doing, kid?
(We found it!
It was in Kubota's closet.
So you've already found it!
How-how can that be?
I didn't put it in, me!
Now we have two pieces of evidence that incriminate her.
This armor full of blood
and the last message from the unfortunate victim!
"You're wrong!"
"It's not the last message!"
"It's a trap the murderer has used to pin the blame on Kubota!"
It's full of blood.
What a pity that he has destroyed such a valuable work of art.
No, it's just a replica.
But I'm sure it's the one Mr. Kubota was moving this afternoon.
I remember.
"So it was a replica."

"That's why he didn't get angry, the director,
when Kubota threw the helmet to the ground."
Lucky us, that the armor of the murder was a replica.
And I will also have saved other works of art.
"On second thought...
the wall where the murder was committed..."
"There are the labels, but not the paintings!"
"The murderer has removed them before committing the crime
to protect them from the blood spatter."
"Surely the murderer is someone from the museum."
"But... the thing wouldn't have worked out
if someone hadn't blown Kubota's alibi."
"And the only one who can do it is....
...the director!"
"If I'm not very much mistaken....
...the killer might still have them."
Well, Mr. Kubota,
you'll have to accompany us to the police station.
No way!
Aiiiiiiiiiiii!
I'm pissing myself!
I'm pissing myself!
The toilet, the toilet, the toilet, the toilet!
Sir, where is the toilet?
He leaves the room, turns to the right,
down the stairs and then...
Oh!
I will not remember everything!
Draw me a map!
Quick, quick, quick!
Look, first you go out and then...
What's wrong with you, sir?
Why do not you write?
I get it!
You already knew from the beginning that this pen wouldn't write.
But it's strange.
Why do you carry a pen that doesn't write?
A pen... A pen that doesn't write?
If the pen he used in Manaka didn't write,
then this last message should be...
...a blank piece of paper.
Look, aren't there some strange marks here?
Mmm?
There are marks like those made by a pen that doesn't write.
Of course there are!
Maybe he tried to cross out the words that were written on it
with a pen that didn't write.
This child...
Of course!
These words were not written in Manaka!
This was already written by the murderer!
What?
But then, why did he take the label, in Manaka?
Very simple, sir.
The murderer before acting has said to Manaka:
"Look at the label behind you!"
"There's the killer's name written on it."
It said: "Kubota".
The owner, frightened, picked up the pen from the table
and tried to cross out the name
and write the name of the person who had made her come to the room.
But he was unable to write it,
because the murderer had previously left a pen without ink.
Therefore, Manaka got rid of the pen and crumpled the paper.
and crumpled the paper.
The murderer used a video that did not have sound
and a pen that did not write,
to give us a false picture of the facts.
It was the killer's alibi!
But, Kogoro look, the pen we found writes.
The pen, when I found it, had the tip hidden, right?
Ah, now that you mention it...
How strange.
A person who sees coming that she will be killed does not close a pen.
Yes, but what if the murderer had changed the pen afterwards?
And had forgotten to leave it open on the table?
Well, the person who has the pen that does not write is the murderer.
In other words...
Director Ochiai...
the prime suspect is you.
What, will you tell us the truth?
Your 2/4 out of 5 alibi, the time of the murder?
Ah... D-director...
It's true, my lords.
At that time, I had a meeting scheduled.
I was impatiently waiting for the corrupt devil to show up,
dressed in armor.
The rest, Mr. detective, you have already explained it very well.
But it is very strange,
that you didn't remember the camera!
You are wrong, I remembered.
"When he moved while I jumped forward."
"There where the label was, the pen..."
All the details were calculated.
Because I had rehearsed it many times.
The rumor about the armor moving was true.
They must think it's crazy,
but it was necessary to get Manaka off our backs at once.
That devil wanted to take the works of art,
which I love as if they were my own daughters,
and destroy this valuable museum.
And, Kubota, you who were selling the works of art to yourself
I also wanted to punish you.
Unlike the painting,
it seems heaven has punished you too, Director Ochiai.

No sir, it is exactly as in the picture.
In that painting,
the devil is killed by the knight of justice,
but the knight, covered in the devil's blood,
is also tainted with evil.
Whatever my motivation,
in the end I also become a devil.
Because I have not deceived the pure eyes of a young justice.
The eyes of a young justice?
Kid, don't you have to go to the bathroom anymore?
Eh?
Ah...

DETECTIVE CONAN
Eh?
And they will turn the museum into a hotel?
After that incident,
the citizens have protested against the closure.
(Matsuhiko) They are right.
There are few cultural centers here.
-(Matsuhiko) I don't like it. What's not funny?
That Conan and Mouri are the only ones that have become famous.
Man, this is...
I got it!
There's a skeleton running around the school at night.
Some people have seen it, right?
Nobody knows if it's true.
The junior detective patrol goes into action!
-We're going to the school tonight! -Yes, yes, yes!
But, but what do you do!
Conan, you're coming too!
Geez, leave me alone!
(He thinks) "I have no doubt! The murderer is this man!"
"But why is he smiling so confidently?"
"What alibi is there, in that chamber?"
Look!
I made it, this picture!
