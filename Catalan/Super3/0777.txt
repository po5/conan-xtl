The Ai made a better face, didn't he?
Yes, he said his fever has gone down.
I guess she'll be able to come to school on Monday.
Then we didn't have to come all the way here to see her.
(Man) You're the best detective patrol ever!
Thank you so much.
I can't thank you enough.
He-he!
You're welcome, ma'am.
No need to thank us.
For Senior Citizen Detectives,
looking for stolen property is like a piece of cake.
-Yes.
-Isn't it, guys? -Yeah.
-Yes. -Yes.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
Very good, very good.
These detectives have found a stolen bicycle?
But they're too big to do this!
Well, they sure are.
"Detectives of the Third Age", are they called?
We created this patrol
to ensure the peace and safety of the people in the neighborhood.
-Txan!
-Txan!
-Txan!
-Txan!
The Detectives of the Third Age!
Eh?
So, you're a group of elderly detectives, huh?
"The years we've spent together are a springboard."
"And we're going full speed ahead without slowing down."
"Unexpected rivals appear
that unsettle the Junior Detective League."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a kid, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The Junior Detective League vs. the Senior Detectives."
So you're the famous Junior Detective League, huh?
Famous, you say?
Gee...
Mutsuhiko Akasaka.
Nice to meet you.
Mutsuhiko?
You're at Mitsuhiko, aren't you?
Our names are alike, and besides, we're both sensible...
and avoid taking risks whenever we can.
We avoid taking risks, you say?
He-he!
My name is Ginta Oshima.
Ginta?
Yes.
And, like you, I'm a cheerful person who only thinks about food.
Ha-ha-ha!
Who do I know who only thinks about food?
My name is Yasuko Emoto, and I'm exactly like you, Ayumi.
I'm the only girl in the group and all I do is scream.
Oh!
She says all I do is call out!
And I call myself Eitaro Tokunaga,
and in case any of you haven't figured it out yet,
I'm just like you, aren't I, Conan?
No need to push the comparisons so hard.
Attention, Detectives of the Third Age!
Let's go on security patrol!
Let's go!
-Yes! -Yes!
-Yeah!
He-he!
"The Junior Detective League versus the Senior Detectives."
-Something must be up.
-What's this? -What's this?
Well, we'll call Conan, come on.
Thank you very much for letting us know what happened.
But you guys are...
I don't believe it!
How can it be that these old men were the first to arrive?
Eh? (Takagi) Vo-vos?
(Takagi) Y-you?
(Thinking) "Looks like things are getting complicated again."
Let's see, but... how can it be that they found the body
if it was inside a private house?
It is that I was going down the street
and I saw a man throwing a cigarette butt on the ground in front of me.
Hey, the cigarette butt!
Hey, the cigarette butt!
Ah!
When I called out to him, he pushed me to the ground.
And I called the members of the Detectives of the Third Age.
And we all searched for that rascal together.
Mm-hm.
He went that way!
It's over there!
Look, I think he went inside that house over there.
-That one over there?
-Huh?
Yes.
-Yes.
-Yes, in that one.
Then we separate selected and try to find it.
-What's the matter?
-Ah!
Oh!
Oooh!
Hey, a murder's just been committed!
-We'd better call an ambulance.
-Let's get the police.
-Ah.
Yes.
-In case he's still breathing.
Oh!
-Do you think he's still alive?
-What do you think?
No.
He's as good as dead.
Oh!
Dead!
Okay, then.
The victim was the owners' only son.

Kiyomasa Kuroda, 22.
He was hit in the head with a sculpture.
He died about an hour before these gentlemen found him.
So I don't understand...
Why were you scolding them, Inspector Megure, when we arrived, Takagi?
It was the first time I saw the scene of a crime and...
Aaaah!
How scary!
Aaaah!
Ah!
He must have been attacked with it!
Yes, probably with this tip...
They have destroyed the scene of the crime,
which should always be left intact;
all four of them.
-Very serious.
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.
Hey, what happened to that rascal you were looking for?
Eh?
Did you manage to find him in the end?
That's right, I didn't remember.
That's right, you didn't.
I guess he must have taken advantage
that we were distracted by the murder to escape.
Ah.
What I don't understand is why he had to run away...
if he only scolded him because he'd thrown a cigarette butt on the ground.
You're right, he must have done something else.
He looked very suspicious:
sunglasses, Hawaiian shirt, dyed blond hair...
and he also had a scar.
-A scar?
-Right here.
As if it had been cut with a razor.
Let me remember...
Yes, it's true.
I've seen it too.
He was a tall, thin man, wasn't he?
Yes, that's right, he was a tall, thin man.
Hm, yes, I remember him too, he was a tall, thin young man.
I have more information about Kiyomasa Kuroda.
He didn't have a very good reputation.
People in the neighborhood say he was a bum with no job.
It is seen that he sucked money from someone and lived off the top.
So, maybe the crime was committed by the person he sucked money from.
Yes.
We're following this line of investigation, guys.
All right, let's go!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
All right! [Laughs]
Look, uh,
this car must have been bought by sucking money out of people.
Oh! (Laughs)
But anyway, we don't know for sure.
It's up to us to show what we're capable of.
And chances are the killer
wants to get rid of anything that might incriminate.
We'll find something, some clue that will lead us to the killer!
Let's go, then!
It's not possible to find something like that, just because it suits you, don't you think?
Hey, why don't we go ask around the neighborhood if they've seen anyone suspicious?
-Yes! -Yes!
-Yeah, good idea!
"He-hey! They're in a competitive vein."
If someone wanted to get rid of something,
the quickest way would be to throw it in the river.
Hm?
Mm?
Oh, it's the glasses our suspect was wearing!
What?
And here's a smudge...
Oh!
Must be...
Ooh...
Well, I guess they didn't find anything.
(sirens) - Huh?
- (sirens)
What, did you find something interesting?
(sirens) Huh?
Yeah, I did.
The Detectives of the Third Age
found the glasses of the man they saw running away stained with blood.
We analyzed the blood
and found that it was the victim's, in Kuroda!
What?
In other words, the person who committed this crime...
is the same man we were chasing and who has escaped from us.
Mm-hm.
Ah!
"He has entered the victim's house,
committed the crime and quietly fled."
But he suddenly realized
that he'd left something behind and had to go back in the ordinary.
"He went back into the house,
got rid of the evidence and fled again."
"And when the murderer realized
that there was blood of the victim to the glasses,"
he threw them into the riverbed to get rid of the evidence.
This explanation has its logic.
Yes, it does.
Yes.
Uh..., could you give me a description of this man?
Ros, and in a Hawaiian shirt.
With an elongated scar here.
-Yeah, very tall and thin, and very young.
-He was a very tall, thin guy.
So, let's get down to business!
You've made a great discovery, besides finding the stolen bicycle!
Yes.
These grandparents are way ahead of us.
Yeah, it's depressing.
Oh! (Laughs)
What, what's the matter, Conan?
It just... doesn't it all seem to fit together too well?
Do you?
If you look at it that way, maybe it is a little too well rounded.
These Detectives of the Third Age have had too much luck, haven't they?
Yes, and besides,
how come they suddenly decided to form a detective patrol?

Hm?
There's something creaking here.
Eh?
You mean the theft of the bike yesterday?
Yes.
How did they manage to find it so quickly?
Uh, well... let's see...
Mr. Tokunaga sensed that someone was saying
that a red bicycle had been stolen a short while ago,
and so we all started looking for it.
Mr. Tokunaga deduced
that the thief had disposed of the bicycle in a particular place.
And he was right!
Ah, so Mr. Tokunaga figured out where it was!
No...
I just told the police, that my bicycle had been stolen,
I couldn't think of anything else.
But even so, he knew it had been stolen, too.
Thank you!
These detectives are fantastic.
Hm.
We'd better investigate it separately.
-Yeah.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
Wait, wait, wait!
Come on, we're all here.
Let me start.
The Senior Citizens Detective Patrol
was formed only about a month ago.
In Tokunaga made an announcement in the city newsletter.
(Ayumi) So he created it.
You mean this one, right?
But what I haven't been able to find out is the motive
that made him decide to create the detective patrol.
He-he!
This is what I found out!
Heh?
About a month ago,
a woman who lived next door to Mr. Tokunaga's house died.
Her name was Tae Kano and she lived alone,
and she fell down the stairs at the station and hit her head.
It seems that she was returning from the bank
after having withdrawn the sum of 3 million yen.
It is likely that she was pushed by someone who wanted to take her money.
And to find the culprit,
Mrs.
Tokunaga created the Senior Citizen Detective Patrol.
I'm sorry, but your theory is not possible.
Why not?
How come?
The death of that old lady, Mrs. Kano,
was undoubtedly an accident.
The reason that made her fall down the stairs of the station
was that she had broken her leg.
So, no one wanted to do any harm to the woman?
Eh?
Wait a minute!
She broke her leg
because days before a car had hit her crossing a street.
Mr.
Tokunaga set up the Senior Citizen Detective Patrol...
to try to find the reckless driver who ran her over.
I don't know... I don't think that's why either.
Oh!
Because I found out
who the driver of the car that hit her was.
It was precisely in Kiyomasa Kuroda,
who died today, killed by a blow to the head!
-Eh?
-Eh?
But they say that he got along very well with her after the accident.
So well, that the woman did not want to report it.
"A few days later that woman died
after taking 3 million yen out of the bank."
Oh!
"That money maybe..."
It looks like she was sucking money from someone and living off the top of her head.
"Despite his reputation, he was very kind to her."
"Maybe... it was all set up?"
"Sure."
Hm?
Hm.
Conan, what?
-Explain it to us!
-Did you find out something?
Yes.
As for the description of the assassin,
except for the Tokunaga, the rest didn't seem very reliable.
You're right.
And it's not that they don't remember because of their age.
It's the same thing that happens in "The emperor's tobacconist".
What are you talking about?
A box to put cigarettes in?
"The Emperor's Tobacco Box is a mystery novel.
It was written by John Dickson Carr,
a writer of detective novels
known as "the master of locked room crime."
Oooh!
I can't find that scoundrel.
And I've looked everywhere.
It seems to me that you are wasting your time.
Where did he go?
Eh?
You can look for him, even under the stones,
but you won't find him anywhere.
Eh?
Why do you say this, if I may ask?
Let's see,
was that man really blond and wearing a Hawaiian shirt?
Yes.
He really was.
And did he really have an elongated scar on his face?
-And he was young?
Was he really like that?
-And that he was tall and thin?
(At the same time) Yes, really!
Could you tell us what he looked like, the Hawaiian shirt he was wearing?
Uh...
It was printed with little palm trees.
And yellow.
-It was sky blue.
-It was red.
See?
You said 3 different colors.
That's because...

This is what happens in a famous mystery novel.
A character appears who has not seen anything,
but there is one who insists that he has seen something,
and in the end he ends up convinced that he has seen it.
It is impossible that they have seen it
because this suspect doesn't exist to begin with.
Right, Mr. Tokunaga?
Hm?
What do you mean by that, handsome?
Mr. Tokunaga, you knew the man they killed,
in Kyomasa Kuroda, didn't you?
After he ran over your neighbor, Mrs. Tae Kano, right?
But who is... Mrs. Tae Kano?
Answer me, Mr. Tokunaga.
Is it true that you knew her, the victim?
Probably Mr. Tokunaga couldn't forgive Mr. Kuroda
because he knew that he had expressly run over Mrs. Tae Kano.
And he saw how, by playing the good person,
won Mrs. Kano's heart,
and deceived her with sweet and kind words to get money from her.
(Kano) Aaah!
When he came back from the bank with the money,
Mrs. Kano fell down and died,
so it was as if she died because of Mr. Kuroda's evil deeds.
Kuroda.
That's why Mr. Tokunaga
decided to take revenge on Mr. Kuroda;
and kill him.
Eh?
That's not true.
I wouldn't do something like that.
And since he didn't care if there were witnesses,
you decided the best thing to do was to kill him at home.
I'd be arrested,
because they would surely find my remains at the crime scene.
That's why you decided that it would be you who would discover the body.
Because if there were any clues left there, your...
everyone would believe that you had left it behind when you found the body.
But since the police are usually suspicious
the person who finds the body, I couldn't find it alone.
Besides, to discover the body he would have to go inside the house,
and he needed a good reason to do so.
So he came up with the idea of creating the Senior Citizen Detective Patrol.
Mm?
He waited for an opportunity...
and today, when Kuroda was alone at home because he had the family on vacation,
he looked for an excuse to go see his house.
"And when he let his guard down, she killed him."
"He has left the scene of the crime,
"He threw Kuroda's blood-stained glasses into the riverbed,
and gathered the members of the detective patrol."
Look, it seems to me that he went inside that house.
-In that one over there?
-Huh?
Yes.
-Yes. -Yes.
-Yes, in that one.
Using the excuse of looking for a non-existent delinquent,
they entered his house, and discovered the corpse all together.
While pretending to investigate the case,
he manipulated all the objects
that could have the non-existent murderer's fingerprints on them,
and then told the police that you had done it unintentionally.
In short, you created this patrol...
in order to find the corpse together
and thus avoid being the prime suspect in the crime.
You only created it as a cover to hide your crime, didn't you?
-It's not possible...
-Lord Tokunaga, you... -Hey, Conan, that's...
-Hey, Conan, what you're saying...
-What this little guy is saying is...
Then, in order to pin the crime on a non-existent murderer,
I needed to find the sunglasses.
But finding such a necessary clue so quickly
would have been too much of a fluke;
so he created a precedent.
He stole a bicycle and made it look like he found it by chance.
For starters, I assure you I had never seen the victim to date.
But you knew his car?
How did you know what Kuroda's car was?
Eh?
Look,
this car must surely have been bought by sucking money out of people.
You waited for the opportunity to confront him, didn't you?
Hm.
They'll find out eventually.
Sooner or later they're gonna figure out
that one of the people who discovered the body and the victim
had some common ground.
And when they realize it, they won't take it as a coincidence.
They will focus the investigation on you,
and some concrete evidence will eventually turn up that will give you away.
By the time this happens it will be too late.
But there is still time to fix it now!
If you go to the police now, before they suspect you, you will have given yourself up voluntarily!
you will have given yourself up voluntarily!
And this could reduce your sentence!
Na-nanos, salary...

We just want him to acknowledge his guilt
and serve the penalty for what he has done.
Mr. Tokunaga.
After Mrs. Kano died,
I came to pay her a visit in Kuroda.
If she hadn't broken her leg...
Maybe I should go put some incense on it, don't you think?
That useless old woman...
Gee, she could have died after giving me the money!
The 3 million yen?
Anyway, I just caught another easy prey with the car.
Ha-ha-ha!!!
And I found out that everything had been planned.
Poor woman... Mrs. Kano...
I am so sorry.
I've used them and I'm very sorry...
This is not important.
Don't worry about it.
Now it's time to go to the police.
Come on, the three of us will go with you.
Yes, before it's too late.
Dear guys, thank you very much.
