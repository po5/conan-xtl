"Ran, Sonoko and Masumi found a dead body....
while on their way to school."
What happened?
Well, it turns out we were looking for her because she didn't show up at work
and we found her passed out here.
And she's got blood coming out of her mouth.
We called the ambulance just in case.
-What?
-The ambulance won't be able to do anything.
According to my calculations, this man has been dead for about 9 hours.
What?!
Besides, he must have been an alcoholic, right?
Y-yes...
The doctor told him that he had to stop drinking, but...
And how do you know that?
He has jaundice.
See-the whites of his eyes.
And, although he's thin, his belly is swollen.
It's called ascites, and it shows that he had a diseased liver.
Also, in the drawer of the vending machine...
is an unopened can of beer.
Given the circumstances,
it's very likely he bought it himself just before he died.
Alcoholics can vomit blood
when their esophageal varices burst due to cirrhosis,
and when he started to feel sick
he was alone and could not call for help.
This is the logical conclusion, but it was not a natural death.
This man died at the hands of a murderer.
This is evidenced by what is right in front of the corpse, look.
The word "death" written in blood.
Eh?
"Next to the corpse was the symbol for the word 'death'."
"It was identical to the symbol of a case my father, in Yusaku Kudo,
"was investigating 10 years ago,
although he didn't identify the culprit."
"We called Inspector Takagi
because he will help us find the similarities between the two cases..."
(Takagi) Ah, the corpse this morning?
I really don't know where the body was taken.
We determined that it was a robbery
and referred the case to another department.
A robbery?
Are you sure it wasn't a murder?
Are you kidding us, or what?!
Where did you get that, the robbery?!
You've seen it too, haven't you, the "dead" symbol?
"D-In fact, I thought so too, that it could be a macabre murder."
"But Inspector Megure,
"Who arrived when you had already left,
saw the symbol written in blood..."
and said that it was a robbery.
(Think, see Shinichi) "A robbery instead of a murder?"
This is very strange.
Inspector Megure was also there 10 years ago,
it would have been normal for him to have considered it a serial murder.
"The Ran is right."
"In Megure also saw that symbol written in blood years ago."
"Then why?"
"And what did the father say to the boy who had found the body?"
"They were both smiling."
"I don't understand."
"How come the father was so sure it wasn't murder?"
"Why?"
"Of love and crimes there always are: they are repeated every day."
"The father left an investigation open."
"What mystery is hidden behind the mysterious symbol?"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The open case of in Yusaku Kudo (part two)"
What if the police knew who the culprit was?
Could it be that he was covering up?
That's what usually happens in movies and series!
He's a big shot in the police or a member of high society
and they can't stop him no matter how hard they try!
"Look who's talking, the rich girl from the Suzuki group."
I don't know.

I would find it very strange if Shinichi's father
would have stopped investigating the case for a reason like this.
-And why doesn't he ask for help?
-Of course, you're right.
Eh?
A on Kinich, your fellow amateur deductionist.
"Eh? Kinich?"
Eh?
Ah, yes... I hadn't thought of that.
Come on, come on!
Don't talk nonsense!
If we have to ask anyone for help, it should be Shinichi Kudo!
He's a teenage detective and your boyfriend, too.
Is that so?
Even if he's investigating a case far away from home right now.
and that's why we haven't seen her yet.
Ah!
So the owner of this house is the famous teenage detective?
What?
But you're living in his house!
-No.
-Don't tell me you didn't know?
The Ran told me that the Shinichi who lived in this house
was an ordinary high school student, the kind that doesn't stand out.
Besides...
Rumor has it that the famous teenage detective Shinichi Kudo
died investigating a case
and that no one has seen him in action since.
A-that's what you heard?
Yes.
That's why I thought
that the Shinichi you talk about from time to time was someone else.
How can he be dead?
I've already collaborated with him on two different investigations.
I've only talked on the phone, though.
-Right, Conan?
-Mm.
Yes, it's true.
Ha-ha!
So, who's in Kinich?
Look, it's just that... Shinichi kind of asked me...
not to give you too many details of his private life...
I-I made that up.
Anyway..,
I don't understand where this rumor that Shinichi is dead came from.
Well, it must be because he doesn't appear in public
and doesn't want those involved in a case to know that he's investigating it.
It seems to me that he does this
so that the culprits won't get defensive when they see him.
Hmm... He must feel like a ninja infiltrating the enemy's castle.
A ninja?
Ran, why don't you try playing a trick on him?
Eh?
Eh?
I'd love to hear your opinion.
Ah.
I-I already sent him an email earlier with a summary of the case.
Yeah, but you still haven't told him...
that the police are investigating it as a robbery, have you?
No, I haven't.
Besides, some things are better said in person.
What's that?
Since you have to call him, why don't you tell him how you feel about him?
What?!
What?
I've... I have to go to the toilet!
"I can't believe it!"
Mm-hm.
Go on, call him!
Ah, if you talk to him, can you tell him something for me?
Eh?
Ah, Shinichi?
It's me, l-Ran.
"Y-yes. What happened?"
About it, is it okay for me to call you now?
Does it have something to do with the case you saw this morning?
Conan wrote me a little while ago
to tell me that the police are investigating it as a robbery.
"Y-yes."
And I also wanted to... I wanted to tell you something else.
(Flow) tell him... that you like it!
"O-another thing?"
"What else did you want to tell me?"
I-it's that...
I like you very, very, very, very, very much.
I like you very much!
Uh... I... I...
Mmmm...
I...
He told me... he told me... he told me in Subaru...
What?
How? What?
He... He told me in Subaru that you're like a ninja,
like in SAIZ Kirigakure.
It can't be.
"He asked me to tell you."
(Thinks) "In Saiz Kirigakure?"
Yes.
Because it's always hidden, right?
Y-yeah, I guess.
B-but why are you talking to him about it, now?
"In Saiz Kirigakure he was one of the Ten Braves of Sanada."
"He was a legendary ninja of the Iga school
Who served under Yukimura Sanada."
"Wait a minute!"
"Yukimura Sanada.... Sanada is a fortification."
"Or some traditional cordons."
"Sanada... Sanada!"
"I've got it! I've discovered the truth about the case!"
Eh?
"Go back to this morning's crime scene."
What?
Wait, Shinichi!
If my theory is correct, everything will fit.
(thinks) "Sure. Now I understand everything."
Wait a minute, Shinichi.
What happened?
Shinichi.
Shinichi!
Oh, my...
He just hung up.
He just hung up?!
But you haven't declared yourself yet!
Did he tell you anything new about the case?
He says he's found out the truth
and that we have to go back to the place where the body was.

And he has also told me that, if his theory is correct,
it should all fit together.
So, he has found out why his father, in Yusaku Kudo,
left the research halfway through 10 years ago.
Eh?
He didn't leave it half done.
Shinichi told me that he knew it had happened
but he didn't tell anyone.
Conan, but how...?
You talked to Shinichi?
But I've been talking to him on the phone until now!
Ah... it's just that right after he hung up he sent me an email.
Couldn't he have explained it to Ran?
Couldn't you?
I-It's just that...
Hmm?
Conan, how come you're wearing a ribbon on your cell phone?
"Gee, I forgot to take it out!"
Oh, that?
It's just that... it's very fashionable at school lately.
Be that as it may,
the only way to check if your deduction is correct
is the crime scene.
It's true, isn't it,
teenage detective Shinichi Kudo?
This is what he said, isn't it?
It's true.
Let's take a look.
Y-yes.
You have to come too, Conan.
En Kudo has emailed you his theory, hasn't he?
Well... yes.
As we imagined, there's no one from the police.
If they've decided to investigate the case as a robbery,
it's normal for them to be long gone.
But if someone turns up dead
and there is a symbol in front of the corpse that he can't have written himself,
as is the case with this character meaning "dead",
everything seems to indicate that it is a homicide.
Yes.
Ran, can I borrow your purse, please?
Eh?
Yes.
Hey, you, you're not old enough to buy beer yet!
No, I'm not!
I'm just doing what Shinichi told me to do.
If we put the coins like this,
covering the holes of the symbol written in blood,
they match perfectly, don't they?
Oh!
Wow!
But why?
Because no one has written it, the symbol.
The blood has fallen on the coins that were scattered on the floor
and drew this shape.
But wait a minute, what about the long, straight space in between?
And now don't tell me that the blood has expressly avoided it.
No.
It's the place where the cigarette was supposed to land.
Remember that it was stained with blood?
Besides, if the wallet fell to the ground...
and stood around the coins,
we've already got a complete picture.
Oh!
So, the man who turned up dead this morning....
"Came in last night to buy a beer,
"had a burst esophageal varicose vein that made him vomit blood.
"And dropped his wallet with coins and a cigarette on the floor,
which were stained with blood from his mouth."
"Once dead,
"Someone passing by must have stolen the wallet and the coins,
and only the mark was left on the ground."
That was it, then.
And couldn't it be that the person who stole the money had killed him?
I don't think so.
They must have stolen them when the blood had already dried completely.
Otherwise, the symbol would not have been so well drawn.
So, it was really a robbery!
Yes.
Tell me, Conan, how did you figure it out?
I-I'm not the one who found out the truth, but Shinichi.
Subaru's words turned on the light bulb.
Yes, he asked me to tell Shinichi that he was like a ninja,
like in SAIZ Kirigakure.
This is what he told me.
And what is it, that the ninja were in the habit of writing symbols in blood?
It is not that.
The ninja Saiz was one of the Ten Brave of Sanada.
The emblem of the Sanada clan is 6 coins.
That's how I learned that the blood drawing was not a symbol,
but a mark that had come out by chance thanks to the coins.
What do you mean?
Eh... Vu-I mean that's how Shinichi has known.
But the case 10 years ago was an accident, wasn't it?
"The director of a kindergarten stumbled
while walking in the park."
"The fish tank he was carrying broke
and one of the shards of glass stuck in his heart."
Hey!
Wait a minute!
That it was also a robbery, maybe?
In the photograph of the scene of the crime 10 years ago
there were the flowers brought as an offering by the boy who found the body,
but there was no cigarette.
Also, Shinichi didn't tell me....
that the victim's wallet had been stolen.
So, the case 10 years ago was a murder?

No, in that case 6 coins were also involved.
What?
See: the boy who found the body was named Ryosuke Nishimura.
It was he who found his teacher in the park,
lying on the ground and motionless.
When he realized that he was dead, he brought him some flowers...
and left him the six coins he would need to cross the Sanzu River.
T-the Sanzu River?
But he was only a 5-year-old boy!
-Yes, but he was the son of a priest.
-Mm-hm.
They'd probably told his parents.
Ah.
If the deceased doesn't carry the 6 coins,
old Datsueba, who lives by the river,
will tear her clothes
and send her straight to hell.
The boy, who somehow knew the legend,
left 6 coins next to the corpse of the master
and hid them under a bunch of flowers so that no one could take them away.
B-but even if he was the son of a priest,
I doubt very much that such a little boy would carry money.
He didn't, that's why he used another object.
What object?
Hm?
Yes.
You don't remember what the child in the photo was carrying?
Ah!
Candy!
Yes!
He replaced the coins for candy,
put them next to the corpse's left hand and covered them up.
"But the blood that continued to ooze from the corpse
"slid down the two sides of the thumb
and casually left that macabre mark on the floor."
This explains why no one saw it
until they moved the body a little.
"Before the body was moved, the symbol was covered under the left hand."
"That's why they found blood on the victim's palm and fingers,
although in the photo he no longer has his hand over the bloodstain."
I get it!
It was the thumb that formed the long, narrow space in the middle!
There is one thing I don't understand:
How come there is no candy to be seen in the photo?
I guess they were all gone
because they had been eaten by the little dog the boy was taking care of.
The one who scattered the flowers.
The dog in the photo of the report is not wearing a collar,
and his food dish has three pieces of candy in it.
But if Shinichi's father knew everything,
how come he didn't tell the truth?
Because he rumored
that the symbol written in blood was the mark of a serial killer.
Depending on how you look at it,
it can be interpreted as a prank in bad taste.
and the boy could have received very harsh criticism for what he had done.
I guess that's why he decided it was better not to tell the truth.
When Inspector Megure saw the symbol this morning,
he realized right away that it was a drawing made by 6 coins.
Yusaku had to be told the truth.
Eh?
Yes, but not only Megure.
That day I saw the father talking to the child.
They were both smiling.
He was supposed to tell him something like...
If it hadn't been for you,
the director wouldn't have been able to go to heaven.
Really?
But the next time you make an offering
you'd better ask the parents' permission first.
Yes, I will.
And don't tell anyone what happened today, okay?
If old Datsueba suspects
that she's got cavities because of your candy, she'll be angry.
I imagine the conversation must have gone something like that.
And I'm a lot calmer
now that I know the father didn't leave the investigation half done.
You're... in Conan, right?
Y-yes.
Ah... I was just reading the e-mail Shinichi sent me.
Come on, come on!
Don't scare me, please!
As if I didn't scare you enough, you and him...
I didn't mean to.
What a pity.
Well, too bad.
We have solved the case
but we still don't know who stole the victim's wallet.
If you want a clue,
I found a bloodstained coin under the machine.
-If it's stained with blood... -If it's stained with blood...
-Hmm? -Yeah.
Yes.
The culprit would have dropped it when he picked up the other coins
and went under the machine.
But if there are fingerprints and the thief has a record...
(Man) Yes, he does.
-Assault.
-Assault.
Blackmail.
(Man) Huh?
Between the three of us, we have three accumulated crimes.
In fact, with this robbery, it's not three but four.
That's why we'd better get back what we've lost.
Come on, it's only 10 yen out of thin air!
And then we'll show you three a good time...
All right, then.
Take it!
-Oh!
-Hey!
Oh, crap!

Who do you think you are?
Ah!
Shit.
You brat!
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
Stop it!
It's over.
Eh?
Aah!
Case is closed!
Job done.
The... the ball... did you shoot it?
Y-yes...

How?
You're not coming to the police station, Masumi?
No.
I'm very sorry, but I should have you without me.
I have to solve an issue that can't wait
and I can't stall any longer.
I agree.
What?
Come here, Conan!
You've got a bad scrape on your elbow.
I-I fell down before.
You have to be more careful.
If it gets infected, you'll see stars.
Y-yes... You're right.
(Think) "After all, I'm a bad person."
Understood.
Nihonbashi's office.

That's it.
How about it, then?
Shall we follow him?
Hey.
Thanks for waiting for me.
The M's boat just left.
What, Ran?
What's wrong?
No.
It's nothing.
