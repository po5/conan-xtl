The Kiss of Venus
It's a fantastic facility!
Ya... You can count...
Ah!
Look, look, father!
Surely it's there, there!
They must do the show there, right?
Oh! (Laughs)
It's great!
Isn't it?!
Don't you think it's wonderful?
It must be incredible, to see a woman come out of that giant shell!
Hey, not even four cats have come to see her...
Come on, let's go.
What do you say, father?
Since an admirer has given you the tickets, we'll take advantage of them, won't we?
Mr. Mouri!
Excuse me.
Thank you for waiting.
I'm the director and set designer of this water show.
My name is Hayashi.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you for the invitation.
Excuse me, Miss...?
She is the lead actress of our show.
My name is Michiko Osawa.
I've been an admirer of yours for a long time.
I was very excited to have you come.
Ah, thank you very much!
Wow!
I was looking forward to coming, too.
I always think!
(Think) Au, go.
You did not want to leave?
Excuse me, how long can you hold your breath in the water?
(Think) Why are you asking me this question?
Ah... Excuse me, excuse me...
It's just that my daughter is impatient to see the show and of course...
Ah, I get it.
Let me think...
I think 4 minutes.
If you want, we can show you how everything works backstage.
Yes!
Go ahead, come with us.
Well, this is the control room.
This is where we control the operation of the machines,
the music and the lighting.
Here are the workers' lockers.
And this is the makeup room.
Here the Osawa and the other actors make up and dress up.
And then, there's the door at the end of the hallway.
This is the room where the actors wait for their turn.
At the back, there is a hatch that connects to the giant shell.
Hey, Mr. Hayashi!
Don't explain so many details.
I don't want you to spoil my surprise show!
Sorry, I didn't mean to.
Eh?
Murakawa!
I'll introduce you!
This is the head of the technical team.
He has 20 years of experience in the industry.
How do you do?
This is Miss Yuriko Minegishi.
Nice to meet you.
She's the other Venus we have in the water show.
Minegishi!
Haven't you changed your clothes yet?
You're the first one to come out!
Yeah, I know!
Can't you see I was just coming to change?
How awful!
This woman has not a drop of professionalism!
That's no way to talk.
Besides, with me playing Venus they don't need anyone else!
Can't you find, Mr.... Mouri?
Yes, yes, of course...
Well, I have to start getting ready.
I hope you enjoy the show.
That's nothing, she's got quite an imposing character, this girl.
Her father is the CEO of Osawa Construction.
Osawa?
That well-known company, run by one man?
Yes.
He took part in the construction of this aquarium,
They say they run the management.
That's why your daughter takes this attitude.
Now I understand...
Excuse me, I have to go and inspect the facilities.
-Oh, I'm sorry I interrupted you, it's all right.
Let's go back to the aquarium and look for the seats?
Come on in!
He dropped a towel, and I'll take it to him!
Ah, Conan!
Sir...
You dropped this.
Ah, thank you, boy!
I'm sorry, but I'm busy, will you put it there, please?
Yes!
Do you always inspect everything so carefully?
Yes, because human lives are at stake.
It must be very difficult.
What is it, this switch?

Red stops the water inlet,
and the blue one empties the water accumulated in the container.
Can water be put in and taken out from inside this container?
No. The water is poured from the control room,
but if I could not stop the process, the person would drown.
Yes, it is true.
Llest!
That's it.
Au, boy, go back to your seat, now the show will begin.
Yes!
Oh, boy!
What a crowd, eh?
It's starting, boys!

Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
How nice!

How should you do it, to be followed by fishes?
By sachet with smell.
See that she's holding something in her right hand?
The fish move following this smell.

(Applause)
What a great idea!
What a thrill, now Miss Osawa will perform.

What's wrong? It can't be!
(Shouting)
(Takagi) The deceased is Miss Michiko Osawa, aged 25,
an actress in the aquatic show performed at this aquarium.
And for a change, Mouri was here by chance, wasn't she?
Yes, I had been given some invitations, and of course....
She drowned.
(Thinking) Drowned?
That is to say, she has been trapped in the shell,
she couldn't escape and drowned.
We must check that it was not a malfunction.
(Thinking) Her make-up has come off.
Inspector, look at the girl's cheek, her make-up has come off.
Marrec!
Don't meddle where you're not wanted!
When she drowned, she must have rubbed herself with something.
I'm sure her legs hurt and that's why she drowned.
Why do you see him like that?
Well, look, Inspector,
is that behind the left knee there is a plaster.
A what?!
It's true!
Let's see... This is a patch for injuries.
(Think) A patch?
The actors are expected,
and when the hatch of the shell is closed, we light this lamp.
When we make sure it's on, we fill the tank.
When the water reaches level 8 the shell symbol lights up,
and the water stops coming in.
Hey, did you have normal operation today?
Yes.
The technical team monitored everything from here.
There have been no anomalies.
Hey, sir, that girl was wearing swimming patches?
She did?
AIII!
Marrec of the devil, one day I'll run out of patience!
Excuse me... Miss Osawa had put on a patch?
Yes.
Behind her left knee.
What does it matter?
She had complained.
She almost choked to death because of it.
Had he said anything to you today that was related?
No, if he had told us, we would have had to cancel the show.
He was very professional,
maybe he kept it a secret that he was in pain.
This means...
That while he was waiting to perform, he did it wrong and drowned?
It's an accident that's hard to imagine in a professional swimmer,
but it could be possible.
She's right.
If no anomaly is found, it is a reasonable hypothesis.
The waterproofing is perfect,
so there are no anomalies at this point.
So, unless the controllers have made a mistake, everything was working fine.
Yes.
And even if they were confused,
pressing this button empties the container,
and you can easily get out.
So, for some reason, you couldn't press the button.
(Thinking) What is this?
Inspector Takagi...
Oh!
This isn't right, Conan.
Here, you can't get in.
What's this?
Let's see...
This is...
Makeup!
What should you do here?
Until shortly before she went out to perform,
Miss Osawa was in the next room doing her makeup.
Yes, exactly.
She was a person who was very attentive to pleasing the audience.
Wardrobe and makeup were things she checked in detail.
Ms. Minegishi had already entered the shell,
perhaps she had come out and...
What are you insinuating?
The Osawa has died accidentally.
When the Minegishi indicated to us that it was about to,
we started to fill the tank.
I can see that.
Gentlemen, what were you two doing then?
-We were in the control room. I went to the restroom, but...
(Get out of here, Conan!
What the fuck are you doing here?!
Hey, miss, whose lipstick is this, this lipstick?
Ah, it was poor Osawa's.
If she has gone out to perform leaving this scattering,

she must have been nervous...
The Osawa was very scrupulous.
It's not normal for her to leave it like that.
Watch out, you dropped something.
It's a protective plastic patch.
It must have hurt her leg badly and she must have been nervous.
If she had asked my advice we would have fixed it.
(Thinking) "Eh? Oh... This is...
"Sure! I got it!
"I knew it. I knew this is no accident!
"It's a premeditated murder!
And the murderer who committed it..."
Ah, Inspector Megure!
Oh!
Takagi, how did it go, that?
Neither the shell installation nor the control room
showed any anomalies.
We thought we'd do a test to see if it's working properly.
And the floor of the shell we also found makeup,
which matches the makeup that came off the victim's cheek.
That's significant, isn't it? Ah, wow...
Probably, when he felt it on his leg he rubbed it off.
Looks like we weren't wrong.
It has been an unfortunate accident.
(Radio) Here we have everything ready!
We can begin.
Begin, please.
Come on, start!
(Radio) Yes, sir!
(Radio) Door closed! (Alarm)
(Alarm) -All right!
Pour the water! (Radio) -Receiving!
Water in!
No anomaly, so far.
(Radio): Received!
Then test the emergency switches of the water tank!
(Radio) Receiving!
(Alarm)
What is this? The emergency alarm.
If the water inlet stops,
it means there's been some accident.
-How did it go? (Radio) - "No incidents!
The water has stopped coming in.
Now the emptying begins!"
Very good!
Now we will continue to introduce water!
It seems that there are no incidences.
Now all that remains is to see if the shell opens normally.
(Thinking) It's your turn, Kogoro.
(Radio) The water has stopped coming in.
The water level is correct.
Very good!
Now we'll open the shell, go up, please!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah....
We have finished.
Everything is working normally.
Good.
Thank you very much.
Indeed, it was an unfortunate accident.
(Kogoro voice) Wait a moment!
(Kogoro voice) Oh!
This posture!
This is no accident!
It's a premeditated murder!
May I know what you're saying, Mouri?
Explain yourself.
I've just realized.
It's a skillful set-up, and I know the murderer too!
A set-up?
-A murderer?
First, we had thought that inside the shell
he had felt of the leg,
had struggled into the water and drowned.
But inside the shell there are switches to empty the tank,
and it's hard to believe that the young lady, who was underwater for 4 minutes,
did not find a moment to press the switch and drowned.
Moreover, with the sense of professionalism that she had,
changing costumes and leaving the patch on was not like her.
This, to me too, seems strange.
What does it mean?
At other times, when her leg hurt, she would rehearse with an eye patch,
but when it was time to perform it bothered her and she took it off.
Also, today, when we met, she was wearing high-heeled shoes. (Kogoro voice)
It's not normal for a person whose leg hurts to wear.
Yes, it is.
But she was wearing the patch behind her knee.
Because probably, it must have been put on by the killer.
Eh?
But why did he put it on, the killer?
As Mr. Hayashi explained,
Ms. Osawa had pain in her left knee.
If the killer put a patch on the victim's body,
it conditioned us to lean toward pain as the cause of death.
Is this a diversionary maneuver by the killer?
So as he says.
But when he has been able to put it on, the patch?
(Voice Kogoro) Before starting the show, he attacked him,
he stuck the patch on her leg and charged her up to the shell!
But then who is he, the murderer?
Tell me.
I was introducing the show to the spectators.
Mr. Hayashi and I were in the control room.
We haven't had time to do all this.
Drowning her takes time,
but sleeping with a drug and carrying her doesn't take that long.
If she went to the washroom she didn't have to worry about suspicion.
In the washroom?
That means...
Yes!
The murderer is you...
...Mr. Murakawa!
It can't be...
Murakawa!
That's a lie! I have proof!

Miss Osawa's beauty products,
a scrupulous person of sorts, were a scattering.
This is the proof that she has put her to sleep while putting on makeup.
In addition, the floor of the shell, has remained the victim's makeup.
So that you had placed it
so that her face was touching the floor.
And since she had lost consciousness,
you made sure that she would drown.
Even if she had struggled while drowning,
it would have been very difficult for her to get out.
That's true.
Then, if water was poured into the shell from this room,
she would start swallowing herself and die by drowning.
These are absurd deductions and circumstantial evidence.
We cannot say that they are very consistent proofs.
If you want irrefutable proof,
you'll know that you have one on you.
On your shoulder.
Exactly, in the neck area.
Allow me.
-Pintallavis!
-It's the color of the Osawa!
It must have been marked when you carried Miss Osawa.
But how come you're wearing it here?
It's also marked on his tracksuit jacket.
and it looks like he tried to wash it.
I examined the jacket hanging in the waiting room
and there was a faint trace of lipstick.
We can't tell, when my lipstick is marked!
We could have been scrubbed!
No, this is totally impossible.
Look at the mark carefully.
The lipstick mark is upside down!
That's right!
You could only make a mark like that when you were carrying her.
The Osawa...
That bad woman deserved death.
Two years ago,
she ran over my wife and child, and fled!
She couldn't have.
That criminal...
Yes, it was her.
When her father came to see her,
I felt them talking about the accident.
I smiled as if I didn't know anything.
She didn't feel guilty at all for the crime she had committed.
Not at all...

(Kogoro) Too bad, we were having such a good time.
Come on, it was a murder case.
When a crime takes place, it's no time to watch shows.
I was supposed to collaborate.
You're right, Father.
Next time I'll take you somewhere else.
How about this one?
There are a lot of girls in bikinis.
Pareeeeeeeee!
Stop it, stop it!
The aquarium! No!
Nooooo!
What did you think?!
A perfect stop!
Au, we're going home.
My... my back...

My goodness, you have a lot of vitality, madam!
