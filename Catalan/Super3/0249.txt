Destiny is a clue to deductions.
It is a light that sheds light on mysterious cases.
Today, Yoko Okino appears after a while.
Television idols also have worries.
She has the brain of an adult and is Detective Conan!
Something 's just not right!
Nani o motometeru no
uso ni narete yuku Kyou mo fake your eyes.
The start of century!
Tashika na mono nakute
Hitori ya nakenai yowasa hate myself.

I think it 's only my destiny!

Oh, yeah!
You're going nowhere, It 's only destiny!
Ari no mama ni susunde ima

You're in my heart!
You're in my heart!

(Kogoro) A, M, O, R!
Love!
I love you, Yokooooo!
Beautiful!
Virgin!
Don't you ever get tired of watching the same video?
Stop it! You're the best in the world...
And why not?
I have very little work today.
But you have a pile of mail.
Maybe... a job offer has arrived.
I'll look at it later, you leave it in the office and that's it.
(Think) "You don't have any work to do, and you don't feel like doing it."
Let's see... the electricity bill and an invitation to a conference...
Wow!
A letter has arrived from Yoko!
What is it?
It's an invitation to a party.
Viscaaaaa!
Gee, they're having a wedding party at her friend's house!
Eh... Eeeeeh?
Engagement?
Her friend is getting engaged
and asked her to arrange a meeting with the famous detective Mouri.
Are you... going to the party?
Eh?
Engagement... courtship... courtship... courtship.
"Now it's to your world."
THE SECRET OF THE BIG STARS, (part one)
(Kogoro) He-he-he... Gee, really, thank you so much, Yoko.
I'm honored that you invited me
to your best friend's engagement party.
The honor is mine.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
I'm sorry I invited you overnight.
-He must have been surprised.
-No, I wasn't.
Not at all.
"Mite'ls. What had gone wrong and was sunk in misery."
And listen: who is she?
Who is she, this friend who is promised?
You will see her very soon.
You know her very well.
-What do we know her well? - (boy) Hello, Yoko.
Wow!
You've finally taken her.
The famous detective... Kogoro Mouri!
(boy) Oh!
Don't tell me you're...
the actor who plays Detective Samonji!
(Kogoro) The Osamu Kenzaki!
(Kogoro) Oh.
(Kogoro) Oh!
Xxxt.
Didn't you say she was your best friend, the one who got engaged?
That's right.
And I'm her future husband.
She's here for Yoko's best friend, who's marrying me.
It's great, that the famous Mouri brought us.
She'll be very excited to see him.
In fact, she still doesn't know that Mr. Mouri is here...
I want to surprise him.
Very well, let's see his surprised face.
(Ring: nobody-nong)
Well, he doesn't answer.
(Ning-nong)
But he's supposed to be all here by now.
Mm?
The door is open...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
It has!
(All) Oooooh!
(Kogoro: laughing)
I'm sorry, Mr. Mouri...
You've come to see me... and I treat you badly.
Having a famous actress like you leave me half-stunned
will be a memory worth keeping.
Lately there has been someone who has been harassing me.
And since I didn't recognize him, I couldn't help the impulse to attack him.
"If you had him come, you should know him."
So, Yoko's friend who is engaged to Mr. Kenzaki is....
Yes, it's me.
We plan to get married...
this spring.
It hasn't leaked to the media yet.
This reminds me that Kaoru co-stars in "Detective Samonji"
with Mr. Kenzaki.
(Girl) That's right.
We got them together to celebrate and make a bit of a fuss,
while we watch the premiere of today's program.
They are the golden couple.
(Think) "Bufa, the Yuki Taken!"
You're wearing a little too flashy nails, Yuki.
Ha-ha-ha!
Cool, aren't they?
They're false nails.
Ah, but what a pity,
Yoko Okino..., Yuki Taken and Kaoru Kusan.
One more person and we'd have all 4 of them.
It's a real pity.
Ah, I am;?
Terumo!
-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! -You came too, Terumo!
Yes.
Yoko told me to come, so....
But if I'm in the way, I can....
No, come, come!

The four Ladies of the Earth have finally reunited!
The Ladies of the Earth?
For the meaning of their names....,
Kaoru Kusan is the fragrant green grass of the field;
Yuki Taken is the white snow that covers the highest mountains;
Terumo Hoshino, the bright stars of the night sky,
and Yoko Okino, the shimmering waves of the blue sea.
That's why they call them "the Ladies of the Earth."
"Ah, right!"
"Each of their names represents a wondrous vision of the earth."
The Ladies of the Earth were separated
because of the fight between Terumo and Kaoru.
Yoko is the only one who continues as a singer.
Anyway, I was surprised that Kaoru, the youngest, is the first to marry,
is the first to get married.
Me too!
I thought Terumo would be the first to get married.
Once you told us I don't know about your lover.
-Yes, tell us what happened.
Are you going to confess what you felt?
As a matter of fact, no.
I prefer to love him from afar and to have him in my heart as the ideal man,
than not to check what they say:
"Marriage is the tomb of love and trust."
-Hey, what do you mean by that?!
-Terumi!
And who is it, this old man... you with this creature?
-Are you Kenzaki's brother? -No, I... am...
(Boy) From it...
it's almost time for "Detective Samonji" to start.
He wants to... come and see?
I'll pass.
In the meantime, I'll go take a bath.
Notify me, when it's over.
Ah, but... the food will get cold, and I'd like you to have dinner together.
Please, don't bother me!
I said I'll pass!
Don't make me repeat things over and over again.
Aaaa... I'm sorry.
Wait, Kaoru.
Ha-ha-ha!
She hasn't changed a bit.
She's always been embarrassed to watch the shows she stars in.
Just as we planned.
Hey.
Are you really going to do it?
Of course I'm going to do it.
That's why we invited you.
To do what?
I'll be waiting for you in the living room.
-Yoko, will you change the sink? -Yoko, will you change the sink? -Okay.
Ooooh! Oooooooooooooooooh!
Isn't that the outfit the Ladies of Earth wore when they debuted?
I get it.
When Kaoru comes out of the bathroom....
Yes.
We'll celebrate their courtship by putting on these outfits...
...and singing the song we debuted with.
But at my age... I'm embarrassed to wear this dress.
Oh. (Laughs)
Oh, that's great!
You look fantastic!
Gorgeous!
You look great!
"You're too happy, I think."
(Yoko) Thanks for waiting.
(Yoko) Surprise...
Oooh!
You really want to do it?
Well, now it's my turn to rejuvenate myself.
Yuki, wake up, I have to change too.
Until now.
Come on, let's write something to dedicate to Kaoru.
"I wish you lots of love and happiness."
Fet.
Molt bien, now you, Terumo.
No need, I don't want to write anything.
Come on, don't be like that, girl.
I'll write something.
Listen.
Hm?
Did Kaoru herself really want to see Kogoro?
Yes, she's already told him herself.
Lately, a sonado has been following her everywhere and...
she wants me to find out who it is.
Aaaah.
When she comes to live with me, that man won't bother her anymore.
I guess not.
Oh, write her a card?
Yeah, we were just writing her some dedications.
Well, I'm going to go change now.
Huh?
But what's this?
Gee, no...
She wrote "I'm sorry for your loss", and burned the card.
If she's left the cigarette mark, I'll...
(thinks) "A... kiss."
Hey, Makuma, why don't you write her something?
Man, I don't...
Ha-ha... Come on, don't be modest.
You can write comments, complaints, whatever you want.
Please.
Sorry, you don't have to, if you don't want to.
No, I'm delighted.
That's it, I've already changed my clothes.
Girl!
It looks great on you!
Eh... Well... I'll go tell Kaoru.
-What's gotten into her, all of a sudden? -I don't know.
In the end, none of you have watched my series.
You don't give a damn.
-Relax, man.
-I've refreshed my memory.
Now we have to wait for Kaoru to arrive.
What?
Where is he, Kaoru?
Well, I've... called him several times, but he doesn't answer.
Well, maybe... he got dizzy, while he was taking a bath.
Maybe I should go check on him, Mr. Kenzaki.
He must have had a fit and locked himself in the bathroom.

(Thinks) "Eh? There are bloodstains!"
"And they're going towards the entrance!"
"It can't be!"
Kaoru, please get out of here at once.
Everyone is waiting for you.
Mr. Kenzaki, open the door!
What?
Hurry up!
Kaoru, I'm coming!
Kaoru?
Oh!
Kaoru!
Kaoru!
Kaoru!
What happened?
How could this happen?
She has a pulse, though.
If we get her to the hospital right away, maybe she'll be saved.
Hurry up!
What's happened?
What is it, those screams?
-What? Ka-Ka-Kaoru!
Hey.
Kaoru.
What happened to you?
Kaoruuuu!
Ran.
Call an ambulance.
Yes.
(Takagi) The victim is Miss Kaoru Kusan, 20 years old.
Door number 1 on the 28th floor.
But a 20-year-old girl living alone in this fancy building!
Is she a rich girl or what? But don't you know them, Inspector?
They're the Ladies of Earth!
From the Land of what? (Ning-nong)
(intercom: Yoko) "Who's there?" We're the police.
"Come in."
We're here... Oh.
Sorry, I think I'm on the wrong floor.
Hello, Inspector Megre.
We've been expecting you.
Eh?
Mmm!
Wow!
A bunch of TV celebrities!
Let's see... Let me ask you one more time:
You 3 were invited
to Miss Kusan's... engagement party.
And while she was taking a bath, you... changed your clothes in the bathroom...
to surprise her.
Miss Okino, Miss Taken...
and Miss Hoshino respectively.
And when they finished changing,
their manager, Mr. Makuma,
went to the bathroom to tell her, but she didn't answer.
Afterwards, Mr. Kenzaki went to call her...
and found her on the bathroom floor and bleeding from the neck.
Is everything all right so far?
Yes.
Again, as if the devil had planned it,
you've turned up at the scene of the crime.
Please, inspector, don't be malicious.
It so happens that Miss Okino had invited me.
It's just a coincidence.
No, it's a full-fledged curse.
Man...
Where is she now, Miss Kusan, the victim?
She was taken to Haido hospital in an ambulance.
Mr. Makuma, who accompanied her, didn't tell us anything,
The Ka... Kaoru... will she die?
(Cries)
Very well.
Don't worry, I'll call the hospital right away.
Wait, I'll come with you.
The father goes often, to this hospital,
so I know the phone number.
You do?
Thank you, thank you.
And the person who cut his throat?
You think... the assailant is in this very room?
No way.
But it is often said that...
the first thing the body finds is the most suspicious.
Hey, wait... Wait a minute.
I have no reason to kill Kaoru.
And when I found her, that guy with glasses was with me.
He was the one who told me to open the bathroom door.
Is it true?
Yes.
It's true.
"Because there was a trail of blood from the bathroom to the entrance."
And when I opened the door to the entrance,
I found this there on the floor, so...
Mm?
A raincoat, leaky work gloves,
an eyedropper and a handkerchief.
We found it outside the door,
so I put them away before the ambulance came.
The raincoat and gloves are covered in blood.
They must be the gloves the criminal was wearing.
You can hardly see it, but there's some lipstick on the handkerchief.
Yes, someone filled this little bottle with an anesthetic...
and soaked the handkerchief to render her unconscious before murdering her.
But... but who did this to Kaoru?
It's awful.
It's the stalker.
He did it to her.
The stalker scared her with a ding-dong and through her legs.
A ding-dong?
It's silly: it's like ringing a doorbell and running away.
But this is not a joke, it's a crime.
Estanya always threw a note under the door of the apartment.
It said: "I'll be back," "I'll come again," and "I'll be back even if I die.
and "I'll come back even if I die."
And it got worse and worse.
They were ominous sheets of paper
written with a word processor.
Yeah, right.
I get it... Oooooh...
That's why she jumped on me when I rang the doorbell.
The door was closed, at the time of the crime?
It was open.

There were many people, she felt safe and did not close the door.
So, the stalker found the door open, entered the apartment,
went through, and Miss Kusan, who had just taken a bath...
"As she has seen the stalker's face,
"She knocked him unconscious and slit his throat."
"The raincoat and bloody gloves have left them out.
"Because they would have attracted attention."
Afterwards, the criminal has fled.
Very good, Takagi.
Very good, Takagi.
Start investigating the building, see if you can find any evidence.
The criminal was wearing a raincoat on a day when it's not raining.
There must be some evidence.
Yes, sir!
Honestly, I don't think anyone saw her,
because this person was very prudent.
Prudent, you say?
That's right.
If you're wearing a bloodstained raincoat,
you can step in the dripping blood drops, right?
But when I saw him, there were no footprints in the whole corridor.
This means that the criminal tried not to step in the blood
while running away.
This is true!
Yes.
It is very strange.
If the criminal has seen so many shoes in the hall,
how is it that he, so prudent,
entered a place where there are so many people?
The criminal may have walked deliberately...
with the bloody raincoat in his hand
to leave a trail of blood down the corridor to the outside...
to make it look like it was a person... who had left the apartment.
And if Miss Kusan knew the assailant at all,
that person could call her without arousing her suspicion.
If she came out of the bathroom helplessly,
it would not have been difficult to make her inhale the anesthetic.
Hey, wait.
Wait, inspector.
You mean the criminal is...?
Indeed, it could be one of us.
Isn't that right, Inspector?
Te-Terumo!
This is true.
The washroom we use to change
is between the living room and the bathroom.
Any one of us could have had a chance to assault her.
You too?
You too? Come on.
Yoko would be incapable of doing such a foolish thing.
While she was changing, we were waiting in front of the sink.
Afterwards, we went back to the living room with Yoko.
So..., I'm innocent too.
When I found him, it was with this child.
Hm.
That's right.
First, when Kaoru went to the bathroom,
she was kind enough to join us.
You could not have attacked her.
You went to the bathroom with her?!
Yes...
So you all had the opportunity to attack her.
All right, first let me interrogate them one by one.
But first... don't you neglect something else, Inspector?
Eh?
The murder weapon.
The knife that was used.
Whether it's among our personal belongings or in the house,
the criminal is among us.
Otherwise, the criminal has come from outside.
It is difficult to believe that someone from outside has hidden the weapon on the floor.
The criminal must have cleaned the knife,
and even if there is no blood left,
luminol can detect hemoglobin.
It's not something you can hide, is it?
It's... true!
(Thinks) "Huh?"
"What the heck... is she pretending, this woman?"
(Think) "Hm? This photograph..."
What?
That Kaoru...?
Don't tell me that she...?!
It's about time we told...
the real reason for this party.
What real reason?
Uh... No, it's just that...
(thinks) "They had planned it from the beginning?"
And the next Conan:
