until they made me drink a potion that made me shrink."
"Today we will experience a kidnapping and ransom."

DETECTIVE CONAN
Fake money in a kidnapping case
Gentlemen, it won't be long now.
You have not committed any recklessness.
(Radio) The victim's safety is a priority.
It's unbelievable that she is Mr. Takei's daughter.
(Telephone)
-Katsuhiko, please say? (Woman) -Do you have money ready?
I have them here!
Let go of Naoko, please.
(Woman) Wait, you'll see her now.
Inspector, the kidnappers are already here, it's a van.
They've stopped near the other car.
Naoko!
I'll give you the money now!
(Woman) Just a moment!
You've come with the police, right?
Well, no deal!
(Woman) Wait!
They have fled with the girl!
(Woman) Come on!
They jumped over the fence without touching the brakes.
You were a classmate of the victim, Naoko Takei.
Yes.
(Think) "Naoko Takei..."
"She always had such a melancholy look..."
"But the way they've fallen..."
Inspector!
We've searched the area and the river bottom,
but the bodies are nowhere to be found.
They could be downstream.
Gee, no...
Why do you say the bodies?
And all because I trusted the police.
That's why I left everything in their hands?!
Come on, give it back to me, give it back to Naoko!
"They say that they have jumped out of the way;
but what does it do, that only the side window is broken?"
"A hammer?"
Conan!
Here we go again!
Ouch!
I'm sorry! Let's see if you wake up!
I will never trust the police again.
I want you to find these criminals, no matter what.
(Kogoro) Okay, sir.
Ask my secretary, Miss Hanai, for details.
I am Akiko Hanai.
Let's start with the circumstances under which the kidnapping took place.
That day, Naoko and I had arranged to see a movie,
and I went to wait for her.
I waited for a long time, but Naoko didn't show up.
She got worried, and reported it to the police.
No, no... the kidnappers called me on my cell phone,
and told me that he had been kidnapped.
The kidnappers warned you not to tell the police, right?
Yes, exactly, that's why I spoke to the president first.
It's my fault!
I shouldn't have invited you to go to the movies!
Ran!
Do you have any idea who they might be, the kidnappers?
If I knew, I wouldn't have hired you!
I don't want you to be offended, sir,
but you are famous because you buy other companies.
I'm sure some people have a grudge against you.
I'm not wrong at all, am I, Mr. Katsuhiko?
(Thinking) "Boy! You're inspired, today!"
I don't want to talk about these details!
Business is a war!
Those who lose are to blame!
-Is it clear to you? -Yes...
(Thinking) "My goodness... no peppers..."
Miss Hanai's room was the second floor, right?
How is she, Miss Hanai?
Bad, father.
Because of Naoko, Akiko was like an older sister
and I loved her very much.
She lost her mother when she was very young,
and to Naoko, Akiko was like a mother to her.
Akiko?
Akiko!
Hey, Akiko...
Ah... it's you...
What's wrong with you?
We've been yelling at you for a while...
Excuse me, guys, but I'm not feeling well...
(Thinking) "Hey ?! This woman..."
You were also worried about Naoko?
Naoko is still alive.
I'd put my hand in the fire!
Yes, but... they've been looking all over for her.
Maybe... Naoko is...
What a pity...
(thinks) "I've got it!"
Let's take a look at the other side?
Why, Conan?
There might be someone who witnessed the accident.
That day?
Right, did you see anything unusual, sir?
We didn't have much time to be distracted.
We were cooperating with the police.
All the ships cooperated in the investigation.
All of them?
Yes, it's an old habit all of us sailors have,
to help out when something happens.
But those damned guys on the boat...
From the boat?
Yeah... they went like lightning past my boat.
It must be some rich, pushy guy from the yacht club on the canal.

Tell us what the boat looked like.
Isn't this the boat that the sailor told us about?
Hey, Conan, where are you going?
Conan, where are you going?
We shouldn't go in without permission.
What's that?
A diving team?
(Think) "What if the kidnapper and Naoko Takei were alive?"
"This is no accident."
"The hijacker jumped into the water deliberately, to escape."
"He broke the side window with the hammer he had prepared."
"And he went under the water to the other shore,
and took the boat that was anchored."
"He sneaked in unseen by the police,
while they were busy with the sunken van..."
"Why would he do that?"
"So that the hijacker, who saw the police,
had to make it look like he and the victim were dead..,
to cause confusion in the investigations..."
"There must be something else."
"There is only one thing I don't understand concerning the victim, the Naoko."
"Her body was not found."
"There was only one diving team for one person."
"How did you get her out of the sunken van?"
"Or maybe she wasn't in the van anymore, for starters?"
"No. It can't be."
"Surely she was seen in the van."
Conan!
Hey!
Hey, Ran, did you find any clues?
According to the watchman at the yacht club,
it's a boat that was abandoned some time ago at the dock.
What if the captain of that fishing boat had made a mistake?
(He thinks) "It can't be so!"
"But I would like to know how to prove it".
Don't you have to continue the investigation?
But why?
What's the matter?
How should I know!
They have decided to close the investigation and have not told me anything else.
These rich people are very miserable.
They should not want to spend money on a dead daughter.
Naoko is not dead!
And how do you know that, you damn kid?
Ah... because...
I agree with Conan.
I don't want to believe that Naoko is dead...
Oh Lord!
Look at the pair of creatures...
If we make a detailed review of the facts, it's not hard to understand.
The way the accident happened,
it's impossible for the kidnapper or the victim to be alive.
Father... no...
Isn't this a joke, this, by a brilliant detective like you?
Mmm?
Maybe you're right, Conan!
Very well!
Please leave.
Look, my daughter Naoko is already dead.
What's the point, continuing the investigation if she's not coming back?
What's that?
But... listen!
Ah!
Isn't that what you want?
Your compensation?
Well, take it and fuck the field!
What do you think!
I didn't come here to get paid!
Ran, we're leaving!
What a man!
It makes my blood boil, this scoundrel!
What does he think he is!
About that... I should go... What?
What? I promised a friend I'd go see her.
I promised a friend I'd go to see her.
I'll be right back! How well they live, today's children!
(Thinking) "This sudden change of attitude..."
Please count it!
"There's no doubt about it."
"The kidnapper has contacted him!"
Consenting to kill Naoko?
Chairman!
He must have the money ready or Naoko will be killed!
But... in fact, we don't know if she's alive or dead.
(Akiko) Please look.
In this photo sent to us by the kidnapper.
you can see the date he took it, in the newspaper.
"So, I was right!"
The Naoko thinks you will go to rescue.
He is waiting!
What will you do, President?
If I pay the 500 million now,
I'll have to back out of that purchase that was finally starting to pay off.
Don't you understand?!
What's more important, the damn money or the Naoko?
The Naoko, of course!
But if we don't close this deal, the company will go...
-...into the water.
-Yes. -Yes.
No doubt you're right.
What's that got to do with it?
A company is no substitute for Naoko!
After a lot of effort,
I have turned this company into what it is today!
Sucking the blood of good people.
Stop it!
Buying a company is a legal business!
The weak lose!
Those who lose are guilty!
(Think) "He has no heart..."
Ah!
Ah!
(Thud) Ow!
(Knock)
What's that?
That boy!
Conan, what are you doing?!
(Rio) I just wanted to go to the bathroom.

You were spying on us, weren't you!
Conan, please...
you can't explain what you've felt here.
If the police find out, Naoki will die.
Of course... I understand.
I can't let that child out, is that clear?!
Lock him in your room!
Conan, I'm very sorry, excuse me.
Be patient and stay here.
When we've sorted it out, I'll take you home.
So, what does the kidnapper ask for now?
The same as before.
He wants 500 million yen first thing tomorrow morning.
Will he pay them? The way the president is...
If Naoko is important to him, he'll prepare the money, right?
The only thing that matters to this man is money!
What's wrong with him?
Nothing, I thought...
He had a little brother named Masahiko.
Had?
Yes... he died... 4 years ago.
He was murdered.
He was about your age.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Sorry Conan!
Let me do this, please...
I'll bring you some food in a little while, okay?
He thinks he'll trick the kidnapper,
with newspaper bills?!
Don't remind me, will you?
I have no choice.
Conan, don't...
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
(Think) "No one saw her clearly, Naoko's face."
"It's impossible to be sure it was her."
"There was only the kidnapper, in that van!"
"Sure... she played both roles."
"Everyone interpreted that it was the Naoko."
"It was a bit far, it would have fooled anyone."
"And besides, you're already looking at her assuming it's her."
Wait a minute!
You've come with the police, right?
Well, no deal!
"The kidnapper knew every step the police took."
"And why not? It was close to Mr. Takei."
"The mark left by the diving watch...
the mark on her dress and that gesture she made..."
"Every diver knows it's to uncover the ears."
"He had hurt his ears
because he had to dive without time to prepare."
What's the matter?
We've been meeting for a while and we still haven't...
(Akiko) It's here!
And it's been there for a while.
(Akiko) Idiot!
(Akiko) What are you doing?
You've gone crazy!
I've twisted my foot!
Help me!
Calm down, this is nothing
compared to what I and my whole family have suffered!
What's the meaning of this?
You don't remember this place, do you, President?
It's the ruins of a company you bought.
What?
You must not have been the...
The daughter of the businessman who died with his family because of you.
The father committed suicide,
and took the mother and my little brother with him.
He left me.
I was going to college.
I was adopted by a friend's father, who changed my last name.
I joined his company...
and I've been seeking revenge ever since.
If I had loved Naoko enough to pay the ransom,
I would have spared her life,
but now...
What... what the hell do you plan to do, Akiko?
I'll have to kill him.
What, gasoline?!
(Thinking) "Wrong!"
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't be hasty!
I'll pay you whatever you ask!
Take all your money in hell.
Goodbye...
Don't do it!
Conan!
It's not even worth killing him!
The evil beasts must exterminate!
Will you put Naoko through the ordeal you went through?
As bad a beast as he is, he's Naoko's only relative.
You are the one who should better understand the pain of losing a relative.
I don't think your brother would be happy
if he executed this revenge.
Excuse me, Conan...
Masahiko...
(Tune from "Step by Step")
DETECTIVE CONAN
"The Naoko was in the basement of the abandoned factory."
"The police rescued her."
"Naoko had sensed the truth since she had been taken prisoner."
Naoko!
Are you all right, daughter?
Akiko!
Akiko!
Naoko, forgive me, I've implicated you in my problem.
No...
Thank you very much...
I haven't made any decision yet,
but if this dog has attacked a person,
then, we will have to put down.
(Thinking) "Shinichi... please come back soon."
"You are the only one who can save in John."
"Come back Sinichi..."
A clue to the next episode: a reflex action.
