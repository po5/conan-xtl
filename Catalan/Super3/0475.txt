The light of summer is the brightness of the past.
Life changes after the tears.
Suddenly, there is an accident that affects your life!
He always discovers the only truth!
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is detective Conan!

(Horns)
(Kogoro) Wow, that's strange!
According to what I was told, the restaurant should be here.
It's just the same!
Why don't we go somewhere else?
(Kogoro) Shut up!
We'll keep looking!
What? We have to go back again?
We have to go back again?
I want to leave, Mr. Kogoro!
It's already five and a half of 7 and we still haven't found the restaurant!
It's only two quarters of 7?
I promised Ran that, while she was gone,
I'd see to it that you ate properly.
(Car: crash)
(Wheels: squeak)
She ran away!
Come back here!
Help me! Help me!
Somebody call the police!
Criminal!
We need an ambulance!
A car has hit 2 pedestrians.
The accident occurred behind Beika Park.
Hurry up!
This guy looks familiar!
Oh!
He's "the most unfortunate man in Japan".
The most unfortunate man in Japan?
A few days ago,
his nephew introduced him on a funny video program
that was on TV and I saw him by chance.
(Child) "My uncle, Shinzaburo Tatematsu,
"He's probably the most unhappy man in Japan."
"When he's walking down the street, all kinds of things fall on his head."
"Every time he tries to dodge them,
"He trips and sprains his ankle."
"When he gets in line,
"They always run out of tickets just before it's his turn."
"That's all right."
"Oh... Why do these things only happen to me?"
(Kogoro) That's all he needed, to have an accident!
-Wait a minute!
It wasn't an accident!
What do you mean, it wasn't an accident?
-That car had been parked on the corner for a while,
waiting for someone.
When he saw these two men,
he suddenly accelerated and jumped on them.
Are you serious?
So he deliberately ran them over?
"Attempted murder!"
"The most wretched man in the world."
(Takagi) One of the witnesses remembered the license plate number,
but it was a stolen car.
We haven't been able to locate it yet.
How are the injured?
It looks like both are out of danger.
-I'm not glad. Have you found out more details?
Yes.
"According to witness statements,
"The suspect was wearing a cap and sunglasses,
"so he couldn't see his face."
"Mr. Shinzaburo Tatematsu, who was returning from work,
"was coming from Beika Station."
"Halfway there, he met Mr. Kyotaka Okonogi...
"And they got to talking."
"Then, the car that was parked..."
(Crash)
What was the target of the driver of the vehicle?
Mr. Tatematsu or Mr. Okonogi?
We don't know yet.
He shot out when the two victims started talking.
Eh?
So, maybe he wanted to kill them both.
Yes, that's possible.
But if it's true that he wanted to kill both men,
he probably would have had a better chance of success
if he had attacked them one by one.
-That's true.
This makes me think that he only wanted to kill one of the two men.
(He thinks) "If his intention was the same,
why did he ram both men at precisely that moment?
Doctor!
All right, well, we'll have to ask the two wounded men...
if they know anyone who would want to kill them.
Thank you very much.
It looks like we'll be able to talk to Mr. Tatematsu soon.
Mr. Okonogi is unconscious.

(Man) How is uncle?
(Takagi) Who are you?
He is Mr. Okonogi's nephew, Mr. Kazuma Sakaki.
Ah, you are his nephew?
The lady accompanying you is his girlfriend.
Tomomi Ichikura.
I was so scared when Kazuma told me what happened.
Thank you for coming.
Your uncle is out of danger,
but the doctors say
it will take a while before he regains consciousness.
What happened to Mr. Okonogi?
My God!
Who could it be?
Takagi.
Something worries me.
It looks like Mr. Okonogi has a large fortune,
but he has no direct descendants.
His only family is his nephew.
-And you mean...? - Yes, I mean...
If Mr. Okonogi had died,
his nephew would have inherited the entire fortune.
Besides, Mr. Sakaki owes his uncle quite a bit of money.
(Takagi) Mr. Sakaki, will you tell us...
where you were today, at seven o'clock in the evening, at seven o'clock in the evening..,
when your uncle was run over?
What is it?
What are you insinuating?
My God!
Please calm down.
(Kazuma) It's obvious that the person who was driving the car
wanted to run over the other man!
(Tomomi) Mr. Okonogi has been involved accidentally.
Be that as it may, the police have a duty...
and the need to check the alibis of the family members
and acquaintances of both victims.
That is why I ask for your cooperation,
and also that of Miss Ichikura.
At that time I was at home.
At home.
What is it?
What's wrong, Miss Ichikura?
No, and now!
It's just that I thought you had to go
to your co-worker's farewell party.
I had planned to go, but I wasn't feeling very well.
I got off work at noon and stayed home to sleep.
As I live alone, there is no one who can confirm this.
Can you tell me what you were doing, Miss Ichikura?
Me?
I was at home fishing.
I was at home fishing,
and at 5 o'clock in the afternoon I went for a stroll
around downtown... the Toto shopping mall in Ginza.
I think I went out to the street around 5:30 at 7:30.
Did you go with anyone else, Miss?
No, I was alone too.
There's no one who can confirm it...
Yes!
Just at that time there was a small incident.
An incident?
Yes.
Then I sent a message to Kazuma.
(Kazuma) "That's right, I remember!"
Let's see... look, it's this one.
(Takagi) A-a ticking time bomb?!
Okumura, were you aware of it?
No.
I'll check it out.
(Kogoro) Wait a minute!
What did you say happened?
Mouri!
Let-me see.
"I'm at Toto's shopping mall."
"It looks like they found a time bomb
"In the women's bathroom on the fifth floor."
"How scary!"
Got it.
Okay.
It's true.
At 5:30 p.m., 7:00 p.m.,
they have located a suspicious device in the bathroom
and had to evacuate the customers
and the mall workers.
There was a considerable commotion.
In the end it turned out to be a bad joke,
that the bomb was a fake.
"Fake?"
So, it was just a prank?
Besides, the fake bomb...
wasn't in the women's restroom on the fifth floor,
but in the men's room on the sixth floor.
What do you mean?
You know, when something like this happens,
there's usually a lot of conflicting information circulating.
Yes, of course.
Whether the bomb was on the fifth floor or on the sixth floor,
whether it was fake or real, has nothing to do with this case.
The fact is that there has been a bomb threat
at 5:30 a.m. on 7
"And that you have sent a message with this information.
"At three-quarters to five of 7."
"This proves that, at that time, you were at the mall."
"From the Toto shopping mall to the Beika neighborhood.
"It is exactly one hour's drive."
"This means that..."
Ms. Ichikura has an alibi
which has been proven by the fake bomb threat.
You were lucky, Miss! Of course you were!
By the way, Mr. Sakaki,
we found out that you owe your uncle quite a bit of money.
Excuse me.
You're from the police?
Mr. Tatematsu!
You must be the other victim of the accident.

That car... that car tried to run me over!
They wanted... to keep me from talking.
From talking? -What?
The day before yesterday I got my paycheck
and I decided to indulge myself,
so I went to the supermarket
and bought a couple of trays of quality meat and fish.
But as soon as I stepped out onto the street, my groceries were stolen!
"Besides, when I tried to catch the thief....
"I broke a tooth."
These things always happen to me.
Wow!
You really can't get much unluckier than that.
Of course you can!
I know why your face looked so familiar!
You're the unluckiest man in Japan,
the one who was on TV!
Ah!
"Poor guy, everyone knows him!"
But... my misfortunes don't end here.
"Last night, I received a call...
"From the person who had stolen my food."
(Man) "How dare you call the police?"
"Now that you've seen my face, I can't let you get away."
"I would have shut your mouth forever."
(Takagi) "You received a death threat?"
And today, he made good on his threat.
I don't quite understand why there was a need to kill him
if the thief hadn't stolen a bag of food from him.
(Takagi) "That's true."
But... But it was the same person!
The same person?
All right, well then...
I know why I wanted to shut his mouth forever, the murderer.
Tomomi, let's go check on the guy.
Yes.
"This case is not as simple as it seems."
Mr. Tatematsu.
Do you know the second victim, Mr. Okonogi?
The truth is, I didn't even know his name,
but we know each other from seeing each other every day.
I always come back from the station at the same time,
which is when he goes out for a walk.
I'd like you to explain in detail
the robbery the day before yesterday.
And also the phone call he received last night.
I agree.
Boy, we've got to go.
We know what happened.
Finding the suspect is the police's job.
All right, well...
"There's something that doesn't quite convince me."
"What makes my head dance is, above all, the time of the accident."
"If the suspect wanted to kill Mr. Tatematsu...
"The prudent thing to do would have been to try to do it when he was alone."
"Why didn't he do it?"
(Kogoro) Ep, boy!
Kogoro!
Where are you going so deep at this time of the morning?
Kids shouldn't stick their noses into this kind of business.
I know that...
I have to stop by the hospital for a moment.
Okay? I've got to go by the hospital for a minute.
Go home right now!
What happened, Kogoro?
You can see that the most unfortunate man in Japan is pretty down in the dumps, poor thing.
He says that, because of you, an innocent person like Mr. Okonogi...
has been involved in an accident.
I'll come to the hospital to cheer him up a bit.
You are a good person at heart, you.
And you are a scoundrel!
Did you doubt it, that I was a good person?
"Involved? What if it had been the other way around?"
"If it had all been a set-up by the crook, I'd have an explanation!"
"Then, there must be someone who saw the suspect!"
Mr. Tatematsu?
Yes.
It seems to me that it's been a few days now.
Let me think...
Yes! Do you remember?
I saw a rather strange person
who was following Mr. Tatematsu.
Say, he was a rather short and rather fatty gentleman?
No.
It was a very pretty girl.
A girl?
I thought she was his girlfriend,
but I don't think Mr. Tatematsu is dating anyone.
"A girl?"
That's right.
They didn't find the bomb by chance.
At around 5:30 p.m. on 7:00 p.m.,
Toto's shopping center received an anonymous call
"Who claimed there was a bomb in the bathroom."
(Kogoro voice) He said the bomb was in the ladies' room on the fifth floor?
I see you are well informed,
although the case is under seal and we haven't given details.
"The curious thing about the case is that the culprit of the rampage.
"Was a child who was shopping in the mall...
"And he moved the bomb from place to place."
"He put it in the men's room on the sixth floor.
"Without knowing it was a fake."
"I get it. I know what happened!"
Mr. Sakaki!
But you're the boy from yesterday!

How is Mr. Okonogi doing?
The doctors still don't know when he will regain consciousness,
and we've decided that we'll take turns going out to lunch.
Miss Ichikura has been left alone
in Mr. Okonogi's room?
Where are you going? Hurry up!
What happened, boy?
Don't run!
You say the mystery is already solved?
Yes, that's why you told us to come.
Who asked you to come?
I did?
You asked us to come.
I do not remember,
but if it is true that I have warned you,
it must have been my other personality.
I have been investigating!
You were right, Mr. Kogoro!
That I also asked you for something, you?
We must hurry! (Door slams) Wait!
(slamming door)
Hey!
May I know what are you doing?
What are you doing?
May I know what you were doing, Tomomi?
What's the meaning of this, Mr. Mouri?
-Eh? -Tell me, Mouri!
Who is it?
Me? What are you telling me?
What are you telling me!
I don't know anything.
I don't know anything.
The door of my split personality has opened...
In sleeping Kogoro!
(Kogoro voice) Miss Ichikura.
Was I trying to provoke you into a coughing fit
with this wet towel
to simulate respiratory failure?
Yesterday you tried to kill him in a way that would make it look like a fatal accident
and it backfired.
But Ms. Ichikura had a solid alibi!
The person who tried to run me over
is the same person who stole my groceries!
(Kogoro voice) It was all part of Miss Ichikura's plan.
Her only objective has been, from the very first moment,
to kill Mr. Okonogi.
Eh?
I beg your pardon, Kogoro?
Mr. Tatematsu was just a diversion.
What's he saying?
That I've been used?
Miss Ichikura wanted to kill Mr. Okonogi.
But she had to make it look like an accident
otherwise sooner or later the police would have suspected her.
She started watching Mr. Okonogi every day to find a way to kill him discreetly.
to find a way to kill him discreetly.
"Then, she realized...
"That every day he would go out for a walk at the same time.
"And there was Mr. Tatematsu."
Miss Ichikura recognized Mr. Tatematsu..,
the most unfortunate man in Japan,
because she had seen him on a television program.
That's when she came up with a plan
that included Mr. Tatematsu.
He decided to go along with it.
"I had seen her on TV, but I couldn't remember the name."
"I sent in Conan at Mr. Tatematsu's house.
"To confirm my suspicions,
"And he's been talking to a neighbor who saw a suspicious woman
"Who had followed Mr. Tatematsu...
"One day on his way home from work."
"So, he carried out his plan."
First, she stole Mr. Tatematsu's shopping bag.
Was it you?
"The next day, once he had found out his name and address,
"He looked up Mr. Tatematsu's phone number in the phone book...
"and called him to threaten his life."
"She chose the day because she knew that her boyfriend, Kazuma Sakaki,
"was scheduled to attend a party with his co-workers...
"And she could have a good alibi."
"So, she planted a fake bomb...
"in the women's restroom on the fifth floor...
"of Toto's mall.
"He then rushed back to Beika's neighborhood...
"and carried out the death threat
"that he had made to Mr. Tatematsu."
"He tried to kill Mr. Okonogi by pretending...
"that he had been involved in the accident by chance."
"A little later,
"He made an anonymous call at the mall."
I've placed a bomb in the women's restroom on the fifth floor.
If you don't hurry, it will explode!
"By the time he estimated the police would have found the bomb.
"And there would be a considerable commotion,
"He sent the message."
Am I wrong, Miss Ichikura?
But the alibi he'd deliberately fabricated for himself
came out backwards.
The place where the bomb was found
contradicted the content of the message she had sent.
This small detail has made her the prime suspect.
Tomomi...
(Sighs)

What nonsense!
Who the hell... thought of moving the pump?
Tomomi!
You...?
It was moved by a boy who was shopping at the mall.
Ouch... It's all backwards.
Everything backwards...
A child moved the bomb,
Uncle Okonogi survived a fatal accident,
a famous detective appeared...
It seems to me that I am even more unfortunate than Mr. Tatematsu.
Why did you want to kill him, Uncle?
Because...
he wanted... his fortune.
A long time ago, when we decided we would get married,
I thought that when Mr. Okonogi died,
I would inherit his entire fortune.
But your uncle has always enjoyed iron health.
I couldn't expect him to die naturally.
The money?
This is what you wanted from the beginning?
And what did you think?
The only thing I like about you is your uncle's money.
Oh! Oh, I've been...
I've been... stupid.
(Okonogi) Tomomi...
(Okonogi) Uncle!
Kazuma?
I'll call the doctor.
What am I doing here?
What happened to me, eh, Tomomi?
What a rest!
You woke up.
Yes.
Gee, what a squirrelly woman!
Maybe so, but it seems to me that there's still time to change.
It's strange for a wretch like me to say that, isn't it?
(Kogoro) "He's right."
"We have to give her a vote of confidence."
Ha-ha-ha!
There's nothing better than a beer!
Look, they'll be rebroadcasting that video because it was so well received!
"Here's the video!"
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Poor man, what bad luck he has!
Oh!
"He-he-he-he... This is what he gets for laughing at others!"
"It has to be me! It's got to be me!"
In fact, there are only 3 suspects, inspector.
Genta!
Don't miss the next episode:
"The deadly shot of in Genta, (part one)."
