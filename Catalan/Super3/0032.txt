DETECTIVE CONAN
The Cafeteria Murder
Hey, Ran, where are you going?
Conan, what do you want?
You're going to the movies?
I want to come.
No.
I have a date.
A date, you say?
With Shinichi!
Ah, with Shinichi...
If Father knows I'm meeting him, he'll be angry.
Don't tell him, understand?
Hm.
Have a good time!
Gee boy, this Ran, so moved.
She's really happy, meeting me.
Hey, that's impossible!
(Adult voice) It's me, Shinichi Kudo!
Well, who's she meeting?
Why would she lie to me?
What a fool she is.
I don't care.
Meet whoever you want.
But what are you doing here?
Didn't I tell you I had an appointment?
Why did you come here?
Woman, I also want to see the famous Shinichi.
But you're already late, aren't you?
I'll have to tell the truth.
In fact, I didn't have an appointment with Shinichi...
What?
Well, who are you meeting, that you made me lie?
(Thinking) "Come on, tell me, who is it?"
Look, he's a person I really like... Okay?
Is he, is he more important than Shinichi?
You donkey, you can't compare, Conan!
I've explained enough things to you.
Now will you go back home?
No, it's fine, here!
I got it!
Don't you like cakes?
I'll buy you one.
And when I come back, you take it and take it home.
Excuse me, I'll be right back, miss.
Okay. (Thinking) "I don't like it.
(Thinking) "You're not going to play me, Ran!"
"With my powers of observation and deduction,
I'll find out which man you've met!"
"Because as I always say, there's only one truth."
Good morning, come in.
Ah, it's a woman...
Are you going alone, miss?
Would you like to sit at the bar?
Ah... Miss...
-A coffee.
-I beg your pardon?
Coffee, I said coffee!
And take me right away!
"What a bad mouth you've got!"
"Eh? You look like you're in a hurry. What if that woman was...?"
"No, she can't be... She said..."
I'm waiting for a person I'm very fond of.
"Impossible."
Good morning.
Going alone, sir?
If you want to...
Look, I have some work to finish
and I'd like a quiet table, if possible.
"A university student. Doesn't look like it could be either, this one."
"I don't know of any student who does work during a date."
"Another woman."
-Hello.
Good morning.
I'm meeting someone here, but he hasn't arrived yet.
And what do you want, madam?
Well, can I have a coffee, please?
"Wow, what a beauty!"
"Eh ?! From a law firm?"
"You must be a lawyer?"
"I don't think the Ran would have met with a lawyer."
"What?! Oysters! Even if she would hit me!"
"No, why would she hit me? I was just looking at her, nothing else..."
What, how are we doing?
Hello, Mr.
Tonoyama.
What happened to your finger?
I hurt it in rugby training.
I can't even put on my wedding ring.
(Thinking) "Neither can he! It's not him!"
"If you're meeting someone,
you don't go to the bar without looking to see who's there."
-Tonoyama, did you get a haircut? -Yes, they were starting to get in the way.
-Excuse me, where is it, the washroom?
-Back there, ma'am.
Understood.
-It's for men and women! -I know.
"If I didn't even know where the washroom was, how did I know it was mixed?"
"What a gossip I am."
"But who's he meeting, Ran?"
"If he's not here yet, it could be someone from the bar."
Hello.
Good morning, sir.
Are you alone, sir?
No, I'm meeting a girl, but I don't think she's here yet.
-Well, would you like to sit over there, sir? -Okay. -All right. -Okay.
A coffee, please.
"What if... what if it was him?"
(Mobile)

I'm Shiro, say?
What do you want?
Ah, Yoshio, it's you.
I'm not angry, if you know I'm meeting a girl!
Yes, with the pretty one who visited the TV studios!
"On TV?"
"Maybe she's talking about the day the producer was killed."
You coast, such innocent girls.
Innocent girls are prudent?
You take them to a corner and you have them in the sack!
"What a guy!"
Of course I don't tell the other girls.
I'll see you!
"All right, now you'll see!"
"With my hyperxut slippers, I'll blow this sucker away!"
Mr.
Edogawa!
Eh?
Please, there's a Mr.
Edogawa here?
My name is Edogawa, but... It's nice, it's for you.
Thank you very much.
Hello?
Ah, Conan? Hey, it's the Ran!
Sorry, I can't go back to the cafeteria yet!
The cash register in the store has broken down.
Is anyone around the bar looking for me?
Yes... A person with long hair.
Yes, that's right, he's already here!
But how strange... she always wears her hair up, her hair.
Yes, a moment ago it was already up.
It would be better if you didn't come back because this can't...
It's already fixed, the box!
I'm coming!
Eh?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Wait, wait, wait!
(Think) "When that scoundrel comes out of the sink, le...."
(shouting)
What the fuck?!
Blood!
Kid!
Come here, come here!
Shit, the door's jammed!
Oh, shit!
I'm late.
I'm very late!
Ten is pissed as hell.
What's the matter?
What's up?
What happened in the cafeteria? A murder!
It's a murder!
What is it?
A murder?
(Think) "I hope nothing happened to her."
As this photo shows,
the victim had her back to the door when she fell.
Isn't that right, Conan?
Since the door wouldn't open, I looked over the top.
The victim is Yayoi Shimeno, age 24.
She appears to have died of a heart wound.
There are marks on her neck.
As if she'd been strangled with a thin thing.
From the amount of blood she's lost,
the killer strangled her until she was unconscious,
stabbed her and left her to bleed out.
He must have panicked when she saw his face.
He must have been looking for easy money.
It's an unlocked toilet.
There's a deserted alley outside.
Plus, he left the knife in the victim's things.
And the victim's body was blocking the door.
The killer entered through the window and was waiting for his victim.
Coincidentally, she came in and it was her turn to receive.
He stole her money and fled through the window.
The murderer entered outside!
Look for witnesses.
Wait, Mr. Inspector! What?
Look at the window.
Isn't it too clean?
The cleaner a toilet, the better.
That's not what I meant.
The kid's absolutely right, officer.
Excuse me, you're Inspector Megure now, aren't you?
Wow!
You're Attorney Kisaki!
What are you doing here?
I just happened to be here.
Inspector Megure, do you know her, this woman?
Of course, this woman is...
Well!
With the amount of blood the victim has lost,
the murderer must also have blood on his hands.
But the window through which we think he fled is clean.
He could have cleaned it, don't you think?
Do you think that a murderer who had fled in a hurry,
would have stopped to clean the window?
He left the knife behind so that he couldn't be taken away, Inspector.
Therefore... There is no doubt that the murderer...
...is in this cafeteria!
Don't you mean it, you buffoon?
But Mrs.
Kisaki,
the toilet entrance door wouldn't open because of the corpse.
There's nothing to indicate that the body was moved,
and there's no window at the other toilet.
How would the killer have gotten out?
There is only one possibility: from above.
From above?
Through this space above?
That's impossible.
An adult wouldn't be able to...
Officer, would you mind trying to go over the top?
To the one next door, so as not to damage any evidence.
No... it's not impossible at all...
Am I right?
But if the killer had blood on him...
there should be blood on the wall.
Yes, but right here, there is water to clean the blood.
It could be that he would have removed the stains from the wall afterwards.

What if someone had seen it?
Ah, haven't you noticed, Inspector?
There's also a latch on the toilet door.
If it's locked, no one can enter.
That's right!
Find out who came in before and after the victim.
I know that.
It was the bar and I noticed.
Oh, really?
That one, look, that one there, that robust man...
the guy with the beard...
that guy with the tail...
And he also came in... this lady here!
What?!
You came in too?!
Now that you say it, it's true...
You have a very good memory.
I'm impressed, buffoon.
Ah, yes, madam, thank you.
You will have to explain to us why you have come
and in the order in which you entered the washroom.
I've come to do some university work.
Very well.
I entered the washroom behind him.
And I came to this bar because I had an appointment with someone.
I was next.
I come almost every day.
The owner and I are friends.
I was the last one to enter the bathroom.
I was here waiting for a girl.
What do you think, kid?
Is this the right order, Conan?
Yes... yes.
(thinks) "What can it be?"
"You seem to see something different from before."
Didn't take you long, did it?
Now the next one.
Mr. Wakaoji.
Yes, sir!
Oh, oh, I can't seem to make it, Inspector.
Oh, oh! Hey!
I guess you didn't fool us!
Will I have to do it too?
No, it would be impossible.
And you, Mrs. Kisaki.
Kisaki, it seems to me that...
Yes, I'd jump without a problem, sir.
The suspects would be M.
Sumeragi and me, right, Inspector?
No, no, and now!
I wasn't accusing her of anything, just...
Inspector!
We found this on Mr. Sumeragi's desk.
Sumeragi's table.
What's this?!
Mr. Sumeragi, is it yours?
Sumeragi, is it yours?
Yes, but it's just a piece of cloth to tie up the books.
I'm not the murderer!
I swear it!
"This man who entered before the victim is not the murderer."
"The victim asked the owner where the sink was."
"It was probably like a password
to tell the killer to meet him in the bathroom."
"This means the killer was already in the bar, then."
"The only one who could have done it is lawyer Kisaki!"
Inspector!
I'm taking the murder weapon back to the police station.
Yes, do, do.
Let me see it.
Hey, nano pussy!
"There's something wrong with this knife."
"Why is there blood on the handle?"
"And why is this piece without blood?"
"Eh? I have blood on my hand! I didn't touch the corpse."
"I can only have stained myself when I looked over the door."
"Why was there blood there? How could a corpse..."
"I've got it!"
"I know how he did it, the murderer! It's crystal clear!"
"There's only one person there who can do it!"
"But I don't have any proof!"
Enough of playing detective... cute!
This is a job for grown-ups!
No... it's just...
Eh ?!
(Think) "A wedding ring!"
"I've got it!"
"If the deductions are correct, I have the smoking gun!"
Mr.
Sumeragi, are you ready to take a field trip to the police station?
I didn't kill anyone, Mr. Inspector!
Hey, did you see the blood here?
I noticed it when I was taking the pictures, Inspector.
And why the hell didn't you tell me?
The evidence against you is becoming more and more conclusive.
Why is that?
But isn't it strange, all this?
Look, this is the door that was blocked with the corpse.
He used the toilet bowl to jump into the other toilet.
Yes, yes, Conan, but...
Besides, shouldn't there be blood on it, the killer?
Take a good look at the knife bag.
Even the handle is full of blood.
That's true.
And this piece of knife that is not stained at all?
Surely because there was something attached to the handle.
What a ?!
The murderer tied a rope around the handle, tied it to death
and pulled it out when he got out of the toilet.
A lot of blood comes out when the knife is removed from the body.
But why is there blood on top?
So that the murderer is not the one who jumped from above.
It was the corpse.

What?
The corpse?
Probably, the blood on top of the door
must have dripped when the killer dumped the body inside.
He stabbed her outside the toilet, flushed her over the top,
and lay on the floor, blocking the door.
Then, from the outside, he pulled the rope.
And thus, the murderer, who could not possibly pass over the door, was automatically excluded from the list,
was automatically excluded from the list of suspects.
Of course, the murderer is...
So, the murderer is...
You're the only one who doesn't pass, aren't you, Mr.
Tonoyama?!
Come on, take him to the police station!
Hey, is it legal to arrest a person without evidence?
Don't worry, we already have evidence!
Oi, Mrs. Kisaki?
No, we don't.
Eh?!
If you were to arrest him and I were his lawyer,
I'd get him acquitted for lack of evidence.
Of course you would!
You see?
I just came to talk to the owner of the bar.
He said he hurt his finger in rugby training.
And that's why the wedding ring isn't...
You don't wear it on the ring finger of your left hand, the ring?
When you entered the bar, you were wearing the bandage on your ring finger, weren't you?
You changed the bandage in the bathroom, maybe?
I get it!
Of course you do!
You used the bandage
to strangle the victim and to tie the knife!
Oh, my lord... What a dumb ass!
Look that you keep such an obvious proof as this.
Not even a lawyer as good as me could justify this absent-mindedness.
Get out of here, you!
(Thinking) "Gee, what a judo key!"
-It's already ours! -Let me go!
(Thinking) "This judo key... it rings a bell..."
"With the help of the lawyer, they were able to arrest the murderer."
"In Tonoyama, the Yayoi had died
because she pressured him to marry her."
"A in Tonoyama was afraid
that his wife knew he had a mistress,
so he killed her."
"Now I have to do something
to lose sight of that cheeky guy who's trying to pick up Ran!"
Hello!
Sorry I'm late!
I've kept you waiting so long!
Boy, what does it mean?
"You take the girls to a corner and you've already got them in the sack?"!
This is what he said.
But what does this boy say?
Nice to meet you... Who is this boy?
Eh?
Aaaaa...
Is it true, what he said in Conan?
Hi, Sonoko...
It's all true, isn't it?
There's been a misunderstanding.
Just a moment.
Sonoko!
"So this one was waiting for Sonoko?"
"Well, who is it? Who was she meeting, Ran?"
Caram, where are you going, dressed like that?!
Didn't I tell you not to wear these short skirts?
Will you stop treating me like a child, eh, Mom?
What?
What did you say?
Mother?!?
Mother?!
Mareeeeee ?!

Why are you hiding, you, now?
You were in high spirits just now.
It's amazing!
You've practically solved the case by yourself.
Isn't that right, Conan?
Poor thing, I seem to be afraid of him....
(thinks) "Evidently!"
"When I was little,
m'escridassava in a bad way when I played with the Ran."
"Just to see her, my heart goes a thousand."
Mother, it's been 10 years since you left home.
What's this about?
"That's why I didn't remember."
Don't you think it's about time you went home to father?
Never in my life!
I never want to see him again, that filthy drunk!
I couldn't stand it.
Years of being married gave me a daughter and that judo key.
Then why did you get married?
This is fate.
And why do you wear the wedding ring?
It's like an insecticide to ward off parasites.
How stubborn!
(Quiet!
There's a problem.
It's the video of that TV studio case.
Didn't you want to watch it, Mother?
(TV) "We watched the phone scene,
which was basic to solving this case."
"My wife? Don't suffer! We don't live together anymore!"

"Let's go clubbing, pretty girl?"
Ah!
No, no!
This is a...
I can't seem to get back, can I?
Beware of childhood friends and detectives.
Eh ?!
They'll never bring you anything good!
Mother, wait a minute!
