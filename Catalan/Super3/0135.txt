The case of the investigation of the missing murder weapon.
I wish we had some interesting cases.
The one at the national stadium was great, wasn't it?
Let's see if we have one just like it.
(Think) If they were all like that, it would be awful.
Look, look!
I always come to this hair salon.
Midori Beauty Salon.
The owner of the salon is called Midori.
There is a hairdresser with very good taste, Mika.
She has it all booked.
(Woman) Wait a second, Mika!
What do you want?
What the fuck do you mean?!
I'll join another beauty salon.
Monday I'll leave the job here.
I won't let you do it.
To begin with...
-Madam... -What's the matter?!
It's just that... The client is waiting for you.
I'll be right back, tell her to wait!
I won't let you do whatever you want!
Gee, isn't that you, Ayumi?
Are you with friends?
Mika, are you leaving the salon?
Yes, another salon is interested in me.
I didn't expect it...
I would have liked you to cut my hair.
Let's do it, do you want me to cut your hair?
As your mother always recommends me, I'll do it.
Really?
I said it right away, but I have it all booked until Monday.
I've got it!
Tomorrow I'll cut you at my place!
-At your place? -Can we come too?
Of course, come all of you.
If you don't mind, I can't...
Conan, you'll come, won't you?
I'll come, right? -Okay...
This morning I woke up at 5 o'clock!
I'm super happy!
-What haircut will you give him? -I can't wait. -I can't wait.
What a peace...
But something intrigues me.
How did you come here?
It's quite obvious:
to see how you identify with your role as a child.
AAAAAAAAA!
Genta, are you okay?
Yes.
Donkey.
What the fuck are you doing?
Watch your step.
(Raven calls)
The crow also takes you for a donkey.
Yes...
Let's see...
It's that block of apartments.
(What the hell am I doing, at this time of the morning?
(Come on, Conan!
Don't just stand there like a stupefied fool.
We'll leave you here!
Sorry, excuse me.
Here we are!
It's this floor.
It's strange.
Maybe he's forgotten.
-You must not be sleeping, though? -It's possible.
Today he was starting work later.
-The door is open. How rash.
Excuse me... Hello, Mika, you're home?
Maybe she's out shopping.
Isn't that Mika sleeping over there?
Hey, Conan!
Hey, Conan!
Mika...
What happened to her?
Is she dead?
She's been murdered.
Someone strangled her.
(Takagi) The victim is Miss Mika Mitsui, 24 years old,
a hairdresser at Beika's Midori Beauty Salon.
(Takagi) Good job.
Is it finished?
Yes, all yours, Inspector.
I'd say it's been 10 to 13 hours since time of death.
The cause, asphyxiation.
She was strangled with some object...
Is there anything wrong, Inspector?
Look.
The strangulation mark is only on the front.
Yes.
What should you do?
Co... Conan!
You can't come in here!
Now both is, look at this, inspector.
You have a blue plastic on the nail of the middle finger.
What could it be?
If we don't do a detailed analysis, I can't certify it.
It must be a fragment of plastic.
(thinks) "Plastic?"
"The grocery bag with dinner in it,
a suit just picked up from the dry cleaners,
a dress on the ground with the cleaning service card,
and a torn plastic bag."

"She was to return after going through the supermarket and the dry cleaners,
and she was to be murdered shortly thereafter."
"However, something..."
Something...
Something doesn't fit.
Ah, yes...
Me neither.
There is something... Kids!
You two!
I beg you, please, can you get out of here?!
This is no place for children!
But we have discovered the corpse.
We'll talk later, wait in the lobby on the second floor.
Takagi, call the beauty parlor
and have someone come to identify the body.
I can't believe it, poor Mika...
I'm shocked.
(Thinking) "That blue plastic fragment, what could it be?"
"A fragment of a personal item of the murderer?"
"Or from the murder weapon? If so, what should the weapon be?"
Ah!
It's Mrs. Midori!
She's been called by the police to come and identify the body.
What?
But where?
Mrs. Midori!
Ayumi, what do you want?
The Mika's apartment is here!
Eh?!
Oh, is it?
Oh, my...
I don't know where my head is today.
But, Ayumi, how come you're here?
Today, we were supposed to meet Mika.
And then...
Ah, that's why.
You must have been scared.
Can I ask you a question?
What do you want?
Why are you wearing this band-aid?
Eh?
Ah!
I... I got burned.
I'm just a little clumsy.
(Midori) Mika!
Why would something like that happen to you?
Where should Mrs. Midori go now?
She was crying.
What's wrong, madam?
What were you looking at?
Nothing, nothing...
I felt sick and I wanted to get some air.
I feel better now.
(Thinking) What's going on here?
What were you looking at, that lady?
Kudo...
(Adult voice) Ah, Haibara...
I told you something didn't fit, remember?
Did you find out anything?
He wasn't there.
He had just picked it up from the dry cleaners, and it wasn't there.
"It"?
Ah!
I got it!
That plastic fragment, was it from the murder weapon?
It's possible.
If that woman was the murderer, what she was looking at was...
We're doomed!
Sir, wait a minute!
What's the matter, boy?
Why are you so overwhelmed?
Go back to teure the debris from this street!
There's something important inside!
Don't talk nonsense.
(Haibara) Hurry up!
Hey, wait a minute!
(Think) What a girl!
People who leave garbage at night are a real pain in the ass.
If they take out the garbage at night,
the others throw it away without consideration.
What are you talking about, boy?
The next morning, if the truck comes by, there's no evidence left.
Let's see, Conan, we're very busy, we can't talk about garbage now.
Wait, Takagi.
I'll ask you a question.
Yes, go ahead.
Have you picked up the garbage from that building?
Yes.
This street is the last of the collection route.
Well...
I'm sorry, but you'll have to drop off the street debris
in the parking lot of that building, please.
But what is it, Inspector?
The murder weapon, Takagi!
After committing the crime,
the murderer could have thrown the gun in the trash.
The victim lived alone.
There was a good chance she would have been discovered in the daytime.
Thus, by the time the investigation had begun,
they would have picked up the debris by now!
Maybe he threw the hanger away so that it would be of no use to him.
That's right.
Maybe she threw the hanger away so that it wouldn't do her any service.
A coat hanger?
Of course he did!
I get it!
The murder weapon is a blue hanger!
When we get something to the dry cleaners,
they do it on a single-use hanger.
Yes!
The dress wasn't on a hanger.
The killer made the opening of the hanger wider,
he passed through the victim's neck from behind
and strangled her by pulling himself taut.
I get it.
That's why she only has strangulation marks on the front of her neck.
How do you figure?
If it's a blue hanger... Eh?
The blue plastic that's left on the victim's fingernail.
Must be plastic from the lining of the coat hanger.
The victim tried to free herself from the coat hanger that was strangling her...
and must have grabbed it in this way.
Then, to the nail, a piece of plastic remained.
Madam!
You have also come to look at the waste ?

So it is true, she is worried.
She used to watch them from the roof, and when she arrived, she came here.
No... you're wrong.
What are you saying, boy?
I just came by to see what you were all doing here together.
This is a murder investigation.
Please cooperate.
That's the way we'll do it.
(Thinking) "If my intuition has hit the mark,
the hanger remains a proof that incriminates the murderer."
"A piece of evidence that offers absolute truth."
-Oysters!
There were so many? -It is that the van compresses them.
Split up and get to work!
You mean it will appear?
Yes.
It seems that the inspector is very convinced.
Inspector, we've opened all the bags, but he's not here.
It's out of the question!
You must look for more!
Conan!
Ah... Excuse me, Inspector.
(Thinking) Why didn't we find him?
What do we do now, Inspector?
Help pick up this scattering.
Present our apologies to the cleaning service operators.
All right, sir.
Mrs. Goto...
Forgive me for asking,
but where were you yesterday between 8 and 11 o'clock?
Why are you asking me this question?
Just to get a rough idea.
Are you saying that I murdered Mika?!
You can't be serious!
Why me?
But yesterday, even though I was arguing with Mika.
You told Mika that you wouldn't let him go to another classroom.
That was...
It's true that I told her... But...
We won't clear it up here, so he'll come to the police station.
No way!
I've left the job half done!
If you insist on pinning the murder on me,
bring proof to prove it, please!
If I may...
What, Inspector...
From the way she looked,
there's no doubt that she threw the hanger in the garbage.
So...
Yes, my intuition tells me so.
I'm not wrong when I say she's the murderer.
(Thinking) "The inspector is absolutely right."
"If we look at her behavior we can't be wrong."
"But how come the hanger hasn't turned up? What does it look like?"
I can't believe the Midori is the murderer.
But the inspector said they weren't wrong.
So how come the hanger hasn't turned up?
It could be that someone took it.
There are people who pick things out of the trash.
Ah!
I picked up a doll from Yaiba the Masked!
This is filthy.
It's not the kind of thing people can brag about, is it?
Nothing wrong with it?
It's a net to put garbage bags in
so the crows don't pop them.
What's so weird about it, Conan?
It could be that the perch was taken by a crow.
Crows eat clothes hangers? They use them to build a nest.
Crows that live in the city use materials such as perch and wire
such as perch and wires to build the nest.
If we were to look for the nest, we might...
Let's go!
The Junior Detective League will search for crow's nests!
Hey, hey, hey!
There's a crow's nest?
Yeah, it's a nest that's half built.
-Where is it? -It's on that light pole.
I can see it!
A crow's nest!
We've found it!
It's a blue perch!
Mrs. Goto...
This is the coat hanger that was used in the crime.
The plastic found in the victim's fingernail
matches the missing fragment of the coat hanger.
In addition, on the tip of this wire, a bloodstain has been found.
It is from a different blood type than the victim.
This is all we have.
Most likely, when the killer strangled Miss Mika,
he must have made a wound on his hand.
Mrs. Goto, would you mind removing the Band-Aid on your right hand?
That girl...
threw the hanger at me
when I went to ask her not to leave my salon.
I'm begging you.
If you do it for the salary, we can come to an agreement.
Don't touch me!
I'll do whatever I want!
Please leave!
It was unforgivable!
She forgot what I had done for her and threw the hanger at me.
Is this the reason?
And for such a ridiculous reason, you have taken the life of a person ?!

DETECTIVE CONAN
I'm glad the case has been solved, but I'm sad.
I still can't believe it.
They were both kind to me...
People have many faces.
(Genta) Guys...
Don't you find that those crows are looking at us very badly?
Maybe they are angry because we took them the perch.
So...
We won't be able to come back to this park for quite a while.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
If in Conan it was here!
It's weird!
A... This is...!
Something has happened...
Either they have it closed...
or they've already killed it.
In the next chapter...
The case of the investigation of the ancient blue castle...
The clue to the next Conan is... A chess piece!
The Junior Detective League will be very active!
(Genta) From now on... Detective Genta!
