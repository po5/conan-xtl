DETECTIVE CONAN
The Spring Festival Murder Case
(TV) "We connect with one of the famous spring festival."
"The Mount Mitsudai ceremony, in which words are made with flames,
is a world-famous event."
"The words "Heaven, Low and Best" will be lit."
Can you make less noise?
When I was about to take a bath,
you come back from the party to get the wallet.
You didn't forget tonight's promise, did you?
-Yes!
Yes! -Promise?
I came here because you told me we would celebrate...
Why dressed like that?
And the room?
May I know what you're up to?
I'm sorry, but I won't keep the promise.
Okay, is that right?
Because it turns out that the honoree, will be....
(TV) "The world's best spring party begins!"
"The word 'Best' has been illuminated..."
...will be dead...
Imatake, don't hold a grudge.
Hey, didn't you hear the sound of a gunshot?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Oh, it's on!
They've lit the last word!
Yes!
Conan, you know how it goes, this ritual?
It's about lighting 3 words: sky, low and best, one at a time,
to ask for a year of good harvests.
Eh?
(Think) "It looks like the Kyoto party."
This staying in a hostel and celebrating the feast is really cool.
And so much.
Isn't it, Conan?
"Yes... if I didn't have this balloon."
"What a rage! They treat me like a little kid."
Oh!
Excuse me...
Could you throw me a picture, please? Yes, of course, sir.
Here's the camera.
Let's see the word "better" in the picture.
Are you ready?
Smile!
Go for it.
Oh!
I think the balloon came out.
Never mind, thank you very much.
I'm doing a report on the local spring festivities,
and that will serve as a graphic document.
You're a writer!
You're so tanned I thought you were a sportsman.
I'm tanned from doing a lot of reporting abroad.
Wait a minute.
You can keep this book, if you like.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Norikazu Sasai?
Although I used to write under the pseudonym "Tomokazu Imai" a long time ago.
What?
"Tomokazu Imai"?
I know him already!
I've read many of his novels in high school!
But if I'm not mistaken,
it was the nickname I used for Satoru Imatake at the beginning.
I'm a close friend of Imatake's.
We used to write the novels together.
You mean "at Satoru Imatake"?
Today we came together to see the party
to celebrate his winning the Naomoto Prize.
Uuuuh... It's hot...
(Think) "If you're hot, take off your jacket."
Could you take two or three more pictures of me?
Ah, sure.
Oh!
-You're in Norikazu Sasai, right?
-Yes.
I'm at Yokomizo, Saitama Police Department.
I wanted to ask you some questions about Satoru Imatake.
What happened to him, the Imatake?
She was murdered.
Eh?
...in the hotel room where they were staying.
The murder weapon is a pistol.
She was killed at two or three minutes past eight.
The killer is a young man who fled after the shooting.
Didn't you see her?
Yes, just as they were starting to report on the party.
It seems clear that he was shot in the head.
Hey, who are you?
But who are you?
Who... me?
Well, I'm a private detective.
Oh... You mustn't be...
mustn't you be that famous detective?
-In Kogoro Mouri! Yes!
I'm Kogoro, but...
Oh, my goodness!
You have solved many complicated cases!
I've followed your exploits in the newspapers!
Thank you very much.
"It's me who has solved them all!"
Please, Mr. Mouri, make whatever inquiries you like.
I would very much like to know your opinion.
Let's see...
But this...
What is it?
This is...
Toothpaste.
Ouch!
Ouch!

"A toothbrush? He got shot while brushing his teeth?"
Coi as a child, always in the way!
Have you found out anything yet?
I'd say, it was a robbery.
A robbery... only?
They only took the bills from the wallet.
And as you can see, the murderer has removed everything.
It is evident that the motive of the crime is economic.
That the victim is on the floor near the entrance,
someone knocked on the door,
he has opened it confidently, and has been shot.
But detective Mouri, are you sure?
Isn't there another possibility?
That the robbery was a diversion and his partner killed her.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
You've got to be kidding!
Isn't it true that the crime was committed around 8:00?
I have an alibi.
At that time I was celebrating the spring festival.
And Mr. Mouri can confirm everything, right?
Yes, but we met towards the end.
I have been from the beginning!
If you think I'm lying...
reveal this reel,
my alibi is proven by the photos!
Understood.
Officer, take it to be developed right now!
(Think) "Inspector Yokomizo is right, this is not a robbery!"
"The victim knew the murderer."
"There's no doubt, it's him!"
"But why is he so calm?"
"What alibi can there be, in these photos?"
(Yokomizo) "He has taken 7 pictures."
"But what does it have to do with his alibi?"
(Yokomizo) "This photo was taken by me?
Look, you see Conan's balloon?
Yes, it was about the same time they have lit the word "Best".
"But the word 'Best' was lit at about 3/4 of 9."
"The crime has been committed at about two or three minutes past eight."
"It would have been there in 40 minutes."
Inspector Yokomizo...
when they light the first word, "Heaven," at about 8 o'clock,
how long is it on?
Approximately 25 minutes, Mr. Mouri.
Well, look at this picture.
It shows that, at least, at 1/4 and 10 of 9,
Mr. Norikazu was at the party.
The crime was committed around 8 o'clock.
No matter how fast you go,
it is impossible to get to the party in 25 minutes from the hotel.
Congratulations, your alibi turned out to be true.
Of course it is.
(Think) "How could he have taken the picture?"
But, he may have taken the picture....
with a double exposure, a trick.
An expert could do that.
I gave the camera to you to go develop the film.
Besides, it's a single-use camera.
It would be impossible to tamper with it.
You took the film to be developed, didn't you?
Yes, I did, sir.
It didn't look like it had been tampered with.
Of course it did!
You see?
Inspector Yokomizo...
at least we know it's true that she was at the party, right?
They told us at the front desk.
Mr. Sasai left the hotel around 2/4 of 8.
He checked the time so many times that the receptionist remembered.
Because he wanted to arrive at the time they turned on the word "Heaven".
You see, today I had forgotten my watch.
You should know that everything gives me a very bad feeling...
It looks like he's been preparing alibis.
Listen, listen, sir, I'm beginning to get sick of it!
Instead of wasting time,
you should be looking for the criminal who murdered my friend.
Mr. Imatake!
Mr. Y...!
Oh!
Where is he?
If you want to see him, he's been taken to the morgue.
Who are you?
My name is Yamada, I work for the magazine "Literary Moments".
The police have notified me of the tragic news.
"Literary Moments", isn't that the magazine where...
Yes, where I published "The Legend of the Sword of Courage."
It's Mr. Sasai, you?
The Imatake told me that I had to write the next episode.
That's right!
And I had to submit it, tomorrow.
Ooooh!
This is terrible!
No writer would not do it to me by tomorrow,
and no one writes like Imatake.
I'll have no choice...
-Tingui: What is this?
A story I wrote.
Imatake wanted to read it, and just today he brought it.
I don't think I can do it as well as Mr. Imatake, but...
And now!
You two had written together.
Everyone in the editorial department will agree!
Are you sure?
It's just the prologue to a long story.

We would like you to continue writing for "Literary Moments".
It puts me in a bind.
I already have a lot of work.
We'd really appreciate it.
Okay, I'll do it for the Imatake, because she has been murdered.
I'll do it for Imatake, because she's been murdered.
Thank you very much!
Well, I'll be going now.
Hey, inspector.
Did you feel this?
I'm sorry, but you see, I have to go to work.
I'll do it for Imatake, killed by someone who wanted money.
"I have no doubt! The murderer is him!"
"But he has an alibi! How can that be?"
"How could he have taken that damn picture
without tampering with the camera?"
"It's the photo he had Ran take."
"But a photo taken later than 3/4 and 9, that's not an alibi."
"It can't be! There's got to be something!"
"A clue to blow the alibi."
"I'll remember... the moment we found it."
-I'm sorry, but I won't go. Wait.
"Of course! I'm sure that..."
How hot...
"Why didn't you take it off? Or maybe you couldn't take it off?"
Could you take a picture of me, miss?
Here's the camera.
Let's see the word "better".
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
We still have work to do!
If you don't leave me alone, I'll report you!
"Sure, I know how he did it... I've already caught him!"
"Sure he's the murderer! And it's a planned murder!"
"I've already solved this mystery."
"His alibi is a trap he made with the photos."
"I have to get this information to the inspector!"
I'm sorry, but I'm leaving!
Just a moment!
"I have to do something."
"Very well! I'll use my secret weapon!"
"Here quietly."
"I'll leave the photos on the table."
"And with the voice transformer, I'll imitate his voice."
(Kogoro's voice) Ah... ah...
"Oysters! The balloon!"
I have a photo to prove my alibi!
Mr. famous detective, why don't you tell him?
Explain to him, explain to him that it's a brick.
(Kogoro voice) He's right!
Inspector Yokomizo, you have disappointed me greatly.
Mr. Mouri...
I wasn't saying anything because you solved the case yourself.
You were fooled by the trick of the criminal's photos.
-What?
-That's what he looks like?
Of course it is!
What died in Satoru Imatake is in this room...
It's in Norikazu Sasai!
Just a moment, detective.
You said you suspected it was a robbery.
I said that to get you to trust me and let your guard down.
The moment I saw the victim's face...
I knew the killer was someone I knew.
Why?
The toothpaste was in the victim's mouth.
The toothbrush was also on the floor next to him.
The victim was brushing his teeth before the murder.
And what is that supposed to mean, sir?
Doesn't everyone brush their teeth?
That's true,
but, let's see, who opens the door to a stranger
with a mouth full of toothpaste?
Have you seen him anywhere, this?
And another thing!
The state of this room.
The murderer ran away, after the shot.
Would he have had time to search this room, in such a short time?
The killer probably did it before he killed the victim,
precisely because it looked like a robbery.
You're right, the crime scene is full of evidence accusing me.
But I have an alibi.
How do you explain that I have a photo that proves my alibi?
I was supposed to have taken it another year ago
and had kept it until today.
And you used it again at the party tonight,
when he asked to have his picture taken
from the second photo of the roller.
It's a very simple trick,
but since he was wearing the same clothes, it was hard to notice.
So, if he has withstood the heat with the jacket on,
it was because it had to look the same as last year.
Am I right?
That's a brilliant deduction, Detective Mouri.
But do you have any proof that the photo is from last year
and that you can use it to frame me?
I have proof that proves it.
What's that?
You see?
In this photograph... the...
Conan!
Will you be quiet?
Not angry father!
Ouch!
AAAAAAAAAA!
Oh!
Father!
Oh, now!
(Kogoro voice) Inspector Yokomizo, finish figuring it out.
Yes.
The doll?
What's that?
Oh...
As you can see, I forgot my watch.

What does it do?
What is the meaning of this?
In the photo that you claim is the alibi...
you see the doll tanned.
Instead, this doll is very white!
This photo... was taken a year ago!
Am I right?
Mr. Sasai...
Inspector, you win.
A year ago, I started planning to assassinate Imatake.
I wanted to take his place among the stars of the literary world.
"The Literary Moment" wanted to publish a series of mine.
But at the last minute,
the editorial department rethought
and decided to publish Imatake's work,
who had submitted it at the last minute.
It is logical, Imatake had more name than me.
That series was my last chance to make a name for myself.
And I took it as if it were a game!
Is that why he killed it?
Exactly, I killed him, inspector.
Miss...
the literary work for which the Imatake received the Naomoto award
is a story that Imatake and I had made up.
But anyway, now no one would believe it.

DETECTIVE CONAN
A brilliant deduction, Detective Mouri!
Thanks to you we have apprehended the murderer, Mr. Sasai,
and solved this case.
(Thinking) "The murderer? The Sasai? The case?"
Come on, don't pretend.
If in Sasai is the murderer, then it's a murder case!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
(All) Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
What a joker!
Ignoramuses.
You came to consult something, didn't you?
You said you were going out with Shinichi?
This door has been forced.
The culprit is in Neokem.
Shinichi!
Now I've found you!
Shinichi!
Get out of here!
I know you're in here!
