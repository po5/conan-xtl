My ticket has won the commercial avenue lottery.
"Since I had the winning ticket
we can go on a trip like this again."
We've heard that one too many times, haven't we? Yes.
This is true.
You always get lucky with the lotteries.
Tinc luck with everything!
Ha-ha-ha!
You mean it's going to be all right?
He's the one who made the arrangements.
Don't worry, Conan is very mature for his age.
And you, father, you're already drinking massa.
Mmm!
All right, I'll stop drinking.
"The chained poem of Matsue, (part 1)"
Look, boys, the town of Matsue.
It's famous for its castle.
And for Lake Shinji.
I understand that the Seven Rarities of Lake Shinji are worth a visit.
The Seven Rarities?
It refers to the rarities that can be caught in this lake:
bass, icefish, smelt, clams, shrimp, carp and eels.
They call them The Seven Rarities, collectively.
Matsue is also important to Lafcadio Hearn,
as Yakumo Koizumi is also called.
You mean the author of Kwaidan, ghost stories?
Yes, most people are familiar
with the story of "In Earless Yoichi and The Snow Woman."
There is a blood chilling story based on Matsue.
Ran, do you want to feel it? Eh?
Ha-ha.
Some other day.
(Woman) Mr. Kogoro Mouri.
A member of our staff will show you to your room.
Wait here.
We'll serve you some green tea and sweets.
(Woman) Thank you.
It's Lake Shinji.
It's wonderful.
We have a view of the lake from here.
Tomorrow we can watch them clamming.
Speaking of clamming... Basho wrote a poem about it.
"Like the oyster marching out of its shell, autumn goes."
-Ha-ha-ha-ha.-Shiina, don't be rude.
-But aren't you sorry? -I'm sorry to correct you.
-But it didn't say oyster, it said cloïssa.
Clam?
Yes... in fact, the poem says:
"Like the clam that leaves its shell, autumn leaves."
He composed it to put it at the end of Ogaki's Oku no hosomichi.
Ha-ha-ha.
You know a lot, you.
(Male) Matsue is considered a big city,
along with Kyoto and Kanazawa, for the sweets it makes.
In Osaka we will also have to work hard to make it.
That's Takumi Yagisawa.
She has a very important candy store in Osaka.
In fact, I'm just following in my father's footsteps.
Ah, so he's a young owner.
They're really good.
Enjoy your meal.
I won't eat one.
But don't forget to brush your teeth after you eat.
Ah... Yes.
It's at Ryosuke Shiina.
He's a great dentist.
-And then, we have the girl.
She's Mizuki Kawaguchi.
My disciple.
She works in the library.
-Very... Very much like. Did you say your disciple?
Ah, yes, I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself earlier.
I'm doing a literature research at a university in Osaka.
Wow, you have a Ph.
D. in Literature?
We are part of a chain poetry group in Osaka.
and we came on a trip to compose poetry with each other.
Chain poetry...
One person is missing from our group.
It is there talking.
It is in Gozo Ushikubo, an investor.
The price of these shares will continue to rise.
My name is Kogoro Mouri and I work as a detective in Tokyo.
-Kogoro Mouri? -What?
-Mr. Kogoro Mouri, the famous one. -That famous detective?
Yes, he is.
There's him in it.
Famous detectives like you must make a lot of money.

-No, the truth is that you don't really want to.
Good morning, my name is Tomonaga.
My name is Tomonaga and I work in a finance company.
It's a pleasure to greet you.
The Ushikubo and I work together a...
-Hey, didn't you have to squint, you? -Hey?
Ah, yes, you're right.
I also like poetry and sometimes I compose some.
I'd like to join your group someday.
Mr. Mouri, have a good trip.
Mmmm!
Dr. Reiko, what is it, this fat book?
Eh?
Ah, this one here?
It's a dictionary of object names.
We use it whenever we compose poetry.
You want to look at it?
Yes.
Oh, it's very interesting.
It's very interesting.
Hey, look at these boots.
See?
They look like Mr. Shiina's.
Eh?
Yes, you could say "trèquing boots".
Although my boots are just an imitation.
Ha-ha-ha!
These boots are branded and very flashy.
They look pretty expensive.
If you're scrubbed...
Ha-ha-ha!
Mr. Mouri, why don't you join us for lunch?
That's a fantastic idea.
We'll be able to hear the anecdotes of Japan's top detective.
The most important?
Ha-ha-ha.
Well, how could I refuse?
I accept your invitation.
Ha-ha-ha!
Oh... Ouch...
Oh.
These hot springs are fantastic.
Yeah. (Man) It's true.
You feel like your body is turning into hot chocolate.
More or less.
Excuse me, Mr. Yagisawa...
Mmm?
What's this chained poetry?
How can I explain it to you to make it easy?
It's a kind of game where a lot of people compose many poems
and then connect them with each other.
You can compose a haiku of 5, 7 and 5 syllables.
The next person adds a 6 and 7 syllable poem.
And another person adds another poem.
And so on.
Is it very different from haiku?
The first stanza of 5, 7 and 5 syllables called heading,
but I guess it can be considered a haiku,
it contains a reference to the season.
I get it.
What kind of poems do you like?
Mmm... I like comic poems.
What do you like, Shiina?
Eh?
Do I?
Let's see...
My favorite poems are the ones with a lot of feeling.
Such as a father feels for his daughter.
Ah, yes, yes.
Forgive me for asking... Do you have children?
I have a daughter, but my wife took her away when she left me.
Oh, well... I'm sorry.
But I don't blame her. It was all my fault.
-I was loaded with deutes. -Ya.
(harmonica)

Thank you for listening to me.
Mr. Yagisawa, you're doing very well.
Here, Mr. Mouri, drink as much as you want.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
By the way, one thing: have you made plans for tomorrow?
Ah, that's right, now I wanted to ask you.
Have you heard about Yaegaki temple?
Eh?
Dr. Ando told me about it while we were at the hot springs.
Why don't we go there tomorrow?
Ah, tomorrow morning we'll go to the Tiffany Park Art Museum.
And in the afternoon we could go to... Yaegaki Temple, huh?
They have the god of marriage there.
He's famous for his predictions of the Mirror Lake, right?
Is that right?
Yes...
Well, I guess we'll have to go there too.
Except for Ushikubo, all of us are single.
But Ran, you've already found someone special, haven't you?
Eh?
Grrr!
I'm sure there's a bus going from Yaegaki Temple tomorrow
to the Matsue hot springs.
You can go to the museum in the afternoon.
Ah, then... let's do this.
Coi, you really want to tangle the skein you have, this one.
-Quiet, take it easy. Listen to something, Ando.
Yes?
We should choose the location where we'll compose the first poem.
Yes, you're right... Shiina, we could start.
Yes.
The location to compose the first poem?
We will go to choose the location where we will make the heading of our poem.
I remember, the heading with the 5, 7 and 5 syllable haiku...
that starts the chain poem.
Yes, the poem is to be composed with a description of the landscape.
Ah, I almost got careless.
Here you are.
This is for you, Mr. Mouri.
Oh...
It's an introduction to chained poetry, I wrote it myself.
There's also a photograph of us, inside the book.
Oh, is that so?
That's right.
They're all there.
I've already finished.

Mizuki, can you take the hat?
It's over there, on the bag.
Yes.
-Here, here's the tens. Thank you.
-Very good.
Ushikubo, you go first. Okay.
By age, I should be next.
Let's see...
Next is... That's it.
Everyone read your paper.
-Matsue Castle. Gessho Temple.
Shiomiwatade.
That means I get the art museum.
Let's go then.
We'll leave the hotel tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.
And we'll be back at 11:30.
Then, when we're all back, we'll go to Tamatsukuri,
and there we'll string our poems together.
Oh, no.
What's wrong, Mr. Takumi?
No, it's just that I'm wearing glasses, and if my eyes get dry,
I have to put some drops.
Ah, they are here.
I'm absent-minded, I don't remember where I put them.
You should always carry a spare bottle.
I always carry an extra cell phone.
Oh, that's right, I have to make an important call.
He-he-he.
Caram.
He's a very busy man.
Isn't he?
He's probably found another victim.
Eh?
Part of his motive for joining our group was to...
to take our money.
He's miserable.
(Gozo, from afar) Listen to me carefully, Yagisawa.
You're the one who can't afford to lose his business.
(Thinking) "This is..." Listen to me well.
You'd better have them all ready next week,
or else pay me what you owe me or you'll lose your business.
Yes. Mmm?
They say if the paper doesn't sink in 15 minutes,
you'll find the love of your life.
If it sinks soon, it means the person you're looking for is close to you.
So let's give it a try.
(Dog: squeaks)
(Dog: squeaks)
"That's why I didn't want to bring her here."
"Ran... I don't know what the god said back, but I..."
Sorry to keep you waiting.
What a snorting puppy. Uh, yeah...
Look, Ran, I... Eh?
Eh?
Shall we go? Mm-mm.
(Mobile)
Yes, hello?
Ah, it's you, Father?
What do you mean?
That Mr. Ushikubo died?!
What?!
It's Mr. Ushikubo, of course it's him.
All right, Mr. Ushikubo...
(Kogoro) He's been beaten to death.
She's been hit many times in the back of the head.
(Kogoro)
You wouldn't happen to be...?
My name is Kogoro Mouri, I'm a private detective.
Mr. Ushikubo
Mr. Ushikubo tried to protect his head
with his left hand when he was attacked.
That's how his watch broke.
Five past ten.
I'm sure that's the time the crime took place.
Yes.
And as for the victim's right hand...
His index finger's outstretched as if he's pointing at something.
Hm...
The bamboo.
Must be a message of his death.
Surely.
"He's got blood on the tip of his finger. And it looks like he touched something."
"There's no blood here?"
"One of the pages has been torn off."
"Zenit of autumn, I live in fullness, nothing worries me."
(Kogoro) Quieeeet!
Ahhhhh!
Don't touch the proofs!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm in Yasugi, Shimane Prefectural Police.
And that's my assistant, Inspector Tsubaki.
Ran, where is he, that little boy? I don't know.
He was asking people questions and then suddenly left.
Oh, well...
Hey, the reason I asked you all to come here...
is that I need to know where you were when Mr. Ushikubo was murdered,
at approximately 10:05.
What are you insinuating?!
From what Mr. Mouri told me,
you all had motives to murder Mr. Ushikubo.
It will all come out sooner or later.
It's better if everyone tells the truth.
Very well, then.
All right, I was at the Ushikubo Art Museum.
I was at the Tiffany Park Art Museum.
I went there to write the headline.
"They have a painting there called "The Deer Window"...
and I wrote a poem while I was looking at it:
"Also the gods gather to see the deer window."
Ah, well, yes, I do remember.
I'm sure I was crouching among the bushes
by the fountain in the English garden;
it looked like he was picking up some coins that had fallen out.
Do you remember what time this was?
Yes, it was a little after 11:00.
"Hm? What are they, these signs?"
At that hour I was at the Gessho temple.

Ten know that there is a huge statue of a turtle there, right?
That's right.
"I saw a mantis next to that statue."
"Rogada devotee, raise your legs towards the tortoise."
"That's what I wrote when it was five past ten."
Yes, I remember.
You've been standing in front of that statue for quite a while.
Do you remember what time it was? I'm sure it was 11 o'clock.
One o'clock...
I was at the samurai residence at Shiominawate.
I was there from 10 to 11.
"I don't have any witnesses.
"But I've been sitting in the rest area thinking a poem."
- (Hirose) Have you thought of anything? - (Mizuki) Yes.
"Soft and sweet, where the sun shines the maple leaves dance."
"Talk about this maple tree."
Eh?
"From the place where it says,
"This bush must forcibly cover the maple leaves."
I've been strolling along the lakefront
and then I went to the Prefectural Art Museum.
-But I didn't write a poem. Why not?
"This time I had everyone 4 write a heading.
"And then I had to take it upon myself to choose
"Which of them would start the chain poem."
"No one remembers seeing Mrs. Ando."
Eh?
"Sure, that notepad..."
"There were things written on it that were related to some actions."
"And the page that was torn out is where the notes were that I had made
while I was talking to that person."
(Male) "Yes, Mr. Ushikubo seemed quite happy."
He was taking notes on his blog and tot.
Ja I understand.
Thank you very much.
"Yes, now I have all the information."
Can't say either of you have a very solid alibi.
-Have you found the murder weapon yet? -We're still combing the area.
And we'll be combing the areas where you've all been as well.
Don't leave until you have our authorization.
Understood.
I'd like to continue this session of chained poetry
as a tribute for the late Ushikubo.
It is a good idea, I propose that we do so.
"The chain poetry session, eh?"
What do you say?
You want to add me to your group?
Yes, you are very smart,
and you'll be able to figure out which one of them is the killer.
-Yes, I'm sure, but... -That's a great idea.
Do it, please.
Yes, all right.
"I'm absolutely certain that she's been murdered by one of the four of them."
"And we'll find out in this poetry session."
That's it.
"There will be panic, when the great detective finds the murderer."
(Pita)
(Pita) Okay.
Now it's my turn.
"However, God is the only one who knows our future."
-Oh...-Hey, Yagisawa, he's got that.
I just found it at the front desk.
And the next Conan: "The Chained Poem of Matsue (Part 2)."
