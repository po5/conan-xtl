Victory, sincerity, tests for truth.
An inexhaustible drive to aspire to be the best!
A girl from a higher grade in our class disappears.
As we follow in her footsteps a black shadow appears.
It looks like a child, but it has the brain of an adult and it's Detective Conan!

"We've gotten over the episode of that fight against the Black Organization."
"We all went back to leading a trouble-free school life.
"When we heard the news that the Shoko Amemiya,
"a girl from our school, has disappeared."
"Moreover, she reportedly looks like the Haibara."
"It can't be,
"The hands of the Organization have reached an elementary school?"
The Shoko Amemiya, an elementary school student?
And then?
What does she remember buying when she's been here?
Mmmm... I think it was...
Hey, we'll have to be careful with that teacher, I don't like him.
"He makes it look like he's a good person to us,
"But then we walked away from him.
"He gave us an aggressive look."
Come to think of it,
that girl went outside and drank the fruit juice.
She drank it all in one gulp.
"She bought a fruit juice that was in a plastic bottle,
"a carton of milk and a razor."
"Then she stops in the kitchen utensils section..."
"And she has a similar character to Haibara..."
"Maybe that's it!"
THE SUPER SECRET WAY TO SCHOOL, (PART TWO)
(At the same time) Conan!
Stop, Conan!
What are you doing?
You'll break everything!
-Oh! -Oooh!
Eh...?
But what the hell are you going to do now?
Conan!
(Thinking) "I thought so."
"It's just as I thought! There's no doubt about it!"
What are you doing, Conan?
If you wanted a plastic bottle, I could have... given you my one.
Anyway, I'll call headquarters and ask them to look for the girl.
Wait!
Before that, could we go to a place I thought of?
Eh?
A place you've thought of?
Does this mean you already know?
You know where that girl is?
Yes.
I'm still not 100% sure it's there, but we'll check it out.
After we pass the pharmacy.
The, uh... The drugstore?
Ah, one thing, Mr. Tanihata.
Yes, say.
Will you give me some of that water... that you have in the store?
(Genta) What a rage!
Thanks to Conan,
this is the second time I've had to clean up today.
Au, Genta!
Stop playing and help us to finish cleaning up quickly!
(Thinking) "That's the second time he's said that to me."
Ayumi, you got what I asked for?
Yes!
Look at it.
Thank you.
Let's go now!
It's 470 yen.
Shall I put it in a bag?
No, it's not necessary.
It's fine now.
You have it.
Thank you very much.
What did you buy? Powdered baby milk.
(At the same time) Milk... milk powder?
(Mitsuhiko) And what do you plan to do with this?
Ayumi, pretty girl,
do you have the plastic bottle of the juice you drank at Genta?
Yes!
The water that the supermarket manager has given us
is still hot.
Thank you.
Now I will put the powdered milk in this bottle with hot water.
Stir it well.
But, Conan, what do you plan to do with this?
All right, then.
Don't tell me you're going to take care of some babies now.
Well, yeah, just the wood.
(All) Huh?
Not just any babies, though.
Wait a minute, Conan!
We were looking for Shoko Amemiya,
the fourth grader who disappeared on her way to school!
I don't understand what you're doing!
Let the babies be, now, Conan!
I'm convinced that the Shoko couldn't leave them alone either.
Well, Agent Yumi, can you take us there?

To the old warehouse where I had planned to go to write some tickets...
some cars for being parked incorrectly!
Eh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No problem.
Hey, is that girl really here?
That's nothing, this warehouse!
It's very dirty.
It's full of dust.
Yes, and so much and so much... That's why... A-atxim!
A... atxim!
Atxum!
Your nasal membranes are very delicate.
Mmm!
But it didn't happen before, did it?
Agent Yumi, do you have any pets at home?
Yes, I do.
Two dogs!
The Sta and the Hachi!
And your acquaintances, do they also have dogs?
Yes.
Come to think of it, yes.
So, you didn't realize you had allergies?
Allergy to animals.
Yes... Allergic?
Yes.
Well, surely, the reason for your sneezing is not the dust.
Conan!
Where are you going?
Come on, let's go!
We'll come too!
Eh?
Wait, wait!
I'll come too!
-Children, what are you doing? - (Ayumi: call)
-I'll come too! -But, Miyamoto....
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ne... kids, are you okay?
Agent Yumi!
Come on, come on, she's here!
Wait, wait!
I can't get through.
This ass...
- (Mitsuhiko) They're so cute! (Mitsuhiko) - Huh?
Cute?
I guess I couldn't stop sneezing because of these kittens, for sure.
The cause of my sneezing was... the cats?
That's right.
It wasn't the dust, it was some kind of germs...
that the little ones give off.
Are you saying I'm allergic to cats?
Yes, I'm sure you are!
But this place is very spacious
and, besides, I don't see any germs around here!
These germs are tiny and very light!
That's why, even if it's in the air for a long time,
it is something that goes unnoticed!
Yes.
Of course it does!
What I meant in Mitsuhiko;
the last thing that the Ai and that girl had in common
surely was that they both like animals?
Yes!
That's right!
That's right!
Now I get it!
This means that that little girl wanted us to go home together
because she wanted to show us these kittens
in the hope that someone would want to take one home.
And then they would have to be taken care of.
Of course they would.
Surely her parents don't like animals or cats,
so she couldn't tell the parents that she was babysitting on the sly.
See?
She cut the butt off the bottle to make them a milk dish.
Now I understand.
That supermarket was out of paper cups and plates.
That's why he cut off the bottom of the plastic bottle,
to use it as a plate.
That's right.
This means that she didn't go to Kyushu
and stayed in Tokyo... to feed the milk to these kittens.
Now I can understand why Shoko couldn't sleep well.
Poor thing.
Yes, she must have been worried about these kittens..,
and she couldn't sleep all night.
Well, it looks like this wasn't the only reason she couldn't sleep.
Check this out.
What? (At the same time) Ah!
(At the same time) Ah!
Conan!
Why did you throw it away, man?
The Shoko had put this milk for the kittens!
This milk has a problem!
Cats don't have the enzyme...
"Necessary to break down the lactose in milk...
"And, besides, cows, which are herbivores,
"and cats, which are carnivores,
"have different nutrients than their mother's milk."
"If cats are given this type of milk
"without having previously treated it,
"It will only give them bellyaches and they will stop drinking it."
Therefore, if you take baby milk like that taken by people,
"heated to 38 degrees,
"Dissolve it with 2 parts of water and en das..."
Oh!
Look, now they drink it!
One of the things that had her worried
was that the cats wouldn't drink the milk.
And she must have thought they would drink it
if she changed their dirty dishes for clean ones.
This is an emergency measure
if you don't have pet stores nearby where you can find cat milk.
Well? Eh?
Yes, but where is that girl, the... Shoko Amemiya?
Yes, that's right.
It's strange, I thought she'd still be here...
because she'd be worried about the kittens.
(Cat, from afar: meows) Mm?
(Genta) What's wrong?
(Genta) Conan?
-I don't know what he wants to look at, but come on-hi. -Come on!
(Genta) Come on!
(Genta) Again?
(Genta) Ah!

Now I can't get through either!
-Hey, where are you going? -Now we're going this way?
What a pain in the ass...
What's the matter?
So there was another one.
Caram.
In the end there were 3 in total.
(Ai) But why should this one have gone outside?
And now, what's wrong?
(Ai) Where is it?
"What is this?"
What is this, Conan?
It's a fragment of a vehicle's headlights.
They probably broke off
and were left here just after they hit this telephone pole.
It's a recent fragment,
evidently the accident occurred recently.
But I could have sworn that we haven't received any reports lately of any traffic accidents in this area.
of any traffic accidents in this area lately.
(Ai) Look.
This... is human blood.
It runs from the telephone pole to the front of the warehouse.
(Female police officer) And look here!
Brake marks.
Don't tell me a car... ran over the Shoko?
Well..., we can't be sure, but it's a possibility!
(At the same time) What?
Exactly, there are many possibilities...
that a vehicle is involved in the case.
Surely, when Shoko was carrying the cat in her arms, it could be...
"That the animal jumped away from her,
"She must have run after the cat,
"She went out into the street, and the car ran over her..."
"(Car: brake)"
This means.
He has been hit and run away?
No.
If this were the case, the driver would have abandoned the child and fled.
And the fact that the police have not yet been informed,
obviously means that there have been no witnesses.
So where has he gone?
Where is the Shoko?
"Where do these bloodstains get to?"
"Huh? They go back?"
"They go back to the point of origin?"
"Maybe they're the driver's bloodstains?"
If so, it's most likely...!
Officer Yumi, can we ask the hospitals in this neighborhood?
Eh?
Yes, okay.
Thank you very much!
Good bye!
Come to think of it, wasn't Dr. Araide's clinic nearby?
(Araide) Eh?
Is that you, Conan?
- (children) Hello! - How come you've all come?
What's wrong?
Excuse me, doctor,
the owner of the vehicle that is parked in front of the clinic...
is it here?
Ah, if you're asking about that man,
he had a head wound that required 3 stitches
and a slight head injury;
so now he's on bed rest.
Hey doctor, did he talk to you about a girl, by any chance?
It's not that he spoke to me, it's that he was carrying her.
"She said she had run over the girl and to please help her."
"She wouldn't stop bleeding."
What do you mean?
That she was bleeding?
No, she wasn't!
It was... it was the man, who was bleeding.
The girl is now sleeping... in a bed at the clinic
and Hikaru is examining her.
Tell me, doctor, what has she taken wrong?
No, she is sleeping now, she was exhausted.
It seems that she didn't sleep at all last night.
That's what she said when she woke up a little while ago.
"She thought she was hit by a car,
"She passed out and fell asleep."
Then why hasn't she said anything at school?
Why hasn't she called?
I asked for her home phone number and called,
but no one answered.
And then she went back to sleep before I could ask her name.
It seems that his wallet was inside that man's vehicle.
I thought I would ask him more questions when he woke up.
He sleeps so well that I couldn't do more.
(Professor) How happy I am!
I am glad to see that Amemiya is well.
Really!
(Cries)
What's wrong with him?
It's just that I had a terrible day today.
I don't know what I would have done if something had happened to him!
Oh, don't cry, Professor Hirayama...
(Continues crying)
Hey, excuse me, instead of crying,
maybe you should call the school to inform them, don't you think?
Yes!
You are right!
My cell phone.
My cell phone...
Come on, man, don't be so soft!
It seems that, finally, this professor wasn't one of them.
No, I guess not.
Ah, I found it!
Hello, it's me at Hirayama!
But why was he looking at us with those hateful eyes?
I don't understand.
Well, since it doesn't look good,

I guess he had those eyes when he looked up from staring.
Eh?
This means that the glasses he wears are not properly adjusted.
Yes.
That's right.
He said that before, remember?
He fell down the stairs today.
He's got a gash above his eyebrow,
and he probably dropped
or damaged contact lenses at the time.
"So he must have decided to wear the glasses
"That he was wearing before he put in the lenses,
"which have a lower prescription than he needs now!"
Remember when he tried to touch his wound?
"He ran into his glasses in the middle and knocked them off!"
This proves that he habitually wears contact lenses!
And now you're going to tell me that this justifies his stupid behavior.
If I were one of them,
there's a chance that he would do everything deliberately
to catch us off guard.
Yes, yes, I thought this for a moment too,
but... I've convinced myself that it had nothing to do with them
by the comments he made afterwards.
By the way, children.
Who are you?
That you live in this neighborhood?
You've convinced me!
What do you find so convincing?
In a circumstance like that,
a school teacher would normally ask
"Which school do you go to?"
"Because we all went with our wallets!"
If it was one of them disguised as a teacher,
he would have even more reason to ask.
That's why I imagined that I had lost my contact lenses
and that he was wearing those glasses to get out of the way
and that he didn't look very good.
What if he was someone who was playing
the role of a clueless substitute teacher?
I wouldn't have any need
to play such a complicated persona.
Besides, if it occurred to him to say something like that because of an oversight,
he wouldn't be the enemy for us.
The ones who really scare me are people like Vermott,
who sneak up on us with impeccable precision!
Gee, all this happened today?
How nice, that you found that little girl, the Shoko!
Yes... Oh, I'm falling asleep...
(Yawns)
Well?
What happened to those cats?
The new professor has kept one and Dr. Araide has kept the other two.
It seems that he will try his luck among his patients,
in case someone wants to stay.
And so obviously they won't be left helpless.
Oh, Father.
Why don't we keep one of the cats?
They keep a lot of company.
No way!
It will scratch all over the house and damage the rooms!
Besides, if we keep a cat,
she might become an arrogant woman as a default.
Is this because of the mother?
To know.
The point is, we don't need any more new tenants to share a house with!
Father!
Ah, wait!
Speaking of new things, in our school, today too...
Look, Conan... Conan, you listen to me too...
Have you fallen asleep?
You've had such a busy day today that you're exhausted.
Daughter, do you also have a new teacher at your school?
No, a new pupil has come.
It's a boy.
Ah...
He has a face like that hostess, Queen Mizunashi!
He says he'd like to come home one day,
so... I'll introduce him to you when he comes to visit!
A boy?
Wait a minute.
Wasn't she a high school student
who looked a lot like the hostess Reina Mizunashi?
Mr. Kogoro, don't receive him! (Door: call out)
This is a carbon dioxide poisoning
produced due to the combustion of solid fuel
inside a hermetically sealed car.
No...
This is a murder
planned very carefully to make it look like a suicide.
