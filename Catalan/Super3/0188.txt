The water that flows has no form.
The wind that blows cannot be seen.
The cases admit all kinds of deductions.
Today's episode is the first in a series of puzzles.
The truth always comes out in the end.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

I feel so all in Secret Life!

Who are you, gentleman, who rescued me not once, but twice?
Oh!
Nameless gentleman who wears black...
If you want to please me truly...
stop hiding with this mask
and show me your face!
(Kogoro) If you wish...
I will unveil my unworthy face... in the light of the llunaaaaa!
(laughs)
Oh father!
Seriousness!
That the play is here 4 days!
And what do you want?
You'll tell me who the fuck reads this without cracking up laughing.
I don't know who has written it, this little pink novel...
La Sonoko, she did it!
And she wrote the role of the knight inspired by Shinichi!
(Thinking) "Yeah, right..."
Hey, wait a minute!
"The knight and the princess kiss passionately."
Have you read it, this?
Yes.
We'll make it look, don't suffer!
Hey, Ran, who's going to do it?
Of knight, I mean...
What interests you, Conan?
A little bit...
Well, surely they'll take a fool to do it.
Well, you two know him.
You met him in a class, he's Professor Araide, from the school.
The kids were embarrassed by him
and, when he came to give the notes, we asked him.
What? What's that?
He says that when he was young he had done many plays,
that's why he can memorize the script and can interpret quite well.
Ah, no way!
No way!
No! No way!
Ran, don't do it!
Just kidding!
The teacher will only supervise the high school rehearsals!
The mysterious gentleman will be Sonoko dressed as a man!
If so...
(Think) "casum decena..."
Oh.
Gee, no!
It's so late!
In the morning I have practice, I have to take a bath.
The bathtub is broken.
Wow!
I wanted to take a bath too!
Then go to the public baths and problem solved.
But they are closed today, Father.
And if we ask Dr. Agasa to let us bathe?
I wanted to go there to talk about the weekend camping trip.
Is that so?
Come on, let's go!
I'm going to change!
I'm going to change too.
You could already adapt to bathe together, so as not to annoy the good man.
And right away home, you feel me?! Oooh!
(Call) You're kidding or what?!
How do you want me to bathe with Conan?!?
You look crazy!
Eh... Eh... Vu... I mean...
they're not good for him, these things...
Aren't they, Conan?
No...
A DANGEROUS RETURN!
JUNIOR DETECTIVE LEAGUE IN THE CAVE!
(croons)
(Shinishi voice) She's been very strange, lately.
La Ran, I mean...
What do you mean?
That sometimes she doesn't look at me or treat me like a 7 year old.
It's as if... she knows something.
I don't know. I don't know.
Your imagination.
Maybe yes, it's my imagination...
What if he knows everything?
Now he's found out...
What do you say, Ay...?
I've got work to do, I'll be here all night.
Don't get in my way, eh?
Caram, boy.
What if Ai is right?
Maybe he knows.
He can't be.
If she suspected anything, she'd come and ask me.
She's like that... straightforward.
Nois!
How do you say I am?
W-well...
Where's Ay, by the way?
Well, look.
It's the basement... I'm going to say hello.
(Conan voice) Hey, Ran, listen...
(Conan voice) Wait!
Hello, Ay!
(Keys: tac, tac, tac, tac) What are you doing?
Hey, Ran's talking to you!
Don't suffer, doctor.
I don't want to disturb you...
See you later, Ay.
I'll see you later.
(Thinking) "Maybe so..."
"I'm running away..."

"Don't make me laugh."
(Children: laughter)
We enter the new century!
Tralarà will install!
Doctor.
Regarding Ran's conversation the other day....
Couldn't you make a robot in case there was an emergency?
What kind of robot are you thinking of?
One that moves and talks like me, a double.
If I knew how to make something like that, I'd have money coming out of my ears!
Yeah, I guess so.
Oh.
...we're entering the new century!
-Guys, we've got a store! - (Genta) We haven't forgotten today!
(Rio) The Ai and I will make a good fire for cooking.
You guys are going to look for firewood in the forest, ok?
(At the same time) Yessssss!
(Genta) Today we have a barbecue-tail-tail,
come with me to the barbecue...
Listen, guys!
We've had enough, we're going back to camp!
-Yeeeeeeeeeee! -(Mitsuhiko) Yeah yeah yeah!
(Mitsuhiko) Come check this out.
(Mitsuhiko) Hurry up!
It's worth it!
If it's just a cave...
The sign says "Danger: do not enter".
What caught my attention is what it says here, fixeu's on it.
"Follow the path of the dragon."
"And upon you shall shine the light of happiness."
-The light of happiness? -A light that makes people happy... -A light that makes people happy?
You mean it's not...?
(At the same time) A tresooor!?
(Thinking) "Here we are..."
"The key is in the character 'to' engraved in the stone."
- "Truffle!"
- (Ayumi) "Tomato."
(Ayumi) "Tonada." (Ayumi) "All" the treasure for us.
Can you imagine it?
Hey, guys, what are you doing?
Don't suffer, we just want to take a look.
Heavy.
- (Genta) The cave is really big.
- (Mitsuhiko) It's got stalactites and everything!
(Ayumi) What a cane!
(Thinking) "Mm? A cigarette...?"
"And the filter is still wet..."
(Ayumi) "Is there anyone else in here?"
They're late.
I don't know where they've gone.
They must be exploring the forest.
Remember they're being led by a very intrepid detective.
But now I need help.
Of course you do!
What is it, that?
Look, there's light.
There is someone!
"Maybe it's the one with the cigarette?"
Maybe these people have found the treasure before us.
Yes, man!
Genta, no!
If we had come earlier, the treasure would have been all ours!
What's the matter?
Genta?
(Cries) A... corpse.
What the fuck...? Who's there?!
Get down! (Gunshot)
-Hey, what happened? -They are children, and they have seen us!
Casum Dena, and are the parents here too?
-No, there are only 4 kids! -Shit!
Shit!
We're on duty.
First we rob the bank and they see the face of one of them...
We peeled him and hid the body here so they can't identify us,
and now these guys...
-Come on, we have to hit! -Where have they gone, eh?
Hey, what the hell will we do, when we find them, huh?
-Eliminate them... -(loads gun)
We'll put them to sleep eternally in the darkness of this tomb.
And this is done by opening a hole in their little heads.
You, towards the entrance to lie in wait!
-He and I will search through there. Done!
Haibara!
Can you feel me?
Haibara!
(Transmitter) "Haibara, answer me!"
"Haibara, if you feel me, answer me! Haibara! Haibara!"
-She says she made food every day? -You keep quiet.
Why don't they answer?
(Ayumi) Maybe they have it disconnected?
I'll go out and tell them we haven't seen anything and let us go.
It won't do any good!
Don't worry.
I'm sure Conan will come up with something.
Oi, Conan?
-Hey, Co... Conan... - (flow) Conan...
(groans in pain)
Co... Conan!
What... what's wrong with you?
You're bleeding!
Did the bullet that man shot hit you?
Conan, we have to get out of here, before the bad men come back!
W-Wait... The doctor and Ay are waiting for us.
Sooner or later, they'll come looking for us...
If they enter without knowing what's going on, those men will kill them.
E... We have to warn them that the cave is... dangerous...
But... how do we do it?
If we write them a message and they find it, they'll tear us apart!
(Mitsuhiko) The only thing we can do is to go to the bottom of the cave
and try to talk to them with the transmitter.
Don't be a donkey!
The further in, the less coverage there will be...

(Ayumi) So what do we do?
We'll do... use the transmitters to locate the criminals...
They have a magnet on the back, we can take out 10 and...
(Ayumi) But... But... (Ayumi) Why do you want them? There's no time for explanations.
Do as I say.
Hurry..., guys...
Caram.
Where have they got to, the brats?
(Footsteps: approaching)
Hey, hey, hey!
Have you found them?
No, it doesn't look like they got out of the cave.
I don't understand anything.
They're not in there either.
The only place we haven't looked is the bottom...
-So we'll save searching! -Huh?
I mean they're dead.
The bottom of this cave is a giant maze.
-A lot of people have died here. N-No, we have to find them!
We can't take any chances.
Look at this, it looks like the kids have gone into the cave.
Glasses?
Maybe they belong to someone who's been lost here before.
You idiot.
Look at this!
It's blood!
Of course it is!
And fresh, still!
I get it, you mean they haven't gone far yet they're still alive!
Yes.
That's right!
Hey.
Don't you think they take too long, doctor?
Maybe so...
I'll be right back.
I'm going to take a look in the woods.
No, wait!
Wait for me, Ay!
Ouch!
Are you all right, Conan?
Say!
Better..., now that I'm bandaged, yes...
But... listen, Genta, couldn't you walk a little faster?
At this rate they'll catch us...
I... no... I didn't run for fear of hurting you.
-Eeeeh? -Eeeeh?
It was all my fault.
If I hadn't insisted on going in... Conan wouldn't have been shot.
He wouldn't have been shot.
It's not your fault!
In any case my, I found the cave and decided to go in.
(Genta) I am the only responsible,
to get excited and see those guys and the corpse...
(Genta) No way. (All) eeeeh?
If I had not entered the cave all together,
this murder would never have been solved.
Now we know who the culprits are.
And... the sooner we get rid of them, the sooner we can start the barbecue!
We must be optimistic!
We've got it all under control!
(At the same time) Yes!
Hell, no!
Come here, hurry!
-The road forks!
- (Ayumi) You're right...
Y... What do we do now?
I know, we'll draw lots.
Ge... Genta..., hand me the flashlight clock in the backpack.
(Genta) What?
Come on, hurry up! (Genta) Got it!
(Agasa) Children, where have you got to!?
Where have you been?
Answer me!
Look at this firewood!
It looks like it was harvested to make fire.
There are 4 piles at the entrance of the cave.
Are you sure about that?
It can't be... They've gone... in here!
Don't fuckin' fork in the road!
Shit!
And now how do we know which one it is!?
-Look, what's here?
-It seems to be glowing...
It's a watch that makes light!
Wow, what a modern people.
That's it, we're doing well, they've pulled this way...
-Wait! -Huh?
This is a trap!
Think a little!
Maybe they are children,
but do you think they won't notice, if a flashlight falls on them?
Besides, they had to unbuckle their watch strap.
They wanted us to think they'd gone that way,
but they went the other way!
Damn!
What did they think?
I can't wait to meet them to see the look on their faces.
They must be scared to death.
Yes.
The scared face they'll make when they beg us to let them live!
(groans of pain)
You mean they'll bite?
This leaving the watch in the direction we've taken, I don't know...
Yes... They'll go the other way.
These men have robbed a bank.
There must be at least one smart one...
But what if they split up and come this way, too?
What will we do?
It won't happen...
In here the walkie-talkie doesn't work,
they know that if they split up, it will cost them their lives...
Ooooh!
Did you see?
It's a fish!
What do you say?
Eh... It has eyes, this fish?
Yes, it has!
It's an omelet.
So what?
What's the matter?
You think you're going to eat it?
No, beast!
But we won't get out of here if we don't come up with a good plan.
Fish that live in caves don't have eyes.
If this one does, it means it came from a river.
If we follow the course of the river, we might find our way out!
We might find our way out, guys!

(At the same time) We could find the exit!
Hm.
That's right.
Look at this.
It's Kudo's glasses, isn't it?
Yes!
Then... then you were right, they're in here!
(thinks) "What are they doing here?"
It's terrible, we have to find them right away!
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
There's something here.
In fact, there are a lot of them.
Yes, look, Oh, they are transmitters!
Don't touch them!
They want to tell us something.
What's that?
"I'll reduce the transmission area."
"It's the number...
"Emergency!"
Shit, what does this mean?
There's no way out!
You fucking assholes!
We've been taken for a ride, these bastards!
He-he-he-he!
Come on, hurry up, we're backing up!
I swear I'll kill them!
-Oh, no... -I don't believe it...
(Mitsuhiko) Getting out of this hole is impossible.
It's too high.
But they'll come in through here, that's for sure...
Gee, you mean we won't get out of this alive?
(Genta) Oh, no!
We can't give up, even though...
You see, there are tree roots growing on the roof...
It means that we are next to the surface.
There must be a way out.
Well, I don't see it...
An egg!
It's a giant egg, that's what it is!
Look at it!
It's just an egg-shaped stone on top of another stone.
-Don't you see it? -Wow.
Well, that's funny...
(Ayumi) We've ended up in a very strange place...
(Genta) And now we have 5 paths to choose from.
(Mitsuhiko) I wish we knew which one is the way out...
(Thinking) "I don't understand..."
"A stone doesn't usually sit on top of another stone."
"Someone put it on..."
"But..., for what reason?"
Look at this!
It has an inscription on it!
You can read it though!
"Those who get lost in the twilight,
"Follow the path of the dragon."
"And upon you will shine the light of happiness."
(Think) "Those who are lost in the gloom?"
These are almost the exact same words we encountered at the entrance.
Oooooh.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Bats!
(Stirring: shouting and flapping)
Eh ?!
-Did you... Did you hear it? -I'm sure it's the boys!
-They're not far away!
Come on, let's go!
-Come on! -Come on!
(Shouting and flapping) Don't move!
Stay still!
Bats that live in caves eat insects.
That's why they respond to sound and movement.
Coi, Ayumi, don't find any more beasts, eh beautiful?
I don't...
In fact, it's a great discovery.
The bats always roost
less than 300 meters from the outside of the caves where they live.
That means that the exit must be close...
Much closer than we think.
(At the same time) Really?
(Thinking) "But...
"Now the problem is that we don't know which way leads out."
"If I'm not mistaken, the dragon's path could lead us, but..."
"Shit, my eyes are glazing over..."
"The keys to this puzzle are 3."
"The huge 'to' I had engraved at the entrance,
"The words 'dragon's path'...
"And the egg-shaped stone."
" 'To', 'dragon's path' and 'egg'."
(Mitsuhiko) Come on guys.
Let's try all the paths.
N-no... We can only try one...
"Those who get lost in the gloom" are us:
those lost in the cave...
"The light of happiness" is the light of the way out....
Vo... It means that the message engraved at the entrance and this message...
are clues that must help us to get out...
The path of the dragon that will lead us out is... is... is... is...
(At the same time) Oh, no!
Conan!
Co-Conan!
My... Look, he's bleeding!
(Running)
-I feel footsteps! -Oh, no.
It's them, they're coming!
(And... What now?
Oh, no... They're coming!
(Shinishi voice) Very well.
I know what you're up to, you bunch of pickups.
What?
Well... it's, I'm the same blood type!
Ran..., so it's true... you...
