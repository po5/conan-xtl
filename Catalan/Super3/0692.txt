(Radio: Chiba) "I have M on the screen."
- "His cell phone is ringing."
- (cell phone)
Hello, this is Mouri, please say?
Understood.
Nihonbashi's office.
All right, then.
(Kogoro) The one who called me has told me
to pick up the briefcase at the post office,
and he says I have to be here for 5 minutes.
(Kogoro) -What are you doing?
(Kogoro) -Attention.
(Man) The M is going down Chuo Boulevard in a southerly direction.
I'm here to pick up a briefcase.
I'm here to pick up a briefcase.
Can I see your ID card, please?
"This case started 5 days ago."
"Of love and crimes there are always: they are repeated every day."
"The culprit of choice Kogoro
and the cherry blossoms become a surprising case."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The night walk through the cherry blossoms of the Sumida River, (Part 1)"
(Rumor of conversations)
"The employees of a company called New Image,
"which deals exclusively
"To the importation of American cars,
"have been constantly assaulted for some time now,
and some have caused them very serious injuries."
"And not long ago, the director of the company...
also received a threatening phone call."
What?
24 million yen?
What's the sound!?
"24 million yen is just the right amount to fit into a briefcase."
(Sato) Conan!
What are you doing in a place like this?
It's just that... I went to the Ran at the mall,
but I saw that Mr. Mouri was coming in here...
and I followed him to see what he was doing.
Mr. Mouri is on duty.
You'd better not bother him.
I'd better not bother him.
Ah, Miwako!
I kept you waiting?
Sorry, huh?
Actually, yes.
That's the only reason you're paying for lunch today.
I won't get anything again.
I always pay for it.
-Woman, it's the truth. -What do you think, I didn't hear you?
-What do you think, that I didn't hear you?
That's it.
What do you think, then?
Shall we go on?
Yes, let's go.
"Put the money in this briefcase.
Throw away the cell phone.
I'll contact you on this walkie-talkie.
Get on the Nihonbashi Cherry Blossom Tourist Boat
which leaves at 5:45 p.m.
Get rid of the microphone with which you are in contact with the police."
(Radio: male) "The M goes up Chuo Boulevard in a northerly direction."
Understood.
What do you want now?
Mr. Mouri has thrown this paper.
I think it has to do with what he's doing.
Thank you.
And now go home, go.
It's the kidnapper's instructions.
(Sato) "Inspector Megure, we have the blackmailer's instructions."
"From now on you will communicate via walkie-talkie."
"And tell him to go to Nihonbashi to catch a boat."
Hey!
Thank you for waiting for me.
(Man) Is that Mr. Ishida?
We thought you weren't coming.
-(Man) Yes, yes.
I'm really sorry.
He-he-he...
Sorry to keep you waiting.
We're all here.
We can go now.
The M boat has just left.
Excuse me, this boat...
it's the kind that takes you to see the cherry blossoms, isn't it?
Do you know which way it goes?
Yes, this one goes up the Sumida River and then on to the Oyoko Canal.
Yes, thank you.
Do you have, do you want one of these brochures?
(Kogoro) "I still don't understand..."
why the blackmailer has chosen me to carry the money for him.
No.
We don't know either.
I thought maybe you could enlighten us.
I have no idea.

He also asked that the police stay out of everything.
And he says that if they don't meet his demands,
they will put the lives of many employees at risk.
I have already done my part: I have taken the 24 million yen.
Now I leave it in your hands.
I don't want to put the lives of my employees at risk.
(Kogoro) That's understandable.
You can trust the great Kogoro Mouri!
(People: exclamations of admiration)
In 10 minutes we start to enter the Sumida River,
there the waves are stronger
and will have to go with a little more than the account.
(People: admiring exclamations) Look.
Look over there.
Wow!
It looks like something out of a movie.
The city of Tokyo, seen from the river,
also has its charm, doesn't it?
...and further on we will find Sendai Bori,
which is so called because it was founded by the Sendai clan many years ago.
Wow, how interesting.
(Radio: man) "The boat where the M
has just passed under the Minato Bridge."
The blackmailer will collect the money along the way.
"Okay."
Be attentive.
"The walkie-talkie only has a range of 100 meters at most."
"The blackmailer, at most, should be within this distance."
Sato, from your location, exactly?
Right now we are very close to the Eita channel.
"All right, the tour boat company...
"They have confirmed to us that they will first do a section of the Sumida River
and then enter the Oyoko Canal."
Okay.
"Go and wait there."
How beautiful it is!
-Oh, it's beautiful.
(Man) "It's about time you started working for me."
"The boat is heading for the Ojima Gate
to enter the Oyoko Channel."
"There, place the briefcase on the roof."
"See that it stays in the center so it doesn't fall."
"Then go back to your seat
and wait for me to get back in touch with you."
(Woman) How nice!
Now it doesn't move so much, fortunately.
(Woman 2) No, because now we have entered the Oyoko, which is a canal.
It was built during the time of the Edo shogunate.
(People: exclamations of admiration)
Oh.
Coi as a child.
Watching with the head.
-Don't you ever do anything that....
(People: exclamations of admiration) Ah!
Uh!
That just went!
During high tide the water level rises a lot.
Even with these boats
it is complicated to pass under the bridges.
Ah, I didn't know that.
(Driver) And if you don't want to know what the bridges are made of, don't come so close to the next one,
don't get so close on the next one.
The briefcase is already the ceiling.
"It is impossible to take it from a bridge
with all these people there."
"Besides....,
all these surveillance cameras make it even more complicated."
Hello!
What's up, this one?!
(Takagi) The M has just entered the Heikyu channel.
(Takagi) Attention.
The briefcase is the roof of the boat.
Understood.
(Takagi) "What? Don't let it out of your sight."
(Sato) I'm going to look for the car.
(Sato) Oh!
The briefcase is gone.
The briefcase is gone.
What are you doing here?
What are you saying?
The briefcase is gone.
We must tell Inspector Megure right away.
Damn it.
Mr. Mouri!
We've got a problem!
Eh?
Will you leave me alone, kiddo?
Someone has taken the briefcase from the ceiling.
What?
Mm?
Ah!
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone!
It's gone!
-It's just that the briefcase is gone! -It's gone!
Watch, please, it may fall.
Aaaaah!
Oh!
-Mr. Mouri!
-Oh!
"How did he do it?"
"How did he do it, the blackmailer,
to take the briefcase from the roof of the boat?"
(Kogoro) A-a-atxum!
So, you say that he asked you by walkie-talkie...
to place the briefcase on the ceiling
when we entered the Oyoko canal?
A-a-a-a-aaatxum...
Yes, Inspector Megure.
And then he gave you no further instructions?
That's right.
A-atxum!
And at no time did you see how he did it to take it away?
No.
He told me to go back to my seat,
that he'd get back in touch with me.
It was a pity.
And you, Conan, when was the last time you saw the briefcase?
Here, on the Totomi Bridge.
The last place we saw it was here, at Shiomi Bridge.

And you, Kogoro, here you noticed that the briefcase was missing,
the bridge of Hamazon.
This means that the blackmailer
must have taken it between Hamazon Bridge and Heikyu Bridge,
which is where the Heikyu canal begins.
Have you noticed anything strange, between these two bridges?
A-a-atxum!
I feel very bad.
I think I've caught a calyp√†ndria.
This is obvious.
You don't have to swear to me.
Ah.
Now I remember I heard a strange noise, a sort of metallic sound.
"A metallic sound?"
It was in this area here.
"I think it was on a small bridge."
"There were a couple of boats tied up under the bridge."
I didn't see anyone.
Was there anyone, the boats?
I felt the noise when we swerved to avoid bumping into the boats
and passed under the bridge.
-What is it?
- (knock)
-Impossible.
-Perhaps we have run into the bridge.
The ship would be capcinejant, if we had touched it.
Yes, of course.
This would be the bridge of Shigure.
When we were watching from the bridge of Shiomi,
"From there we could see the Heikyu Bridge and no boat could be seen."
Also, Ishihama Bridge, which is what comes next,
has a huge gate right behind it.
If you say it looked like a small bridge to you, it couldn't be this one.
That's perfect.
What comes after that is the Hamazon Bridge,
so there's no doubt that the metallic sound that you're saying...
he must have heard it on the Shigure Bridge.
Yes, it seems obvious.
What is not so obvious
is that the metallic sound is related to our case.
Inspector Megure.
This was found near Heikyu Bridge.
Look at it.
Oh!
It's the....
Mr. Mouri, do you know if this is the briefcase you were carrying?
I have no doubt.
It's this one.
Open it and let's see what's in it.
Can I take a look?
Mr. Mouri,
have you noticed that the fabric inside is torn?
What?
According to the coroner's report, as you pointed out in Conan,
they've torn the inside of the lid,
and they have also discovered some marks
that make think that inside there was some device.
A device?
Well, it is possible that the blackmailer has used this device
to retrieve the briefcase.
Of that, although we can't be sure.
Oh!
Aaaah...
What have you got, father?
Mr. Mouri?
Inspector,
I've already figured out how the blackmailer did it to get the briefcase back.
How come he no longer has a cold voice?
Oh, is that so?
(Kogoro voice) I don't know.
My nose is suddenly uncovered.
This is of no importance now.
The blackmailer has used a very strong magnet.
A magnet?
One of the characteristics of the Oyoko canal
is that the water level varies a lot depending on the tide.
and, therefore, the distance...
between the surface of the bridge and the water.
Surely the racketeer had checked the time of day
that would have the highest tide
and had placed a very strong magnet inside the briefcase.
"This meant that when the boat passed under a bridge at a very low tide.
under a bridge at a very short distance....
But, let's see, wait a minute.
There are a lot of bridges.
How could I know where the briefcase would be hooked?
You're right.
But the blackmailer has used an electromagnet
that allowed him to generate a magnetic force when it suited him.
"The electromagnets that are made
"by winding a wire around a magnetic material
"They only generate magnetic force
when an electric current is applied to the wire."
"Surely the blackmailer has hidden a pair of iron bars
with a coiled cable and a battery inside the case.
"And then there is a remote control installed
so that it can be operated from a distance."
"Later, when no one was there,
he turned off the power and retrieved the case."
Very good.
With Kogoro's theory in mind,
we will again investigate the area around the Oyoko and Heikyu canals.
(Sato and Takagi) Right away!
Father, sleeping here is not good for your cold, man.
Why should your father choose the blackmailer to make the delivery?
I have no idea.

The reports of the cases you've handled must be around here, right?
Yes.
I think he has them on file.
Well, maybe by looking through them we'll find something.
Maybe we will...
Maybe the blackmailer had it in for her
for some case he'd brought her.
Yeah, could be.
Mm?
What, Ran?
Something wrong?
No.
It's nothing.
I just thought that if there was Shinichi
would also have proposed solving the case like this.
Don't worry, Ran.
I'll solve this case myself.
Just like with the Junior Detective League.
You want me and you to solve it, instead of telling the father?
You're right.
The key word is "New Image."
Your father must have had something to do
with this company.

I've got it!
Look, I think it's this one here.
This one, look.
Satoshi Nishizawa, 32 years old,
mechanical engineer at New Image, a vehicle import company.
"A Kaori Ida, 37 years old,
requests that you search for a person who has been following her for some time."
"As a result of the investigation,
it becomes clear that the person in question is Satoshi Nishizawa."
"A restraining order is eventually issued against him
and, as a result, he is taken out of New Image."
Did you notice that this is a two-month-old case?
He lives in the Koto district.
Does it say the address?
Yes.
Isn't this near the Oyoko canal?

This way.
Yes.
It's that door, isn't it?
(Door: doorbell)
Good morning, Mr. Nishizawa.
What is it?
Mr. Nishizawa.
Yes.
He's not here.
Maybe he's gone out.
Oh!
It's open.
Mr. Nishizawa.
May we come in?
Mr. Nishizawa.
Conan!
What are you doing?
You can't go in without permission, man!
Wait, Ran.
Don't touch him.
Look at it.
The water's up to the edge of the tub.
So, it was a suicide?
You won't like what I have to tell you.
Do you still want to know?
I know the Nishizawa case gave you a lot of work.
I'm sure we'll eventually get the water out of everything.
But I see there are no yellow flowers out there.
(Kogoro) "Well, I'd say I have a slight idea."
So, he, neither was the blackmailer nor has he committed suicide?
