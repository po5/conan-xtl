"We have paid a visit to Mount Aso and in the Kumamoto area."
"We have been involved in a case involving the theft of confidential information
of the Kumamon Food Company."
"In return, they are asking for 10 million yen."
"The thief has hidden the memory stick with the information.
"Inside a Kumamon, a teddy bear typical of the area,
"But unexpectedly, the bear ended up in the hands of Justin..,
a boy we met while visiting the Aso Volcano Museum."
"Following the lead of a phrase he said in Justin,
we finally managed to find him."
"But just at that moment,
the thief kidnaps the boy and the teddy bear right from under our noses."
"Is there an accomplice of the thief among us?"
"And what's more important: who should it be, the thief?"

"Mysterious adventure in the land of fire and water".
(Kumamoto Episode)"
"After losing track of the thief we have had no more news
and have decided to spend the night in a hotel in Kumamoto City."
How do we do it?
There's always someone who gets us into trouble!
- (knocks)
-What?
-Oh!
-Would you shut up, man!
I'm sorry, man.
No, I didn't mean it, really.
It wasn't your fault, Ayumi.
I can see that.
He thinks it's his fault, though.
Mr. Mouri.
What's that?
-Do you know anything about the thief?
-Can we talk for a moment?
Yes, he called the president of Kumamon Foods
and told him to bring 10 million yen to Kumamoto.
That's why Mr. Kumada and others have come
and they are in the meeting room.
Okay, then.
Ran, take care of the children.
Hm.
Eh?
And Conan?
Yes, please, thank you.
I'll get it.
Yes, I know.
I'm at the police station right now.
I'm so scared...
What if...?
-Thank you.
-Here.
Now it turns out that a child has been kidnapped?
What the hell are you doing, the police?
It's very bad for us.
By the way, the thief, when called, indicated the place of the exchange?
No, he said he would call back later.
How can it be that a simple information theft
ended up becoming a kidnapping case?
-Huh?
-I don't understand.
What are you talking about?
"A simple case of information theft"?
You know perfectly well how important this information is.
Our future is at stake.
Yes, I know, but a child's life is more important, isn't it?
What are you saying?
You dare to contradict me?
Please, gentlemen, let's not get nervous, we won't get anything out of it.
Now all we can do is wait for the thief to call back.
(Thinking) "I have the feeling that something is not right."
"The child's life is more important than the information."
(Ouch) Conan...
"That's true, but..."
Wow, where did you come from?
Don't scare me like that.
I want to talk to you for a moment.
Eh?
3 servings of Kumamoto ramen.
You could at least tell me why you wanted to take my Kumamon.
What?
Why did you want to?
What?
No.
What are you doing?
It's Justin's, let him go!
Let my mother be!
"If anyone hurts my mother, I'll report him to the police."
(Yeah, maybe it was from your husband.
A card?
It had the name Naoto Takamori written on it.
So she made a call to her husband.
But it's a bit strange

that you don't have your number saved in your cell phone, right?
I also think it's not very normal.
But then again, the card was from Higo Foods.
Higo Foods?
Wasn't it that company that...
But if the data of the new product
is going to a competitor company,
like Higo Foods, a giant in the industry, we're already lost!
Justin's father was the president of Higo Foods.
Maybe it's just a coincidence.
Or maybe not.
Eh?
Huh?
Aaah!
Hey.
Xxxxt!
Where are you three going?
We were able to escape without Ran seeing us.
What are you standing here chatting?
Come on, let's go.
And where are we going, exactly?
The Junior Detective League has decided to go look for Justin.
(Inoue) Better not, it might be dangerous.
-(Inoue) I've got the wound on my hand.
(Inoue) -Oh, I think we've been discovered.
Are you going to do it
when the accomplice of the thief hit you with the bag?
Ah!
Ouch!
Well, next time it may not be a simple wound, do you understand?
Excuse me, were you there when all that happened?
-What did you do, what took you so long!?
-Mr. Kumada, I'm here. -Sor Kumada, I'm here.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Excuse me, what are the police doing here?
Because, if I'm not mistaken,
they didn't arrive until the president sent for them.
Mr. Kumada told me
Kumada told me that a girl named Ayumi had taken a wrong drink.
-Yes, it's me.
-It's you, the Ayumi, isn't it?
It was all my fault,
because I got in the way and didn't...
(Sighs)
If you're so eager, I'll go with you.
All this happened because of the information stolen from the company.
How nice!
By the way, when the thief made the second call...
I heard the sound of a streetcar in the background.
"But to Kumamoto there are two streetcar lines,
with a total of 35 stops."
"If we don't have a little more information..."
Eh?
"No way!"
It's this one.
I'm sure, it's his stamp pad.
Justin left it here specifically so we'd know where he was.
Excuse me, did you see if he was with anyone?
Yes, he was with a strange man...
wearing sunglasses and a mask.
I don't know, maybe it was his father.
That means he was still with the thief.
And when they were leaving, did you notice where they went?
I would say that they have gone
through the galleries in the direction of the castle.
(Mobile)
Well, he's spotted us.
Hello, Ran.
How's it going?
"Conan, where are you? And the others, are they with you?"
We do not do anything bad, calm.
(Mouri) "What are you wearing on your head?"
(Mouri) "It gives me."
We are accompanied by Mr. Inoue.
"I don't give a damn, who I'm with."
How cute was that half-foreign boy we saw.
How cute!
What a cutie!
Excuse me!
This half-foreign boy you saw, what did he look like?
What was he like?
Look, it's this one.
-Where did you take this picture? -Where did you take this picture?
-Oh, it's in Justin.
A little bit further.
In front of the karaoke, more or less.
What a pity!
-Oh, you!
-They're gone.
-Hahaha!
-And where could they have gone, now?
Excuse me, haven't you seen a foreign boy of our age...
with blond hair?
Of course we have!
We saw him recently in front of that store over there.
He winked at me and everything.
How cute!
He's a beautiful boy.
Do you think he's a model?
Yes.
You see, don't you?
He does it expressly to let us know where they're going.
He sure does.
He's very clever.
(Girl) Hey, look at that kid!
Oh, yeah.
He's a cutie.
How cute he is!
-Yes, you're right.
-He's like a small adult.
-That's true.
-He's so cute.
-What are you doing?
-Bye, nice guy!
-I can't believe it!
-See you soon, precious!
Oh, my goodness.
We've attracted too much attention.
Stay here and play for a while.
Don't do anything strange, I won't take my eyes off you.
Understood.
Do you have the money ready?
- "Listen to me well."
-Yes, I have it here.
"Put the bag under the big ginkgo tree in Kumamoto Castle."
But if I see a single policeman around,
I can't guarantee they'll ever see the boy alive again;

Did you understand me correctly?
"This man..."
-Aaah!
-Arrgh!
Leave me alone.
May I know what he's doing?
"That boy sure does..."
Hm.
At Kumamoto Castle.
He told me to leave the money under the big ginkgo tree
in Kumamoto Castle.
This is the last chance we have.
This time we have to catch the thief at all costs.
If the thief was at the place of the exchange last time...
watching everything, he might recognize us now.
We can't get too close, it would be dangerous and counterproductive.
It's true.
If she finds out we're watching her, she'll run for cover,
and the child's life will be in danger.
I think I've got it.
An idea has occurred to me.
Why don't you let me, in Kogoro Mouri, take care of everything?
H-hang on, Father, I'm sure you've got it all under control?
I hope you find your little friend soon.
Thank you.
As the waitress at the ramen restaurant said,
do you think it's possible that the kidnapper is the child's father?
"The child's father?"
Conan!
I found a person who has seen Justin in the castle museum.
In the castle museum?
Hey, where are we going now?
- (Ayumi) It's over there!
-You shut up and come with me.
-We won't let him escape.
-It's with the kidnapper!
It's taken too long.
Hold it right there!
Don't come any closer... or you'll regret it.
Nyac!
Fuck!
Quiet!
Where are you going!
-What?
Ah!
-Teu.
-Conan, got it!
-Woman-me.
(woman): Huh?
Aah!
Coi de chiquillos!
What do you think!?
I'll get it.
Oh, take it.
No, let me do it.
Oh!
Hahahaha!
I'm so sorry, guys.
Iaaaaaah!
Ah!
Oysters!
Nooo!
Aaah!
We'll take care of it.
You chase the thief, run!
All right, I trust you, Ay.
I trust you, Ay.
-Huh? -Samurais!
-Samurais!
There's an intruder.
Get him!
Aaaaaaaaaaah!!!
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
Ha-ha-ha!!!
What did you think!?
I'm the owner of the castle.
One word from me and you've seen what can happen to you.
In Kosugi helped you by showing the badge so that the men would help you.
Damn it.
It doesn't matter what happens to the boy!?
What's wrong with him?
Don't pay any attention to him!
-Ah!
-Quiet, I'm here!
Justin!
(Justin) Mother!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
This voice... I'm sure it's Koda's.
(Koda) Huh?
No!
Koda, it's you!
He sent me a message telling me to let you know
if we found out where Justin was and I told you.
The only tourist attractions to the north are the Kokuzo temple and the view from the top of the hill.
are the Kokuzo temple and the view from the top of Mount Daikanbo.
"Mount Daikanbo?"
"Sure!"
He didn't say that someone was giving you a big welcome,
but that he was going to see the big Buddha.
It is a big Buddha lying asleep.
Of course!
From Mount Daikanbo it looks like you see a big Buddha lying down.
I have to notify Agent Koda immediately.
I didn't think you were capable of doing something like that.
I just needed the money.
I lost a lot because of gambling
and I had to pay back a loan to a loan shark,
but I didn't have enough, I didn't know what to do.
They stabbed me to warn me that they wouldn't be lenient.
And they told me that if I didn't pay back well they would kill me.
So you weren't attacked by a criminal while you were on duty.
Where is the thief?
You are the agent who was the Kingdom of Lovable Animals
when that little girl named Ai got in the middle of...!
Excuse me.
Actually, the girl's name is Ayumi.
It doesn't matter.
You are the agent who chased that man who wanted to run away!
"I get it. I've finally cleared it up."
Oh, can you hear me?
Come here.
How dare you come to steal from our company?
And why did he want it, the confidential information?
It is likely that the memory stick was stolen by someone else.
Because on the day of the robbery at the Kumamon Foods headquarters...
Mr. Koda was still in the hospital, right?
-Huh?
-Oh!
So, where is the information about the new product?
Can you tell me where my Kumamon is now?
I think we can tell you that.
Come with me, please.
-Are you sure this is the one?
-I've found it.
Of course you have!
There's a memory device in the back, and it's in perfect condition.
-Very good, Ayumi!
-Oh, it's true.

You found it.
Great!
Thank you.
You saved our company, kiddo.
-Hold on.
Don't give it to her, yet.
-Here.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
The great detective Kogoro Mouri is here!
Come on in.
Aah!
Aaah...
Aaah... aaah... aaah... aaah...
What's wrong, Mr. Mouri?
Father, what are you doing?
(Kogoro voice) Mr. Inoue, I'd like to ask you a question.
What is it about?
This robbery, it was planned and carried out by you, wasn't it?
-Very simple.
-What do you mean by that?
I'm just asking if it was you
who stole the confidential information from Kumamoto Foods.
But how dare you accuse me of anything?
Conan explained to me that yesterday I was not in the Kingdom of the Lovely Animals
at the time of the exchange.
And yet, I knew that the man had hit Ayumi...
with the money bag.
Then he said he knew because Mr. Kumada had explained it to him.
But Mr. Kumada did not know for sure
what the name of the girl who received the blow was called
and confused the Ayumi Yoshida with the Ai Haibara.
You are the agent who was the Adorable Animal Kingdom
when that girl named Ai got in the middle of...!
Never mind, the name.
I'm sorry.
The girl's name is Ayumi.
If it were true what Mr. Kumada told you,
he would have told you
that the thief had hit a girl named Ai.
But you asked Ayumi Yoshida, not Ai Haibara,
how he had the wound.
That's because yesterday...
Ah!
Ouch!
"...was also at the scene of the crime."
To take the money that middleman had promised him.
But, unfortunately, the plan failed.
"When Mr. Kumada called him urgently...
"to explain how the robbery had gone,
"When he appeared in that room
he acted as if he had just arrived in the ordinary."
Am I wrong?
I don't remember telling you anything about the girl.
It is true that yesterday I was at the place of the exchange, I admit it.
But I went because I was concerned
about the information that had been taken from us, I was worried about the company.
We'll see about that now.
Inspector Kosugi, your tablet must have a USB port, right?
Eh?
Yes, yes, of course it does.
Then you can confirm for us
what's on the memory stick we just recovered.
What?
But that would be...
What's the problem?
If it contains the company's information that they stole,
what happens, if we check it now?
Since it's confidential, you can show it only to Mr. Kumada if you want.
What do you say, eh, Inoue?
Since the robbery was planned and carried out by you,
you didn't have the heart to steal the real pencil.
To understand each other, the real information was never stolen.
Aaaaah !!!
I could not stand Mr. Kumada's arrogant and authoritarian attitude.
He treats me very badly, he thinks I am his servant.
Worse, his dog.
All I wanted was to make him suffer a little.
But then he called the police
and without knowing how it turned into a kidnapping case.
Everything got more and more involved and I didn't know what to do anymore.

It is seen that Justin's father died not long ago.
The phone call that Jessica made was to talk about the case
and to ask for advice from a colleague of her husband.
That's why she didn't have the number and used the card.
This explains why Justin is always so protective of his mother.
He probably thinks he has to fill a little bit of the void
left by his father.
Yes, you're right.
"Because, to him, his mother is the most important thing."
I won't get out of here or get killed.
Ha-Haibara...
It will be a very important testimony.
Don't be so afraid.

I assure you that he will not grumble any more.
"He won't squeak anymore? Who?"
Hm?
"Come to think of it, this cat..."
"I've got it. There's a way."
