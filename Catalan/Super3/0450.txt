A giant wall blocks our way.
If we look at it with different eyes, it will be like a giant door!
A crime with the magic that has made the city famous.
An enigma on stage and mystery with a double montage.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and is Detective Conan!
Atarashii no Sekai no makuake wa itsumo yake ni
Okubo de saisho no Ippo ga fumidasenai!
Saa, te wo nobasou...

Yume and tone mukau Hyaku mo no tobira!
Gee, this is for the hiccups!
It's as if from the label,
those ghosts you like so much should come out.
Conan, what a thing to say!
Unlike the cheerful image offered by the magic of en Kazumi Sanada,
the magic show of en Geny Fuyuki
sells a sinister and murky image.
It is strange that this Fuyuki asked you to meet urgently.
Let's check what he wants, anyway.
THE SET-UPS AGAINST MAGIC, (PART ONE)
(Door: knock)
- (boy) Come in, come in. (Kogoro) Sorry for the inconvenience.
(Kogoro) Ah.
It's you, Mr. Mouri!
I apologize
for having such a famous detective like you come in like this.
I am in Fuyuki.
I am in Mouri.
My daughter...
Good morning!
I'm Ran Mouri.
And in Conan, the tick that lives with us.
Tick?
You could have saved this.
Uh... Good morning...!
Excuse me...
As in your call you told me
that you wanted to meet me, at any cost, I came in a hurry.
This is no inconvenience!
Do you like magic?
Hm.
I like it very much!
We go to see magic shows very often.
"If we didn't tell him one of these, he wouldn't have taken us with him..."
Then...
(Clink, clink)
Oooh! Oooh!
Oh, my gosh!
"Oops. And I have to swallow this nonsense..."
It's unbelievable!
"But it must be said, your technique is impeccable."
Changing the subject, if I have made him come expressly to this theater,
it's for another reason.
To tell you the truth, a member of the company wants to kill me.
And I want you to stop this person.
I'm scared.
Listen, have you received... threats?
Lately, on two occasions...
equipment has fallen from the ceiling during rehearsals,
and they didn't kill me.
The first time I thought it was an accident,
but... when it happened again...
At that time, was anyone around?
No, no, it was just me.
Besides you, how many people are in your company?
Shut up!
If you asked the questions, we'd be sold out!
Excuse me, please.
How many are in the company?
There are 5 people in the company besides me.
"First, there's Misa Uehara, an assistant."
She's my ex-girlfriend,
"And she still holds a grudge because I broke up with her 3 years ago,"
unilaterally.
One-sided, you say?
Yes...
Then there's Chiaki Nakagawa, also helping out.
She's my ex-wife and last year we agreed on a divorce.
But she still hasn't forgiven me
for the number of times I was unfaithful to her.
Next, on Kazuma Ishida, who does the video recordings.
He is my disciple
and he had the courage to take on
the whole issue of recordings to study magic.
Recordings...
He has the makings of a good magician and the nano is obedient and has a good temperament.
He is the only one I trust.
Next to him is Shoji Shingo.
He had been a disciple of mine a long time ago,
but he didn't have enough talent for magic
and hired him as a stage manager.
He and I have different views
on what turn the performance should take.
And it will be the last time I plan to count on him.
-That he'll be dispatched? -That's right.
And lastly, on Minoru Hasegawa, the crane operator.
He likes gambling and betting and owes me a lot of money.
Therefore, if he were to die, he would be released from his debts.
In other words, the people who have a motive to murder me are....
...4, except for Kazuma Ishida, right?

Yes, indeed.
-Mr. Mouri. -Tell me.
Here you are.
These are tickets for tonight's show.
Ah.
Well...
I don't think there will be any incidents, but during the performance...
I'll be doing some tricks where I put my life at risk,
so we'll agree on a signal
in case there's an emergency.
A signal?
When I make this signal,
I beg you to come running up to the stage and save me,
even if we are in the middle of the show.
But in your case, just cancel the show.
This I cannot do.
I am a professional magician
and I have a responsibility that I cannot shirk.
Understood.
I will also do my best as a professional detective.
I beg you to do so.
And see to it that no one in the company knows about this.
(Kogoro) I will!
"We still have plenty of time left until the show starts."
Guys, where do you want me to...?
What's wrong?
Ran, what's wrong?
You were disappointed with Fuyuki-san, weren't you, Ran?
That he broke up with his girlfriend unilaterally,
that he was unfaithful to his wife many times and they got divorced...
He said it as if it was the most normal thing in the world.
Daughter, the world of adults is very complicated.
Mr. Mouri, you also have your complications.
He-he!
Conan! (thump)
Oh, what a pain... Don't be a big mouth!
Be that as it may, I have work to do.
You guys are going to hang out wherever you feel like it!
(Punch) Okay?
Ah, Conan, are you okay?
Eh?
If anything should happen during the show...
Indeed, some magic apparatus would be used.
What are you doing here? Well, did it work like that?
Ep, Marrec!
Don't ignore me!
Oh, someone's coming! What?
Fumuda!
Conan, we must hide!
Come on, come on! Yes!
Lie down over there, I'll put the lid on it!
All right, do it!
Conan, wait a minute,
isn't this the box of the trick where they cut the girl to pieces?
It's all right.
Then it comes back in one piece.
No, this is not the point!
Shrink the legs! Yes... They are already here.
-In Kogoro Mouri?
That detective? -Yes, it seems you've hired him. -Yes, it seems you've hired him.
I heard him talking on the phone.
Well... Who do you think dropped that machinery?
I don't know.
But if someone wants to kill him, he'll have to be smarter than that.
-That's true, if you and I were to get together...
-Really, we'd have it pretty easy.
- (riuien) - (boy) Hey!
How can you talk so much nonsense?
Maybe you have a temperament incompatible
with the director of the company,
but if we have something to make a living, it's thanks to him.
Of course it is!
I should be grateful to the master!
But what the hell do you call?
The only reason you're supposed to be siding with him is because you owe him money.
Shut up.
And you too, Kazuma.
Deep down you detest Fuyuki deeply.
Because he gates a lot of time here
and he never lets you go on stage like a real magician.
Well, I don't detest him.
I don't hate him...
-Come on, shall we go? -Yeah.
I don't give a damn, but why don't you shave that beard?
It looks like a stubble!
Ep, wait a moment, please!
Who do you think you are?
Shit!
Hey, are you all right?
How do you want me to be?
Coi!
What a bad pass.
You had to stretch out on your back
and grab your knees with your hands to do this trick.
Huh?
Lie on my back and grab my knees with my hands?
Then, nothing would happen to you, even if you cut your box in two, right?
Sure...
But, thanks to that, we now know...
that the members of the company have a motive against Fuyuki.
All right, I'll have to handle this case very carefully.
Very well!
Hey!
Won't you examine the magic devices?
Looking at everything won't do us any good.
Aw, come on!
Eh... Yes, I'm coming...
Oh, my goodness!
(Audience: standing ovation)
"Ladies and gentlemen,
"Welcome to Geny Fuyuki's magic show."
"I hope that tonight you will all enjoy yourselves
"And be moved by this magical world full of darkness and chimeras!"
(Think) "Mi-te-la! She's having a great time."
How awful!
Oh, it's horrible!

(Audience: exclamations of surprise)
It seems unbelievable!
Oh... What a rest...
Father, it's unbelievable!
Mr. Fuyuki is an expert at throwing knives.
Mr. Fuyuki just made it look like he was throwing them.
What?
But we've seen the knives being thrown.
It just looked like it.
They have a special mechanism.
"I saw it a moment ago at the warehouse backstage."
While Mr. Kogoro and I were hiding there.
With the father?
Uh... Ahem.
Daughter, let the next trick begin.
(Clanc, clanc)
Those spikes are real!
And if those spikes went through him, he wouldn't have a chance to save himself.
(He thinks) "Those straps
(Clanc, clanc) "He only fastens them with a weak adhesive."
After lowering the curtain,
he'll flee through a small space on the side of the table.
Listen, wasn't that the sign?
What? I saw it too!
Stop! (Fuyuki: call)
(Fuyuki: call)
Listen, wasn't that the signal?
What? I saw it too!
(Fuyuki: stop!)
(Fuyuki: call)
(Audience: exclamations of surprise)
Mr. Fuyuki!
Conan!
Mr. Fuyuki!
Gee, what an honor!
Aren't you... the famous detective Kogoro Mouri?
That we have any cases, here?
No, I...
It seems that Mr. Kogoro thought...
that these two cuties wanted to murder me
and came running to help me.
But you can rest assured.
Look, you can see I'm in one piece.
Yes, it seems so.
(Audience: laughing)
But you can't get lost,
because in the second act there are tricks in which I risk my life.
I hope you will watch out for my safety.
Likewise, Mr. Fuyuki.
Ladies and Gentlemen!
A big round of applause for Mr. Kogoro Mouri!
Thank you... Thank you...
Please excuse me.
I just wanted to check if you really
could see the signal I was giving you or you couldn't see it, you know?
Listen, there's a limit to everything.
Thanks to your grace, I've made an awful fool of myself.
I'm very sorry.
But what I said on the stage was true.
In the second one, I'll do some really dangerous tricks.
(Door: call out)
Fuyuki!
Where did this magic trick come from?!
To my stage direction
I wasn't looking for all this screaming or all this blood from the nostrils.
That was my idea...
Thanks to it I was able to deceive a famous detective like you.
This was not what we had said!
The indications I had given you were intended
to offer a splendid image, in the midst of all that dark mystery.
-Kazuma! Yes, say!
Shoji.
From now on nothing will be splendid and elegant.
There will be an even more exciting spectacle.
And I'll offer it.
Then do as you please!
But that's not making a show more exciting, it's making it grotesque!
(Door: opens and closes)
I'm sorry you saw such an unpleasant scene.
Did you want anything?
Say.
No, nothing.
Where should it be, Conan?
He's gone to the toilet and hasn't come back yet.
Leave him alone!
You keep an eye on Mr. Fuyuki.
This whole thing gives me a bad feeling!
"From here I'll be able to tell immediately if anything happens."
Little boy, you can't watch the show standing here.
Go back to your seat.
Yes... But... Come on. Come on.
Good.
Father, look!
No, it's comedy.
He hasn't made the sign!
Father, it's been a long time.
It's all right.
This trick must go like this..., surely.
"When the curtain goes back up,
"Mr. Fuyuki will be right on top of the water tank."
Oh! What?
-Oh! -Oh!
(Audience: exclamations of surprise)
(Audience: exclamations of surprise) Damn it!
Wow! (Audience: whispers)
(Audience: whispers)
Mr. Fuyuki!
Mr. Fuyuki!
What are you doing?
Open the lid of the tank, hurry!
The curtain!
Lower the curtain, please!
Hasegawa!
Lift the lid right now!
(Audience: expressions of surprise)
An ambulance!
Call for an ambulance!
-Fuyuki! -Fuyuki!
Fuyuki!
Mr. Mouri!
Give him mouth to mouth!
(Girls) Fuyuki!
Mr. Fuyuki!
Mr. Fuyuki!
(Girls) Fuyuki!
Headmaster!
Headmaster!
Headmaster!
(Girls) Fuyuki!
Fuyuki!
Fuyuki, you must resist!
(Trona)

No matter how much you tell us it is for research,
we can't reveal the secret of a magic trick.
Well..., you know....
We can't tell you this, you know?
"I must remember that trick."
This knocker...
"I've got it! Now I lack proof!"
And the next Conan: "Assemblies against magic, (part two)"
