DETECTIVE CONAN
The case of the assassination of the president of the finance company
(Think) "I should do a" ryanpin "here?"
"It seems to me that a" shabo "is impossible."
What?
Hey, stop touching my chips!
Let it go.
You're doing great.
This kid is like your amulet.
"Ron!"
"Menten, Ipekodoradora!"
Wow!
I made a double, yes!
Ah, it seems to me that I fold.
Okano, already folded?
Man, I don't have much luck, tonight...
-We need another person.
Shall I call Mr. Hida?
Mr. Hida?
He's the president of a finance company down the street.
He likes to play mahjong a lot.
It's 10 million.
I made a profit again today.
(Phone)
Hida Finance, please say.
Mr. Hida, are you still working?
Ah, it's you, Mr.
Hasegawa.
Being this noise? (Chips moving)
We're short one player and we thought of you.
Yes.
I'll come when I finish counting that money.
(gasps)
Is something wrong?
I'll come here for half an hour.
Start without me.
He says he'll come here for half an hour, we'll start.
I'll play, until he gets here.
All right, if you want... No!
I was very worried because Conan didn't come back!
How did you think to bring him here?!
We're going home!
-Wait't. -Ran, why don't you play?!
You don't even want to!
I don't like this depressing and boring game.
"Ron.
"Da, daisangen, suankohtsuisoh!"
(At the same time) He made a triple!
I've won again.
-He's late, Mr. Hida.
I'll call him back.
It's strange, he doesn't answer... but his lights are on.
He seemed to be in a hurry before.
What if a burglar had broken in?
Let's take a look.
Hey, Mr. Hida.
I know it's in here.
Mr. Hida!
What are you guys doing here?
Who are you?
We were supposed to meet the president.
Since you didn't come, we came looking for you.
Are you still here?
(Kogoro) By the way, what are you doing here?
I forgot my cell phone.
Ah, that's right, I have it.
It's this one.
-And where is it, the president?
-In his office, I think.
Mr. President, Mr. President!
Don't you have a password?
The president won't give us any more key to the cashier's office.
We must break down the door.
Eh?
Pre... President!
Oh, shit.
There's nothing to do.
It's death.
The victim is Michiro Hida, 53 years old.
He died of potassium cyanide poisoning.
He died between 7 and 2/4 and 8 pm.
Inspector!
What is it, Takagi?
The key we found on the board is the one in the office!
Ah!
And if all the windows were locked from the inside,
this... is an impossible crime.
A murder committed behind a locked door!
The staff left at 4 minutes past 7.
The president closed the door
and went back to his office to count the money.
After two hours, Kogoro's group arrived.
Who are they, the two people who went out with you?
Ah, they are...
That's us.
What's all this commotion?
I was at a karaoke, and my pager went off.
That's right, it's true.
What happened here?
Mr. Hida, the president of the finance company, was murdered.
The old man's good luck has run out.
What does he say now?
(Thinking) "What a spread of money."
"Eh? He bites his nails. Must be a habit he has."
"A habit?"
Did he have any special habits, your president?
Habit? When he counted the money or...
Yes, he would spread the bills out in a fan...
and he'd lick the big finger of his right hand.
Who carried this money?
It was me.
He-he-he-he-he... Well, it's very simple.
-It's you, the murderer, Mr. Iino.
-What?!
Of course it is!
You put the poison in the banknotes!
What nonsense!
Could it be this?

Yes.
There was poison on the big finger of the right hand and on bills.
Voice?
I said so, I.
But the poison on the bills is shaped like the victim's finger.
He touched them with his poisoned finger.
-Have you checked it out?
-Of course.
Coffee, eh?
That's right, I brought it before folding this afternoon.
So, you're the murderer!
You put the poison in the handle!
No, there was no poison in the cup or in the coffee.
We understand.
The only traces of poison that we have found here
are on the victim's big toe, on some bills,
the inside doorknob and the bail bondsman on top.
What?
They're also in the shape of the thumbprint.
The victim has touched everything with the poisoned finger.
(Think) "Someone said it looked like the victim was in a hurry."
"Maybe he went out when he hadn't finished counting the money..."
touched the poisoned object
He went back to the office and closed the door.
"But how did they make him touch the poisoned object?"
"And what is it, the object?"
When they have arrived here, they have not touched anything, right?
I only touched the phone, which I had left here.
May I see, please, Mr. Minamisawa?
Yes, indeed.
What's up?
Where is your partner now?
I'm here, inspector!
Hey, may I know what you're doing here?!
Can't you see?
I'm preparing tea.
Don't touch anything without my permission!
Ah, alright.
You mustn't have touched anything else, right?
Well, I went to the bathroom.
I've been to the washroom too.
And somewhere else?
I just started up the computer for a moment, Inspector.
Don't throw the ash on the crime scene!
Is that better for you, Mr. Detective?
Cheeky! Easy, easy, easy.
Is something wrong, gentlemen?
(At the same time) They are suspects.
Do me a favor and stop still!
Hell, no, I've set it in motion!
-Did I stop or not? -I don't know...
Don't touch that!
I'll stop it.
Don't touch it, please!
You'd be in trouble, wouldn't you, if they saw those secret data?
The ones that prove you opened a fake account to embezzle money.
Embezzle money? No, that's not true!
You killed the president so that he would have caught you?
This is absurd.
You are a scoundrel, Minamisawa, you wanted to kill him too, didn't you?
You left a lot of money to a client who disappeared.
The president insisted that you return it to them.
What about you, huh, Takako?
You're no saint!
You always said you'd like to see him dead.
That's true.
But if you can't pay, there's no need to borrow.
You haven't found any traces of poison, in the office?
And the bathroom and the kitchen?
No.
The victim touched potassium cyanide.
It can't be that someone made him disappear in such a short time.
He's got one of you.
I'm not leaving without taking care of it.
Remove all the objects you have with you.
You first, Mr. Minamisawa.
The wallet, the watch, the house key,
a notebook, a railway card and a handkerchief.
This handkerchief is still wet.
Because I went to the toilet recently.
Miss Fujii.
You also have a wet handkerchief.
I've been to the washroom too.
Do you remember, sir?
-Mr. Iino.
Iino-Yes.
And that handkerchief is also...
Oh, my, my, my!
You have it xop... I sweat a lot, I...
(At the same time) no traces of poison have been found in your personal belongings?
No, sorry, but we have not found any poison.
Well, you can give them back to me, can't you?
If you don't mind...
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is over, Conan.
Let's go home.
Aaa... wait, even if you don't...
(Adult voice) What are you doing?
Come to think of it, that person hasn't... Maybe... (adult voice)
Hey, Conan, come back here!
Excuse me, sir... (adult voice) Eh?
You've looked at all the places the victim might have touched.
Did you check the fingerprints? Yes.
Well... (whispers)
(whispers)
Yes, I found it strange too.
Conan!
Flights stop?
Kidney you, if you touch these things.
Flights stop, Conan!
(thinks) "I got it! Bleach!"
"This drip is still fresh. The killer has used this!"
"That person's actions..."

"Those strange footprints and that he went to the bathroom..."
"The victim was alone in the office,
but the killer was able to poison her."
"It looks like he worked magic!"
Marrec!
You're still here stirring?
Ran, take him home!
(Thinking) "Let's go."
Father!
Are you sure, Kogoro?
You know who the murderer is?
(Kogoro's voice) The murderer wanted
the murder to be behind a locked door!
Ran, get some iodine dye from the office.
Did you hurt yourself?
Please register.
So we can prove who the murderer is.
Okay, I'll be right back.
The victim was in this office counting money,
but the killer made him come out
and made him touch something covered in poison.
Then he returned to the office, closed the door and poisoned himself.
The murderer took advantage of the victim's habit of sucking his thumb.
The murderer must be some employee who knew her habits.
Therefore, it must be one of the three of you.
No traces of poison have been found anywhere, apart from this office.
How would he have done it to her, to make her touch the poison?
If he had used a specific object,
10 out of 10 people would have the same reaction.
Ah!
Of course, a telephone!
If a phone rings, anyone would pick it up.
You have called it.
You picked up the phone and the poison went into your hand.
I don't believe it.
Mr.
Mr. Minamisawa has a habit of biting his nails,
and he picked up his phone with his hands without hesitation.
If the phone had been covered with poison,
he would have been too afraid to touch it.
Then it was on the computer!
Mr. Iino, you must have asked Mr. Hida to look at some data!
Hida to look at some data!
This is ridiculous.
He couldn't know
whether Mr.
Hida would touch the switch with his big toe.
Well, where did he put the poison?
There is a way to force him to touch something with his big toe.
They will feel it right away...
The method the murderer used to kill Mr. Hida...
Hida...
It is the voice of the devil...
(Beeping)
(Beep) What's wrong? (Beeping)
The kettle in the kitchen.
The kettle?
Ah!
(Beeping) Sure!
Now I get it!
It's obvious!
The killer has coated the handle with poison, right, Kogoro?
No.
Normal stoves are designed for right-handed stoves.
If you put the poison on the left side of the button on this stove,
you know for sure that whoever touches it will place the poison with their thumb.
To prove it, you can check that there is poison on the inside knob.
Mr. Hida has left the door open,
touched the poison,
went back to his office and closed the door.
And who has used this method to kill M.
Hida?
The only person who has touched the kitchen after the murder.
Miss Takako Fujii!
Just before she left the office,
she put the kettle on the stove and turned it on!
She has adjusted the fire to boil when he was counting money.
He planned to clean up the poison tomorrow when he came to work.
We found the body earlier than you thought.
He was afraid we would detect the poison in the kitchen,
so you went and wiped it up with your handkerchief.
I do not know what s'empatolla.
It is impossible to clean the poison without leaving traces in a short time.
Yes, it is impossible if you only use the handkerchief.
Father!
The tincture of iodine.
The tincture of iodine?
Now, inspector, I'll throw a little on the lady's wet handkerchief.
With just one drop we'll have this mysterious case solved.
With it we'll only have a brown stain.
Oops!
It has disappeared!
So the moisture on the handkerchief is neither water nor sweat.
It's sodium thiosulfate, inspector.
Sodium thiosulfate, you say?
That's right, inspector.
It's a bleach that removes stains from iodine dye.
It also neutralizes potassium cyanide,
which is the poison used in this murder.
They're in the toilet cabinet.
An ingredient has been added to make it effective at room temperature.
Takagi, check it out.
Yes.
When she found out we discovered the body,
she must have gone to the sink to soak the handkerchief in bleach.
All right, I give up.
I've been found out too soon.
What? Takako, don't...
Takako, don't...
It was you!
That's right, I killed him myself.
Mr. Hida was a mean man.
Why did you do it?

My boyfriend had asked her for a loan.
He couldn't pay it back and hung himself.
Simple, right?
You said that those who asked him for money were as bad as he was.
I wouldn't have killed her
if my boyfriend had asked her for money to buy things for himself...
But he did it for me.
I couldn't forgive him.
He did it for you?
I've always had a bad heart.
Three years ago, I had to be hospitalized.
My parents died when I was little,
and because of my temper I didn't have many friends.
He told me he would take care of the hospital bill.
When I went to his apartment, I found him hanging,
with the loan contract at his feet.
And you came to work here to get even with him.
Exactly, I was waiting for my chance.
Hey, how did you find out that I murdered her?
I noticed you didn't take your left hand out of your pocket.
To pick up or light a cigarette, you used your right hand.
You only used your left hand when you touched the button on the stove.
You are a heavy smoker.
And if you smoke, you touch your lips with your fingers.
And so as not to poison yourself, you put out the fire with your left hand.
She didn't take her left hand out of her pocket,
because there could have been poison left and he didn't want to touch anything.
He wanted me to stop smoking.
What an ironic ending!
He must have a laughing fit at the grave.

DETECTIVE CONAN
Hey, Kogoro, I didn't think you'd ever come to play, here.
I had no choice.
Nobody wants to play mahjong because it reminds them of murder.
And you play electronic mahjong with a child.
Au va.
Come on, come on!
Now we press the "chiosoh" and the "Danto".
Idiot, no "must".
Be still!
What are you doing?
Aaa... nothing, nothing, we're...
You should press a "pahsoh", and then wait for a "dorausoh", and then quickly a "lee".
and then quickly a "lee".
(Machine) Prize.
(Machine) Oh!
Let-me did it!
(Machine) All right.
Come on. (Machine whirring)
Come on!
(thinks) "There's no way he's gonna win. He's got almost nothing."
"Tsumoh"... "ipatsutsumo, honitsudorachi!"
And I have an "urandora" too.
It's a triple!
A triple!
All right, and now the last card.
Who taught you how to play mahjong?
I didn't... I didn't...
Shinichi!
(Thinking) "What? Kid Kat. Yes, it's you!"
"You've made a mockery of everyone's police."
"It can't be that a human being would disappear so fast!"
In the next episode...
In Conan vs. Kid Kat the thief
