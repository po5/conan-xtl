(Shinichi voice) "We have a saying that goes:"
"The stork brings new life and good fortune
in the houses where it stops to rest."
"And these little storks we see here are no exception."
"Love is magic and triumphs over mystery."
"It connects with Conan when it comes to suspense. The action takes place in Hyogo."
"In Heiji also appears in this mystery in the hot spring town."

"The Mystery of the Stork (Ran's Investigation)"
(Shinichi voice) They say that the Kinosaki Hot Springs
cured an injured stork long ago.
The hot springs were founded by Douches Shoun 1,400 years ago.
Kinosaki is in Hyogo province, in the north.
It is surrounded by some spectacular sites, such as the Amanohashidate,
one of the three most beautiful landscapes in Japan.
It is a very visited place.
Tourists come here all the time, attracted by the seven spas,
Matsuba crabs and Tajima beef.
Ah, it's hot!
Come on, hurry up, it's very good!
What are you doing?
A foot bath?
Oh, how nice it is!
And we've been lucky, the weather is really nice.
I'm looking forward to bathing in the outdoor pool.
(Thinking) "They didn't say much to me, the hot springs,
but I think I'm starting to like it."
Out of my way, kiddo.
Excuse me, would you mind lying over there, please?
- "What a face," they'll think.
-You don't mind, do you?
No...
We can't fit because you're too fat.
Who, me?
Look who's talking.
(Thinking) "I was wondering if I could like it..."
Hey, I want to go to all the spas.
Why do you think they've started at Genta and the others?
Oh, that's great!
It's nice, isn't it, that we can come to the spa from the first hour?
Oi so much!
I already have one, the Mandara.
After a hot bath, there's nothing like a crab ice cream.
Well, if you say so... Now we have to go to Ichino's spa.
What do you do?
You throw the ice cream on the shield!
Ah!
It's falling apart!
If we come to visit the Kinosaki hot springs, it's for a reason.
And the reason... is this.
This is the famous Kounen Spa,
where, according to legend, the stork was cured.
It's perfect for you, isn't it? (Conan voice) Thank you, Mr. Kogoro.
(Thinks) "He must think I'm a stork."
I'm sure it's good for you.
It was recommended to me by a client from a case I solved not too long ago.
(Thinks) "Actually, I solved the case."
By the way, Conan, how did you do your leg?
(Conan's voice) Uh... well...
-Are you sure?
-Yes, of course.
- (Genta) Really?
- (Mitsuhiko) Well, I'm not.
(Thinks) "La Ran and Mr. Araide."
"But how is it?"
(Conan voice) AAAA!
Ay, ay!
Ow!
Oi.
(All) Ah!
(Ayumi) No, Conan!
(Think) "Don't mind them, you."
You sure didn't watch where you put your foot.
You should be careful when you walk.
Aaah!
What are you doing?!
-Ah!
-But it's...
-I thought you didn't explain. -I'm sorry...
-Eh? -You're not...
Aren't you the famous detective Kogoro Mouri?
Mm?
Well, yes, of course I'm the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
Yes?
My name is Koichi Yumoto and I'm a freelance journalist.
Please let me do an interview with you.
But now... I'm not investigating any cases.
A detective's vacation.
This is the kind of interview readers like to read.
Please, please, please, please.

Well, if the readers like it.... You can interview me whenever you want!
Thank you, thank you very much!
Now I'll be famous too.
(Thinking) "My ankle is no longer of interest to him."
Run, let's go to Yanagi Spa!
Hey, wait for me!
But isn't that...?
Hey, Ayumi!
I'll save it for you.
Let's see, Yanagi Spa.
Ah, it's over there.
Ah! Ah!
Oops.
Oi, what a pain.
Did you hurt yourself?
Are you all right? Don't touch me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
"Haruna."
Your name is Haruna, right?
Where are your parents?
Don't you want me to take you to them?
No, I don't! Haruna!
Hey, wait!
Nothing like a beer after a bath!
But are you sure someone will want to publish this?
Yes, of course they will.
I'll follow it all day long.
That's fine with me.
No problem for me.
Ha-ha-ha!
Beer is fine...
But sake with hot water from the hot springs is unbeatable.
Who are these two?
They're like a lamp.
Yeah, that's how a famous detective spends his vacation.
Now, the Ichino hot spring.
And that makes three.
-Hey, look! -Hey? -Huh?
Guaita, I have six crab poles!
I know it's part of your nature,
but when are you going to stop eating?
I have to try the veal and horse meat.
Veal and horse?
Yes, the beef and horse meat.
You can tell it's a local specialty.
No, it's not veal and horse meat.
It's Tajima beef.
Ah...
Man, it has the same characters but it's a different word, huh?
Oysters!
Isn't it a mixture of beef and horse?
How serious, my mouth was already watering.
Genta is a glutton.
He's had his fill at breakfast time.
(Conan voice) Listen, where is the Ran? I do not know.
We lost it a while ago.
You know where it might be?
We know it.
We've seen it recently.
Have you seen it? Yes, it was Yanagi Spa.
Look at it.
The person in the photo is the Ran, isn't it?
(Think) "Who is the girl in the photo running in front of her? Hm?"
(Conan voice) Mitsuhiko, move the photo to the left.
How?
Like this? Yes.
See this man? Eh?
But it's...
It's the man who threw me to the ground! What?
Yes, he's the guy who bumped into Genta and didn't even apologize.
(At the same time) Eh?
(At the same time) Ah!
-What's wrong with this guy? -Ah!
Ah! People!
My crab ice cream!
It was only the second one I ever ate!
(Think) "What was this guy doing? Following the Ran and the girl?"
(Conan voice) Maybe I'd better call the Ran.
(Female recording) "We're sorry, but the cell phone you're calling....
Is either turned off or out of range right now."
"Please call back in a few minutes."
What?
How are we doing, guys?
Have you worked up an appetite for lunch yet?
Mr. Kogoro, Ran is missing.
What?! I called him and he's not picking up his cell phone.
-But how is that possible?
-Hey, this is getting interesting.
You, hide the machine.
The interview is over.
But why?
I had already sold the interview to a newspaper.
Look, my daughter is missing.
I'm sorry, but we'll leave it here.
-You're a detective... -You go away! -You go away!
Now that my luck could change.
Shit!
Do we have any clues that could help us to locate her?
No, none.
(Think) "I'd be satisfied if I could find out who this girl is."
What happened to you?
Have you taken to being on crutches?
What?
Did you fall and twist your ankle?
Hattori!
Oh, sorry, I mean Heiji!
What a coincidence that we meet here.
But where's the Ran?
The Ran was with us, but she's disappeared.
-What?! - The Ran has disappeared?
Yes.
The last time we saw her there was still this little girl in the photo.
-This girl? -Wait a minute! -This girl...
This girl...
Do you know who she is? -Huh? -Of course I know who she is.
Of course I know who she is.
If we're here, it's because we've been tasked to find her.
Her name is Haruna Tabuse.
She's eight years old and the only daughter of a restaurant chain owner.
-Va disappeared from home yesterday. -What?!
She disappeared?!
We're here, Mr. Tabuse.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Oh, it's you, Hattori.
Where is the Haruna?
Have you found her?
Have you found my daughter?
I'm sorry to say not yet, but now we're following a good lead.
You have a lead?
But who is the man accompanying you?
-Ah, he's a detective from Tokyo. My name is Kogoro Mouri.
-In Mouri, the detective?!
-The famous detective?
Eh?
(Think) "What is that spot?" Yes, and this little guy here is....
(Conan voice) In Conan Edogawa.
(Thinks) "The 'little one', you could have saved yourself."
What's the matter?
You must be following us around all day?
Sweep away the fog, little guy!
It's just that I'm worried about the Ran, too.
Worried about the Ran?
Apparently, your daughter Haruna...
has disappeared with my daughter Ran.
We can't find her either.
What?
Your daughter has kidnapped the Haruna?
I want an explanation!
(thinks) "Oysters!"
Hurray!
I'll finally eat Tajima's beef!
Oi, that's good!
This sandwich is so good!
-And this crab must be good too.
-You, that's enough, eh?
What do you think I am?
Your bench, me?
Come on, you could buy me a drink, couldn't you?
For some little something you mean:
five hard-boiled eggs, five pork sandwiches and four veal sandwiches?!
That's no good.
Conan has left without us.
I don't know, I'm worried.
Maybe something serious has happened to Ran.
It seems that Conan is convinced,
that something serious has happened to him.
I got it, I know what to do!
We'll look for Ran and find her before Conan does!
Better!
We'll prove that we are the Detectives League!
I wouldn't mind if we found it ourselves,
but the only clue we have is this photo.
-It's true... -Hey!
Look at the backpack!
-Huh?
-That's the backpack I wanted.
-Huh?
The same one? -Yes, it is.
Look, it's in this catalog.
It's the same one, isn't it?
I'm sorry, I've lost my temper.
I apologize.
Don't worry, don't worry.
It's all right.
Mr. Tabuse, if you don't mind,
I'd appreciate it if you'd explain everything from the beginning.
Of course I would.
It all started yesterday.
A very valuable piece was stolen from the Tabuse museum,
in Kobe.
This piece was stolen when we were rearranging the exhibition.
I don't know if it was a coincidence, but, at the same time,
my daughter Haruna, who had gone to visit the museum,
also disappeared.
I was here in Kinosaki for work,
when I got a call from the museum director, Mr. Kamachi.
He put me in touch with Hattori
and asked him to look for her.
Thank you.
Could you tell me which piece was stolen?
A sculpture, "The Rainbow Boy",
by the sculptor Kaho Handa.
Let's see?
So this is "The Rainbow Child".
So you think that when they stole the sculpture
Haruna was around and that's why she was kidnapped?
Ah!
Where is my daughter?
You said you had a clue, right?
Well, apparently, your daughter is here now, Kinosaki has been spotted.
Kinosaki?
Yes, that's her.
It's Haruna!
But what's she doing here?
What's she doing here?
Who is this man by the bridge?
We're not sure, but we suspect it's the kidnapper.
Apparently,
his daughter has managed to escape from the kidnapper,
met up with Ran, and now the two of them have fled together.
(Think) "Ran, why don't you call me? What happened to you?"
"May... may be this man has...?!"
(Woman 1) Hey, look, they sell Toyooka City bags here!
(Woman 2) You can buy them from this machine!
We bought one!
-Oh!
What nice bags! -Hey, you buy one too.
The one with the drawing of a stork is very pretty.
Let me go, please.
I don't want any, bag!
-Hello. -It's this one here.
-How cool!
-How many backpacks there are!
Hello, madam, we're looking for a little girl.
Has a little girl come, here,
to buy a backpack like the one you have on the table?
-Just a moment, I'm waiting for you.
-No, don't worry, don't worry about me.
I'm in no hurry, I can wait.
I'm sorry.
A backpack?
Like this one here?
Yes.

The one we had like this one, Haruna, Mr. Tabuse's daughter, has it.
-Was the backpack pink? -Yes, it was pink, for sure.
Excuse me...
I heard you two talking.
You're Haruna's friends?
Nothing happened to her, right?
(Phone: Conan voice) "At Kinosaki Water Park?"
Yes, the dolphin trainer there knows Haruna.
She said a friend of hers may have known where they were and called her.
"It looks like the friend has seen them both."
Really? "I'll call you when I know more."
Wait, I'm coming too!
Where are you going so fast?
Don't worry, there are still a lot of things we have to finish investigating.
Tell me what we should do and we'll do it.
Come on, you come over here and leave everything in our hands.
(Voice Shinichi, sluggish) Thank you, Hattori.
You're a good friend.
By the way, you have to tell me what happened to you, at the bottom.
You loved looking at that girl and you tripped?
What?
What are you saying?
It's not true!
- (ovation) - (applause)
-Oysters!
(applause) - How cool!
(PA: man) "I present to you Genta, the sea lion."
-Did you feel it?
It's Genta! How strong!
It's normal, you look so much alike.
-You can't say it like me! Always the same...
-We didn't come here to have fun.
- (applause)
(thinks) "How strange. In the store she's done the same thing."
I'm looking for this girl.
Have you seen her?
I'm looking for this girl.
Have you seen her?
Yes, yes I have seen this girl.
They were there.
Yes, they were before the altar of the goddess Kishimojin.
(Shinichi voice) And you say you were looking for something?
Yes.
And, by the way, they visited the spas and the most touristy places.
By the way, have you heard of the legend of Kishimojin?
The legend of Kishimojin?
It is an Indian legend.
Kishimojin was an evil goddess who kidnapped and devoured children,
but one day, to teach her a lesson,
Gautama Buddha hid a child of hers
so that he would know how his victims suffered.
It is seen that Kishimojin learned the lesson
after which that wicked goddess who devoured children
became a kind goddess,
and forever devoted herself to protecting mothers and children.
It is seen that both of them were looking for something
around the Kishimojin shrine.
I don't see it clearly.
Do you think someone is chasing them?
It looks more like the Ran is being followed by a girl
who wants to go sightseeing.
Yes, I know who she is.
Here she must have been with her parents.
(Haibara) "This photo is from three years ago. Haruna Tabuse."
"Father's name, Shuuhei; mother's name, Kaho."
Kaho?
But Kaho is also...
The sculptor of the work on display in her museum,
"The Rainbow Boy," is his ex-wife,
and she is also the mother of the Haruna, am I wrong?
Why didn't you tell us?
I didn't know anything either, Mr. Tabuse.
No... I didn't mean to hide anything.
Where is your ex-wife now?
This woman...
is a monster who preferred art to her daughter!
-I don't know where she is, and I don't want to know. Mr. Tabuse...
(Conan voice) And how is it that she exhibited a work...
of a person he could not stand and did not want to forgive?
This, this is not... Of course, it was her!
Eh?
It was she who stole "The Rainbow Boy",
or maybe not, maybe she had it stolen from the Haruna.
Yeah, sure, that's what happened.
(Mouri) You mean the suspicious person is the Kaho in disguise?
I don't know, but I would say that stating this is a bit adventurous.
-Please, Kamachi, show them. Yes, okay.
It's a letter from the Kaho addressed to Miss Haruna.
Mr. Tabuse found it in his room.
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me, do you mind if I read it?
-Endavant. -Let's see...
"We had a good time at the Kinosaki Hot Spring Resort
and the Water Park, didn't we?"
"You were very little and you may not remember much."
Sure!
The hot springs, the parks, Kiyamachi Square....
Haruna has been to all the places listed on the chart.
Clearly, Haruna is visiting all the places....
she had visited three years ago with her parents.
Surely this woman must be waiting for the Haruna and the sculpture
in one of these places.

(Thinks) "I don't think so, then I'd tell the place to the letter."
"The whole thing is weird."
-That's very strange! -What's strange?
Well, the letter...
does not mention at any time the Traditional Museum of Straw Art
and the Haruna has gone.
On the other hand, she has not gone to the Center of Art and Literature,
which does appear in the letter.
Let me see.
Let me see?
"I found by chance my friend Michiko,
the straw artist, the Kinosaki Art and Literature Center."
Who is this Michiko?
She is a high school friend of the Kaho, and a straw artist.
But how could the Haruna have gone to a place she didn't know?
These are memories from three years ago, from when she was five years old,
it's normal for her to go to the wrong place.
(She thinks) "It could be, but there's something that doesn't bind me."
" 'I'll keep it as a souvenir of our trip.'"
(Conan voice) One question: what will you keep as a souvenir of the trip?
Sorry, I have no idea.
The important thing now would be to know the next place where he will go.
Surely, at the Kinosaki hot spring resort,
which is mentioned in the letter.
Yes, it might be here.
Hey, Haruna, would you mind telling me what you're looking for?
Come on!
Where is it?
Where is it?
Ah!
Let go of me!
Let her be!
I repeat: let her be! As you wish.
Haruna! Ah!
-Where have you hidden?
-I don't know.
Stop!
Haruna, call the police!
Aaah!
Ran, no!

(Think) "Sorry, Ran, if I didn't have an ankle like that..."
Great, the Haruna is already showing signs of life.
Now that's a job for the Junior Detective League.
(Conan voice) You say that the shield feels like gongs?
I don't know why, but I think you're thinking what I'm thinking, Kudo.
(Conan voice) Help!
Somebody help me!
(Think) "Ran, hold on!"
(Conan voice) "Don't miss the next episode!"
"The Mystery of the Stork: Chasing the Haruna'."
