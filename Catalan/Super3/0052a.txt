DETECTIVE CONAN
The Mist Goblin Murder Case
The cherry blossoms,
how beautiful, especially in the mountains.
Of course, cherry blossoms are also beautiful in the city,
but in the mountains, the blossoms show their beauty and splendor.
Oh my lord, Kogoro is a bit of a handful everywhere.
What did you say?
Ah, that it was worth it, renting the car and coming.
Of course it was!
We'll take a picture.
Come on, get over there, nanos.
Come, Conan!
Yes.
Father, set the automatic so you can get out.
That's a good idea.
Hold it right there.
"My name is Conan Edogawa."
"This guy is Kogoro Mouri, a sleazy detective."
"And the Ran, a friend and classmate."
"You don't understand how she can be my classmate?"
"Actually, I'm someone else."
"I'm Shinichi Kudo, student."
"It all started that day..."
"The Ran and I had gone to an amusement park,
and witnessed a bribery by an organization."
"A man dressed in black, whose name was Vodka."
"But from behind, another man came up, in Gin."
"He gave me a punch and stunned me."
"Then they forced me to drink a poison."
(Thinks) "I'm so hot."
"My bones seem to be falling apart."
"I've already lost."
"Then I heard the voice of a policeman."
"My body had shrunk."
I have to find out who those men are and get the poison!
If they find out you are alive, they will try to kill you.
This secret must remain between you and me.
Don't tell anyone, not even the Ran!
"This is Dr. Agasa, a neighboring inventor of mine."
"That's how my body shrank and appeared in Conan Edogawa."
"After this incident, I settled in Ran's house."
"His father is a detective, but a sleazy detective."
"To help me, Dr. Agasa invented an anesthetic gun."
"I use it to put Kogoro to sleep,
and with the loop that transforms the voice I solve complicated cases."
"And that's how I've lived my life until today,
but the truth is that I want to go back to the way I used to be."
Well, let's go home.
We'll take a shortcut here.
Do you see clearly, this?
We won't get lost?
No, woman, no!
Don't suffer!
Okay, come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go!
I asked you if it was clear?!
Besides being lost, we have a flat tire.
We had such a good time! Shut up.
Oh, my gosh!
Now it's raining!
What are we going to do now?
We are far away from the foot of the mountain.
I don't know... I don't think anyone lives here, in the middle of the forest.
We'll spend the night in the car.
I don't want to sleep here!
Couldn't you fix the flat tire?
We don't have a spare tire.
It's bad luck, getting two flat tires in one trip.
Hey, hey, hey!
Where has he gone, that nano?
Conan!
Where are you?
Conan, come answer me!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Why are you screaming like that?
It was just a bird.
Hey, what happened to you?
Why did you call?
What did you say?
I don't know what you mean.
Anyway, where were you?
I don't want you to go alone.
I found a temple back here.
I'm sure someone lives there.
Shall we go?
Hey, you're right.
Look!
It's a mountain temple.
Now that's lucky!
Come on, let's go, guys!
Let's go, let's go!
They've built it in a strange place.
It's called "Sandeiji".
They must let us stay the night.
Hello, everybody.
Anybody here?
Hello!
Hey, what do you guys want?
Didn't you hear me?
What have you come?
Are you stupid, are you journalists from a newspaper or a TV station?
Go away!
Go away!
We don't want vulgar people like you here.
We have a flat tire and we don't have a spare,

and we thought we could spend the night...
But what do you say now?
You want to sleep here?!
Yes, but... listen, if we disturb you, we'll leave.
Man, why didn't you say so before?
I figured they wanted to make a report on that thing,
and we're sick of it.
That thing?
What do you mean, sir?
Ah, nothing, nothing, it's of no importance, child.
Let's see, one night with a meal and a visit will cost you 10,000 yen per person.
The child will pay 8,000.
We have rooms ready.
What's that?
10,000 yen?!
If it's not good for you, leave.
It's 6 hours, all the way to the foot of the mountain.
Ah, I didn't say we wouldn't stay.
Disciples!
Some guests will spend the night here.
Eh!
I haven't said if we're staying yet.
It is wiser.
Stay for the night.
With a rainy night like this, you don't know if that one is spying on you.
That one? That there are bears out here?
He-he-he-he-he!
Bears?
It's not as cute as a bear, no.
Taking advantage of the rain and darkness, it eats people's souls.
It's an ancient beast.
It's the fog goblin.
The... fog goblin?!
Ah, no.
This name is taboo here.
Pretend I didn't tell you anything.
Ah, he is here.
I will introduce you to the 4 disciples who study and live in the temple.
This is in Kanner.
He has been studying here the longest.
How do you do?
This one is in Tönnies.
He is gluttonous, but a good cook.
This one is in Mokunen, very skilled.
He takes care of the carpentry.
Very nice.
The last one to come is in Shun.
He is small but smart and a good student.
Welcome.
Finally, I am the monk Ténéré, the priest of this temple.
All right then, Tonna and Mokunen, go and prepare dinner!
Kann and Shun, go show the temple to these people.
Father, we are staying the night here, aren't we?
Between the car rental and the stay, I won't be able to drink anything.
This is the main hall of the temple.
(Kogoro) Mmm... It's beautiful, isn't it?
If you want, we can reserve the hall for your funeral.
-Eh?! - It was just a joke.
How scary.
Come over here.
(thinks) "Eh? What's this?"
"The door with the padlock..."
"Is it a warehouse?"
Hey, hey, hey!
Kid, don't come in here, come back!
"There's nothing... it's small."
Hey, come on, kid... Kid!
"Eh? Wow... what a high ceiling!"
Wow, what's the use of this room?
What's it for, this room?
Hey, hey, hey!
Listen to this.
This is the punishment room.
In the old days, the disciples who did something wrong,
they were locked in here.
That's why the walls are so thick...
and varnished because they slip and don't go up.
And why is it different, the wood of this piece here?
I've been told that when it happened they had to change the wood.
Isn't that right, Kanner?
So, what happened?
I just don't know all the details, because I wasn't here.
The goblin from...
Shut up, Shun!
You don't have to explain this to our guests!
Sorry, sorry. (water flowing)
Eh?
What is it, this noise? (Water)
It's the waterfall.
Do you want to see it?
It's next to this room.
Conan, come on, let's go!
I'm coming.
Wow, it's beautiful!
We have the waterfall right here!
It's beautiful!
It even falls over the railing and it's pouring over there, the water.
Watch out, please.
The ground is safe, but you could slip.
Aren't they cherry blossom petals?
Yes, the water must have washed cherry blossoms down from the mountain.
(Kogoro) How romantic, isn't it?
We should go inside.
Dinner should be ready by now.
I thought priests spent the day instructing themselves,
but they have a lot of free time.
Sometimes, when we have a day off, and it's nice, we go to the beach.
The big priest really likes girls in bikinis.
Hey, hey, don't make me look bad!
Gentlemen, a question.
Who is it, the Elf of the fog?
Who spoke to you?
I'm sorry... forgive me, it slipped out by accident.
-But priest... -It's all the same.
It's all right.
It's an old story, little one.
On rainy nights,
this goblin would enter the village as if it were fog,

He would tear down the walls of houses and kidnap people.
Then it used to fly into a tree,
hung the body and ate the flesh.
It is part of our mythology.
And they say that its prey were young girls, with tender flesh!
Yes... yes, exactly, just like you, miss.
But this is an ancient story.
Don't worry, my pretty.
It's a tale.
Well you say so.
But maybe it's not just a story after all.
About two years ago, there was a mysterious incident at the monastery.
Mokunen!
No!
Kogoro, don't you want to ask them more about this incident?
Man, you're the great detective Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?
Maybe you could unravel the mystery.
He's the detective...
-Kogoro... Mouri!
You're very famous!
Maybe you can solve this mystery!
-We'll explain everything, sir! -Two years ago, a priest... -Two years ago, a priest...
Very well!
Enough of this!
We promised we wouldn't explain it to any outsider.
But... but priest!
Dinner is over!
Everybody go to sleep right now!
Mr. Detective, you can stay for the night,
but tomorrow morning you will have to leave the monastery!
And now dispensi'ns, please...
Yes, understood.
Father, don't they exist, don't they, the elves?
Of course not, daughter!
You know that fairies and ogres don't exist.
Well, it's the same with elves,
they are only creations of the imagination.
You are right.
The idea of leprechauns originated in China,
when a shooting star fell and made a deafening noise.
In said, "Ten-no-inu".
It eventually morphed into "tengu" or "goblin".
This belief was also adopted in Japan.
And the long-nosed goblin
appears in strange places and has mysterious powers.
Conan, being a little boy, you know many strange things.
Eh ?!
Ah, I saw it on a TV show.
Ran, don't worry about anything.
Nothing bad will happen to you.
And now.
I'm not afraid of anything, me.
Least of all, of stories about leprechauns.
Come on, let's go to bed.
Apa, like this.
Conan, if you get scared in the middle of the night, you can come to my bed.
I'll take care of you.
Apa, good night.
Most of all, Conan, if you get scared, you can come to my bed.
"His prey were young girls with tender flesh!"
"Yes, exactly, just like you, miss."
Oysters, coi de Ran!
Look at you waking up at this hour.
What do you want me to do, if I'm a coward?
Aren't you curious to know what happened?
No.
If you do not want to talk, better not to ask.
And I doubt that the fog elf has ever come here.
You were saying something about me?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
You're a coward too.
Ran!
Where did you get it, this mask?
From the wall of the washroom.
Oh!
Coi de notch.
What happened?
Ah... no, nothing, nothing.
Au, in bed!
Good night, Kanner, sleep well.
I took this.
What shall I do?
Put it to sleep!
(Think) "With all this commotion, I'm wide awake!"
Good morning!
Breakfast is already on the table, family.
Yes, we'll be right back.
You look very sleepy.
What's it like?
Well, I read too late.
Now I'll have to be excused.
You've been up late too, Mokunen?
Of course I was!
What did you make that scream for.
I couldn't go back to sleep.
I'm very sorry...
And look, I still... But in Tönnies has not slept at all.
Where are they, the high priest and Kanner?
In Kanner he said he couldn't find the priest, so he went to look for him.
He must be in some room drinking liquor.
(Shout)
It was... it was Kanner's voice!
It was coming from the punishment room.
What's the matter? What's going on?
Look, look...
Oysters!
Monk Tenes!
The victim is the monk Tenes, the high priest of the temple.
The approximate time of death is between 10 and 11 o'clock at night.
The corpse was discovered by a disciple of the temple.
It's called Kann, isn't it, sir? Yes ..
I couldn't find the priest, this morning, and I looked for him everywhere.
I went into the punishment chamber, and...
And when he heard his scream, one I know came running to...
That's right, Inspector Megure, it was me, Kogoro Mouri.

Well, well, you've made a scream that's not bad, Kanner.
Not as loud as yours.
Don't you have a highly developed sixth sense?
I say that because the priest was hanging from the ceiling, which is very high.
I wouldn't have seen it, up there.
It's a little strange, isn't it, Kanner?
Maybe you already knew,
that the priest was hanging up there all the way up there, huh?
Hey, stop making jokes.
I was just looking for...
(Man) It's natural, that I've seen it.
Hey, Mokunen!
Because two years ago, the same thing happened in this room.
(Man) What?
Two years ago?
Yes, I took care of that case too.
It was a disciple named Chun who died.
And the body was found by you, in Kann and Mokunen, right?
That incident also happened during the rainy season.
In Chun was doing exercises in this chamber...
and when we came to look for him,
we found a hole in the wall, but he wasn't there.
We searched for 3 days, but we couldn't find him.
Until the morning of the fourth day,
Kann and I went in, looked up and...
En Chun was hanging here.
The wall that was smashed, was that same wall?
Yes... first we thought
that he had smashed it in Chun to escape from the temple,
but the door to this room wasn't locked.
A carpenter who came to fix the outer wall,
told us that it would have taken one person a day to make that hole.
We deduced that it must have been the work of that beast.
The goblin of the fog!
(At the same time) The fog goblin?
To be continued.
