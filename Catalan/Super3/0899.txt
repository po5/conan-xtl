(Door: doorbell)
Mifuyu!
Hello!
- (brittle) -Huh?
(Woman) Tabata!
(Woman) What are you doing?
Please, Tabata, stop!
- (woman: shrieks) -Oh!
Mifuyu!
What happened, Mifuyu?
Are you all right, Mifuyu?
Mifuyu!
Mifuyu!
Ah!
Mifuyu!
Mifuyu!
Mifuyu, please hold on!
I... in Tabata...
In Tabata?
He stabbed you in Tabata?
He's coming... Go away!
In Ta... in Tabata is...
Mifuyu!
Hang on, Mifuyu!
-Mifuyu!
- (metallic clang)
(Mifuyu) "It's coming... Go away! In... Tabata is..."
"A new day begins with a splendid sun."
"It's the time for love and mysteries."
"There's been a murder at a girl's house."
"What could have happened? The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

(Go, go, go, go, go!) Get the truth.
(Go, go, go, go, go!) Get the truth.

"The cry of the real culprit."
(Kogoro) Yes.
It stopped raining.
Damn!
I was thinking of going to lunch at the Poirot.
I didn't think it would be closed.
Let's see, what would you like to eat for lunch?
Hey, hey, hey!
What's the matter with him?
I... I'm sitting down.
Where are you going so fast?
What is she running away from?
She looks very pale, she looks like she's not feeling well.
Mm?
What is it, that thing on her shoulder?
It looks like blood!
Yes..., it is blood...
It's that my friend has been killed by her boyfriend!
What's that?
What's that?
(Slides)
-It's here.
-Wait!
The killer could still be inside, we don't know.
Hello!
Anybody here?
Wait out here until I call you.
Go ahead, you can come in now.
All right, you can come in now.
It can't be!
Are you sure, it's on this floor, where you found the stabbed friend?
Kogoro.
Oh, of course it is!
It's the truth!
This must be the murder weapon.
It's stained with blood.
And here are some footprints
that come in from the balcony and others that come out again.
It's very strange... A corpse can't just disappear like that.
"What does this mean?"
Miss Ayano,
Are you sure the victim was the woman who lived on this floor,
Miss Mifuyu Morita?
That you knew her, the Mifuyu?
Yes.
We worked together at the bakery in front of the station.
Mifuyu had invited me to come to her house for a while today,
but when I arrived at the time we had arranged...
She heard the sound of breaking glass and someone said, "Stop, Tabata!"
It was her friend Mifuyu's voice.
Then, as she knew where the spare key was,
she was able to open the door, entered the apartment...
and found Miss Mifuyu stabbed.
"Careful, get out of here!", he told her.
And she died immediately afterwards.
Then I heard a noise coming from the balcony.
I got scared and ran away in a hurry, without looking back.
Yes, from what you say,
it's possible that the culprit was still here, hiding on the balcony.
Y... who is he, this Tabata guy?
The guy Mifuyu was dating, her boyfriend.
Is this the guy?
The one in the photo?
That's right, that's him.
This is Mifuyu and Tabata.
They met about 3 months ago.
My dream for many years is to open a pastry shop in Paris.
Wow, really?
It's a very nice dream.
Yes.
That's why I work so hard now and try to save as much as I can.
I'd love to help you, even if it's just a little bit.
Really, Tabata?
-Tabata...!
-Of course you are, I'm your boyfriend.
But..., soon after we left,

he had serious problems with his business
and told the Mifuyu that he needed money.
Bah!
It's the typical modus operandi of the seductive swindler....
Go on.
The Mifuyu left him her savings?
That's right.
She left you 10 million yen.
Ten... ten million yen?!
But then in Tabata,
who didn't know that Mifuyu and I were friends,
also asked me for money and I got it.
I told Mifuyu about it and she said she would report it.
And it seems that in Tabata you have come to shut her up for good, right?
About that, Miss Ayano,
we sent a sample of the blood on the knife to the lab.
and they told us that it was group B blood.
Do you know what it was, your friend's blood group?
Yes, it was group B...
And another question.
We found this note in the wastebasket.
Do they tell you something, these 3 figures?
Had she spoken, Miss Mifuyu?
No.
I don't know what they are.
"2, 9, 3?"
"It's impossible to jump from such a high floor."
"Mm? What's this?"
Eh?
Ti!
AAAA!
You brat!
Who gave you permission to snoop?
I won't do it again...
How strange!
-What's the matter?
I see the suitcase is missing.
Mifuyu had a fat wheeled suitcase that she always kept here.
Of course she did!
Tabata has carried the corpse inside the suitcase!
I know how it all went, Inspector.
In Tabata he broke in through the window from the balcony
and killed Mifuyu by stabbing her in the chest with a knife.
But since Miss Ayano arrived
before she could make the corpse disappear,
she hid on the balcony and, as soon as Miss Ayano left,
she put the body in the suitcase and took it away to hide it.
It could be.
Okay, we'll send a couple of officers to ask the neighbors...
if they've seen a suspicious man carrying a suitcase.
In the meantime, let's check on Tabata.
Good afternoon, Mr. Inspector.
Good afternoon, sir.
Have you checked if this is Mr. Tabata's address?
- (Kogoro) Inspector!
(Kogoro) -Yes.
Look, here are some fingerprints.
And I'd say they match
with the ones in Miss Mifuyu's apartment.
(Kogoro) Also, these look like the ruts of a suitcase.
Just as we imagined:
Tabata has stuffed the body into the suitcase
and took it home.
Mr. Tabata, open the door, please!
It is open.
Look, there are blood stains on these shoes.
Everything fits.
They must be the ones she was wearing when she killed the Mifuyu.
Of course they are...
That's why they're so splattered.
Mr. Tabata!
It can't be.
Oh!
Mr. Tabata!
Oh, my God!
What the hell happened here?
This smell...
I don't want to jump the gun, but I'd say he's taken some kind of poison.
Yes, and there's probably still some left in the coffee cup.
Look, there's a piece of paper.
What does it say?
This is...
"I'm going to meet with the Mifuyu. Atsushi Tabata."
Wow, a suicide note.
We should check if this is his handwriting.
Yes.
Indeed, it seems to be his handwriting.
This means... he committed suicide.
(Kogoro) He must have been so sorry for what he had done to the Mifuyu
that he had no choice, right?
By the way, we should look for Mifuyu's corpse.
It doesn't seem to be in this room.
Let's search the rest of the house, then.
Yes.
(Takagi) I found her!
Mm-hm.
I'll open it.
(Takagi) Mm?
(Takagi) Mm?
Maybe it wasn't this one, the suitcase.
It's empty!
Mm?
Look at this.
This long hair looks like a woman's.
Inspector!
Tabata must have hidden the Mifuyu's body somewhere in the middle of the road,
while he was taking it home.
We understand.
We'll go back to the station,
have the hair analyzed and look for the body.
Mouri, thank you for your help.
We'll take it from here.
It's been a pleasure, inspector.
Now all that's left is for the police to find the Mifuyu's corpse
and the case will be solved once and for all.
We can leave now.
Eh?
Mm?
What do you got?
There's something you're not quite convinced about, is there?
I just don't understand what the need was at Tabata
to take the empty suitcase home.
Huh?
What the hell are you talking about?
It would have made more sense to make it disappear with the body.
Yes.

On balance, you are right.
Besides, I also find it strange that Mr. Tabata used the guests' crockery to drink the poisoned coffee.
the guests' crockery to drink the poisoned coffee,
considering that in the kitchen
there is a cup of coffee with battle milk in the kitchen.
Bah!
Sometimes, the Swiss give a little treat...
before going to the other neighborhood.
And if he was not alone?
Maybe there was someone with him.
E... ei!
Stop stirring.
It doesn't look like they were used.
Maybe this other person washed his cup.
What do you mean?
Just as I thought.
Look at this.
Huh?
What did you imagine, you?
They cleaned a lipstick stain with the scrubbing pad.
What are you talking about?
So, they've washed the other cup...
to hide the presence of another person.
There was someone, then?
Then, in Tabata he would not have committed suicide, but would have been killed.
And now, that's nonsense!
Haven't you seen it,
that we found a suicide note written in his handwriting?
"I will go to meet the Mifuyu," the note said.
Yes, but these words need not be a farewell message.
And what other meaning could they have?
Perhaps Mr. Tabata wrote it in the literal sense,
because he was meeting the Mifuyu somewhere,
and they used the note to simulate a suicide.
Wait a minute!
So, it wasn't a suicide, was it?
It could be that this man was the victim of a murder!
Someone killed the Mifuyu and faked Tabata's suicide.
Think, Kogoro.
He didn't kill the Mifuyu either?
When the two of us entered the apartment where the Mifuyu lived,
it had recently stopped raining,
but the killer's footprints were already dry.
Yes?
I didn't notice.
So, then, we must assume...
that they had been left behind for quite some time.
And you're not surprised that the murderer broke the window
and attacked the Mifuyu at the very moment
when Miss Ayano was knocking at the door?
But Miss Ayano claims
that she heard the sound of breaking glass
and the Mifuyu's voice shouting: "Stop, Tabata!
I got it!
Miss Ayano lied to us!
The person who killed Mifuyu is....
If the murderer was Miss Ayano,
she wouldn't have taken us to her victim's house
right after committing the crime.
Of course, of course!
The culprit has left his footprints in advance,
calculated the time when her friend would arrive to break the glass,
threatened the Mifuyu to force her to say that Tabata was attacking her.
and then stabbed her and hid on the balcony.
No.
I'm sure there was no one on the balcony.
What?
But, while she was on the floor,
Miss Ayano heard a suspicious noise coming from the balcony.
It was a setup.
It was all staged so that Miss Ayano would think that the murderer was hiding on the balcony.
that the murderer was hiding on the balcony, she got scared and left in a hurry.
What kind of device?
The noise was made by an appliance.
A toaster.
There was a toaster in the kitchen of the victim's apartment, wasn't there?
Slices of bread were put in it,
covered it with something like a tray.
and set the timer.
When Ms. Ayano came in,
the toaster popped the bread, which caused the tray to fall on the floor.
and caused the noise she felt.
I know this because there were bread crumbs
on the air conditioner.
This can only mean that someone in the Mifuyu has also killed him.
There is only one person
who could have made these preparations in advance.
Hey, wait.
You must not be implying that...?
What are these numbers under today's date?
These aren't the numbers that...?
Paris.
Two, new, three.
(Takagi) "Do they tell you anything, these three numbers?"
My dream of many years ago is to open a pastry shop in Paris.
Paris... two, nine, three.
(Takagi) Shit!
You tricked us!
Ha-ha-ha... Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Today is the first day of my new life!
Eh?
I wouldn't be so sure.
I figured it would be here.
The numbers 2, 9, 3 written on a note on the wastepaper basket in your apartment
are the number of the flight you have to take to Paris, right?

I knew I would find her alive,
Mifuyu Morita.
Who is it, this one?
You must have me confused with someone else, king.
Ah, Kogoro.
The Mifuyu is here.
In the cafeteria in the main lobby of the France fair.
Yes, connoisseurs.
I'm sorry, but I have to go, it's time.
I don't have time to chat.
Ouch!
That's too bad!
It hurts because you have the wound you had to make yourself.
In order to spread your blood on the ground
and dirty the knife and your shoes.
I was already surprised at first,
because I noticed that there was too little blood,
because she had been stabbed in the chest.
After Ms. Ayano had left in a hurry, you went to Mr. Ayano's house,
you went to Mr. Tabata's house,
you left his shoes stained with blood
and the suitcase containing one of his hair,
killed Mr. Tabata and made it look like he had committed suicide.
It was you, wasn't it?
But... but what the hell...?
May I know who you are?
Conan Edogawa, a detective.
It doesn't matter.
I had nothing to do with it, me.
Stop, Mifuyu Morita.
Metropolitan Police.
Mifuyu!
So you're alive!
We've searched Mr. Tabata's house from top to bottom.
His bank book is missing.
We called the bank
and confirmed the withdrawal of 10 million yen from his account.
Miss Morita... You stole it, didn't you?
No, I didn't!
The 10 million yen has always been mine.
All I did was to get my money back.
Was it you who killed Mr. Tabata?
Tabata was a bad man.
He tricked me from the beginning to steal my money.
That's why...
I will travel to Paris myself first
and I'll look for the ideal place to open the pastry shop, okay?
I'll come as soon as I can.
I'll come as soon as I can.
I don't know if I believe it.
I hope you don't intend to go into business with another woman!
Come on, don't be silly!
If it's true,
I want you to promise me in writing that you'll meet me as soon as you can.
So that I won't distrust you...
Yes, as you wish.
I'll do whatever it takes to put your mind at ease.
I was so enraged that I decided that, this time,
I would cheat her and steal everything she had.
In the end, it was money I had made by swindling other women.
What a pity, I was looking forward to a life of luxury in Paris!
Mifuyu... How could you use me?
I thought we were friends...
What?
Don't be so silly and wake up at once!
I used you, you say?
Yes, I have!
I've used you!
But you should also know that I had to kill him because of you!
What? I'm not that stupid, you know?
I'm not such an idiot, you know?
Deep down I already suspected it,
that he wanted to swindle me and steal my savings.
But if in the end he had managed to run off with my money
and vanished from under my nose,
I would have been just a poor, innocent victim.
If you had not come to inform on him?
Since you're going to rat him out and confirm my suspicions,
I was forced to take revenge!
Please, Miss!
I had to kill her because of you!
You have to know that she's dead because of you!
Enough of this!
If you hadn't told me "Mifuyu, he's cheating you"!
You were proud because I couldn't cheat you, weren't you?
Please be quiet!
Miss Morita, you are the only one responsible...
for the idea of taking revenge on Mr. Tabata
and for the execution of the murder, you and no one else.
Don't look for more culprits!

The truth is that they are terrifying, women.
Even the pretty ones are capable of anything.
- (guts: they snore) - Oops!

Come to think of it, didn't we go out to eat?
Yes, we'll try to nibble a little something on the side...
(Woman) Mr. Mouri!
Mmm...
Excuse me, you're the famous detective Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?
-Oooh!
How fortunate!
-Yes, that's me.
We're big fans of your work!
We'd love to hear anecdotes from you!
He-hey!
Sure, how about we go out to dinner somewhere and talk about it?
-Are you sure you're doing well?
-That's great!
Oh, sure it is!
Just now we were saying that we're going to have dinner at a French restaurant.
And, to celebrate, he'll order a bottle of champagne!
What, Kogoro?
You've already forgotten about me?
So, is it true that you've found out?
Do you already know who tried to kill me?
Ahem... Evidently, I've figured it out.
There is no impossible mystery for me, in Kogoro Mouri.
I promise you that right now I will reveal the only truth.
