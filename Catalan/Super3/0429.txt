An inexhaustible drive to aspire to be the best!
His girlfriend leaves home because of a petty quarrel,
and the place where they met is the scene of a tragic reunion.
He looks like a kid, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

Well?
Can you tell when the boy is coming?
He said he'll come home, after changing his clothes.
Eh?
Who is he?
Yes, remember I told you?
A new student at the school told me that day
he wanted to come home for a visit.
Come on, Ran.
Let's not waste any time.
Let's get going!
Yes..., right away.
(Thinking) "A new student?"
Ah, that's right.
Now I remember.
When I spoke to you, you had already fallen asleep.
Oh, really?
Tell me, how come that kid has to come home?
What's that?
Why do you ask?
Mite'ls him, this little boy thinks you have a new boyfriend...
and he's getting jealous by the minute.
Sonoko, what a thing to say.
It's not true!
Then what is it?
That you plan to go with this story to Shinichi?
"In Shinichi it's me, but wow..."
Too bad, kid! What?
He's not coming home to see me.
Hey, Ran..., you're back early today.
I'm sorry to ask you just to come home,
but can you make me a cup of coffee?
If you don't make it yourself,
my brain cells seem to refuse to wake up,
and I have no strength to work.
Father, who are you imitating? Mr. Mouri..., who is well?
What is it?
Don't smoke...!
What a surprise!
Only the crazy goat from the good house has come?
What's he saying?
Crazy goat?
Hey!
If you ask for the other person, he'll come later!
Does this mean he's coming to see Mr. Kogoro?
Yes!
That's right!
He says he admires the father very much!
Are you calmer now, glasses struçot?
"Sonoko, this one's on me...!"
"Was that it? A great admirer of Mr. Kogoro?"
A POINT OF NO RETURN, (FIRST PART)
What a mug,
I shouldn't have gone to all that trouble
to make the welcome paper.
(Sonoko) But, listen...
What's the point of being cocky
for an ordinary high school student?
A student...?
A boy?!
(Sonoko) Wait a minute.
Wasn't she a high school student
who looked a lot like the hostess Reina Mizunashi?
"Eh...? Queen Mizunashi?"
Father!
I told you quite clearly, that she was a high school student!
If you were always the same:
that if this person gets embargoed, that if this person gets it...
Well, it is not necessary for him to receive it!
He must not see!
(They call)
Ah!
It has already arrived! Yes.
Come in!
Mr. Kogoro!
For... excuse me.
I tripped over something.
Uh...?
Detective Mouri, nice to meet you!
It's an honor to see you in person!
Eh?
Of it... Uh... This is Conan, he lives at home with us.
Let's see...
Eh?
Ah... Is it true?
I've already told you..., have you heard?
He lives at home with us.
It's the glasses' estruçot!
-He's got the glasses! Ah, thank you, girl.
That's my father over there.
Excuse me, please...
Detective Mouri, nice to meet you!
I introduce myself, my name is Eisuke Hondo!
Hello.
I hope we understand each other.
Aaaah!
AAAA, what a pain!
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
(At the same time) No!
Ouch!
AAAA!
"Where did this sucker come from?"
Daughter, now I'm beginning to understand....
what you meant by "that person".
Ah, it's just that as you can see, he's a bit of a dummy.
I'm no fool, I was just born starry-eyed!
If I drop a piece of toast,
the side with the butter and jam on it will always fall on the floor.
If I go camping,

I am the first one to be bitten by mosquitoes.
If I take a group photo,
for some reason I always come out with my eyes closed.
The only explanation I can think of is that God hates me!
If you were a girl, this bad luck would still make you attractive.
That's why I was looking forward to meeting Detective Mouri!
Eh?
Why is that?
If I may, I want you to share the good luck you have with me!
Good luck?
You know what I mean!
To be able to solve cases while you are asleep is very lucky!
I am sure that in those moments, the hand of God comes down to touch you!
"The hand of God? It's ringing..."
Hey, Hondo...
It's true that the father is called "Sleeping Kogoro."
but all he does is to keep his eyes lowered
and reveal the truth;
he's not really asleep.
But Detective Mouri usually avoids answering interviews after a case.
after a case with comments like "I don't remember
with comments like "I don't remember anything" or "Ask the police", right?
(He thinks) "Come to think of it, it happens to me too."
He only says that because he is a very shy man!
He remembers everything... Isn't that right, father?
Yes..., of course I remember.
Please show me how he plays "Sleeping Kogoro", please!
-I beg you! -I'd like to, but...
"This boy is a danger in another sense."
(Door: knock)
(Man) Uh, excuse me.
Is this the Kogoro Mouri Detective Agency?
Ah, yes. Eh?
Ah! (Doorbell rings)
Ah! (Doorbell rings)
(Man) What?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
You touched my chest!
How can you touch me?
You've come to take him on a case?
Uh..., well... yes...
Detective Mouri!
Looks like he's got a case for you...!
Hurray!
Hurray!
It's coming back.
Ja is coming back.
"Again?"
Aaah!
My nose!
Oh!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
You were born starry-eyed!
Please, don't pay any attention.
Ah, you guys...
(Half laugh)
Ah!
Then you want me to find your girlfriend, who has disappeared.
Yes, we live together,
but this morning, when I woke up, I saw that she was gone.
The reason she's gone,
probably because we had an argument last night.
If you don't mind, can you explain to me why you argued?
Yes, of course.
Marrecs!
Spread the fog!
Ah.
Relax, I don't mind!
It was a normal and ordinary discussion...
Mmmm... I understand what you mean... Go on.
Yes...
I've been too busy lately
and I haven't been able to spend much time with her.
This was the trigger for our discussion,
but after we said everything we wanted to say to each other...
You have changed so much!
And I'm still the same as I always was!
Woman, we can't go back to where we started...
and be as we were when we first met...!
After I made this comment to her,
she kept quiet and went to sleep.
And when I woke up in the morning, she disappeared along with the car,
she disappeared along with the car.
Well, yes, these happen every day....
The chances of a case are 0%.
She just left her house?
But, look, if you wait 2 or 3 days, she will surely come home!
I can't wait that long!
I left in my car the documents
that I have to deliver to my company tomorrow, without fail!
So I need to find her today at all costs!
Do you understand?
Naturally, finding her also worries me.
All right, okay, I have understood the situation, but we have few clues.
Did your girlfriend know
that you had those important company papers in the car?
Yes.
So, it could very well be...
she just wanted to play a trick on you.
Huh?
A trick?
Yes!
I think she wants to reprimand you,
and she wants you to go look for her
to the place where they played goose in the old days.
Goose, where did you get that from?
That I don't remember?
This gentleman earlier said something about not returning to the starting point.
Where were they before.
Wasn't he talking about the goose game?
When I was playing goose with Ran the other day,
I fell to the point of no return!
Ran!
Is it possible for you to play goose with this repellent struçot?
It's from the television game "Budori Street!"
Conan is very good at it.
He-he-he-he-he!
Boy, you're such a pacifier!

The starting point that this gentleman was talking about,
was that they couldn't go back
the same as they were at the beginning, when they first met.
Sonoko, he may be right.
Couldn't it be that his wife was
the place where they first met?
Yes, yes.
After a fight,
if she wanted to make him sweat it out and make sure he'd find her,
that would be the perfect place!
-Well, Mr. Misumi, tell me.
Where did you meet the first time?
At a... Gunma ski resort.
Aaatxim!
Then I said not to come, you fool!
Eisuke, are you all right?
See?
In situations like this, I'm always the first to get constipated.
He-he-he-he-he...
Snowing so hard,
it's a good thing Sonoko didn't want to come after all.
Gunma Station?
I'm sure it's just snow, snow and more snow now.
Excuse me, Ran, do you mind if I don't come with you?
(Thinking) "You got it right."
Atxim!
Hey, don't give it to Ran!
I'm fine.
With Conan's warmth, I'm not cold.
"You too."
Explain,
Did you really meet in a place like this...
in the middle of the snowy mountains?
Yes...
She came to the mountain slopes by car with 3 friends,
"But when they were taking a shortcut down a forest track,
"the engine stopped and they got hung up."
Hey.
What happened to you?
We have a car breakdown and we don't know what to do.
And we don't see any cars coming by to help us either.
Good to see you!
The place where we find ourselves is the forest track
that we will find right in front of us.
Oh!
Look!
On the other side of that tree!
That's my car!
Case closed, I guess.
Oh!
Ami...?
Ami...?
Answer me, Ami!
You can't die!
(Kogoro) Hey!
What's wrong?
I'll go check!
No, wait!
"The spaces between the doors...
"are well sealed with duct tape."
"There's a coal stove in the passenger seat."
"A suicide?"
Where's the key?
Don't you have a spare key?
Yes, I do!
Damn it!
It's all taped up and I can't open it!
We'll have to call the police and open it with whatever tools they have!
-Stand aside, sisplau. -Eh...?
Yes...
Where did you get this pair?
Always the duke the hood of the car to play baseball from time to time.
Ami!
I'll get you out of here!
Ami!
(thumps)
Ami!
Ami!
Remove the tape from the car door at once!
Don't waste time!
Yes!
But it's too stuck, I won't be able to get it all off.
Ah, it's true!
Here inside I had one of the...
Very good, very good.
Ami, you must resist!
Ami?
Ami!
By the look of her, she must be dead by now.
No, please...
Ami!
Ami!
Ami!
Ami, please!
We'll have to call an ambulance and we'll call the Gunma police.
Ah, I called them a while ago.
I was told that an officer...
who forms a great team with Detective Mouri is on his way!
Wait, don't tell me it's....
(Man: sneezes loudly)
(Thinks) "I knew it, it was him!"
Aaaaaaaaatxum!
Who told you that you and I are a team, eh?
Mr. Mouri, why do you take it that way?
If all the times we have worked together
we have had a 100% success rate!
Did you feel me?
100%!
And then?
Tell me, like all the other cases?
Well, I... you see...
"This means that all the others have not solved them."
Well, let's stop with the complicated stuff and start investigating!
Today will be a great day, I will surely record the Sleeping Kogoro!
Unfortunately, this won't be possible.
Eh?
Look-okay!
It's the car where this woman died.
The doors are sealed on the inside of the vehicle
with duct tape.
Then, there's a portable charcoal stove made of mud...
with burnt remnants of solid fuel.
The woman, we pulled her out of the car...
after smashing the windshield with a metal bat,
otherwise it would have been impossible for us to access the vehicle.
This is carbon dioxide poisoning due to the combustion of the solid fuel.
produced due to the combustion of the solid fuel.

inside a hermetically sealed car.
There is no doubt that she has committed suicide.
-What? -What?
(At the same time) So, we won't be able to see the "Sleeping Kogoro" today?
Mm?
May I know who this young man is?
Ah, he's a fan of mine.
He came with us.
He's a high school student.
An admirer of Mr. Mouri?
Yes, sir!
Nice to meet you!
My name is Eisuke Hondo!
This is the first time I've ever seen a police investigator
and I'm very excited!
Oh, I am Investigator Yamamura from the Police Department.
From today, you can call me Yama, if you want.
-Aaaaatxim! -Aaaaatxim!
"You make an ideal team."
-Mr. Yamamura! -Yes?
We found a sleeping pill
the coffee can that was on the floor of the car...
-A sleeping pill. -I get it!
Surely he wanted to make sure he would achieve his goal,
and took it just in case.
Very good thinking!
But then... Eh?
The woman was supposed to move the seat a lot, when she was asleep.
Eh?
But if she was sitting in a correct posture
the driver's seat!
But I saw it before.
On the bottom of the jacket, at the level of the hip,
there were deep wrinkles.
"If she wanted to sit in a good posture,
"Surely he would have been bothered by that
"And he would have straightened it out right away."
"So, that wrinkle had been made while she was sleeping, right?"
Yes, that's most likely....
And the same goes for the passenger seat.
Eh?
Ran, come with me, sisplau.
Yeah, okay.
Get over to the side of the car
and pretend you're in the seat with your hands on the wheel.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Like this?
See?
The woman was supposed to be in the same position as Ran is now,
but the seat was too far back for her to reach.
Surely, she must have done it...
because she was in the habit of moving around a lot when she was asleep
and threw the seat back before going to sleep.
That's true.
The seat is too far back
because that woman could drive the car...
No..., no.
Surely she had to pull the seat back
so she could put the stove at her feet.
Of course she did!
She put it at her feet,
but then he put it on the passenger seat
because it was too hot!
By the way, may I know who you are?
Ah, yes, sir.
My name is Atsushi Misumi,
I was dating the woman who committed suicide inside the car.
Ah, my condolences...
Tell us, did she move around too much in her sleep?
Yes... Yes.
It's true, she moved a lot.
I can see that... So, it's clear that it's a suicide.
Unfortunately, I suppose so.
"No..."
"This is a very carefully planned murder...
"To make it look like a suicide."
"And, what's more, surely, the murderer is that man."
"But I don't understand."
"How did he seal the car?"
"The car was well sealed from the inside with duct tape."
"And what kind of set-up... did he do after he put her to sleep?"
Oh!
That concentrated posture of hers is really inimitable!
It's the Sleeping Kogoro!
"Wait a second, that duct tape...!"
But doesn't that surprise you at all? Eh, what?
On the other side of Mr. Mouri!
Ah!
You mean on Conan?
And the next Conan: "A point of no return, (part two)"
