How nice!
-We are here!
Ooooh!
Ooooh!
How brilliant!
-Ooooh!
-It's on Nobunaga Oda!
"The year 2017 marks the 450th anniversary
"Of the triumphant entry of General Nobunaga Oda,
of the Sengoku period, at Gifu Castle."
"In addition to visiting the city,
"We took the opportunity to attend some of the commemorative events
that are taking place."
It was very interesting, wasn't it, Conan?
Yes, it sure was.
Wow, I didn't know you like this kind of thing.
There are a lot of girls lately who are interested in history.
For history in general and also for the Sengoku period.
Well, to tell you the truth, I couldn't tell you that,
but I found it very interesting.
-Yes, yes!
-Come on, let's continue the visit.
(They laugh)
"The curtain rises and the main character appears."
"He solves the mysteries by doing a beautiful dance."
"A case casts a shadow over the new heroes of Gifu,
the Nobuna Gaizers."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The Nobunaga Affair, 450th anniversary."
This is where we'll be sleeping tonight.
Welcome.
Hello, thank you very much!
Oh!
Tobayama!
Ah!
Hello, Agasa!
Guys, Mr. Tobayama is a friend of mine for many years.
He is the one who invited us to come.
He is a master cormorant fisherman.
Hello, guys.
You're the Junior Detective League, right?
Nice to meet you!
Wow!
What a lively bunch.
Hehehehe!
Wow!
How nice!
-Great!
Look, it's in Tobayama!
Mr. Tobayama!
Let's see... and now where "ikomaika"?
This is the Gifu dialect!
"Ikomaika" cannot be used as a question.
It actually means "let's go to a place".
As usual, you know everything, don't you, Mr. Detective?
Pretty much.
Gee, guys, I'm already starving.
What a ?!
Genta, but you just recently ate 3 plates of Hida beef!
Oh, did you?
Hehehehe!
Hahahaha!
By the way, there's a place I'd really like to go, doctor.
Hm?
Nobunaga triumphantly entered the castle
four hundred... fifty years ago!
And this year commemorates this feat!
May justice and friendship reign in this land!
We bring you courage and effort!
And also, love and joy!
We are the origami squadron.
The Nobuna Gaizers!
Long live!
-Long live!
-Long live!
-Great!
That's great!
The Nobuna Gaizers!
-Very good!
-Bravo!
Ah!
A superhero show.
The... Nobu... Noza?
What's their name?
Nobuna Gaizers.
I guess they're a bit inspired by Nobunaga Oda.
They are amazing!
You think so too?
I actually wanted to come for that.
-Great!
-Snort!
Mitsuhiko, did you do it all by yourself, this album?
Yes.
I like to collect information from the local heroes,
I do it whenever I travel to some other prefecture.
and I also look them up on the Internet.
It's a huge collection.
With so many heroes, Earth must be a super safe place.
Eh?
(Mitsuhiko) They're amazing!
- (Ayumi) How cool!
- (Genta) Wow, it's amazing!
Viiiisca!
(Ayumi) Yeah!
(Ayumi) Oh!
Nobuna Gaizers!
(Shouts of enthusiasm)
This is their most famous move, the triple tower Gaiza!
(Ayumi) -Genials!
-They're awesome!
Hehe!
- (Ayumi) Me too.
- (Mitsuhiko) Let me help you.
(Genta) I want to help too.
(Mitsuhiko) Thank you.
The Nobuna Gaizers have a gift for you.
Get in line.
-Please take it before you go.
- (boy) Thank you!
- (woman) You have.
-Ooh!
-(woman) Thank you!
(woman) -Oh!
-Haha!
(woman) Ooh!
-Oh, what a pretty piece of paper.
-Here, for you.

It's Japanese Mino paper, isn't it?
Eh?
I'm surprised you know him.
It's just that... before I came to see the performance,
I looked at the places where you had performed.
Ah!
Oh, gee!
I'm glad to hear it.
If it weren't for people like you, we wouldn't exist!
Thank you! Thank you!
Eeh...
No, thank you very much!
I'm thrilled.
Thank you so much!
Thank you all!
See you guys!
-Bye!
-Goodbye!
Wow, I've never seen Mitsuhiko so excited before.
-All right, guys!
-Here we are!
-It went well!
-It went very well!
-We're done!
-All right.
Yes!
Congratulations, guys!
Ah...
Ah...
Ah...
We have to meet to prepare for tomorrow's performance.
So if you can, come to my office.
(All) Understood!
It's against the rules to spy on the heroes' faces, Conan.
(All) You're right.
Come on, guys, back to the hotel.
SIII!
I'm so full, I've eaten so much.
Yeah, me too.
Yes?
Look, I could keep on eating.
Doctor, before we get to the hotel, could we stop to shop?
I'd like...
a meat loaf, a few sandwiches,
French fries and a juice.
All right, you guys.
Hey, Genta, I think you eat too much.
Aah!
What's the matter, Mitsuhiko?
I wanted to ask them to sign my album and I got careless!
I can't believe it!
But listen, Mitsuhiko, are you really going to give up so easily?
-Yes, I do.
Of course I do!
-Come on, we'll wait for you.
But then we have to go shopping for food, eh?
- (Agasa) Be careful!
-(Agasa) Thank you!
Yes!
Excuse me...
The members of the Nobuna Gaizers are...?
Aaaah!
(Genta) Mitsuhiko is taking too long.
I'm about to starve to death!
It's so quiet.
- (cell phone)
-Try calling him.
- (mobile)
(mobile) -Look!
It's from Mitsuhiko!
What happened?
It can't be!
(Mobile)
You still haven't found her?
It's been two hours already.
I've alerted my fellow fishermen.
If they see or feel anything, they will let us know immediately.
-Have you notified the police?
-Thank you very much.
The Agasa has taken advantage of Kogoro's influence because they are looking for him.
I don't think it will take long.
(Car: siren)
Eh?
Eh?
Caram.
You look... familiar.
-Yeah, sure.
So do I.
-Yes! -Yes!
Now I remember!
We met on the Onizawa Village case.
It's Inspector Matsushiro, isn't it?
Eh... By the way, isn't he with you, Mr. Mouri?
No, he's not here.
But we're here with Dr. Agasa.
Ah, Dr. Agasa.
I've heard about you.
You've also solved some complicated cases, haven't you?
They say you're as good at deductions as Mr. Mouri.
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
I'm the one doing the work on both cases.
They'll feel you.
Can you explain to me how it all went?
We still don't know where Mitsuhiko is.
Also...
The Nobuna Gaizers have also disappeared?
But what happened?
We wanted to talk to them in case they knew anything,
but we've been unable to get in touch.
It's all becoming disturbing.
You're right.
- (two gunshots)
- (alarm)
(alarm continues)
(Man) OK.
The stolen objects...
are a solid gold statuette of Nobunaga and the gold plate,
as well as ancient documents of great historical value.
They are all part of the precious treasure of Gifu.
We'd better hurry or they'll soon have it all sold on the black market.
Or exported abroad.
-That's looking worse and worse.
-Really?
Hahaha!
Hm?
About that...
Could you show us the security camera footage?
Sure!
Wow!
But if it isn't...
(Ayumi) The Nobuna Gaizers.
I don't believe it.
Hm?
Eh?
(Ayumi) What?
(Ayumi) What?
It can't be.
Hard to believe, heroes committing a robbery?
(Ayumi) What bad guys!
They won't get away with it!
Hm?
(Matsushiro) What... what are you saying...?
That you've found the Nobuna Gaizers' vehicle?
(Matsushiro) Oh!
(Ayumi) What's this?
- (Ayumi) Can it be Mitsuhiko's?
- (Genta) It's Nobunaga's insignia!
You mean he's climbed into this van?
-(Ayumi) What?!

-Maybe they're holding him hostage.
Yes, I've noticed.
Look.
Hm.
Also, look at the wheels.
You think it's...?
I'm sure, this is asphalt tar.
(Man) "The Nobuna Gaizers, the popular local heroes,
"known for cleaning up the city and also for helping the elderly,
are wanted as suspects in a robbery case."
"Its 5 members, on the run from justice, are believed to be holding hostage a young boy,
"are believed to be holding an elementary school child hostage."
It's my fault, because of what I told him.
But, listen, Mitsuhiko, do you really think you'll give up so easily?
-Yes.
Of course I do!
-Come on, we'll wait for you.
But then we have to go shopping for food, eh?
- (Agasa) Be careful!
-(Agasa) Thank you!
Yes!
Well, I'm guilty too.
-Neither am I.
-I didn't stop him either.
No, neither did I.
Heroes, and what else?!
They're a bunch of heavies.
Hehehe!
By the way, the red Nobuna Gaiza was left-handed, right?
Yes, but the one of the robbery was right-handed.
Besides, when they made their characteristic position....
Blue and Green were upside down.
What do you mean by this?
-... they're impostors?
-Can it be that... -Yes, exactly.
Yes, exactly.
Eh?
Eh?
Eh?
Hey, are you the Nobuna Gaizers?
Xsst!
(Pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip, pip)
Hello.
It's all set up.
We'll take care of everything.
The impostors kidnapped the real Nobuna Gaizers,
took their clothes and committed the robbery.
-But, who could have done it?
-You bunch of bastards!
You already suspect who the culprit is, don't you?
Would you like to confirm it?
Yes.
Doctor, call Inspector Matsushiro.
Eh?
That's it.
Everything went very well.
Haha!
-Eh?
- (Ai) What went well?
Could it be your evil plan?
Yes, you set a trap for the Nobuna Gaizers.
and arranged everything to make it look like they were the thieves.
-But-but... can you tell who you are?
-Am I right, Mr. Kimifusa Oyabu?
-Where are you in Mitsuhiko?
-The Junior Detective League!
I... I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know anything.
It's useless, don't pretend.
We have proof.
Proof?
The red Nobuna Gaiza is left-handed.
And when they made the figure, Blue and Green were interchanged.
If you wanted them to be impersonated,
you should have studied them better.
Well, maybe they are in the wrong position.
Besides, there is another proof.
A proof that is conclusive.
Your ring!
That's right.
It should have been taken off.
Heroes don't wear these things.
Besides, he hit a watchman.
And when he did, his glove was torn.
I'm sure it matches the victim's wound.
After Dr. Agasa's call, I confirmed it again.
It's true, the glove on the dress is torn.
We will have to proceed to analyze the ring thoroughly.
I had no choice.
The company was not doing well,
the collectors of the loan shark who lent me money threatened me and...
So the other imposters were from the loan company?
Yes, that's right.
I did it because they forced me to help them.
Dr. Agasa, I'm impressed!
Well, I don't think it's that big of a deal either.
Hahaha!
It's not all settled yet.
And in Mitsuhiko?
Where are the real Nobuna Gaizers?
-I don't... I don't know, where are they?
-Where are they?
I was told that they would take care of the rest.
It's the truth!
What, Conan?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What the... Oysters!
We must hurry or they'll kill him along with the heroes,
surely they won't want to leave any evidence!
-Emergency investigation!
-What?!
(Pip, pip, pip)
(Pip, pip) Fire!
(Pip, pip) Fire!
We won't get out!
-I don't want to die!
I don't want to!
-We are lost!
We must not give up!
The fans of the Nobuna Gaizers are waiting for you!
Hey, Conan.
Now what should we do?
I'm sure, this is asphalt tar.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Can you tell me where you've been working this morning?
-That's it!
-A little more, it won't be long now.
Ah! (knocking)
(knocking)
- (woman) Help!
- (Mitsuhiko) Hey!
Anybody here?
-Something.
-What do we do now?
-We can use the papers!
-Up there!

This morning the areas that have been asphalted have been....
-They are in opposite directions.
-These: there and there.
(Ayumi) What should it be, in Mitsuhiko?
What's that?
Aah!
AAAI!
-We won't fall, don't suffer!
-Be calm.
-Come on, hold on!
-You have to trust us!
-Yes!
-Mitsuhiko!
Hang in there, Mitsuhiko!
-What shall we do now?
-Oh, boy, we're out of paper!
My album!
Take the pages of my album!
But it's a very important album for you.
Heroes are there to help in times like this!
It is here!
They must be very close.
This leaf... it's from Mitsuhiko!
- Mitsuhiko!
-It came from over there!
(Mitsuhiko!
Conan, over there!
The door is locked!
(children) Okay!
He's come to save us.
I'm so happy.
I've been so scared!
Very scared!
Hahahahaha!
Hahahaha!

Thank you, Mitsuhiko.
You really are our hero.
Thank you!
It's a great honor.
Thank you very much.
The remaining impostors have been stopped
and all the treasures of Gifu have been recovered.
And the good name of the local heroes, the Nobuna Gaizers, has been restored.
Very good, Mitsuhiko!
You are the pride of the Junior Detective League.
Why doesn't the Junior Detective League also wear a special costume?
Heroes appear!
Aah!
Me too.
I'll pass.
-Well, I'll be damned...
-No way.
We are the local heroes, the Nobuna Gaizers!
Plus one!
"...the coded message
left on Koji Haneda 17 years ago before he died."
"An odd couple?"
Because in that notebook,
the stranger had clearly written the word "nue"!
Does this mean that the Nue lives in this forest?
Is it the huge, creepy monster that comes out in traditional legends?
Oh!
"Don't miss the next episode:
'In Conan, in Heiji and the Legend of the Nue (The Scream)'."
