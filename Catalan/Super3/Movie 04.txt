(Children: exclamations of emotion)
(Children: call out)
Look at this!
Look at this!
There are dinosaurs!
(Children:) Eh?
Apa!
It always disappears suddenly.
Ah!
There, I'm sure you were very thirsty.
Thank you, thank you.
Oops, no!
Three minutes to go!
Eh?
Wait, wait!
Shinichi!
That's right!
We're on time! What is this place?
It's just a normal square.
Wait and see.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...,
...4, 3, 2, 1!
What's that?
That's nice!
Oooh!
Here, the water in the fountains comes out every hour.
You like this kind of thing, don't you?
Shinichi!
This is your gift
for winning the karate championship.
Accept it... gladly!
Why are you talking like this?
He-he-he-he-he-he-he...!
Ah!
A rainbow!
Au, we make a toast!
How funny!
(They laugh)
DETECTIVE CONAN
"Caught in her eyes"
"I'm Shinichi Kudo, a juvenile detective."
"I went to an amusement park with the Ran.
"my childhood friend,
"And there I saw some suspicious men dressed in black
"Making a transaction."
"I was so intent on how they were doing the transaction,
"that I didn't see another man approaching me from behind."
"That man made me take something and when I woke up..."
"My body had become small!"
"If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive...
"They'd surely show up again to make an attempt on me.
"And the people around me would be in danger."
"As Dr. Agasa recommended,
"I hid my identity,
"But when the Ran asked me to do so, it suddenly came to my mind...
"Conan Edogawa."
"In order to find out more about them,
"I went to Ran's house,
"Because his father is a private detective."
Mr. Mouri, what was the key to your great deduction?
Eh?
To tell you the truth, I don't remember much.
(laughing shockingly)
"No, I'm not surprised either."
"Because I always use an anesthesia dart shooter.
"In the form of a clock to put Mr. Kogoro to sleep.
"And then I use my voice transformer
"To solve cases with Mr. Kogoro's voice."
"These two great inventions are the work of Dr. Agasa."
Pleased to meet you!
"Apart from these two, he has devised a skateboard equipped with a motor.
"radar goggles to track suspects...
"and sneakers that do super-powered kicks."
"And, in fact, he continues to come up with unique inventions."
"However, neither the Ran nor Mr. Mouri...
"Know my true identity."
"Who knows it are Dr. Agasa and Heiji Hattori.
"The juvenile detective of the west."
"And also Ai Haibara, a classmate from school."
"She had been part of the Men in Black Organization," he said,
"But, when she was trying to run away,
"She took the same substance that they gave to me
"And her body became small!"
"Even now, the identity of that organization...
"Remains a mystery."
"And now, a very wide wall of unreachable height...
"Is about to rise between me and the Ran."
Perhaps I have been dwarfed,
but I have the brain of a detective and for me nothing is a mystery!
There is only one truth!
(Shinichi voice) A fountain? "Yes, it was beautiful."
"A rainbow appeared, remember?"
Ah, yes, it's true!
(Think) "Come on, why did you have to remember this nonsense?"
Let's go again, to Tropical World.
"What?"
Since that day we haven't gone there again, Sinichi....
"Normal. That was the day I was dwarfed, pretty girl."
"Say, when can we go?"
Well, I...
-Will Conan be at home? -I don't know...
If he's not, we'd be well screwed.
Ran, I'm sorry, but I'm still working on a case,
I'll call you another day.
Good bye, bye!
Ah!
Wait, Shinichi!
Oops!
Cases, cases and more cases!
Coi of stupid cases!
Surely Conan must not know what it's all about!
-I can't wait to see defeat painted on his face.
Wow, at Conan defeated?
I'm sorry!
He won!
What are you laughing at, you bunch of punks?
-Conan! Good thing we found you!
Now we were going straight to your house!

-Between all 3 of us we have prepared an amazing quiz game.
A game?
Are you ready?
We asked Haibara:
"What kind of person do you think Conan is?"
And she, looking at the moon, towards the sky, answers:
"I guess he's like summer."
Let's see, she, number one: did he flatter you?
Or number two: criticized you?
Which is the correct answer?
"I guess it's like summer."
Got it!
The correct answer is number two.
- (at the same time) What? -How did you know?
In Japan, the summer months are June, July and August.
So it means: It's a Pocapena that doesn't do any good.
(Ayumi) It's amazing!
You're as bright as ever.
(Genta) See, this isn't funny anymore.
And now, tell me, why were you laughing, if I may ask?
Will you tell us someday that we beat you?
(Genta) Eh?
-Guys, we have to cross! - (man) Quiet!
You can not cross!
When the green light starts flashing,
it means it's yellow.
Please wait until it turns green again!
(at the same time) Yes.
We've been booed.
(Ayumi) It's common sense.
This gentleman is right.
Now, you must answer my question-answer game.
What do you think is the gentleman's profession?
(Ayumi) Uh... School teacher, maybe?
(Ayumi) He could be a salesman, but he doesn't carry a suitcase.
The owner of an eel restaurant?
The answer is police inspector. (Vez) Eh?
A police officer?
When a police inspector takes notes,
he opens his police notebook vertically
and writes from left to right.
- (at the same time) Eh? -Yes, that's right.
Conan, you're amazing.
You know so much about everything.
Now it's turned green.
Let's cross!
Yes! Yes!
The inspector is on the ground!
That man has shot him!
I won't let him run away! Conan, alert!
(horns honking)
Call for an ambulance! All right, but be careful!
(thinks) "Damn it, he's escaped!"
(Inspector: groans)
Sir, you have to hold on!
Who shot him?
"What do you mean?"
(TV: man) "Today, around 2 o'clock in the afternoon,
"Police sub-inspector Osamu Narasawa was shot
"while on duty at the Beika Park intersection."
"The killer has not yet been apprehended."
"The Metropolitan Headquarters has put reinforcements
"And the investigation base for this case
"has been established at the Beika police station."
I'm sorry to have to repeat this again,
but we'd also like you to tell us
what the murderer looked like.
It was a young man.
No, it was a young and very pretty woman.
You're wrong, it was a middle-aged man.
And what was the umbrella he was carrying?
-It was a black umbrella. -No!
It was green!
It was green!
I think it was blue...
But did you really see it?
And you, Conan, what do you say?
Both the raincoat and the umbrella he was carrying were gray,
but I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman.
He was holding the umbrella with his right hand.
This means that he fired the gun with his left hand.
So the killer is left-handed?
By the way, Inspector,
how can one interpret the fact that Sub-Inspector Narasawa
took the left side of his chest before he died?
We have concluded that he was referring to the police notebook...
that he carried in his jacket pocket.
We are now thoroughly investigating
all the notes he had in the notebook.
Inspector Megre, according to the shell casing found at the scene..,
it has been determined that the pistol used...
was a 9-millimeter automatic.
A 9-millimeter?
That's a normal pistol that could even be used by a woman.
I'm glad you weren't involved in the end.
And neither are you, Conan.
Yes.
"Damn!"
"If the traffic light hadn't turned green,
"The killer wouldn't have gotten away from me!"
(phone ringing) Ah!
(Phone)
(Ring)
Inspector Megre, tell me.
Hello, Mouri.
I'd like to... ask you about the details of the crime
that took place last night.
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.
Call me another time.
Eh?
Hello?
Mr. Inspector?
What happened? He told me he was busy right now.

It is normal that it is... Two police inspectors have died.
But this time he didn't look like the same old inspector.
Shiratori, listen to me carefully.
This case is an absolute secret, it must remain between you and me...
Don't talk to anyone, you feel...
Yes, sir.
"From the marks that have appeared on the bullets,
"it has been determined that the pistol
"used in the murder of the two police inspectors on duty
"Is the same."
"The police are continuing their investigation
"On the premise that all 2 crimes
"could have been committed by the same person."
"And now we continue with the weather forecast."
(Kogoro) Caram, I find it out of place....
Inspector Shiratori's little sister
could have had a little look at herself
and not hold the wedding reception at a delicate time like this.
But it's not her fault.
This room, they booked it a month ago,
and she couldn't have known something like this would happen.
Besides, this is not a wedding reception party,
rather it's a party to celebrate her wedding.
The people who organized it are the friends of the bride and groom.
I know that!
(Sonoko) And what is Mr. Haretsuki, the groom, like?
I understand he's a painter.
Yes, a painter without fame or fortune.
A painter without fame and fortune...
I guess I can't expect much from his friends either.
You still have the same clumsy handwriting as always.
Mother!
You've been invited too?
Yes.
The reason is that Sara is a young lawyer.
Blow!
She has beautiful penmanship!
"Look at that! They're married and sign separately."
Here, that's it.
Here, number 89.
Come on, Conan.
Yes.
(people: voices murmur)
Come on, let's go!
A crowd has come!
Look!
Mr. Inspector has also come!
Here one can tell who is a policeman by a simple glance!
Everyone has a cloudy look
and there is a pessimistic and morose atmosphere.
It is not strange.
They must not be around for many parties because of all this that has happened.
But Inspector Sato always looks cheerful.
Have you seen?
It hides all the flaws.
No!
You don't have any!
This dress really suits you.
Oh!
It's Mr. Odagiri!
Excuse me, I'll go say hello.
Who is he?
It's Police Superintendent Odagiri.
He used to be the chief inspector
of the Criminal Investigation Department,
and if I remember correctly, he is now a police sergeant.
"Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to keep you waiting."
"May we present the bride and groom."
"Please welcome them with a round of applause."
(People: applause)
They make a good couple!
Kotaro, Sara, congratulations!
Mr. Mouri.
Hello!
I congratulate you!
Thank you very much.
Let me introduce you to someone.
This is Dr. Kazato,
from the psychiatric division of Beika Yakushino Hospital.
I'm Dr. Kazato, pleased to meet you.
I am Mr. Mouri.
This is Eri, my wife and this is Ran, my daughter.
And that's Conan, a parasite who lives with us.
"Stop calling me a parasite."
Gee, you have dealings with a psychiatrist?
(laughs) You know that the executive officers of the police...
sometimes we have a lot of worries.
By the way, Mr. Mouri,
I think you should go see him one day.
You are right.
Lately I don't know what's wrong with my memory.
Just a moment!
What do you mean by that?
Stop it!
You're already a mass of rivers, you little brat!
That's too bad! Excuse me a moment.
Inspector!
Hello, Mouri.
Excuse me, as the investigation?
Excuse me, but I can't talk to you.
Why won't you tell me anything?
Surely, there's something I can't tell you.
Hey, Takagi!
Takagi!
Is what you say true?
No, sir...
Hey... Inspector Takagi, you like Inspector Sato, don't you?
-What? -What? -Gee, that's interesting!
I'll go explain to her personally how you feel about her!
No!
Wait, please!
You win.
Nothing has been told to the media,
but they've also found Inspector Shiba dead
with his police notepad in his hand.
What?!
This means...
(Shiratori) It's useless for me to try to stick my nose any further into this matter.
You don't need to know.
Do you understand what I mean, Mr. Mouri?

"It is not necessary for me to know."
No need to know?
This is ridiculous!
"It is not necessary for me to know."
"A secret code used by police inspectors."
This means...
that the perpetrator of these crimes is someone related to the police force?
Moreover, not related in just any way.
It is a high-ranking police officer or, even more....,
it could be that the entire police force is involved!
So he didn't ask you to marry him formally?
No, because he's a real handyman with these things.
(Eri) It's worth it for men to be like that.
Men who get lost in sweet talk...
are usually untrustworthy.
Aaaaatxum!
Hey, mother, I've always wanted to ask...
What did your father say to you when he asked you to marry him?
Those kind of sweet words
that send chills up and down your spine.
Tell me, please!
What did he say?
If you want me to tell you, I've already forgotten it....
And now!
Don't do comedy.
-Please, I can use it as a reference.
Mother, don't take away my illusion!
Mmm...
"I love you with all my heart."
"More than any other person in the whole world..."
-I think so...- Oooh!
Aaaaaaaaatxim!
(Sonoko: thinks) "It seems unbelievable."
It's wonderful!
"Oh, if Shinichi said something like that to me, I'd die...!"
Your face says it all, beautiful!
I didn't make that face!
Run, go...
Hey, Ran, what's wrong?
Oh, you're red.
No, it's nothing...
(Man) Toshiya?
What the heck are you doing here?
You shouldn't be in this place!
I'm sure no one invited you to this party!
Shut up, old man!
I just came to this hotel for a job!
It's on Toshiya, your son.
I understand he had a rock band...
Hey, superintendent, it's no big deal either.
-Toshiya, benvingut. Go away!
Stop behaving like a stray dog looking for food.
-What did you say? -Toshiya!
Shit.
Sorry for the trouble!
Toshiya!
Wait, wait!
Oysters, oysters, that woman looks familiar.
Sato...
You know what I mean.
I'm sorry, but I don't.
But, Sato...
Don't worry.
Sisplau!
-Number 38, sisplau. -Yes.
(Door: creaks)
Hello, Ran.
Hello, Inspector Sato.
You think it's a strange party, don't you?
There are police everywhere.
Don't think so.
But, Inspector Sato, be very alert, okay?
Why is that?
Because they're shooting a lot of police inspectors lately.
Don't worry, don't worry.
I'm a strong girl.
(Ring)
(People: exclamations of surprise)
A blackout?
What happened? How strange...
I'll go check it out, don't move from here!
Inspector Sato, here's a flashlight.
Can you see it? (CLEC)
(CLEC) Ah!
No, Ran, no!
Inspector Sato!
(CLEC) Ah!
(Crystals: brittle)
(Water: mana)
Inspector Sato...
Inspector Sato, you have to resist!
Just because... I've turned on the flashlight... No!
Noooo!
-Ran! -Sato!
Sato!
Ran, are you okay?
Ran just fainted,
but Inspector Sato is seriously injured.
Sato!
Sato, you must resist!
It's terrible! Megre, an ambulance!
Shiratori, block all entrances and exits to the hotel!
Yes, sir!
We're on the 15th floor of the Beika Sun Plaza Hotel!
A woman has been shot!
Please send an ambulance immediately!
"No bullets?"
"A 9-millimeter automatic?"
"It's the same killer!"
"But..., why that flashlight?"
Hurry up!
Close all exits immediately!
Test for gunpowder on everyone except the children!
The police officers and myself, too!
I want no exceptions!
And naturally, to this fool here too!
"He was still here?"
"But I don't see anywhere that pair from before."
Inspector Megre, how is the Sato?
One of the bullets has lodged very close to the heart.
It looks like she has a 50% chance of being saved.
Inspector, how is the Ran doing?
Fortunately, she has no wounds on her body,
but she's still unconscious...
Her room is over there.

"La Ran will be fine."
"I'm just worried about the flashlight."
"Maybe..."
Shiratori, how is the research progressing?
We've tested for gunpowder all over the world,
but we didn't get anything.
Nothing, you say?
We believe that the killer fled before we locked the doors.
Did you find any prints on the gun? No prints were found.
Chiba, have you determined what mechanism was used in the switch?
Yes, it seems that it was a mechanism that exploded...
when it received a signal from a cell phone.
There's something that doesn't quite add up.
Well, the flashlight that was on the floor of the sink,
I wonder if Sato was carrying it at the beginning.
I don't think so.
Let's see, the cabinet under the sink was open.
I'd say it was in there at first.
And that it had been left on!
What?
You mean... the killer had left it there?
-Of course... When it was light, no one noticed, that it was there...
Therefore, we can be sure...
that this case is also connected with the previous ones.
But... what previous cases are you talking about?
No, head... Why won't you tell me anything?
One more mistake and my daughter would have been shot too!
Mr. Inspector!
-It's terrible!
La Ran! -What happened to her?
She's regained consciousness, but she's behaving strangely!
What? What?
Ran!
Hey, Ran, are you okay?
Kiddo..., who are you?
She can't be...
Not only does she not remember us...
she's even forgotten her name.
This is ridiculous!
I am Kogoro Mouri, your father!
And she's Eri Kisaki, your mother!
I don't know... I don't remember anything at all.
Ran.
Here we are, sir.
Dr. Kazato,
forgive me for asking you to come in on your day off,
but there was no psychiatrist on duty.
Miss, do you know who you are?
Do you remember what happened today?
Please tell me.
No...
What is the capital of the United States?
Washington.
How much is 5 times 8? 40.
Can you take the pen and get it ready to write?
(Kogoro) Memory lapse backwards?
Yes.
It is an abnormality of memory
produced by a sudden illness or injury
and the patient is unable to remember anything that happened.
However, in your daughter's case,
she has seen Inspector Sato being shot.
and I believe that this has given her a great psychological shock.
Will my daughter be able to recover her memories?
At this stage, although I can't tell you anything for sure.
But she will have no problems in leading a normal life,
since her knowledge has not been affected.
Just a moment.
So, she will be able to lead a normal life?
Yes, he can.
But I think she should stay in hospital for a few days
to see how she evolves.
"Even so..."
"I understand that for Ran it's a shock
"That an inspector she knows has been shot in front of her."
"But the cause of this memory loss must be something else!"
"It must be something that has struck at the bottom of her heart."
They have finished operating on Inspector Sato.
They were able to remove the bullet that was lodged in her,
but we still don't know if it can come out.
Really...?
Mr. Inspector!
After all that has happened, even if you refuse to explain anything to me?!
Shiratori!
You know what's going on!
Speak up!
I give you my word, we'll take this murderer.
Damn it!
Hey, Inspector Chiba,
have you looked at the prints on the flashlight
you found in the bathroom, right?
Yes, of course, but we only found Ran's.
We had assumed that it was Sato, who had taken the flashlight,
but, however, in reality, it seems that Ran had taken it.
That's good.
In this case, the Ran is to be blamed...
for the fact that Inspector Sato was shot.
So, this was the cause of the crash?
Is that why Ran has lost her memory?
"Ran..."
Ran, even if you never regain your memory,
you and I will be... we'll be friends forever.
(Cries)
I'll tell you everything.
But, Inspector Megre!
If you do...
So much is all the same.
If I get fired,
I'll open a detective agency like you did in Mouri.
Mr. Inspector...
Takagi, you keep an eye on Sato.

Chiba, take care of Ran.
If there is any news, let me know immediately.
(At the same time) Yes, sir!
Last summer, at Tamotsu Jinn,
a doctor from the First Department of Surgery
of Tohti University Hospital
was found dead in his apartment.
Chief Inspector Tomonari took charge of the investigation.
He belonged to the section
of the First Investigation Division of the Metropolitan Central, like me.
And under him
he had Inspector Narasawa and Inspector Shiba,
the two inspectors who were shot.
Inspector Sato was also, in this group.
"In addition to having consumed a large amount of alcohol,
"He cut his right carotid artery with a surgical scalpel."
He bled to death.
The first person to find him was Miss Tamaki Jinn,
a journalist who lived in a neighboring town.
Mr. Kogoro, it was her!
Yes!
It was the hotel party!
I remember now!
This woman came to see me once!
She what?
She went to your office?
Let's see, say!
And what did she ask you?
Eh, well...
That day, it seems to me that I had a little to drink...
and I don't remember what he talked to me about, no, I don't remember...
Wait a minute, I remember the case of this Mr. Jinn.
A few days before he was found dead,
the family of a patient had denounced you for negligence, right?
That's right!
On his personal computer, he left a suicide note...
in which he apologized for this negligence.
So Chief Inspector Tomonari considered
that everything indicated that Mr. Jinn had committed suicide.
Even so, Miss Tamaki, the younger sister..,
denied that he had taken his own life.
She remarked that Mr. Tamotsu, the older brother,
was a mean doctor, who never thought of his patients;
therefore, he would be incapable of committing suicide...
to apologize for having committed malpractice.
And, furthermore, she said she saw Mr. Tamotsu...
arguing with a young man who wore purple-colored hair
in front of a store;
specifically, a week ago.
"With purple hair?"
Just to make sure,
Inspector Tomonari went to that warehouse
along with Inspectors Sato, Narasawa and Shiba!
"That was a particularly hot day."
"It looks like it was over 35 degrees."
It's... it's closed.
All right, we'll open our eyes wide.
Shiba, you go that way.
It's so hot... Aaah!
Inspector, what's wrong?
It's a heart attack!
Call for an ambulance, hurry!
Yes!
-Don't do it! -What?
Now we're guarding this place!
Calm down.
-But, sir! -Nothing will happen to me!
I'll take a cab and go straight to the hospital!
You guys keep watching all the time!
"But Sato was worried,
"And after a while, when he went to take a look..."
Inspector Tomonari!
"Sato immediately brought Inspector Tomonari
"At Tohti University Hospital."
"All And so, Inspector Tomonari died during the operation."
Inspector Sato is taking her strength.
Yes.
Mi-te!
They're coming!
What the hell!
It's hot as hell today!
Shall we stop them?
Wait, wait, wait!
You don't know who that guy is?
It's Toshiya, the son of Superintendent Toshiya!
"In the end, with the death of Inspector Tomonari and all,
it was concluded
that Mr. Tamotsu's death had been a suicide
and the case was closed.
Miss Tamaki, the younger sister,
was investigating the boy,
but Inspector Shiba told her that she had nothing to do with the case.
Wow, so this was it?
Besides, Inspector Tomonari had a son named Makoto.
Oh!
This man was at the party, wasn't he, Inspector?
Wasn't he?
But he disappeared right away.
What's wrong with this boy?
Yes.
It all happened at the funeral.
Why didn't you call for an ambulance?
If we had called one right away, the father would have been saved!
-Sure! -He told us not to...
You are the ones who killed my father!
I will never forgive you!
There you go, Conan.
Thank you.
Soon after,

both Inspector Narasawa and Inspector Shiba,
were transferred to the department under their jurisdiction.
But Inspector Shiratori noticed that, for some time now, Inspector Sato had been spending hours investigating something,
Inspector Sato was spending hours investigating something after work.
after her workday.
Inspector Narasawa asked Inspector Sato
to recheck the case
that the two of them together with Inspector Shiba handled.
(Shiratori) But it seems that Sato was not aware of the relationship
of the relationship between Toshiya and Mr. Jinn.
Inspector Narasawa was shot shortly after that.
"And Inspector Shiba, almost right after that."
"It was then that we became aware
"That it all had some connection
"to the events that took place a year ago!"
From the blocks of police notes we have,
we have deduced that the murderer is someone connected with the police.
So Inspector Takagi investigates Mr. Makoto Tomonari,
the inspector's son.
And I investigate Toshiya, the son of the police superintendent.
I figured there was a good chance
that the murderer would want to make an attempt on Sato next.
I told her to agree to have someone as a bodyguard,
"But she refused."
I get it.
So that's what you asked the party for?
That's right!
I've got it, Mr. Inspector!
The killer is in Toshiya Odagiri!
Surely, he shot Inspectors Narasawa...
and Shiba and Inspector Sato..,
because he found out they were re-investigating the Jinn case
case that occurred a year ago!
But he didn't shoot Inspector Sato, we have proof.
The gunpowder test was negative, sir.
Ah, that's right...
Our priority is to find Mr. Makoto Tomonari.
We still don't know where he is.
Besides, on the days that Narasawa and Shiba were killed,
he was seen nearby...
And today he was also seen at the party.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, we know that the killer is left-handed.
By the way, Mr. Makoto Tomonari is left-handed!
Very good!
Go stop Mr. Makoto Tomonari!
Yes, sir!
Tell me, Inspector,
in what way was Mr. Jinn's carotid artery severed?
How!
Well, on the right, a diagonal downward cut.
Therefore, if that incident was a homicide,
there's a possibility that the killer was also left-handed, right?
Huh? And how do you know that, eh, brat?
Because... To avoid getting blood splashed on him.
To avoid getting splattered,
he had to be left-handed,
otherwise I wouldn't have been able to cut his right carotid artery.
This is it, isn't it, Conan?
Yes.
Now I understand...
No, however, Mr. Makoto Tomonari...
has no connection whatsoever with Mr. Jinn!
If Mr. Jinn's death really was a homicide,
we would have another left-handed murderer!
In Toshiya is also left-handed.
I've seen her light a match with her left hand.
And there is another one...
Her father, Superintendent Odagiri of the police.
He's also left-handed.
Don't be ridiculous!
It's impossible for him to be a murderer!
Inspector?
I'm Ayumi Yoshida.
They're Genta Kojima,
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya and Ai Haibara.
We are all friends of Conan
and we have come because we were worried about you.
Thank you very much...
But I'm really sorry, I don't remember any of you.
Don't say that!
I can't believe it!
You've played with us so many times!
You don't remember me either?
I'm Hiroshi Agasa!
You know, the cool scientist who lives next to Shinichi Kudo,
your childhood friend and classmate.
Shinichi... Kudo?
Eh... Do you remember Shinichi Kudo?
No, I don't.
Ah, right...
Ah! Haibara, what's wrong?
I thought someone was spying on us.
What was that?
I must have imagined it.
Excuse me, I'm a little tired.
Don't worry and rest easy.
Who's there?
Shit! Conan, what happened?
Mr. Kogoro!
Could it be that the Ran saw the killer's face
when Inspector Sato was shot?
What do you say?
In this case, it's possible that the killer wants to kill Ran!
He was waiting for us.
You can rest assured!
Takagi and Chiba will take turns to keep her well protected!
How does it evolve?
My husband is with her.
Au, let's go!

-Excuse me, Mrs. Kisaki, please tell me.
Listen, Dr. Kazato wants to talk to you about your daughter.
The tests we've done show no abnormalities in her brain.
It seems that your daughter's amnesia has occurred
to avoid a serious nervous breakdown.
Does this mean that if we take her back to the hotel and replay the incident.
and replay the incident, she will be able to recover her memory?
Come on, what are you saying?
We shouldn't make her remember things she doesn't want to remember at all.
-And what do you want?
That the Ran spends her whole life lost in amnesia?
I am against using methods that make her suffer, you feel?
Calm down, calm down, gentlemen.
Forcing her to remember could damage her brain.
-You see? -Mmmmm...
(Phone)
-Excuse me... (ring)
Tell me, this is Kazato.
Yes, understood.
I'll call, then.
"If the Ran has seen the killer's face,
"We have to get his memory back as soon as possible and stop him."
"If not, we'll be in great danger."
"But, as the doctor says, forcing her to remember would be fatal."
"I have no choice but to protect the Ran myself."
Eh?
No one's picking up.
Pardon the interruption.
Doctor, is there a method to get her to regain her memory
in a natural way?
Mmmm... In general, many patients recover their memory suddenly,
when they are in a relaxed environment.
I understand.
When he is discharged from the hospital, I will also come to live in your office.
What do you say?
This way, I can take proper care of Ran,
and I'm sure she'll be able to relax.
Deus joking!
Then it will be me, who will be stressed out in a bad way!
I don't care what happens to you.
All this is for the good of the Ran.
Is that clear?
"Oh, no, I'm annoyed!"
(Kazato) Miss Ran,
please don't overdo it to regain your lost memory.
Yes.
If you see that he regains his memory a little,
please contact me.
Understood.
(Kogoro) This is the city where you have lived for 17 years,
since you were born.
Does it look familiar?
This is your home, Ran.
Mouri Detective Agency...
Wait, you'll get wet.
Oh!
Ah!
Ran, what have you got?
This puddle must be scary.
When Inspector Sato was shot,
there were also puddles of water everywhere.
Stop the car up ahead, please.
Yes, understood.
On the second floor, there is the office.
I'm always solving complicated cases at that desk.
"All he does is drink beer and watch TV."
Here's the living-dining room and there's the kitchen.
And that's your room over there.
This boy's name is Shinichi Kudo.
He's a nice guy who always tries to seduce you.
"Hey, I don't seduce anyone!"
Ah, wow!
You do karate! I do karate?
You won the interinstituts championship!
You don't remember? No...
Oh, well...
But you don't have to worry.
I'm sure I'll get my memory back very soon!
Now you're talking!
Tonight, we'll have dinner together!
We'll make a nice tec to celebrate Ran's discharge!
That's perfect!
I'll cook you something tasty, I haven't done that for a long time!
What's wrong with you two?
What's wrong with both of you?
And... and why did you... did you... did you... did you have to cook?
You don't need to cook dinner for me... I'm not really hungry.
Listen, Conan, you don't need to come with compliments,
I'll try hard
to make you a beef stew that you'll love.
And so much.
"It couldn't get any worse."
-Huh?
King, where are you going now? -Ah...
It's just that... I forgot that today I had promised the neighborhood kids
that I would go play mahjong with them.
How could you even think of going to play mahjong with your daughter in this condition?
with your daughter in this condition?
Or maybe it wasn't this?
That you didn't want to eat what I prepared?
"What a break!"
"La Ran is happier than I expected!"
"Now I know she'll be fine!"
Ran...
What?
My bodyguards?
Inspector Takagi told us
that the killer might try to make an attempt on you.
Hey, Ran, we, the Junior Detective League,
have decided to protect you!
We'll call it:
(At the same time) The Ran Protective League!
"Come on!"
I have carried a water pistol filled with super spicy paprika!

-I've been carrying a boomerang! And I've been carrying handcuffs!
But, kids, they're little boy toys!
Thank you very much, children.
Now I feel calmer.
As a thank you,
I'll buy you a nice cool drink.
Come on up to the house. (Vez) Yes!
Viva!
Although you do not remember anything? No...
Hey, maybe it's much better for you...
that she doesn't remember anything, don't you think?
Then you won't have to worry
that your true identity might come out.
How can you talk like that?!
If I could...
If I could, I'd like to erase my memories too.
The fact that my sister was murdered,
the fact that I was a member of the organization and created a poison...
I would like to forget everything and be the Ai Haibara,
an elementary school student like any other girl.
It would be great.
And I would be with you forever...
Like this, as we are now...
"Haibara, you..."
Just kidding!
Are you more cheerful now?
Hello, little one!
Is that your new girlfriend?
"Another one who's come to mess with me."
Look, this is the picture from when you won the karate championship.
You don't remember?
Who is this guy? Ah, it's in Kudo, your husband!
"I'm not your husband, you bore!"
You seem to remember him.
What? Ran, is it true? Ran, is it true?
But... But?
I feel a... a certain nostalgia when I look at him.
I don't know what makes him... I don't know...
If he were to meet Shinichi again
maybe he'd get his memory back.
-Exactly!
We've been here-now!
(Sonoko) I wish it were that easy!
Come to think of it, he was a juvenile detective...
who travels all over the country to solve complicated cases, right?
Coi of insensitive!
Where the heck ten stop, now that the Ran is in such a smoky situation?
(Door: knock)
Come in.
Ran, I've already left the washroom free for you.
Thank you...
Conan, what... kind of person is Shinichi Kudo?
What kind of person?
What kind of person?
He's probably someone who always thinks of you above all else..,
but who doesn't dare to express what he feels.
I'd like so much... to see him...
Ran, would you like to go to Ginza tomorrow?
I get nervous here with your father.
I'd like to go shopping together
and get rid of this stress.
Conan, you come, too.
Ah!
Miss, are you all right?
What's up?
Sato!
Sato!
Sato, you must resist!
Excuse me.
Thank you for helping me.
Shit, shit, shit!
Our guy's coming.
Ran!
Ran!
Ran!
Xxxt.
They just gave her a tranquilizer.
Is Ran all right?
(Eri) Fortunately, she only has a few scrapes.
But... but, I'm worried...
that because of this incident, she's afraid to regain her memory.
Takagi, weren't you supposed to keep watch?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
But now we can be safe!
When the assassin shot the Sato, Ran saw his face!
Listen to me well!
Do whatever it takes, but protect the Ran.
Protect as much as you can, do you feel me, Takagi?
Yes, sir!
"It's not enough to protect her. Now, we have to fight back."
"That day, none of the people in the hotel...
"showed no reaction to the gunpowder test."
"I wonder if it's really possible
"to fire a gun and have no powder residue."
"Just a second!"
"If I'm not mistaken, then.........
"The fence of the umbrella stand was closed."
"And, after the fact..."
"It was outside the fence, and, on top of that, it had been left somewhere else."
"Besides, when the Ran left the hospital..."
"It could be!"
Eh?
You say that umbrella was you, kid?
Who knows where it is now?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Since it had a hole in it, I threw it away.
What?
"It's normal. A lot of days ago."
Relax, it was a joke.
Of course I had kept it.
You see?
"Come on..."
Thank you!
"I knew it!"
"I've already figured out how he fired the gun
"without it being evident in the screening test!"
"And, now,
"Not only Makoto Tomonari, Tamaki Jinn and Toshiya."
"Also all the other people who were at the party are suspects!"
It's here!
(Rock)

"I got it!"
(Rock) "Miss Tamaki was at the party....

"Because I was following in Toshiya!"
You wicked woman!
Why the hell do you have to follow me around every day?!
What's bothering you? -What?
I'll find the evidence of the 2 police inspectors...
whom you shot to death,
to prove that you committed that crime!
What do you want to do as bait? Eh?
You're Miss Tamaki, aren't you?
Tamotsu Jinn's younger sister.
The person who argued with her older brother,
about a year ago, was Toshiya Odagiri.
And since your father is a police superintendent,
you found out that she had not even been questioned.
Little boy..., who are you?
Conan Edogawa, a detective.
A... detective?
If you really esteemed your brother,
it wouldn't be surprising...
that you held a grudge against the 3 officers
who closed your brother's case as a suicide.
I hated my older brother!
I'm only investigating the case
because I want to know the whole truth, the whole truth!
So, we played heads or tails...
We present selected at the headquarters of the enemy.
"What do you want to do now?"
"It's unbelievable!"
You are Miss Tamaki Jinn?
I have something for you, Miss.
For... for me?
A month ago I found it in my son Toshiya's room.
T. Jinn!
-Is it my older brother's? -Of course.
I remembered his name
because it was the last case that Inspector Tomonari had handled
who had a sudden death due to a heart attack,
a year ago.
When I coaxed him into Toshiya,
he confessed to me that he had blackmailed en Tamotsu Jinn
in exchange for money because he discovered that he was dealing drugs.
However, there was no reference to en Toshiya...
in the documents we had.
That's why I ordered Inspector Narasawa
to investigate the case again.
So it was you who asked for the case to be reinvestigated?
Now that Sub-Inspector Narasawa has been shot to death,
it's Inspector Megre who has taken over the case.
But if Sub-Inspector Narasawa had decided to reinvestigate the case on his own initiative.
to reinvestigate the case on his own initiative,
you could have tried to protect your son
to avoid being considered a suspect, right?
Yes, yes, the truth is that I would also have a motive...
for murdering those 3 agents.
If you really want the truth of this case to come out,
Show us the investigation documents!
This, I cannot do!
Revealing the truth of this case is the job of the police force,
that is, it's our job!
(Sonoko) I'm so glad you didn't take it wrong!
(Sonoko) Thank you so much.
The doctor told me that I can go home now.
About it, Suzuki... Oh, look!
Tell me Sonoko!
What kind of a kid is Conan?
Eh?
Yes, I want to know.
He risked his life to save me.
What can I tell you?
For a kid, he's pretty smart...
Or maybe he's got an uncanny intuition.
He's a strange boy.
But you want me to tell you something?
To me he's just a repellent brat.
Yeah, he's...
"This year, Tropical World theme park,
"has added a new attraction
"called The Island of Beast and Antiquity!"
I... I know this place... I know this place!
Tropical World?
I know this place... I know this place!
It's true!
That's right, you went with Shinichi!
(Kazato) I see.
The memories of the Ran are gradually returning.
Hey, doctor!
If she went to Tropical World, do you think she could regain her memory?
Mmmm... There is always this possibility.
I'll go tomorrow to try my luck.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I don't like that!
It's possible that the killer wants to attack you again.
Besides, if you remember what happened, you'll suffer again!
To tell you the truth,
I'm also afraid to remember what happened to me.
But I don't think I can go on like this....
I have to take a step forward on my own initiative.
Ran...
That's right, you're a very brave girl.
If you've made up your mind this firmly,
I suppose it won't be inconvenient for you to go to Tropical World.
And couldn't you put it off until the day after tomorrow?
It's just that I have an engagement tomorrow...
(Kogoro) Don't worry!
I'll go with her!
I'll protect the Ran even if it means my life.
Oh, king...
Ran, I'll go with you too!
(Kogoro) Thank you!

But... don't say anything about this to Conan.
If you tell him, I'm convinced he'll want to come.
And I don't want him to put himself in danger again because of me...
Understood.
(Tamaki) It's getting late.
Yes.
Conan, if you want to see the investigation reports,
I have a copy.
You do?
I am a journalist after all.
I have them at home, so I'll show them to you tomorrow.
Good bye!
He's already gone!
He hasn't noticed, you're welcome.
Au!
Shall we go too?
Great, great!
La Ran has left the house!
-It's been worth the stalking since early morning!
I don't know if Conan was aware of all this.
It's a good thing he's out of the way once in a while!
He always gets the credit.
Listen to me, don't do anything dangerous, okay?
Follow the car in front!
Tell me, what have you found out, little detective?
This notepad that Inspector Chiba was holding in his hand...
There are voices nothing, the notepad?
If he had taken it out of the inside pocket of his jacket,
the notepad would have been facing the other way.
If you pick it up like this and take it out of your pocket...
You are right!
It is possible that it was not Inspector Shiba who took the notebook out,
but the murderer did.
Eh?
Indeed... It's quite possible.
Eh?
I'll find the evidence!
Miss Tamaki, weren't you right-handed?
Eh?
Ah, I used to be left-handed,
but over time I changed and became right-handed.
When I smoke, while I'm drilling something,
or when I encounter an unexpected situation,
I use my left hand unconsciously.
"In unexpected situations?"
"Actually, at that moment..."
"Wait a second! So, it was..."
(Groans in pain)
"That gesture had a meaning!"
Excuse me, your older brother...
worked at Tohti University Hospital, didn't he?
Yes, indeed.
Forgive me, Conan, but now I have to go somewhere else.
We must fold, for today.
Goodbye, Conan.
To Tropical World, please!
I remember... I remember this place...
It seems to me that when Shinichi came to the park with you...
he solved the roller coaster crime.
Hey, Ran, why don't we go up?
Maybe you'll remember even more!
Let's see...
The mystery roller coaster
is next to the island of mystery and visions.
You and Sonoko, go ahead.
(Shinichi) "Do you understand?"
"Surely this is what Conan Doyle would have meant."
Mmmm?
Eh... (Shinichi) It's all right.
Look, it's Ran and company!
What a rage, I wanted to come up too.
How can you talk such nonsense?
We have to investigate the surroundings
and see if there are any suspects in the meantime!
-Let's go! Yes!
Eh?
I thought Mr. Mouri was afraid of heights.
Madre mevaaaa!
(Shouting)
Excuse me, are you all right?
Ran, you want anything? Yes.
(Children) Look, the balloons in Troppo!
Coi!
Who the hell came up with this demon attraction?
(children) Ah!
"It has, I'm sure you were very thirsty."
You got this, Ran.
Thank you, Ran.
"You're Shinichi Kudo?"
"But, though I don't remember... who you are."
(Flow) Excuse me, Mr. Mouri... I'm going to the washroom for a moment.
I'm going to the washroom for a moment.
Hurray!
Thank you very much!
(Girl) The balloons are flying away!
Ran, alert!
Wait for it!
Let's go, let's go.
Children, don't do it!
You won't escape!
What's the matter?
He's got this!
Paprika water super gun!
Are you in Makoto Tomonari?
What's in there?
A knife?
I don't...
Makoto Tomonari, you're under arrest for attempted murder!
(At the same time) Hurray!
The Ran Protective League...
...has triumphed!
You have triumphed!
It has triumphed!
Mr. Mouri, I will take you directly...
...to the Metropolitan Headquarters!
Wait, I'll come with you.
Let me go!
Let me go!
(At the same time) Hurrah!
There is no more danger of me attacking you again.
Besides, it will be easier for you...
to recover the memories you have of Shinichi if I'm not here.
Pa... father...
Don't worry.
Look, tell me father when you've regained your memory.
Nothing happened thanks to the Junior Detective League.
You've done a good job this time.
He said "good job."
A famous detective, too.
He flattered us...
Great!

Now we can have as much fun as we want!
I want to see the parade!
Come on, let's go!
Doctor, we can stay here until the evening, right?
Sure, sure.
Shinichi and Ran were also here until night!
(At the same time) Hurrah!
"Are all the troubles really over?"
Aww, Ran, let's go to the devil's laboratory!
It'll be great fun!
(Woman) How?
Kid, you're the assistant of that famous detective, Kogoro Mouri?
Yes!
Say!
If I collaborate with you, will you give me an autograph of Mr. Mouri?
-Say: I want one too!
Of course you do!
"I can get you as many autographs as you want!"
Doctor Jinn, right?
I don't like to talk like that, but he was a nefarious doctor.
Of course he was!
When it came to money,
he was always coming up with shady stories and he wasn't slick at all.
He committed a lot of malpractice!
Yes, you remember that patient...
they brought in because he had suffered a heart attack?
During that operation, she made a cut...
on the arm of the surgeon who accompanied her during the operation.
Yes, yes!
And, because of this, the patient could not get out!
Please tell me this in more detail.
"So, it was as I thought!"
"I have to explain this to Mr. Kogoro!"
(Phone)
(Ring)
(Answering machine: Kogoro) "Mouri Detective Agency."
"Now, the famous detective Kogoro Mouri is solving a complicated case."
"Coi!"
(Girl) Kisaki and associates, tell me. "Hello, this is Conan!"
Hello, Conan!
"What is it, Mrs. Kisaki?"
Mrs. Kisaki has finished her hearing a moment ago...
and has gone to Tropical World.
To Tropical World?
From what she said, it looks like the Ran has gone.
"No!"
Oh, it's so much fun!
So?
Now you can talk?
Come on.
I got a call from a man.
He said he would explain to me
the circumstances of my father's death.
So I went to the Beikacho crossroads.
But the man didn't show up
and Inspector Narasawa was shot in that area.
When I returned home,
I received a call from a man again.
"This time he asked me
"To go to the Maison Park apartment building in Midorikai."
"However, this time he didn't show up either....
"And Inspector Shiba was found dead
"in the subway parking lot of that building."
"Then it finally dawned on me."
"The killer was lifting up my shirt."
"That night, I spent it in a hotel."
"The next day, I called my answering machine...
"and found a message from a woman
"who identified herself as Inspector Sato."
"She said to be at the Beika Sun Plaza Hotel...
"And went on to say that if I didn't show up,
"I would be arrested on suspicion of murder."
"But... when I arrived,
"I found everything full of police officers."
"So I got the hell out of there."
But Inspector Sato was shot!
And why didn't you go report it all to the police, right away?
After what happened to my father,
I couldn't trust you!
So, I thought I'd go to Detective Mouri for help,
and I was following him.
This means that you were not in Tropical World to be close to the Ran?!
No.
I wanted to talk to Mr. Mouri.
Wait a second!
But, you were carrying a knife.
It was to protect me.
I thought the killer might want to kill me too.
Oh, no...
So... There's another killer out there?
And he has an accomplice!
A woman!
"La Ran is in danger..."
"Where are you? Ran, where have you gone?"
Excuse me, is there room in the observatory?
Yes, now everyone is watching the parade.
Thank you.
Welcome to the maze of ice and fog.
Eh?
In Genta and the group?
They're here, too?
This means that the Ran must be close!
"It's the killer! Ran!"
"Sure!"
"The transmitter of the Junior Detective League!"
Genta!
Mitsuhiko!
Ayumi!
"What can you hear me? Answer me!"
Tell me, Conan, I feel you!
Conan, where do you think we are, right now?
You'll hallucinate!
We are in Tropical World!
"It's fantastic!"
Calm down.
Listen to what I'm going to tell you!

Right now, the killer is pointing a gun at Ran!
(At the same time) What?!
"Tell the Ran to walk through crowded places
"And to sneak out of Tropical World."
Hey!
Warn Ran!
-Ran, run away!
You're in danger! -Point a gun at you!
Watch out!
Doctor!
"They're hurting other people... because of me!"
Ran, stay close to me!
The killer only wants you...
Eh?
Ran!
Ran!
Damn it!
"The Ran is in the next area.
"On the island of dreams and fairy tales!"
"To go there...!"
Next, please.
Little boy, where are you going?
It's over there!
Ah!
What's that?
Conan! Ran, now everything will be fine!
We'll blend in with all the people and get out of here.
Follow me!
"It's dangerous!"
"As long as he kills Ran,
"He'll get other people hurt!"
Help us!
A madman is chasing us!
Jump into the boat!
What are you doing?!
Conan, where did you learn to drive a boat?
My father taught me Hawaii.
Maybe... we're out of danger now.
No.
What?
The booze!
"What?"
"It's 20 minutes to 9 o'clock!"
Conan!
A water jump! Hold on tight!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Let's get stuck in!
(gasps)
It won't be long now!
Make an effort!
Ah!
Coi!
He's already caught us!
Come on, we have to make the climb and hide behind the rocks.
Hurry up!
(CLEC)
Hey, Conan.
This ride closes at night and there's no one around,
so you can let yourself be seen.
I find that very prudent.
But it's useless for you to keep hiding...
because I have already found out the meaning
of the message that Inspector Narasawa conveyed to me!
"When he clutched the right side of his chest before he died,
"He wasn't indicating his notepad, but his heart!"
"He was looking to tell us something that had to do with the heart!"
"In Japanese the word 'psychiatrist' carries the character 'heart'."
Did I get it right, Dr. Kyosuke Kazato?
When did you know it was me?
Well, if you want to know the truth,
the first time I saw you call on the phone.
"First of all,
"Right-handed people don't press the keys with their left hand!"
Exactly!
Actually, you are left-handed!
Yes, that was a big mistake on my part.
7 years ago, you were at the Tohti University Hospital working....
"Very excited as a talented young surgeon."
"But one day, at an operation I was doing together with Dr. Jinn,
"He cut his left wrist with the scalpel by mistake."
"Because of that accident,
"His wrist, which they called 'the golden wrist', lost precision."
"And he decided not to use a scalpel ever again,
"And he changed his specialty from surgeon to psychiatrist."
And, from then on, probably also driven by his great pride,
he acted as if he were right-handed.
Yes, it is true.
I didn't think that anyone would realize that I was left-handed
just by watching me make a phone call.
A year ago, when he moved to Beika Yakushino Hospital...
as a psychiatrist,
something happened between you and Dr. Jinn.
I met him by chance.
"I went for a drink at his apartment."
"I drank a lot,
"and I decided to clear up a doubt
"that had been nagging at my heart for those six years."
"I asked him if he'd done that cut on me specifically!"
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
You're a fool, my boy.
"As I supposed, that accident was a premeditated action!"
"At that moment the will to murder him arose."
"That season,
"She had been denounced for having committed negligence;
"There were grounds to argue that he wanted to commit suicide!"
And the investigation concluded
that the cause of his death had been suicide.
But, sure enough,
he heard that they would re-investigate the case.
Yes, said Inspector Narasawa, a Beika police officer.
When his colleague, Inspector Tomonari, died,
he came to my office for treatment.
And through the treatment,
I also learned that Makoto Tomonari hated the police.

Therefore, he planned to assassinate the 3 inspectors....
who were investigating the case again
to keep the police away from you.
And he asked Mr. Makoto Tomonari
to come to the scene of the events
because he wanted to frame you for the deaths.
That's right!
I called him
and told him when I killed Inspectors Narasawa and Shiba.
And, as for Inspector Sato...
...she recorded the message she left on the answering machine
when you treated a woman who was a patient of yours, right?
That's right!
You learned from Inspector Shiratori
that Inspector Narasawa died
shaking the notepad he was carrying at chest level.
Of course, of course I did.
And, then, to make it look like...
that Inspector Tomonari's son had committed the crime..,
he expressly put the police notepad
in Inspector Shiba's hand after he shot him!
Great, Conan!
But you don't have any evidence to prove that I am the murderer!
Because... when Inspector Sato was shot...
they didn't detect anything in the gunpowder test!
If you want me to explain the set-up, I'll be glad to do it.
What a ?
Once the police have arrested him!
This way!
We must have been ambushed at that exit!
Where are we?
On the island of adventures and pioneers.
This small island was built by gaining land from the sea.
Well...
Come on, let's go!
We haven't finished talking yet.
Damn it!
He followed us to the boat.
I can't allow this setup to get out.
This would also make me a suspect
of having shot Inspector Sato!
Even if I or Ran testifies against you,
Did you escape by arguing
that nothing was detected in the gunpowder test?
That's right!
Because the Ran only saw me for an instant!
But, all the same, it is a danger to me and I have to eliminate!
Au, keep talking!
Let's see if your deduction agrees or not!
For me, perfect.
First of all....,
"He caused a blackout on the 15th floor of the hotel."
"Then he put on a pair of surgical gloves,
"took the umbrella, which he'd left in the umbrella stand,
"and went to the ladies' room!"
"He first opened a hole in the top of the umbrella,
"He put the pistol through that hole... and shot him!"
"In other words,
"The umbrella protected him from the smoke and gunpowder particles!"
That's why they didn't detect anything at all.
Because, most likely, he got rid of the gloves....
by throwing them in the toilet bowl, right?
Correct answer, Conan!
I see I have no choice but to kill you.
Conan...
(CLEC)
Tell me, why?
Why do you make so many efforts to protect me, eh, Conan?
Tell me, why?
Because I love you!
(At the same time) I love you with all my heart...
more than any other person...
...in the whole world.
Jump!
Catch your breath!
Hurry up!
Thank you.
Comrade.
Ah... you're welcome...
Shit!
"46 seconds to 9 o'clock!"
It's him!
Conan, let's put an end to this right here.
Besides, there's no more... escape.
Conan!
I'm all right... He just grazed my shoulder.
I told you!
There's no escape!
If you kill Ran, here and now,
you'll prove Makoto Tomonari's innocence, you know?
Yes, I had planned to kill him before he was arrested,
but I had no choice.
So, you know, ladies first.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...
What is this, some kind of spell?
...3, 2, 1!... 3, 2, 1!
(Sato) "No, Ran! Aaaaah!"
Inspector Sato!
"You have, I'm sure you were very thirsty. One!"
Aaatxim!
(Sonoko) "If Shinichi said something like that to me I would die...!"
"This is your gift for winning the karate championship."
Get away from me!
When the fountains stop it will be the end of you!
You can give up now!
You're coming at me in child's play?
Are you there?
You die!
Conan...
"Ran... Don't say that you..."
Shit!
I'm going to kill you first!
No... maybe...
I remember everything!
I also remember that you shot Inspector Sato!
And also that I won the karate championship!
Karate?
You won?
It's unbelievable!
-Ran! -Ran!
Mother!
Father!
Oh, my child...

Have you recovered your memory?
And of me, do you also remember?
Of course I do!
Sonoko Suzuki!
My lifelong friend.
Ran...!
Ran!
I'm so happy!
So, this guy was the killer.
Police superintendent Odagiri
has re-investigated the case on his own and reported to us.
Conan, it's not fair!
It's not fair that you caught her all by yourself!
Don't say that!
He just wanted to keep you two from getting involved.
This is what we didn't want!
-We're all supposed to be the Junior Detective League together!
Excuse me, please.
(gasps) Huh?
Conan, you're bleeding.
You are.
Thank you.
I'm glad everything went well.
Yes.
Good work, little detective.
Eh?
Miss Tamaki!
What are you doing here?
I had come to keep an eye on Toshiya,
who was doing a live concert in this park today.
But I see I wasted my time.
-And another thing.
What happened to "I will protect Ran even if it means my life"?
The ones who risked it to save her
were Dr. Agasa and Conan.
Eh, well... I'm glad she's all right anyway!
(laughing outrageously)
-Are you serious?
Say .- (man) "Yes!"
Attention everyone!
Inspector Sato has regained consciousness!
Looks like we don't have to worry anymore!
Yes, really?
(People: shouts of enthusiasm)
Sato!
Inspector Takagi, you've come out!
I'm so happy!
With this, we already have the tancat case.
Don't talk nonsense!
Although we have to deal with the Toshiya blackmail case!
The victim is already dead,
but deal with it firmly and investigate the facts point by point!
Yes, sir!
Little boy, it seems that you have seen the truth...
before any of us did.
Who are you?
"I don't need to know."
I'm a normal elementary school student.

Conan, thank you very much.
Hey, you said that before...
for helping me get my memory back, right?
Eh?
Yes, we felt it at the hotel, remember?
My father told my mother
to ask her to marry him.
"I love you with all my heart."
"More than anyone else in the whole world..."
Is that why you used the same words?
Eh, he said the same thing? Did he?
Didn't you feel it?
Uh, no... I did feel it.
I thought so!
There's too much of an age difference between you and me
for you to tell me something like that...
But you've made me very happy.
Good night! Good night!
Good night.
So much for that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Does this mean...
(At the same time) That this man and I express ourselves in the same terms?
No way!
