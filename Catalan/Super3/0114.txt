DETECTIVE CONAN
The case of the snake-bitten diver, part 1
Have you thought about it?
Yes, that, Saturday and Sunday.
Yes?
You'll come?!
Will you really?
Thank you, thank you!
What are you doing, at this hour?
Aaaa... Co... Conan!
I'm not doing anything... I was talking on the phone with a friend.
Well, we understand each other, so, good night!
(croons)
Good night, Conan!
(Think) What's wrong with this one?
Going to an Izu beach?
This Saturday and Sunday!
You didn't have anything planned, did you?
It's a very nice hotel with a wonderful private beach!
But staying there will cost a kidney.
I never party, and for one day I'd rather stay at home drinking.
(Think) You drink and sleep even if you don't have a vacation.
It's just that I had already arranged to go...
Meeting?
With whom have you been?
Ah... Leave it, my stuff.
Conan, you want to go to the beach too, don't you?!
Oi?!
No!
If when you're young you start to get bad habits, too bad!
They say that on the beach of that hotel there are many girls in bikinis.
And it's full of young students!
(She thinks) But what does she say?
The usual Ran doesn't talk like that.
For some time now I've been saturated with work
and I could use a vacation.
Hurray!
Thank you, father!
You're welcome, daughter...
(Thinking) "Hey, wait a minute, Kogoro is acting as usual.
What's gotten into him, a la Ran?"
Wow!
The sea is beautiful!
A sea full of chocolates is calling me!
A sea full of chocolates is calling me!
A sea full of chocolates is calling me!
Ooooh!
How wonderful!
This is a top-notch hotel!
What's the matter with you?
Are you looking for someone?
What?
No, no one...
Father, we'll check in right away!
Yes, you're right.
We must hurry!
They had booked two rooms.
Yes.
You didn't need to take separate rooms either,
a suite would have cost us cheaper, right?
Look, we'd end up getting in your way...
Nothing, it's just me.
Let's change clothes!
Yes, you're right!
Those chocolates are waiting for me!
(Thinking) It's weird!
Something's up.
(Think) This is full of hot chicks!
Surprise!
Look, it's this, father!
The bikini I bought!
Xxxxxxt!
If they think I'm carrying ballast, too bad!
What do you mean by that?
What do I mean by that?
Well...
Come on!
Girl, you have a sculpted body!
If you want sun cream, I'll put it on you!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
E... Eri... How-how come, you're here?!
This I ask you.
Why...?
What a beautiful coincidence!
You look like a well-knit married couple!
Form an ideal couple!
-Ran, it's up to you!
-You've got it all figured out.
What?
You what?
That's why you booked two separate rooms.
What do you mean?
What's that supposed to mean?
(Thinking) My goodness, you've got some nerve.
Don't make these long faces, please.
I've already apologized to you for making me find you.
Cheer up and let's enjoy Izu Beach for a while longer!
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go!
I was having a great time, until a moment ago...
Until a lady with a flashy swimsuit appeared with desire.
Well, that lady has so enraptured someone that I know
that she didn't make eyes like saucers.
Hey, just a... just a moment, don't fight.
I'm going to the bathroom for a moment!
Eh?
Ah, father, wait, wait!
He's confused.
Since I haven't seen you for a long time...
I don't know what to tell you...
I see a man as stubborn as a mule
who is incapable of giving in on his own initiative.
Eh ?!
You're not wearing your wedding ring!
You always wore it!
Yeah... I've taken it off, I've taken it off...

He wanted to test, he wanted to know if he would notice or not....
If he had realized it, he would still have hope.
Maybe it's asking for the impossible... This means that...
It means the great failure of my life.
I should turn over a new leaf and rebuild my life.
But... mother!
Conan, don't become a man like him.
Ah... Yes!
(Thinking) Even if I set my mind to it, I would never be like him.
What should I do?
It takes too long already, the father.
I'm sure he's gone back to the beach to flirt.
Apa, that's impossible...
(Kogoro laughs)
I can't believe we've met such a famous detective!
For me it's an honor!
I can't believe that two such attractive ladies are my fans!
Ya te deia.
Ca... coincidences!
Coming back from the washroom he met by chance those girls and...
Are you sure?
Look closely at her legs.
Although he had removed the sand, he is now up to his knees.
He must have knelt down to put cream on those girls.
Maybe he's gone to all this trouble to get them up here
because I saw him with them.
What a banal man... It's unbelievable...
Don't tell me that in Kogoro...
Maybe I should form a fan club!
I don't think so...
Ep, father where are you going?!
Ah, Ran, these girls are my fans!
Come, I'll introduce you to my family.
Geez, I don't want to know anything!
We'll start the introductions over here.
This is Kiwako Toda, a college girl I've met.
Good morning to you.
And this is Harumi Matsuzaki, from the same university.
Nice to meet you.
How cute!
Is he your son?
No.
He's the son of an acquaintance, we have him at home.
And that's my daughter, Ran.
Hello.
And that's...
My name is Eri, his ex-wife!
Eh?!
Are you divorced?
No!
It's a joke, a joke!
No, it's not a 100% joke.
Hey, you're not a youngster anymore.
Don't throw the cane at our classmates.
Hey, Masahiko, say something to him.
This guy is messing with your promise and your sister!
Aw, man, don't take it so hard.
This guy looks like he's someone famous...
Is he famous?
It's Kogoro Mouri,
that famous detective they call the "Sleeping Kogoro".
I thought so!
I had a feeling I knew him.
Boy, am I familiar!
I have a lot of experience.
Since my face is in the news,
I could do no wrong.
Listen, has he eaten yet?
No, not yet.
Then join us for lunch!
Behind this hotel
there's a restaurant with a beautiful view.
-Yes!
Good thinking! -Let's go!
(Kogoro) Let's go!
(Kogoro) Oh, what a surprise!
We're all from your university's diving club?!
Yes, today we did a dive together before lunch.
As you are getting married next week,
it was the last bachelor dive!
No.
Tomorrow we will do another one.
For my brother, since he can't swim, joining the club was hard.
-He can't swim?
-That's right.
He would drown.
That's why he's always hooked up to oxygen tanks.
Since he was little he's always swum like a lead fish.
Don't be mean...
Hey ?!
Since he was little?
That means you were childhood friends!
That's right...
Two childhood friends who ended up getting married!
You're just like the father and the mother!
Oi?!
Oi?!
Oi?!
Childhood friends...
There are couples who end up crying for the sweet sound of these words?
When you understand each other well and you know how it is,
to get your hopes up is the height of cynicism.
It will do you no service....
But if it seems to you that she is unfaithful to you, come in the office.
When you divorced, if you want a financial compensation from the husband,
come to the Kisaki law firm.
(At the same time) Nice to meet you!
(Thinking) How cold...
(Think) Why did this have to happen?
What happened to the other childhood friend you have?
After the dive,
Hiroshi said that he would make immersionisme to the sea.
Immersionisme?
Yes, to dive in the sea without cylinders!
He has dived without taking a bite?
Yes, he is a curious boy, he always says: "I like the sea more than women".
He'll have to marry a cod!
How you burn!
Harumi, can you go get the new towel from the room?
Eeeh?
Hey, Kiwako, don't say that now...

Yes, I'm really looking forward to going in the water too!
You've had enough to drink, can you?
And if you leave it for tomorrow?
I'm fine!
I haven't had that much to drink either.
Besides, I just want to do a little immersion.
So, can I dive with you?
No need, I want to go down alone.
See you later.
And don't worry, eh?
Kiwako...
It seems that the sea has risen up.
Will she be all right, Kiwako?
Hello!
Are you all here?
Ah, Hiroshi, were you with Kawazu?
Yes, we met at the toilets.
Today's place was extraordinary!
What's up?
Where is she, your girlfriend, Masahiko?
-It's still the sea.
-Eh?
She hasn't been found?
No, not at all...
Look, it's over there!
He's waving his hand at us.
Kiwako!
(Thinking) Something's wrong with her...
-No... It can't be!
-She's choking!
Ki... Kiwako!
Kiwakoooo!
Masahiko!
Kiwako!
You jerk!
You can't swim!
How are you going to help her?!
Calm down.
(Kiwako) What about Masahiko?
Where is she... in Masahiko?
(Kiwako) He's fine.
Look at him, he came all the way here to save you.
Sure... I'm glad...
What the... What is it, this thing?
This is...
All yours, seducer!
Carry it in your arms yourself!
Don't worry, Masahiko, it must have had a ramp on one leg.
A sea serpent!
(thinks) What?
It can't be!
Then I said let it run.
Come on, leave the marriage discussions for later.
Hey, Kiwako... can you feel me?
Kiwako!
Kiwako?
Kiwako...
What's the matter?
Come on!
You have to be strong!
Come on!
Don't move it!
You may have been bitten by a sea snake!
A sea snake?!
There was one near us!
It should have fang marks.
Aaaah!
The hand... the left hand...
The left hand?
The bite mark!
So, the Kiwako... Did he really get bitten by a snake?
We must bind this part and extract the venom!
-Do you have something to tie? -A handkerchief.
How did you know she was bitten by a sea snake?
Eh, boy?
What did you catch?
I saw the sea serpent!
It was about 40 centimeters long.
What happened? Call an ambulance!
She was about to drown, but she has already been rescued.
A sea snake bit him!
-A sea snake?! - They are very venomous beasts!
That's why I'm saying it, an ambulance!
E... Hey!
What's wrong with him?
Why is he carrying tea with ice?!
Because of tannin.
By cleaning the wound with tannin, a component of tea,
neutralizes the effects of the poison.
This is the best emergency treatment there is.
It is important that the person who sucks the venom glopegi tea.
How does he know these things, this child?
Does he miss you?
This child is very intelligent.
He is more useful than us, who have stood by and watched.
How is it that a former police inspector has no idea about these things?
How can he!
So much so, I'll go ask for the ambulance.
Go and ask for a cup of tea to be brewed for you, for the tannin!
See you later, Mr. famous detective!
You have to resist, Kiwako.
I am her fiancé.
May I accompany you to the hospital?
Hop in.
Who saw the sea serpent? It was me!
What species was it?
What species?
We have an illustrated encyclopedia in the hotel office.
As soon as you know, report it to the hospital.
Y... yes!
That's the one!
I have no doubt about it!
-A striped sea snake? -A Izu?
It enters the Japanese coast, and from time to time one comes.
There are fishermen who have died for not being careful.
And you, despite the danger, have the beach open to the public?
No, you understand me.
The fishermen put their hands in the nets,
and they are bitten by a snake that has become entangled.
But it is a snake!
There is always the possibility of it attacking someone!
This species is a tame snake and would never attack a human being.
In the 20 years that this hotel has existed,
no snake has ever bitten a guest.
Do you know if this sea snake has wings on its body?
Wings ?
No such strange species.
What is strange...
It looked to me as if it had small wings on the back of its head.
It must have some seaweed attached to it.
That must be it.
It's formidable that you remember so many details at a glance.

I can tell that you are my daughter! It has caught my attention and that's enough.
(Eri) An excellent gift for observation.
Unlike one I know
who hasn't even noticed his wife's finger.
-What's wrong with your finger? -Nothing, man...
He must have put his hand in the snake's cache.
I can't think of anything else.
I'll go and report it to the hospital!
(He thinks) "No...
"He's wrong.
"That fang mark is not due to an accident!
"Someone was carrying the snake and forced it to bite Kiwako's hand!
"If this were so,
someone of us who had approached would have...
"No, then all of us were empty handed
and we have approached because Kiwako was drowning!
"No one would bother to bring a snake prepared,
considering that she could have drowned herself.
"The most natural thing to do would be to have her bitten by the snake
and drown because her body would be paralyzed.
"In Hiroshi was the only one who could commit the crime.
"He was the sea before she drowned.
"But when he learned that she had been bitten by a snake,
he proceeded in an impeccable manner!
"If he were the suspect,
he wouldn't be trying to save someone he was trying to kill.
"Be that as it may, the suspect was there at the time.
It's one of the four of them!"

DETECTIVE CONAN
Do you like it, Kiwako?
I fell in love at first sight.
So much so, help me.
It's gone!
Kiwako's medical book!
At the bottom, on the towel.
(Voice Kogoro) It was not an accident!
You are to blame!
In the next chapter...
The case of the diver bitten by the snake, part two...
The clue to the next Conan is...
A ring!
In the next chapter we solve it.
Who is the culprit?
-L'empleat del hotel!
-Me?
