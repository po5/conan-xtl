It's this way.
Conan, you're giving us a lot of rides today, aren't you?
That's all right.
Sometimes it's okay to take the long way around.
You're right, you're right.
Here we are.
(Laughs) Huh?
Oh! (Laughs)
Mm-hm.

"Memories of the cherry tree class (Ran as a little girl)."
It's beautiful...
So much so.
All the cherry trees are in full bloom.
You were absolutely right, Conan.
It was worth it, it came the long way.
And so much.
You got it right.
Yesterday, coming out of class,
I passed by here with Genta and the others and we loved it.
Wait, the sight of the cherry blossoms made me think...
of the first time I saw Shinichi.
Oh!
I don't think he knows this,
but... the truth is, when I first met him,
I didn't like that boy at all.
Eh?
Eh?
Hey, I can't find the badge with the Ran's name on it.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-Do you know where it is, you?
I think I've seen it on the kitchen table before.
That's the one from last year, from the tulip class.
This year I'm going to the cherry class.
Oh, that's right.
Yes, that's right.
Today, the first day of school, she wanted to wear it.
She had left it on the shoemaker.
You didn't see it happen, did you?
Now that you mention it, when I put on my shoes, something fell on the floor.
- (brittle)
-Eh?
Wow...
I stepped on it.
Ooh...
I did.
And you've smashed it.
It's got, I'm sure you can glue it with some glue.
I find it a bit difficult, that I can glue it back together, frankly.
I have to go now.
I'm starting work at the Metropolitan Police today.
Wait, no.... bar!
Hm...
I guess what we'll have to do is ask the professor
to see if he can make you a new one.
You know what we'll do?
And what will I do, until I get it?
The mother will make you one so you can come to class with your name on it.
Do you want to go get a pink poster board?
Hm.
(Man) Let it go.
We both know she's not coming back.
(Woman) Don't say that, that.
Because it's not true.
What... what do you want me to do, then?
-Oh.
-Start over.
This time I'm sure it'll go well.
It can never be too late to retrace such a wonderful path.
I got so excited, with your book.
Ah.
Thank you so much.
Especially when I read the detective's last sentence.
"It can never be too late to retrace such a wonderful path."
I thought she was saying it to me.
It gave me goose bumps.
By the way, you...
Didn't you come to the Hokkaido book signing the other day?
Gee, I'm so glad you remembered!
Thank you, Mr. Kudo.
A while ago, when I arrived here, it was snowing, and then it stopped,
but I see it must be raining now.
No.
I'm in the habit of carrying an umbrella.
Ah.
Look how nice.
(Mobile)
-No, on the contrary.
-One moment, excuse me.
I've wasted enough of your time.
Thank you very much again.
Yes, tell me?
Ah, hello, Yukiko.
What's that?
That badge where Shinichi's name was?
(Yukiko) Yes.
The one that was shaped like a cherry petal;
it was made of plastic.
Today Shinichi starts going to the new school, it's the first day.
Last night I wrote his name
and left it on the desk in the office.
- "No."
-You didn't see it?
"On the desk there was only the pen and the glasses case."
I was running a little late and I shoved everything in my pocket in a hurry.
- "I knew it."
-Oh.
I've got it.

You took it with you to the book signing, didn't you?
"Yes, but you shouldn't have left it on the desk in the office."
You're just absent-minded.
You left your pen here.
Hehe...
"Before I take Shinichi to school,
I'll stop by here to pick her up;
wait'ns, eh?"
Yes, but to go in, especially put on your hat and glasses.
"There will be a lot of commotion, if you get recognized."
Okay.
Come on, Shinichi, we're leaving.
Shinichi.
Where have you been?
Hey, Ran... How come you're wearing this badge?
It's different.
It broke this morning and my mother made me another one.
And look, it has a safety pin.
Really?
Well, it's very well made.
I can put it on and take it off whenever I want.
You see?
Oh... How well done!
It tastes great, your mother.
She does.
What's that thing?
It's paper.
Tricky.
It's different from ours.
You're not from the class.
-You're not from the class.
-Yes, that's right.
You can give it back to her right now.
-I don't feel like it.
-I don't feel like it.
-DDDD...
-Turn it back on.
Bddd...
No, Sonoko.
Give it back!
Sonoko!
(Man) Come on, come on, and now make peace.
So, this is something else.
And you, Ran, next week you'll already have the other badge.
We'll make you a new one, but you have to wait a few days.
Is that okay with you, pretty girl?
Mm-hm.
(Sonoko) Sorry, Ran.
I wanted to get it back, but... it got all wrinkled.
That's all right.
I noticed how the mother made it before.
"Let's see, how did she do it?"
"First I fold it in half,
"I fold it again, fold it again, fold it again,
and now I open it."
"Then I take one end
"And fold it up to the middle of the cross that the folds have made,
"unfold the tip and... y... y... and then..."
"Come on, let's go, it's almost done, it's almost done."
"I make a line with this shape,
and now all I have to do is to cut it out."
"That's it."
Make another one for me.
It's a... cherry blossom.
What is it?
Is it or isn't it?
Y-yes it is, but-but how do you know?
Like, how do I know?
Do you think I'm a donkey or are you laughing at me?
I've noticed the robes you have together in front of the futons,
and on all of them there's a cherry blossom.
The gowns in the other row, on the other hand,
all have a tulip blossom.
Yes, but, just looking at this,
how did you know what a cherry blossom did?
Well, very easy: so that your gown is the only one that doesn't have one.
Besides, with the amount of folds that I have counted that you did....
and the shape you were giving, you have 10 ends left,
and since you've cut the ends, when you open the paper,
it will look like a cherry blossom.
Oh...
It's easy;
that's why I knew...
that you had lost the cherry blossom-shaped badge
and that you made another shedding tears like a whiner.
Ooooh!
How could you know, all that?
That you're a witch, or what?
Don't be silly.
How do you want me to be a witch?
Well, I'm not a crybaby either.
No, I wasn't crying.
Well, you were crying.
Yes, you were.
Hmm...
I wasn't crying!
(Yukiko) Aah... Shinichi.
You're here.
Why did you leave?
I had to finish filling out the registration form.
Mother, please...
What have you done, about the badge?
A moment ago you had it here on your robe.
What have you done?
Where is it?
What do you mean, you lost it?
I don't know.
Maybe I lost it.
And that's why I had to go undercover at the book signing?
"What's a spy?"
That's why I came to ask her
to make me a badge in the shape of a cherry blossom.
Aren't you... Ran, Eri's daughter?
How does she know?
How funny!
You'll be going to the same school.
Excuse me, Mrs. Kudo.
If you don't find the badge in the end,
we'll have to make one for the Ran next week,
we'll make another one for your son, so don't suffer.
Hey.
Thank you very much.
If you want a cherry blossom, I can give you this one I just made.
Okay, I'll write the name, too.
I'll write your name, too.
Ah..., what's your name?
Eh?
Ah... Shinichi Kudo, from the cherry tree class.
Shi... ni... chi... Ku... do.
There, that's it.
Ah, thank you very much.
There you go.
For you.
I'll give it to you.
But, in exchange, you have to promise me one thing:

that you won't tell me I'm a crybaby anymore!
Because I am not.
I'm not a crybaby.
(Sonoko) I remember as if it were now.
You stared at her and said:
"Don't ever tell me I'm a crybaby again".
Oh, really?
It's just that... we were in kindergarten
and he was acting like he was a very arrogant big boy.
Also, when I realized...
that he had the feeling that he was better than everyone else...
and that he thought the others were idiots,
I felt like saying something to him.
But the truth is that I was only crying because I had been angry
because they had spoiled the badge my mother had made for me.
"She just admitted to me that she was crying."
Besides, I didn't understand why she had asked me...
to make the badge with the cherry blossom on it.
And that made me even angrier.
Because...
Why did he ask you?
The cherry blossom was actually...
...well locked up, and now we opened them.
We clap our hands loudly, we close them again.
With our hands open...
What's that?
What are you looking at?
What do you mean?
That he keeps looking at her all the time.
At Ran, I mean.
What?
What? I don't know why you say that.
I don't know why you say that.
All right, kids, what do you say we stop singing...
and go to the park and play for a while?
YEAH!
How can you be so silly?
It's normal that he's watching us all the time.
Oh, is it?
Because he's the teacher.
Yes, of course he is.
And look, everyone loves her very much, Mr. Efune.
It's true.
We all love him.
Besides, there are many girls who say that when they grow up,
they would like to get married.
JAAA.
And you, Ran, do you also like the teacher?
Why are you asking me these questions?
You don't have to do anything!
I'm sorry, then.
I didn't mean it.
You're really nasty, aren't you?
Maybe he doesn't like me anymore.
Stop it.
He keeps saying weird things.
Oh... (Efune)
(Efune) That's clear, isn't it?
And now, to go through, I want everyone to raise an arm.
(Efune) All right!
Higher!
What are you doing, Shinichi?
You're not raising your arm?
That's good!
Hm.
Hm.
Aah!
(Boy) It was my turn.
No, it was my turn.
Come on, that's enough.
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop it.
Don't fight anymore.
Come on, let's go.
You two are good friends, you have to respect.
Isn't that right?
Yes.
You want to go down the slide?
Hm.
Now it's the Ran's turn.
Let it go.
Aah!
Don't you want to go down the slide, Shinichi?
It's a lot of fun.
Hey, Shinichi, can't you hear me?
And you, don't you go down the slide?
What's that?
No, the slide is only for you.
(Efune) Ale, well, it's nap time.
All right, throw futons as usual, in a row,
side by side.
Wait, Shinichi, what are you doing?
T-This is the Ran's place.
Yes, Shinichi, sorry.
Isn't it a little strange, all of it?
Eh?
Oh.
How come she's the only girl who always puts the futon in the same place?
Ah, well, ah, perquèèèèè...
And apart from the futon thing, there are more things that seem strange to me,
3, exactly.
When we go to the park to play,
how come you always shake hands only with Ran?
Later, when we were on the slide,
there were a few children queuing up
and you made Ran pass in front of them.
Also, now they are going to a park that is farther away than they were going before.
Along the way there are two crosswalks,
and this makes it much more dangerous.
Mr. Efune...
I am convinced that what you want is to gain their confidence
because then he can do whatever he wants to do;
tell the truth.
Oooh...
I'm sorry, excuse me.
What's so funny?
Look, first of all, I usually shake Ran's hand...
because one time when we were out hiking in the park she got lost
she started walking in another direction and we lost sight of her.
As for the slide,
we let her go in front so that Ran is a very good child
and always lets everyone go down before her,
and in the end, she often doesn't go down at all.
And Ran always sleeps here, in the same place,
because this way she has the toilets closer to her.

Before, when I slept a little farther away from the toilets,
there were times when I didn't make it in time.
Really?
What is the meaning of this?
That you'd break yourself?
Let me, this, in front of the whole class?
Oh!
I don't want to hear anything more from you.
And if you want to know why we're going to another park,
now, you'll have to wait until tomorrow, when we go, Mr. Detective.
Hm.
All right, you remember we're supposed to raise an arm as we go through?
YIII!
Oh...
What-what's the matter, Ran?
That you're sad?
That it's because of what Shinichi said to you in front of everyone?
No, I'm... I'm sad because yesterday my mother scolded me.
She told me not to mess with the other kids.
What?
Hm.
I don't pick on anyone, do I?
I'd say there are more who pick on you.
Oh, that's perfect.
Make it all very well.
Go on, explain to me:
why did you decide to change parks and come to this one?
Because the farther we go, the longer we walk and the more exercise we get.
Besides, to come here we cross more crosswalks...
and we learn the traffic rules better.
But the truth is that I like to come to this park
because of that girl.
What girl?
-Eeeeh?
-Huh?
The one you see in the window, behind the cherry blossom tree.
She's in this hospital next door.
But, this girl you see looking at us,
she's actually... my wife.
Does this mean you're married?
What? Your wife?
Your wife?
Yes.
But now she's a little sick
and she's been in this hospital for a while.
Next month she'll be transferred to another hospital,
which is in another city where the air is much cleaner.
But for the moment it is in this one, and here there are only old people.
She is a little sad because there are no children like you.
That's why, until they take him away, I like to come here,
so he can see children playing and laughing, like you.
Because I know he loves them, the kids.
Actually, I've been a little selfish leading the user to this park.
No, it's not, selfish.
Listen.
Why don't we all say hello at the same time?
-Yeah, yeah. -Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, yeah. -Yeah, yeah.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to listen to someone who wears a different badge.
(Two children) Me neither.
You're the only one with this badge.
You're not from the class.
That's not true what you're saying.
(Children) You're not from the class!
(Children) What?
You haven't noticed?
Haven't you seen my badge?
It is also made of paper, like hers.
Well then, you're not from the class either.
There are two of us who have a badge made of paper.
She's no longer the only one.
And that means we're from the class.
"Sure, she was looking at us."
It's different from ours.
You're not from the class.
-You're not from the class.
-Yes, that's true.
"He's seen it all."
"That's why... she's done all that."
Make another one for me.
It's a... cherry blossom.
(Yukiko) May I know what you've done?
Where do you have it?
(Yukiko) I don't know.
Maybe I've lost it.
It's also made of paper, like hers.
She's not the only one anymore.
And that means we're class!
And don't ever mess with me again.
Is that clear?
Neither with me nor with her.
Come on, let's go.
Say hello to Mr. Efune's wife and the whole class, come on.
J-j-you're not mad at me anymore?
No, I'm not.
And I really like being your friend.
Eeeeh!
"Thanks to the cherry blossoms, I made a new friend,
a childhood friend that I love very much."

I've seen that he does very strange things.
What do you mean he does strange things?
I'm convinced that what he wants to do is to gain her trust
because then he can make himself do whatever he wants.
Aha!
And couldn't it be that...

you have seen that the teacher treats this girl better than the others,
and that's why you got a little bit jealous?
What?
Don't talk nonsense.
I'm not jealous.
I'm not.
