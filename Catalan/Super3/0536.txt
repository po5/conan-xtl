(Clock: touches)
Hey, listen!
They told me about a house.
I've been told there's a scary house on Third Street.
Eh?
Which house?
You mean the one where no one lives now?
Last night I heard my mother say
that a man had gone to live there who nobody knew where he came from.
What?
You mean in the haunted house?
But he's so scary, he won't go near anyone.
We should... search.
It's our duty as members... of the Junior Detective League.
I'd rather say! Ha-ha-ha!
(Shinichi voice) "Love is eternal, mysteries, a labyrinth."
"Ready to find the way out? The hidden work of a painter."
"What mystery do you think you'll be able to decipher but you don't come out ahead?"
"The truth always ends up knowing!"
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult, and he's Detective Conan!"

"The secret of the missing artwork."
I find it very strange, that someone would want to go live in that house.
(Genta) Yes, you are right.
I'm much more interested in who lives in your house, now,
than who can live in this house
that everyone says is haunted.
(Shinichi voice) Who are you saying it for?
For Subaru Okiya?
Come on, you don't need to suffer, for him.
He thinks he's a fan of Sherlock Holmes.
I don't know what that has to do with it.
What you say is absurd.
What do you have to do, to whom I leave the house?
I can leave it to whoever I want.
If you say so...
(All) Eh?
-Oooh! -Oh, well, it's very nice!
Apparently, whoever came to live here has decided to fix it up.
Mm?
(Man) Really, it puts me in a bind.
We agreed that today was the last day, right?
Two or three more days is not the end of the world.
Think we have our rules.
I can give you until tomorrow.
Come on, you think I have no problems, me?
Come on, fuck the field!
Ah!
You don't know what you're doing.
For your sake, I advise you to keep your word.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Beika Real Estate."
What are you guys doing here? Mm?
-Did you want to tell me something? -No, it's just...
(Conan voice) Excuse me something.
How come there's no name written on the entrance?
That's right, there's no name.
Yes, I know there's no name on the entry.
I haven't had time to put it on.
I haven't yet.
Mm... Not naming the entrance is very strange, don't you think?
Yes, he must be planning something, with this big house.
(Shinichi, thinks) "And then, the next day..."
What?
You say that guy is dead? What happened?
What did he die of?
I don't know, it looks like he wasn't in very good health.
"Last night he fell to the ground,
but before he passed out, he was able to call an ambulance."
I know he didn't look like a good man, but I feel sorry for him.
I do, too.
Why did he have to go and live in that haunted house?
What do you think he was up to? We'll have to look into it.
We'll have to look into it. What?
If we don't, we'll never know, and we'll always be left in doubt.
The neighbors say they didn't know much about this man.
Yes, although he had been living in the house for 3 months,
until now he had not been related with any of the neighbors.
It seems that he hardly ever left the house.
He was always locked in the house to fix it up,
and if he went out, it was only to take care of the garden.
Maybe he didn't work there.
Mm...
Here, it's here.
This must be it, for sure.
Excuse me, sir.
Did you know the man who lived in this house?
You all knew the master, Mr. Wada?
Master?

Was this man a teacher of something?
Of course he was!
Master Wada was a famous Western-style painter
and he represented Japan.
(Shinichi, thinks) "So he was a painter, huh?"
And you are a painter too? No, I am an art dealer.
For many years I have been in charge
of selling Master Wada's works of art.
He told me that he had rented the house
to use it as a studio for his next work.
That's not what I should talk about..., sir.
No, you're right.
If anyone should think of stealing, it would be a tragedy.
It didn't take long to solve the mystery.
We already know who this man was, and what he had come to do in the house.
If he spent all day painting,
it's no wonder he never left the house.
I would like to know what picture he was painting.
-We should see it, right? -(At the same time) Oi?
(At the same time) Oi? Mm... Oh.
Can we go in?
-Let's look over there. -Yes!
Oysters!
There's nothing here.
They rented the house as a painter's studio.
That's normal.
Hey, Conan, look at this!
Conan, look at this! What?
This kid... could be the man we saw as a kid?
I guess so.
He looks a lot like him.
-What's he doing here, you guys? -What's he doing here? -Ah, nothing.
We just wanted to see this painter's paintings.
Well, I'm sorry, we couldn't find any.
And we've looked for them everywhere in the house.
How can that be?
Do you think someone stole them?
No, I don't think so.
We haven't found any coloring utensils either.
No brushes, no canvases, no paints, no nothing.
And you're sure this was the studio where he painted?
Yes, we are absolutely sure.
I assure you, I've already found it.
It's the perfect place to paint!
At last I will be able to create a great work, a work of art never seen before.
This is exactly what the master told me.
Couldn't it be that he ordered the painting utensils when he finished the painting?
Ah, it could be.
We do another look around the house.
- (man) Excuse me, Mr. Wada? MM?
We are already here.
We started tearing down the building.
(man) -What are you doing here? -What-what-what do you mean?
Ah, it's the man who argued with Mr. Wada yesterday.
-You quarreled with the master? -But Mr. Wada, where is he?
-Mr. Wada is dead. -What?!
Yes, he died tonight.
-What luck! -Eh?
What do you think you are, you?!
Someone dies and you're happy?
Oh, excuse me, it slipped out.
I-I can explain.
My name is Shishikura, and I represent Beika Real Estate.
Our company bought this lot about 3 months ago.
We wanted to demolish the house right away,
to build a new block of apartments,
but then Mr. Wada showed up.
He told us that he wanted to rent the house for only 3 months.
So we rented it to him.
3 months and that was enough.
He's not leaving?
What do you mean, he's not leaving?
Sorry, I've had to make a change of plans.
I just need a couple or 3 more days.
But for us that's a problem.
We've sold the lot to a client and we have to tear the house down.
I just need 3 more days.
This is what he told me yesterday.
And it created quite a problem for me.
(Shinichi, thinks) "That's why, they were arguing."
But anyway, now that Wada-san is gone, the problem is gone too, isn't it?
Well, let's get down to business.
Take all the furniture outside and start tearing it down.
Can't it wait?
Until we found the painting that Master Wada said he painted.
-More, though? -Don't suffer, it won't be long now.
-I don't believe it... -What do we do now, Mr. Shishikura?
I-I guess we'll have to wait now.
Hey, guys, we could help you find the painting.
Yeah, it can be a lot of fun, like looking for treasure!
Yeah, yeah, let's help them! You mean?
-Come on, let's go! -Yeah, let's go! -Yeah, let's go.
Aren't you going to look for it, you? Mm...
Think of the value it can have, the last work of Master Wada.
It's useless, you don't need to look for it.
He won't find it.
Eh?
And why not?
Hey, Conan!
Where the hell should I put it, this painting?
-Huh? -Huh?
Hey, Conan! MM?
I doubt very much that we found anything in this house.
If someone had painted a picture here,
you could smell the paint.

And I assure you, it doesn't feel a thing.
-Now that you mention it...-Yes.
Yes, it's true.
The boy is quite right.
Maybe, after all, Master Wada didn't paint anything here.
He didn't paint anything?!
(Shinichi, thinks) "If he didn't paint anything here,
then the mystery is why he rented the house."
I don't know what they're doing.
I'm starting to get fed up with waiting so long!
- (door, open) -Huh?
They must not have found anything, as far as I can see.
After so much, there's no paint, eh?
No more waiting.
Come on, you can start now.
-Yes, let's get down to business, nois. It's about time!
I've had enough of waiting.
Hello.
-Is there, Mr. Wada? -What?
I'm sorry, but Mr. Wada died tonight.
-What? Why did you want to see him?
We were supposed to meet him.
A few days ago he sent us a message.
"The work will be finished soon.
Whenever you want, you can come and see," he said.
What? Eh?
"You can come and see the work"?
-Are you sure he said that? -Yes, of course.
About 4 or 5 days ago.
Look.
(Wada voice) "Because of the bad weather, I'm late."
(Wada voice) "It took me longer to finish it than I thought it would at first,
but I'm sure it will be finished by the end of the week".
It is true.
It's her handwriting.
"Miss Eguchi."
This must be you, right?
Yes. "Kafu" what is it?
It's an old people's home, it's the place where I work.
What is it?
A nursing home?
And you're not Mrs. Saeko Takato?
Why? Do you know who she is?
Do you know who you are? -So much.
Master Wada talked about her many times.
He told me that he often went to an aunt's house when he was little,
that she had always taken good care of him
and who was now in an old people's home.
His nephew, Master Wada, had always been very good to me.
A year ago Mrs. Takato had a stroke,
and now she has amnesia, so she doesn't remember anything.
Now, the poor thing, she can't even remember how to say it.
(Shinichi, thinks) "She doesn't remember anything." I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.
But, however,
Mr. Wada always found a time to go see her.
Hey, Auntie, I'm working on a play that I made thinking of you
and I'm going to dedicate it to you.
Ah!
Wow, I'm so excited, Mrs. Takato!
You'll bring it here so we can see it, won't you?
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can bring it.
He'll have to come and see you.
Oh, will he?
Is it that big and important? MM-hm.
You've got to see, Auntie.
You'll stand so still, you'll get your memory back for sure.
The door of memory that's locked by you,
will open wide.
This means that in Wada did work on this painting here!
What's the matter?
Have you gone crazy?
Get out of the way!
-Stop this junk! -Huh?
-Kaoru, search the house again.
O-Okay!
Hey, what's he doing?
They've already searched everywhere and haven't found it.
-You haven't found it, the painting? -No, but we'll find it.
We'll find it. Eh?
No, wait!
You can't go back in!
-What do we do now, Mr. Shishikura? -Wait.
We can't do anything, if there are people inside the house now.
We have to go somewhere else, we don't have all day.
Don't waste time arguing.
Let's go to the bar for a drink.
-Yes, let's go.
Forget about this useless guy. How can you be so incompetent?
I thought we could finally get started now!
How about it, Mrs. Takato?
Shall we sit here for a while?
You can't stay here!
What do you think? About the painting?
"That they won't find anything, because most likely he didn't paint anything."
-What?
He didn't paint anything? -What?
So you think she was able to fool her aunt?
the aunt who had taken such good care of her when he was little?
I hope not, poor woman.
But if she didn't rent the house to paint a picture, why did she rent it?
why did she rent it, a haunted house?
Yes, it's a mystery.
We're back to square one.
Apparently, all she did was fix up the house...
and take care of the garden.
That's true.
Right!
I've got it!
I'll be right there!
Eh?

Mitsuhiko! Eh?
Ah, these kids are finally leaving!
Maybe we should start passing by, huh?
What?
But what about the painting?
It's sunny and a very nice day.
We walk slowly to the station.
-Can you tell me what took you? -Beika Bank.
Mr. Wada wanted to build a tunnel
from the house to that bank.
A tunnel?!
To get to the vault and rob inside.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Ha, a tunnel. How original!"
From the house to the bank, in a straight line,
it's at most 50 meters, give or take.
Just to advance 60 centimeters per day, 3 months would be enough.
He had to dig at night, and then he would take the dirt from the tunnel outside....
and dump it in the garden.
No one would be suspicious because it would look like he was tidying up.
Yeah, but he was also fixing up the house.
He was doing it to throw people off the scent.
It would have been very suspicious, if he only worked in the garden.
But what are you saying?! Remember this.
I'm sorry, I don't think I can take her.
He'll have to come and see.
(Mitsuhiko) "If he stole millions of yen,
he couldn't take them to the residence."
You have to see, Auntie.
You'll stand so still, you'll get your memory back for sure.
(Mitsuhiko) "There's no one in the world who won't stand still,
in front of a fortune worth millions of yen."
I wanted that, with such a big surprise, she would regain her memory.
-Oh, Mitsuhiko, you are a genius! Yes!
My goodness, what a headache. (Shinichi, thinks) "Ha-ha-ha!"
Hurry, let's go find the tunnel entrance!
It can't be, they're back!
(Shinichi, thinks) "This man took on the real estate company...
so that he could stay in the house longer."
Please don't go in!
Let's see if inside this closet...
But it should be connected to the basement.
Maybe he tore some wood out of the ground, to make the tunnel.
We should see if any wood is empty underneath.
-In this room, it looks like No. Come, let's look in another one.
(Shinichi, thinks) "They could make a little less noise, eh?"
"What's this?"
"At Aunt Saeko's house?"
(He thinks) "Could it be that.... No, I don't think so, it can't be."
Sir..., I'm sorry, but there has been an unforeseen event.
And because of that, we still haven't been able to...
More!
More!
More! More!
-Aaah! -I'm sorry, we have to leave.
They're waiting for us in another house.
-But you must tear down this house! -Try this yourself, see if you can.
Why... why did I... choose this job?
It's you!
It's all your fault!
(Conan voice) Don't you know this house?
I think it's the house where Mrs. Takato used to live.
You think I lived here?
It is a very... beautiful.
After the death of her husband, she lived a very difficult time,
but, before that, I understand you had a lot of money...
and that you were very happy.
-Yes, I must have lived in this house.
En-Oh...
(Shinichi, thinks) "Remind him of happy memories of the past,
that's what it was all about!"
I'll burn it down until there's nothing left!
(Imitates marching voice) What the hell are you doing?!
Stop this nonsense!
What do you want?
That the fire spreads and burns down the whole neighborhood?
I'm sorry, but you must understand... I have my reasons.
One more day.
We only ask you to wait until tomorrow, please!
(SOMICA)
What did this man want now?
(Conan voice) He doesn't mind waiting until tomorrow, to tear down the house.
(SOMICA) Wow.
But you can tear it down right now, if you want.
Yes, now they haven't found any paint anywhere.
Nor any tunnels under terra.
No wonder.
This man only rented the house
to surprise his aunt, Mrs. Takato.
He wanted to make a unique work of art
just to dedicate it to her.
And have you found it?
Do you know where it is, the work of art?
Yes, but it's not finished yet.
I imagine that tomorrow we will be able to see it.
- "Tomorrow we can see it"? - "It's not finished"?
Not yet, because today... it's too sunny.
Yes, sir, it's finished today.
What is this?
How beautiful!

The work of art was not a painting,
but a flower garden surrounding the house.
This is the artwork that Mr. Wada had been working on for the past few months.
had been working on for the past few months.
It really is a work of art, and so much of it!
Because of the bad weather,
he needed a few more days to finish it.
That's why he asked me for a few more days.
-Mrs. Takato, this place... I know it!
I remember a house, a house like this.
Soc the garden with my husband.
We are both very happy in this house.
I look at him, and smile at him.
I remember Roku, my nephew, coming to play often, in the house.
He was very little and had lost his mother.
I, at Roku, loved her like a son?
and he, to me, loved me as if I were his mother.
-Mrs. Takato, you remember! Yes, I remember!
I remember everything.
-The garden has awakened your memory! -Ah!
(Shinichi, thinks) "That's why it must have been this house."
"Because this house looks a lot like....
(Shinichi, thinks) "That's why it must be this house."
(Conan voice) Yeah, right!
The name on the entrance should have been her signature.
The signature?
Yes, that's why he decided not to put the name on the entrance, yet.
He wanted to wait... for the flowers in the garden to bloom,
because no painter ever signs a painting...
until the painting is finished.

No, if we think that with that work of art he managed...
that his aunt recovered her memory.
-That's true. Yes, that's true!
Come on, we're late! Yes, let's go!
Hey, wait for me!
Don't leave me here alone!
