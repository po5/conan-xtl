DETECTIVE CONAN
The murder of the dark street
The food was delicious.
Wasn't it, Conan?
Yes!
You ordered the most expensive items on the menu!
Wow... you're Kogoro!
-Omura, it's been a long time since we've seen each other! -You look as good as ever. -You look as good as ever.
Do you remember?
It's Mr. Omura.
Yes.
We met him at the spa.
He's Kogoro's former college classmate.
I'm so glad we ran into you.
You must have helped me figure something out.
What is it?
Every night I feel a strange noise in my apartment.
A strange noise, you say?
It's a thud, like someone knocking from outside.
Isn't it someone playing a joke on you?
I thought so too,
but I look outside, and I don't see anyone.
I've been feeling it for a week already.
Already a week ago?
Why won't you look at it?
You must help me, Kogoro.
That's good of you.
You're a lucky man.
The famous Kogoro Mouri will gladly help you!
Ha-ha!
Thank you, Kogoro.
Ah!
This is the life!
It's been a long time since I've had such a good time!
(Think) "Didn't I have to look at what the noise was?"
I'm out of beers.
I'll go buy some more.
I'll go.
(Boy humming and laughing)
(Boy humming and laughing) Shut up!
You're disturbing the neighbors!
Here we are.
It's about time!
It's been a long time, kids!
What was it, this!?
What happened, Omura?!
(Hey, Ikuta, what's wrong?!
(Ikuta!
Hey, answer me, Ikuta!
Don't play the donkey!
Ikuta!
Ikuta?!
He's... he's dead!
Ran, call the police!
Yes!
He's been hit on the head with a blunt instrument.
(Think) "There's a lot of cigarette butts..."
The victim is Yoshiro Ikuta, 20 years old,
a student at Beika University.
You were with the victim?
Yes.
My name is Kusaka.
The Ikuta was a friend from the university.
Can you explain to me what happened, exactly?
Yes... He and I were supposed to meet here at 10 o'clock at night.
But when I had just arrived, he fell to the ground.
Was anyone around?
No, sir...
But it was so dark that I might not have seen him.
This streetlight was out of order, I could hardly see the Ikuta.
How do we know it wasn't you?
-It wasn't me! (Boy) - Let me through.
Hey, stop!
-Shi... Shimizu! -Kusaka!
What's happened to you?
Who the hell are you?
My name is Shimizu.
The Ikuta and I were at a friend's house.
Where do I live, this friend?
Over there, on the fifth floor.
-What?! - The dead Ikuta?!
It can't be!
Whose is it, this floor?
It's mine, sir.
My name is taken.
I also study at Beika University.
Well, and you?
My name is Nakamura.
We're all from the university's hiking club.
(Kogoro) So the Ikuta was here with you?
Yes.
We've been here since 7:00 p.m.
What time did the Ikuta leave?
Around 10 o'clock, because Kusaka called him at 9 o'clock.
Hey, wait a minute, I didn't call him!
You didn't what?
Didn't you call him?
And so, the Ikuta was not there, and I picked up the phone.
And where did he go, the Ikuta?
To buy food.
In taken told him to go.
In Kusaka, did he call you?
Yes, I'm sure, sir.
I didn't call him!
Then why did you meet the Ikuta?
The Ikuta left me a note in my locker at the university.
-Why did he want to talk to you? -I don't know...
Just a moment... just a moment... Didn't he steal money from you, Kusaka?
What do you mean?
He stole my college tuition money.
Do you have the note?
No, sir, I threw it away.
I'm sure it's never existed, this note.
What?!
The Ikuta had stolen the money, and now he wouldn't give it back.
You were furious, you met him and killed him!
It is not true!

Besides, the Ikuta had problems with Nakamura and Taken, too.
What problems did he have, with me?
The Ikuta owed you a lot of money!
I haven't moved from here!
Right, Shimizu?
Yes.
That's true, Nakamura, but you went out for some fresh air.
Around what time?
Around 10 o'clock, before the Ikuta left.
-At the time they have assassinat. -I've been out two or three minutes!
What problem did the victim have with Taken?
6 months ago, climbing a mountain,
the Ikuta and Keiko Togawa, had an accident.
Keiko had hurt her leg.
The Ikuta went up and left her alone.
When we found her, she had already frozen to death.
Keiko was Taken's girlfriend.
Is it true, what they say?
Sometimes, when you have an accident up the mountain,
you have to swallow your tears and leave some of your teammates behind.
I didn't resent the Ikuta.
Besides, I haven't killed him because I haven't moved from here.
In taken has not moved from the floor.
He had to finish a job.
Around 10 o'clock, he was alone in the next room.
How long was he alone in the room?
About 20 minutes.
But he couldn't possibly have gone out,
because he would have had to go through this room.
But if he's a climber in Taken, he could have climbed down with a rope.
Not through that window.
I'll show you.
Look at this window.
And it doesn't open anymore, this window?
Shit!
It's impossible to get out of there.
If he was doing a job, why did he have the lights off?
What the ?!
When we were coming back from the store...
I noticed that there was no light on this floor.
Well, it's just that...
Don't wrap it up!
It doesn't mean anything!
It is impossible to enter or exit through this window.
It is innocent!
(Thinking) "Wow..."
"A shooter."
"So the only phone there is in this room."
"A red thread?"
"They're the same brand as the ones at the crime scene."
"The Ikuta would be very smoky."
Conan, where are you going?!
"The Omura's floor is below Mr. Taken's."
"Why would it be broken, the window?"
"That's strange."
"The object that broke it is not here on the floor."
"This is blood!"
"It must be the victim's? Why is it on this piece?"
-It's not blood?
-What do you say?
Yes it is.
Don't touch it.
I'll tell the inspector.
"Why are there blood stains here?"
"Mr. Ikuta was straight in the dark."
"Maybe..."
"The blood stains and where he was...
and the broken window on the Omura's floor are in a straight line!"
"This means that the rooftop of this abandoned building..."
"I was right! It's blood!"
"And that's Mr. Taken's apartment."
"I know who the killer is and I know how he did it!"
Conan, where have you been?
Instead, Ran.
AAAA!
My head is spinning.
You should all come to the headquarters.
(Kogoro voice) Just a moment, Inspector Megure!
I'll tell you the details of the crime!
I know how it went!
Do you really mean it?
We're missing the murder weapon.
That's right.
They haven't found it, at the crime scene.
Look at the blood stains
on the abandoned building next to the crime scene.
I've also found blood elsewhere.
Where are they, Kogoro?
At the time of the crime, I was at Mr. Omura's house.
Omura's house,
and something strange happened.
A strange thing?
Right after the murder, a window in the apartment was broken.
Is it related to the crime, Kogoro?
Yes, because I found blood stains on the pieces of glass!
What the hell does that mean?
Before I explain, I want you to go check something.
Someone go to the roof of the abandoned building.
If my theory is correct, you'll find blood on the railing.
Stains?!
Officer, get this looked at right away!
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Give him a walkie-talkie.
A walkie-talkie.
Yes, because I'll have to get in touch with him, Inspector.
It's blood!
Inspector, I've found it.
There's blood on the railing.
There's blood on the railing?!
Just as I imagined.
What is the meaning of this?
The wall of the abandoned building, the railing on the roof,
the broken glass in Mr. Omura's apartment...
Omura's flat...

Why do you think we found blood?
The weapon they used has passed through all 3 places.
The murderer committed the crime without being present.
The murderer was in this room, away from the crime scene.
Mr. Taken...
Taken...
the murderer is you!
This is impossible!
This is ridiculous.
How do you want the Ikuta to have died from this room?
(Kogoro voice) Does anyone have fishing line?
Fishing line?
I do.
I use it to display the models.
Bring it to us.
Yes, I'll bring it now.
Ran, fill a plastic bag with two handfuls of stones
and bring it here, please!
Hm.
All right.
Here you go, Kogoro.
What are you going to do?
Please, Inspector Megure, help me,
take a stone and tie it with two heads of fishing line.
Inspector, take this.
When you've tied it off, take Mr. Takano's shooter.
Takano,
point it at the abandoned building, and pull it tight.
It's only about 11 meters.
Two and a half cabs.
Anyone can hit the target at this distance.
Tell Agent Takagi to untie the string
and pass it underneath the stained railing
and tie the two strings to the railing.
Now take the rope from the shelf.
The rope?
You mean this one?
Tie one end of the rope to one end of the fishing line.
You mean like this?
Then stretch the other end of the fishing line.
That's it.
What do you plan to do, from the string?
Ran, tie the plastic bag on the other end of the string!
Got it.
Tie it tight, making sure the stones don't fall.
Look, there you go, Father.
Kogoro!
You mean with this...
What, inspector?
Now you're beginning to understand?
Inspector, I'm on the wall! All right, let's get started!
Eh?
What shall we start, Inspector?
Officer, how did it go, that?
The bag has passed by the victim's location
and crashed near where the blood is!
That's how Mr.
Taken killed Mr.
Ikuta.
Then he lifted the bag,
and thus removed the weapon from the crime scene.
Inspector!
The bag ended up under the broken window!
Kogoro, the noise you felt these days was related...?
That's right, Mr. Taken was a trainee.
But tonight something unexpected happened.
The gun hit the window.
For it has broken the glass!
Taken.
The Ikuta was under that streetlight
because in Kusaka had told him to stay there, right?
If I had not called him, the setup would not have worked.
Mr. Kusaka didn't call.
Kusaka didn't call.
You called, Mr. Taken.
This can't be right.
We felt the phone ring!
I just had to put a tape with the sound of a telephone ringing
into this radio cassette,
and set it to ring at a certain time.
Then all I had to do was pretend I was talking to Mr. Kusaka.
Kusaka.
Mr.
Taken also left the note in Mr. Kusaka's closet.
Kusaka
to pin the blame on him.
But listen, Kogoro,
how did you hit the victim's head?
The lamppost was broken and the area was dark.
He wanted to make it look impossible, that's why he broke the lantern!
But he couldn't know where the victim was.
Even if there was no light,
Mr. Taken knew where the victim was.
I don't have a sonar like bats.
Ran, when he saw Mr.
Ikuta, coming back from the store, what was he doing?
Nothing.
He was standing straight under the broken down streetlight.
Oh yes, and he was smoking.
Mr.
Ikuta was a heavy smoker, he always had a cigarette in his mouth.
Mr.
Taken, you have directed the gun
using the light of the cigarette as a guide.
You turned off the lights in the room
so that no one would see the gun fall toward the street.
So, the gun should still be over here.
It should be a bag full of rocks!
They searched the room.
But they won't find any bag full of stones!
Mr.
Taken, you're wearing thick socks, for this time of year.
Aren't they climbing socks?
How ingenious!
You have turned the socks inside out and filled them with stones.
After the murder, he threw them into the aquarium,
turned the socks inside out and put them on.
The proof is that a red thread from the socks has remained in the fish tank.
These socks would not break even if they were filled with stones.

If I am not mistaken there should be blood, inside these socks.
The blood of Mr.
Ikuta's blood!
Won't it do you any good to look at me, Mr. Taken?
Anyway, there won't be.
Taken!
The motive for the crime was Keiko's death?
That's right, sir.
When you have an accident in the mountains, you have to leave a partner behind.
I had told myself many times that I shouldn't hate Ikuta.
But whenever I thought that I would never see Keiko again,
I felt alone in this world,
so lonely that I thought I would go crazy.
One day, I walked into a bar and....
Keiko had the bar to break up with me.
I got angry and left her in the middle of that storm!
He-he-he-he!
Oh, you're so mean.
I couldn't forgive you!
How dare you let my dear Keiko die for what ?!
It couldn't be!
And I couldn't forgive Kusaka, because he laughed!
And everything went just as Mr. Mouri explained.

DETECTIVE CONAN
Beer tastes better, when you've solved a difficult case!
Kogoro, listen, it's getting late.
Why don't we go get some sleep?
Come on, let's go!
Let's drink until morning like in the old days!
Aren't you tired?
I'm in great shape.
As if I had taken a nap!
(Think) "Sure, like you did, you clown!"
Ran, what's wrong with you?
Tonight is the weaver's party,
and all the lovers are meeting.
Who knows what he should do... Shinichi...
(Thinking) "Ran..."
Surely Shinichi must be looking at the stars, too, now.
You're right.
Hey, you must be in Heihachiro Shiota, right?
(Thinks) "At Heihachiro Shiota ?!"
"This old man is that famous private detective?"
It's a murder case!
I don't want anyone to move!
(Think) "It's happened right in front of my face!"
