(Door: doorbell)
(Cat: meow)
Hehehe!
- (meowing)
-Hehehehe!
Oh!
Nyan-chan, at last I see you again!
Thank you very much, Mr. Detective.
Mm-hm.
Wow!
Look at me looking for cats,
I'm such a famous detective!
Didn't it pay well?
Well, that's what counts, after all.
Yes, that's right.
Well, now that you've been paid, why don't we go make a good meal, eh?
Ah, is that why you came?
Do you think you can't see the duster?
Hehe!
Since it's already one o'clock, we'll go to a fast food place.
I'll go there one day when I'm alone.
Can't we go to a nice restaurant?
What did you say?
Rat.
(Woman) Aaaaah!
(Woman) Me?
I didn't say anything.
Yes.
It looks to me like it's coming from a floor below.
(Woman) Oh!
What's happened here?
It seems that they have entered the floor and, in addition, there is blood on the ground.
- (woman) No, it has made us too afraid.
- (Kogoro) You haven't entered?
(Kogoro) I get it.
Well, you guys stay here.
I'll go in.
(Kogoro) Oh!
(Kogoro) Oh!
Nothing to do, he's already dead.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Please, somebody call the police.
Listen up!
What about the other woman at the door?
(woman) -Huh?
- (woman) Saki!
Oh... oh...
-Saki!
(woman) -Oh!
(woman) Oh!
Stop it!
Saki!
Saki!
Come on, wake up!
Miss, step aside, please.
She's dead.
Oh, no!
Oh.

"The secret of the rich couple."
(Camera: shoot)
Well, let's see: you three were at the door of the apartment,
you saw that something had happened
and when you were about to call the police, this man appeared.
Yes, it went like this.
Then Conan and I went into the apartment to see what had happened
and we found this man dead in this room and all full of blood.
Wow!
And then they found the woman dead in the closet in the room
and finally they called the police.
Yes, that's what happened.
Hm.
Well, why were you three at the door of the apartment at that time?
I came
because these two people had asked me to open the apartment.
As I'm the concierge, I have the keys.
I...
I wanted to come in because I was asked
to come and pick up a package.
And I had arranged with Saki that I would go shopping with her.
I came to pick her up because that's not where we had arranged to meet.
Inspector Megure.
Very well, all right.
Ah, Takagi.
What do you know at the moment?
It turns out that all the neighbors in the building were out of their homes...
and, so far, we haven't found any clues that might be of any use to us.
But this couple's credit cards, bank books...
and this couple's jewelry are missing;
they're gone.
Looking at the mess all over the apartment,
I'd say someone broke in here with the intent to rob.
And have you identified the victims?
The man found dead in this living room was named Seiichi Maehara,
he was 32 years old and a stockbroker.
Or rather, he was a stock market speculator.
It seems that the cause of death are the stab wounds
stabbed him in the chest with a knife,
which caused a hemorrhage and that is why he bled to death.
It is clear that he had recently made a lot of money in the stock market,
because there are transfers of millions of yen in his account.
This information was confirmed to us by his stockbroker.
Therefore, the murderer must have wanted his money, right?
Most likely, yes.

And what do we know about the woman they found in the closet?
She is Mr. Maehara's wife.
Her name was Saki, she was 29 years old and a housewife.
The cause of death appears to have been asphyxiation.
She couldn't breathe through her nose or mouth.
At what time did the deaths occur?
According to the coroner's calculations
the man must have died around 11 o'clock and the woman a little later,
maybe around half past.
Hm?
(Chiba) Inspector.
I have some important information:
At about 11 o'clock in the morning someone who is probably the culprit
appears on the recording of the camera at the entrance of the building.
Oh, is that so?
I've printed out some images from the recording.
Hm... It's so obscured, it will be very difficult to recognize them.
Does anyone of you know who this person might be?
-I don't.
-No.
No wonder.
But, besides, there is still a detail:
the security camera on the emergency staircase is broken.
Yes.
The one in the emergency staircase?
(Hayashi) Ah, yes, it was broken two days ago.
It seems to me that it was the work of some scoundrel.
What a coincidence!
We have the images of this person
entering and leaving the building through the main entrance.
I would say that the broken camera
has nothing to do with this murder.
I think we can assume that the mysterious person
has something to do with the death of Mr. and Mrs. Maehara.
Maehara.
Distribute these images
and start searching all over the city.
(Agents) Yes.

(Agents) Hey.
Boy, I've looked for you everywhere.
Head for home.
Should we go now?
Let the police do their job.
They'll find the killer.
My work is done.
I agree.
Well, inspector, we'll be on our way.
Uh... Inspector.
Very well, then.
Thank you. Thank you.
Look: the agents have found this.
Say.
Oh!
And what is it?
Since it's all dirty with blood,
I guess it's the weapon with which they committed the murder.
Hey, Chiba, where did they find it, this bag?
It was the garbage can in this building.
Huh?
Hm...
That's a lie.
I can't believe what you're saying.
All right, calm down, please.
Ooh!
Some officers who were investigating the area called in
and they said that they discovered
that Mrs. Maehara bought in a hardware store
the clothes worn by the person who broke in.
-It's hard to believe.
-It can't be.
Saki would never be able to do something like that.
I understand that she doesn't want to believe that her friend was a murderer,
but they found a hair stuck inside the cap...
and they correspond to Mrs. Maehara.
In other words, this is a set-up.
Mrs. Maehara has committed a premeditated murder.
There is no doubt that she wanted to be recorded by the security camera.
It is now clear why the security camera in the stairwell of the
the security camera on the emergency stairs was broken.
Why do you say this?
Yes.
I'm sure after she left the building disguised as a burglar,
she threw her clothes in the dumpster
and re-entered through the fire escape,
where she already knew the camera was broken.
But the hardest thing to explain is why she drowned.
Maybe it's not as strange as it seems.
It is possible that it was an accident
when she wanted to make it look like she was also a victim.
"She must have tied her hands and feet and locked herself in the closet,
but she was buried in her clothes and couldn't breathe."
A most unfortunate accident,
but in fact, the real victim in all of this is the husband,
who died at the hands of the wife.
Oooh... Saki!
It can't be!
I can't believe it!
(Cries)
And I suppose she arranged for the three of you to come here
to find the corpse in the living room and her in the closet.
What?
I did?
(Crying) Oh, no!
Hm?
Saki!
Saki!
Come on, wake up!
Hm?
Ah!
Are you still here?
Go on, go home, I said.
Now we're really late to go eat somewhere.
(Guts: snoring)
I'm starving.
Wow!
What a mess!
All these expensive clothes will come out wrinkled.
On the outside people can make it look like anything they want,
but the hidden places show who they are.
Hm?
Oh!
Hey, Conan, don't tattle.
"Oysters! What if...?"
Excuse me, Inspector.

Inspector, the forensic scientist's report has arrived and everything checks out,
because she says that they have found traces of Mrs. Maehara herself
to the ropes with which she had tied herself.
No, there were no other prints on the ropes.
And there are no other prints?
On the other hand, in the seal of the mouth
there were Miss Hori's fingerprints.
It is not strange at all.
They must have been there when you removed the seal.
I'm sorry, I didn't know what I was doing.
I didn't know what I was doing.
Well, well, well!
This confirms that the second victim has flirted herself.
Oh, my goodness!
Excuse me, could I go, please?
It's just that I have a lot of packages to finish delivering.
Uh... Yes, I also have a lot of work to do, still.
As we have already found the culprit, you can go now.
Well, bye.
Ouch!
Aaah... aaah... aaah... aaah...
Mr. Mouri!
(Kogoro voice) One moment, please.
But what's gotten into you?
Let's not be hasty.
This case is not solved.
What do you say, now, Mouri?
Didn't we say that...?
I don't understand what you mean.
There's something strange here.
"After a short time of searching,
"a garbage bag turned up
"with the murder weapon all smeared with blood in the building's dumpster."
But does it seem normal to you
that the murderer has left such obvious evidence
in such an easy-to-find place?
Maybe he thought he could retrieve it right away.
Today is Saturday.
The garbage won't be picked up until Monday.
That means the weapon would have been in the dumpster for two whole days.
Yes.
Hm.
That's true.
This makes me think that, surely,
the container was only a temporary hiding place
and that the culprit was planning to hide the weapon in a better place later.
But before he could move it, the crime was discovered.
This is what must have happened, right?
And the conclusion this leads us to
is obvious: that he had an accomplice.
Eh?
Mouri, explain what you mean.
As I said,
the murderer wanted to hide that knife as soon as she could...
but, of course, that ran into a snag:
According to her script, she had to be locked in the closet.
To hide the knife in a safe place, she would have needed time?
and, besides, she might have been seen and her alibi would have run out.
Yes, that's true.
That's why I said that we must necessarily come to the conclusion that Mrs. Maehara had an alibi.
that Mrs. Maehara had an accomplice.
Yes, I understand that,
but how do you explain the gun showing up in the dumpster,
which is not what she had planned?
I see.
I guess what happened
is that there was some problem between her and the accomplice.
That's why the murder weapon was still the dumpster.
And that means...
In the end, the killer was killed by her accomplice.
Eh?
-Hmm?
-Hmm? -Hmm?
Look at the seal that covered Mrs. Maehara's mouth:
there is not one brand of lipstick, but several.
This means that when the accomplice wanted to cover her mouth,
Mrs. Maehara resisted.
If she had put the seal on herself, there would only be one lipstick mark,
there would only be one brand of lipstick.
Yes, that's true.
Oh!
Also, look at the cabinet and the one inside.
Hm?
Hm?
I don't get it.
I don't know what you mean.
(Kogoro) Can't you see there are too many clothes in this closet?
All these expensive and good clothes will be wrinkled and spoiled.
(Kogoro) Yes, you are right.
But it turns out that there are also T-shirts and sweaters in here,
which are usually kept in a drawer, not hanging in a closet.
Man, about that there is no written rule.
There are houses where they keep T-shirts and sweaters hanging on hangers.
Of course there are!
There are.
But look at them:
the contents of this closet is a very strange mixture.
In addition to clean clothes, there are also dirty and wrinkled ones.
And there is also some that was folded in a drawer and is now hanging.
Neither the dirty nor the folded ones should be here.
(Sniffs) Yes, it's true.
Mr. Mouri is right: there are clothes here that have already been worn.
And there are also pieces that smell of tobacco.
This sweater has been folded for a long time.
This means that the accomplice has moved the clothes around
because it looks like the murderer drowned by accident.

But then, who is this accomplice you say?
Miss Hori,
why did you run to Mrs. Maehara when I told you not to?
Because I wanted to see if she was all right.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
Is that so?
You didn't do it so that you would be the one to discover the corpse?
What? Mouri, explain where you're going, please.
Mouri, explain what you're getting at, please.
She wanted to be the first to touch the corpse to hide the fact
that there were your fingerprints on the evidence.
Isn't it true?
Of course it's true!
Because we would think that the fingerprints were then.
-But they were already there.
-Oh! -Oh!
All this you say is not true.
I was just suffering because of how Saki was.
You're not willing to confess?
Very well, then.
Then show us what's in your bag, please.
Why are you asking me?
I'm sure Mrs. Maehara has hidden everything she had stolen,
but if she threw the murder weapon in the dumpster,
I imagine she's done the same with her loot.
And if the police couldn't find, for the time being,
it's most likely that the accomplice has kept everything for her.
Open the bag, please, Miss Hori.
What is this?
Miss, why did you do that?
I went up to Saki's house by the emergency stairs.
You're late.
Now you must just listen and do what I tell you, as usual.
Oh!
What's the matter with you?
Are you afraid?
Now don't you dare back down, Maiko.
You're my accomplice.
It's like you killed the Seiichi, too.
I didn't.
Yes, you did.
You're as guilty as I am.
The knife is in the trash.
Make it disappear.
Ah!
Ah!
Hmm... hmm... hmm... hmm...
Hmmm... hmmm... hmmm... hmmm...
Ah... ah...
Since it was time for the messenger to arrive,
I rushed out the door.
I didn't have time to get the knife out of the trash.
Even if they found the gun,
I thought the police would only think of Mrs. Maehara.
-Yes.
-Wouldn't they?
She always told me what to do.
She had also told me that she would give me a share of Seiichi's life insurance.
of Seiichi's life insurance.
But in the end I was too afraid
and I understood that I couldn't let her boss me around all my life...
...and I wanted to free myself from her to decide on my own.
