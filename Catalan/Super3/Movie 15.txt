(gasps)
Aaaah!
(Dog, far away: barks)
(Dog, closer: continues barking)
With you all, Governor Asakura.
- (people: applaud)
(People: applaud) -Go ahead, you have the floor.
Dear fellow citizens, Tokyo residents...
and train enthusiasts from all over the country,
thank you for waiting.
The Tohti line, the 15th line of the Tohti subway system, is now open,
the 15th line of the city's subway system!
(Takagi) "Blackmail? And they sent it to the governor?"
Mr. Asakura received this note in the mail yesterday afternoon.
yesterday afternoon.
No return address is recorded.
"Have no doubt that heaven will punish you for your overbearing attitude
at the head of the Tokyo government."
"Authoritarian attitude."
During the first term of the legislature,
the governor has had a good reputation.
Well, it goes as it goes, it's all a matter of taste.
You don't know what logic or irrational rage
people can move against someone.
It is just as it says in Shiratori.
Tomorrow Asakura will attend the opening ceremony of the Tohti line.
And we have been tasked with protecting the governor.
A warning to everyone: don't let your guard down.
(Megaphone: woman) "The governor has already boarded the train."
(Mitsuhiko) I can't wait to see the Space Fair!
Besides, there will be a spaceship simulator!
Oh, yeah, I'm going to want to go on it!
Oops, looks like you know who's deep in thought.
What's up?
Are you worried about what Mr. Mouri heard Inspector Megure say about
to Inspector Megure about the blackmail note the governor received?
Yes.
I hope nothing will happen.
"(Metro: door closing warning signal)"
-It's extraordinary.
-Today is a great day.
We have now entered the new Yamate tunnel.
Come to think of it, this tunnel meets the Tohti line?
Yes.
It conflates with the Toht line and a piece underneath.
It's a one-kilometer stretch, almost parallel.
Now comes the curve.
When we turn, we'll come to the confluence with the Tohti line.
Ah, so...
Conan, what does this represent?
"I thought I saw the silhouette of a person."
"It was an emergency exit,
"But there was no car or motorcycle parked,
and he was holding something in his hand."
"But..."
"It can't be!"
Doctor!
Stop the car!
Bombs!
How?
They have put bombs inside this tunnel!
-Bombs, you say?
-What?
Bombs?
But..., but it's that...
I can't stop until the next emergency exit.
(Inaudible)
Conan!
(Cars: horns)
(Cars: horns)
"It was on, the activation lamp?"
"Fucking hell!"
(Mobile)
"I'm in Kudo!"
Yes, here in Megure.
"Stop the train immediately!"
Bombs are about to explode!
Bombs?
Come, Takagi!
(knocking)
-There are bombs!
-Stop the train!
(Shouting)
(Noise getting louder and louder)
-No, it is not.
-An earthquake?
Come on, the train has left!
It's the Toth line!
Kudo!
Wow!
I'd put my hand in the fire that there's a curve ahead!
Hold it!
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
(People: murmur of voices)
Are we saved?
Governor, are you all right?
Yes... Yes, I'm fine.
Thank you very much.

DETECTIVE CONAN.
FIFTEEN MINUTES OF SILENCE
"I am teenage detective Shinichi Kudo."
"One day, I went to the amusement park with Ran Mouri.
"my best friend and classmate,
"And I witnessed a suspicious exchange
between two men dressed in black."
"I was so focused on watching those two men,
that I didn't realize there was another one behind me."
"He made me swallow a poison
"And, when I woke up....
(Conan voice)... my body had shrunk!"
"If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
they would want to kill me and the lives of those around me would be in danger."
"That's why Dr. Agasa
recommended that I hide my identity."
"When the Ran asked me what my name was,
I randomly told him I called myself Conan Edogawa."
"Since Ran's father is a detective,
"I decided to go live with them
to get information about the Men in Black."
"These are my classmates:
Genta, Mitsuhiko and Ayumi."

"All 3 created the Junior Detective League,
and they decided to make me a member of the group."
"And... this man is in Kogoro Mouri."
"I don't need to tell you anything else, do I?"
"These are two of Doctor Agasa's inventions."
"Doctor Agasa has invented all kinds of special devices for me,
adapted to my present size."
"This is the ball ejector belt."
"If I press the button on the buckle, it inflates the ball and ejects it."
"It's super useful."
"And the last gadget is this high-performance snowboarding board."
"When you put your foot on the binding,
the board moves even if it doesn't go downhill."
"It has a turbo engine, just like the skateboard."
By the way, there is another person who knows my identity....
besides Dr. Agasa: Ai Haibara.
"His name is actually Shiho Miyano."
"He used to be part of the Men in Black gang,
but because of something that happened he wanted to commit suicide."
"He swallowed the same drug that I had been forced to take
and her body shrank."
"So, the doctor took her into his house," she said,
"And Ai and I started a new life...
as first graders."
Soc small, but I have the brain of an adult.
A detective who solves all mysteries!
The truth always ends up knowing!
Plastic explosives have been used.
A series of devices
activated by a timer for remote control.
According to information provided by Conan Edogawa,
who fortunately was able to see it,
it appears that the perpetrator of the attack
pressed the button on the remote control
once he confirmed that the subway had passed over his head.
The subway runs at 60 per hour.
From where the suspect was to the bomb site is about 250 meters.
Therefore, it is very likely...
that the countdown was only 15 seconds.
If the engineer had not slammed on the brakes... the train would have been hit by the bombs,
the train would have been hit by the explosion
"... and, no doubt, everything would have ended in tragedy."
But how can that be?
What a disaster.
Who was the person who called you
to tell you to stop the train, inspector?
Well, it's just that...
Let's say the person who called is a police collaborator.
In any case, neither the governor nor any other passengers on the train...
have been injured.
Of that... please, Inspector..,
keep my identity secret, as always.
Considering the kind of work I do, I don't want to have any more enemies.
"The kind of work you do... That you're not a high school student?"
Also, it's worth noting...
that thanks to Conan's intervention it's been a miracle
that not a single car was affected by the deflagrations.
How is it that this Conan
was aware of the existence of the bombs?
It seems that he knew
that there was a possibility of a bomb threat,
because that is what Mr. Mouri, who was present here, had told him.
-Mr. Mouri, what can you tell us?
-Me?
"You mean I told him about this?"
Mr. Mouri, can you provide any information about the suspect?
Eh?
Ahem...
This was unforgivable.
Not only did he have the goal of making an attempt on the governor's life,
but he also wanted to destroy...
one of the most outstanding projects of his term of office,
the new line of the subway network!
Can you tell us what you know so far about the suspect?
Unfortunately, the emergency exit in question, built inside the tunnel, cannot be destroyed,
built inside the tunnel, cannot be inspected.
In any case, we believe the suspect has fled...
(TV: Shiratori) "... through the emergency exit ramp that leads to the freeway.
that leads to the highway just above it."
"But we still don't have any witnesses who can confirm it."
"In Conan also told us that he doesn't know what the suspect looks like,
and that he couldn't say the age or sex either."
"Police are investigating whether any person
"May have had a feeling of disappointment or anger.
"over Governor Asakura's four-year term of office
that may have driven her to commit this attack."
"Nothing else, then."
(TV: male) "So much for the broadcast
from the Tokyo police press room."
But how can that be?
Is it already over?

They haven't said anything about us,
the members of the Junior Detective League.
-Come on, let's play for a while.
-How unfunny.
-Yeah, let's go!
-Good idea.
Well, apparently, it won't be easy to find the culprit.
(Shinichi voice) Hey, doctor.
What if the blackmail...?
What if it was a strategy to hide the real reason for the attack?
Eh?
To hide the motive?
Hey, doctor, the governor had been the Minister of the Interior,
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, right?
According to the information I have received,
during his tenure as minister he destroyed an entire village
to make a swamp.
Yes, he did.
I remember.
It was the Kitanosawa swamp.
Minister Asakura went to the village himself,
"He promised compensation to the villagers
and offered them alternative land."
"He stayed in the village for a week to talk to all the villagers."
"Once he gained their trust,
he got them to agree to leave the village
and settle on the new land."
"It took three years to make the new village."
"The intake was built in only 5 years,
faster than I could have ever imagined."
It was said that the Asakura
had built a great work of civil engineering.
You are right about that.
However, it seems that some villagers?
didn't agree until the very end.
Of course they did!
If the construction of the swamp was the real reason for this attack...
The culprit would be someone from the village
or someone who had something to do with it, of course.
But it is only one of the possibilities.
It turns out that next Sunday there will be a ceremony
commemorating the fifth anniversary of the founding of the new town.
The governor was to attend, and there was to be an overnight stay.
But because of all this, the visit has been cancelled.
I understand.
Now, you want to go to the village to investigate it, don't you?
(Conan voice) Yes.
Of it..., what would you take me, doctor?
-Oh!
(Conan voice) Oh!
-Where do you want to go now?
-It's not fair, you always go!
-We want to come too!
But, hey, you guys didn't go to play, did you?
But why?
If the doctor goes, I'll come too.
Because if I don't keep an eye on him, he'll get fat for sure.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"Well, he's not little, of degrees, I find."
(Festive music)

-Oh, what nerves!
-It's almost our turn.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
BRR!
How cold it is!
Well, we're lucky the snow is soft!
-Come on, let's go, let's go down again!
-It's great!
-Yes!
-Yes!
Yes, again.
These 3 are having a blast.
(Agasa) I'm glad I let them come.
Anyway, I guess it's all right.
Hey, no, no, no, no, wait, Sonoko.
Come on, Ran!
Excuse me, excuse me.
Don't push me!
Why did you have to come, Ran and Sonoko?
And so...
It's here.
The long-awaited open-air baths.
Where you can...
men and women can bathe together!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
The mixed baths I've always dreamed of!
Where perhaps a sexy lady is waiting for me,
a beautiful maiden.
Come on, let's go.
Oh.
It's over there!
Ahem... Of it... how nice to be, in the water.
What a level, isn't it?
To be able to take a hot spring bath outdoors... when you travel.
Oi, Miss?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
-I don't know.
Everything looks good!
-What do you guys want to eat?
Wow!
It's good, the pop!
Yes, and the grilled squid.
The rice cake is great too!
Come on, let's eat as much as we can.
Ahem!
You must guess a riddle.
What?
What is the most suitable food to serve outdoors
in a stall where there is powdery snow?
Choice number 1: roasted sweet potatoes.
Option number 2: rice cakes.
Option number 3: grilled squid.
Option number 4: pop rolls.
-Snow as soft as flour.
-You know what it is, powdery snow?
Like flour?
Like flour...
Flour..., flour... I've got it!
It's the 4, the pop bag!
What's that?
Why is that?
Maybe because it uses flour.
With my mother we make a lot of rolls.
The Kazuha told me

which the Kansai district calls "flour food".
Ah!
How nice.
Wouldn't that be too simple an answer, this one?
I'm sure it's more far-fetched.
Sorry, don't look for three feet to the cat.
So now, another riddle.
Do you know which of the four meals is the most suitable for the doctor?
The answer is "none".
For they all contain fats.
"Man..., this is no riddle."
-Let's eat!
-Well, then, if you'll excuse us....
Until the body tells us enough!
We'll eat for you!
What do you think?
Shall we eat?
Yes.
We'll eat your share, doctor.
And what about you two, Ai and Conan?
Nor me.
I don't feel like it.
I'd rather go for a walk around the village.
I think I'll go with Conan, then.
No, doctor!
You'll come and have tea with me.
(Agasa) Aaaah!
(Man) A map of Kitanosawa village?
Yes.
And also a guide to the swamp, please.
(Agasa) Understood.
(Agasa) Wait a moment.
Ep, Yama.
It looks like the ski resort has gone bankrupt.
Yes, it's been explained to me.
There seems to have been a lot of avalanches.
Thank you for waiting.
Here is the topographic map of the dam area.
And this is a map of the original Kitanosawa village, at the same scale.
You see, he insists he wants to locate the site of the reservoir...
where the house where he was born is, which was submerged under water.
Oh, right.
-Yes. -Yes.
-Come on, let's go.
Oops!
Eh?
Oops you.
Excuse me, sir, it's a taser, isn't it?
Funny you should know that.
I use it for protection.
In Tokyo I work as an investigator for an insurance company,
and I've encountered many dangerous situations.
And, of course, I always carry it with me when I go out.
Thank you. Goodbye, kid.
Goodbye, kid.
Thanks for waiting for you.
Let's see... A map of Kitanosawa village and a guide to the swamp.
Thank you very much!
Of course...
Here it is.
Do you know if the person who was against the construction of the reservoir until the very end
now lives in the new village?
And why do you want to know that?
It's because of the free work they've put us on for the winter vacations.
In first grade, sir.
And you, what course are you going to?
Well, I think it will be much better if you choose another subject,..,
as for example..., you see that poster?,
there are a lot of swans, here, in the Sawajiri lake,
which is near the village.
And if you do an observation work on the swans?
Sawajiri Lake is a thermal area and does not freeze,
and no ice sheets are made in winter.
Ah, okay, I'll think about it.
"Just as I guessed, they don't want to talk to a child."
(Genta) Oh, what a pain!
Come on, take this.
(Genta) Thank you very much.
If you drink this, you'll feel much better.
You'll get rid of the stomach ache from the empacho.
Of course it will!
That's what you get for eating 10 plates of pop rolls!
I didn't think it was that much either.
-I'm sorry...
-What are you talking about?
Now what grade do I go to?
-We're going to first!
-First grade!
-Yes.
-Ah!
To first grade.
(Vital signs measuring device: regular pip)
(Ayumi) What a good food!
It was.
And with some eels on top of the rice it would have been....
I mean... how can you eat so much?
It's amazing what you can fit in your belly.
It's just that Genta has a stomach with walls of steel.
And he could eat more!
Ah!
By the way... We bought a gift for Miss Kobayashi!
Do you have eel cake cookies?
-What a good idea!
My goodness, and she's still thinking about eating.
Yes.
Come on, let's go, Conan.
(Kogoro) I'm going to the room.
"Snowshoeing trip. Sawajiri Lake."
Excuse me, miss.
What do you want, handsome?
Does this snowshoeing trip go all the way to the swamp?
Man... if there's anyone who wants to go, we could go.
Pretty much.
What are you interested in the swamp, you?
(Ayumi) I don't know what to buy.
And if we take these bone cakes?
No, we take this owl!
It looks very intellectual!
Oh, what should I get?
A cup with a handle?
"I like white swans."
Ah!
In Japanese it's "Shiratori"!
Aaaatxum!
Mm?
What do you have, Shiratori?
A cold?
No, I can't catch any cold until we catch the culprit of the case.

I don't even know if I'll finish winter next year.
(Sonoko) Hey, Ran, how about this?
To give it to Makoto.
What do I think?
Ah, yeah, it's nice, it's really cute.
It looks a little like you.
It looks a bit like you. Huh?
Oh, it does?
Does it?
No.
Me for who?
You don't buy anything?
You know, for Shinichi.
Ah, there's no...
Buy-a-gift!
Even if I did buy him something,
he must be investigating some case, and he won't be there.
If you leave him untethered and let him run around freely,
he'll be leashed by another girl, you know what I mean.
"Leash? That I'm a dog or that I?"
Ah... I guess Makoto should also run freely.
Well, maybe...
Maybe I'll do a trick.
You're right.
"Oh, no!"
(Mobile)
"Ah, Shinichi."
(Shinichi voice) Hello?
Eh?
"You wouldn't say step where I am."
In the town of Kitanosawa, Niigata Prefecture.
I've come to the Snow Festival.
"What's up?"
Oh.
Wow!
The lighting is beautiful,
and besides, it's snowing, it's like a dream world...
Shinichi, I'd love to show you.
Come on, if it's as fantastic as you say it is,
I would have loved to see it.
"What would you like me to take you?"
Well... Anything.
What do you mean, anything?
You have to tell me something.
"Wow. And what's the stuff?"
A lot of things: for example, they have bone cakes.
"A wooden owl..., and a cup with a swan on it."
(Thinking) "Swan, and... Let's see..."
"Perfect, the owl."
Okay, so the owl.
"Of it..., I don't know when you'll be able to give it to me,
leave it on the shelf in the dining room at home."
Oysters.
How come you never come home?
I know...
"Where are they going at this hour?"
"Shinichi?"
I'm sorry, I can't talk right now.
I'll see you!
Eh?
Shinichi?
"Just in case..."
Come on.
But if it's...
the gift I just told you about...
Okay, the owl then.
But what if it's... Shinichi...?
Uuuuh!
Hurry, more hurry!
I really wanted to try the bike!
Yes, it's great!
Wow, it's cool, it's like a roller coaster!
-So now...!
-It's super exciting!
-That's dangerous!
-Hey, hey, Genta...!
Don't worry, I'll handle it!
Leave it to me!
-There in front!
-People!
(Calling)
(Ayumi) Genta, I think we've left the snowmobile area.
What's that?
Are you sure?
I don't like it!
It's forbidden to ride here.
(Ayumi) What?
Don't smoke!
Okay, we turn tail.
(knock)
(Genta) Hey, are you alive?
(Mitsuhiko) I think so.
(Ayumi) I guess the snow has made a pillow.
We have a problem.
As it is, it doesn't look like we can fix it.
So what are we going to do?
And it doesn't seem to want to stop snowing.
We're too far to walk back.
And, on top of that, I don't think any cars will get through.
(Genta) We'll get out!
Don't worry, man, we still have this.
(Shinichi's voice) These kids!
They should have gone out alone!
Gee, how fortunate that now with the skateboard...
you can also go on a snowy road.
Yes, it's going well.
Eh?
I'll be right down.
(Genta) It does take a while, in Conan.
But it's warm, inside a hole in the snow, isn't it?
- (noise)
-Yes.
Eh?
(Genta) - Eh?
-Listen!
Let him hear it?
Yes!
It's Conan!
-Oh, you've come too!
-You took your time, Conan! -You took your time, Conan!
I was a little worried,
Conan is not used to skateboarding in the snow.
Well... Well, well...
It seems to me that we won't be able to solve it if we don't get help from an adult.
We'll call the doctor to come and pick us up by car.
What?
I didn't want the doctor to know.
That's why I asked you to come and rescue us on the sly.
There's no other way!
First of all...
It was Genta's fault!
He got carried away with emotion!
And you were having fun, weren't you, Mitsuhiko?
But one has to know where the limit is!
-What?
-You have to think more before you act.
Hey, will you stop, please?
Are you insinuating that I don't think?
Ha!
You mean you think?
Oh, I think so much!

Well, you know what I say?
-What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?
That you're santet for life!
-Well, I'm telling you the same thing!
-People, you're a...
You want to stop!?
You two.
I don't want you to say anything more.
Once something has been said, it can no longer be erased.
You must keep that in mind, that.
-But...
-But Conan...
The pen is better than the sword.
If you misuse words, they become deadly weapons.
You can damage a lifelong friendship
because of a few misspoken words.
And to think that, once the line is crossed,
you may never see each other again.
(Car: horn)
(Ayumi) Ah!
Here comes a car!
Okay, I'll be back in a while.
Tell everyone not to worry.
Yes.
"Okay, be careful."
Listen.
Almost apologize, when we get there.
We'll apologize.
-Yeah, Genta.
Me too.
-I'm... I'm sorry, Mitsuhiko.
He was very lucky, guys.
If he hadn't promised a person to meet him at the hotel,
I wouldn't have passed by a place like this at this hour.
You don't live in Kitanosawa village, do you?
I live alone in the hut
that I built on the other side of the mountain.
-Huh?
You make wooden owls?
-I cut wooden owls.
Are you the one who makes them?
I make the small ones, in the cabin.
I used to live in the village,
but since it was submerged at the bottom of that hateful swamp...
It was a disgrace for the village.
Swamp...
That project should not have carried out more of life.
So, you must be...
the one who was against the construction of the swamp until the end.
Yes, that's me.
The villagers who were against it at the beginning,
including my parents,
went to live on the land offered to us by those people.
Damn this village!
We are sorry!
But how...!
Come on, Mr. Mouri, it seems that the three of them are very sorry.
Yeah, but it's just that...
Thank you for taking them here.
And also...
You're welcome.
I don't know what they would have done without you.
Anyway, I just happened to be coming to the hotel.
Well, then... I'm off.
Oh, you are?
Yes.
Thank you very much.
Come on, you guys, thank him.
-Thank you.
-Yes, thank you very much. -Yes, thank you very much.
And don't make the big ones suffer any more, okay?
Okay, okay, okay.
Come on, let's go, let's go inside.
You must be cold.
-I thought I was going to freeze to death. -Yeah.
-(Genta) Yes.
(Genta) Whose idea was it to go out with the motorcycle?
(Ayumi and Mitsuhiko) Teva, Genta!
Ep, Muto!
(Ayumi and Mitsuhiko) Here!
You're late.
(Ayumi and Mitsuhiko) Ah!
The nurse this afternoon!
-Thank you for taking care of me!
-Yes!
That's right.
Hi, guys.
What, how's your tummy, huh?
It's perfect!
Genta's stomach has walls of steel.
"Eh? Those two..."
Come on!
But aren't you the famous detective Kogoro Mouri?
Eh?
Ahem.
Yes, indeed, I am the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
I thought so.
And what's it like, what's this way?
-Ah... Well...
-Have you come to investigate a case?
We're here because we've come to see the Snow Festival.
We wouldn't come with children, if it was for work.
Ah!
I guess so.
(Kogoro) He-he-he!
You guess right.
Gee, who would have thought...
I'd meet the famous detective in a place like this, right?
Allow me to introduce them.
This one sitting next to me is Keisuke Yama.
The two of them are Mizuki Tono and Fuyumi Tachihara.
And he is Takehiko Muto.
And I'm Shogo Hikawa.
We are all from the original village of Kitanosawa.
In Yama and I have come from Tokyo
in order to attend the commemoration event.
Does this mean you are all childhood friends?
Yes, we were classmates in elementary school.
But, of course, since it was a rural school,
there were only 5 students in that class.
-There were only 5?
-What?
Yes, that's right.
How long ago was the last meeting?
8 years, maybe?
8 years ago?
So, it's a very emotional meeting!
But listen, how come you haven't seen each other for 8 years?
Ah, the reason... that's it.
Come on, let it go, Hikawa!
What?
But it's...
8 years ago, he was living in Tokyo, and when he was driving back...
"...the original town, where his grandmother lived..."
- (brittle)

- (loud bang)
"He panicked, left the dead girl there and fled all the way to town."
Then, a few hours later,
he thought about it and went to turn himself in to the police.
Eh?
He turned himself in?
Yes, the car had been badly damaged,
he knew he couldn't get away.
At the time,
he was up to his neck in debt to various lenders,
because of his fondness for gambling.
He was tried for speeding
and for fleeing after the hit-and-run.
And to top it all off, his license was revoked.
So, adding it all up, he was released from jail last summer.
So, while Mr. Yama is in jail....
The takeover proposal went through,
and the town went under water.
And on top of that, Yama's grandmother, when she found out what had happened to him, had such a shock that she died,
had such a strong shock that she died.
So... she never lived in the new village again.
The worst of all is that the person who died because of him....
was Mizuki's sister Natsuki, who was 18 years old at the time.
-What?
-What?
Yama..., you should know that I still haven't forgiven you today.
The same goes for you, Hikawa.
I can't forgive you either!
Your family was the first to pick up the junk and leave.
You sold your house and land and went to Tokyo.
-Hey, hey, Muto.
-I'll never forgive you!
You put the idea in my parents' heads!
You sold our precious village!
Are you aware of what you did?
Are you aware?
(Hikawa) In this world, you have to know how to live...
Come on, let's leave it here.
Let's go to the room.
Yes, let's go.
Enough of meddling in their things.
Let's all go in the rooms.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're sorry to have disturbed you.
It seems that she, the Fuyumi, also... will have her reasons.
Yes.
Even though they were all classmates
they've been splitting up and going their separate ways.
Yes, it seems so.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine between the two of you.
Eh?
How... did you know that?
Man, it's obvious, I know exactly what's on your mind.
"Oooh! It's an unknown what might happen between Shinichi and me."
Right?
What are you talking about?
I was thinking about this group we've met,
I wasn't thinking about him.
Right.
And about the gift we were talking about before.
Is it really here, in this town, Shinichi?
Yes.
But I don't think he's staying at this hotel.
Although... I can't help but feel
that Shinichi is somewhere very close to here.
The truth is, I always have that feeling.
You sold our beautiful town!
Are you aware of what you did?
Are you aware?
"What if Mr. Muto was involved in the bomb case?"
"What about his classmates?"
Come on, to the snow!
Let's go to the snow!
In the snow!
(Laughter and playful shouting)
Conan, Ai!
Come on, are you in?
I don't think so, no!
I have to keep an eye on them.
Otherwise, who knows what they might do.
Eh?
Ouch!
He's got it!
What an aim!
(Vital signs meter: regular pip)
(Ayumi, Mitsuhiko and Genta: playful screams, from afar)
- (playful shouting)
- (regular pip)
(Mitsuhiko) Run, run, run!
-Correo!
-Count, they're coming...!
Entoma-la!
No mail!
- (pip: regular)
- (playful shouts, from afar)
-Ouch!
-He's got it!
And this one.
He's got it!
And this one!
(Mitsuhiko) Very good!
Another one!
That's it!
(Ayumi) Look, Ay!
The way she's looking, it looks like she wants to tell us something.
Hello!
J... I...
I'm...
I'm sorry.
We've trespassed on your property.
Would you... let me...
ju... play with you?
I... want... to... play... with... you.
I also... want... to... play... snow... wars.
There must be something wrong with him, right?
Yeah..., it's a bit childish.
- (door, open)
(door, open) - Huh?
To... Here...
Oooh!
You woke up!
Take it!
Take it!
Oooh!
Take it!
Mother?
Oh! Oh, Mother.
Oh, mother.
(Woman: cries)
Mother, how glad I am to see you!
-Mother...
- (woman) Here!
(Crying)
(Muto) "The son of the Fuyumi, in Toma,
"One morning 8 years ago,
"he fell down a ravine and rolled into a stream,
near where the original village was."
He was found lying on the ground, unconscious.
He was immediately taken to the hospital.

He saved his life, but has been unconscious for 8 years.
8 years?
It was the same day in Yama that he caused the accident and fled.
Yes.
The same day?
This town has always been very quiet and peaceful.
Since that day when there were these two accidents...
the town has been a mess.
The fall in Toma was investigated?
The police concluded that it was an accident.
The ravine was near the lake
where the swans that en Toma liked to watch went.
At the time of the accident, she had binoculars around her neck,
and they concluded that he had slipped.
"The neighbor's dog, who in Toma esteemed so much,
was the one who found him."
And where were the Fuyumi and her husband?
Fuyumi is a single mother,
so he was admitted to the hospital
at the foot of the mountain, where she works.
And there was no grandfather or grandmother to help her?
No.
When Fuyumi was little, there was an avalanche and her parents....
They both died?
They both died?
They were found half an hour after the avalanche.
They were found half an hour after the avalanche.
If they had found them only a quarter of an hour earlier,
maybe they would have saved...
It's been proven that if you get caught in an avalanche,
you can survive for 15 minutes at most.
15 minutes, only?
Yes, 15 minutes is the time that marks the boundary between life and death.
15 minutes is a very short time.
(Man) Apa, now I'm not coming to the hospital for a while.
So that I can be with Toma and take care of him.
(Fuyumi) OK.
Thank you very much, doctor.
How did it go, Fuyumi?
Mizuki.
Hello, Muto!
(Fuyumi) I've been told that she's doing well physically so far in Toma.
That's good.
But... psychologically...
He doesn't remember anything about the day he fell down the ravine.
And now... at the moment he can't get it through his head that he has been unconscious
for the last 8 years.
But I'm very happy for you, Fuyumi.
I'm really happy for you.
Aaah!
Excuse me, have you thought about wearing contact lenses?
A beautiful person like you
would still be much prettier if you wore contact lenses.
Glasses, depending on how you look, make an impression of coldness...
and I'm not very fond of them.
Oh, please, Father!
Oh... Eh?
Oh...!
You look like you're worried...
Perhaps because the accident in Toma and what happened to Yama
were all on the same day.
Yes.
I don't know if it's a coincidence or...
(Girl) Tieta!
Is it true that Toma has woken up?
That good, has come all.
Come in, come in.
Eh?
I don't know if he's well enough for this.
Don't you think it's a little too early?
Yes.
Here, it's Kaori and the others.
-It's been a long time, hasn't it, Toma? -Hi, how are you feeling?
-Hello, how are you feeling?
- (children) OK.
- (Mizuki) What, shall we rest a little bit?
(Ayumi) Wow, how many swans!
-Oooh!
-Oooh!
But... (Ayumi) Mizuki...
Yes.
I tried wearing contact lenses.
Because I already bought some.
Yes, you look much prettier like that.
They make your beauty stand out even more.
Oh!
What a pain in the ass!
Hey, it looks like she's changed her hairstyle a bit too, doesn't it?
Now it'll turn out that she likes your father.
Oh, that's pretty silly, Sonoko.
Yes.
She really looks pretty like that!
Mm?
Listen to me.
Yes, it is.
This lake is on the map, isn't it?
Where's the ravine where they found Toma lying on the ground?
Yes.
Huh?
In Toma, you say?
What's that?
That's strange...
Here, near the swamp.
If he was going along this road, I find he went off course a bit.
(Kogoro) He must have gotten lost.
Au, don't worry anymore.
So, Mr. Yama's accident occurred at this bend here.
(Kogoro) That's right.
But why do you ask, all this?
Ow, run away from here, boy!
Conan!
-It's true.
-Oops, now it's snowing.
Oh, it's snowing now.
Yeah, it sure is.
What is it?
Are you worried about something again?
I wonder if Toma really went swan watching.
It's going to have a good snowfall now.
How nice!
(Mizuki) Don't worry.
It's going to stop snowing soon.
Come on, let's go, it's time to leave.
(Mitsuhiko) It really has stopped snowing.
(Agasa) I guess the people here know that.

Miss Mizuki, why don't you come to see us in Tokyo?
-Already.
To the Skytree.
-I'll take you wherever you want.
Hey!
It's... it's just the place I'd like to avoid.
Don't tell me you don't like heights, Mr. Mouri...
You got it right.
Don't you like other places?
(Mizuki) I don't like dark and narrow places.
(Kogoro) But... but what are you doing getting in the way?
What's bothering you, maybe?
(Kogoro) What's wrong, Mizuki?
Isn't it...?
Doesn't it look like Hikawa's jacket, that one?
(Kogoro) -Hey?
-Hello, Hikawa!
- (Kogoro) But what are you doing down there?
- (Mizuki) Don't you want me to sit down?
Yes.
Oops, don't you find it a little strange?
(Mizuki) Please, you wait here.
Do you feel me, Hikawa?
Hey, Hikawa, what are you doing here?
Yes.
I'm going to see what's going on.
Hey, father...
Hey, Hikawa, what's wrong?
Oh!
But Hikawa!
Mizuki!
What happened to her?
-Apart s.
-There's something wrong.
Mr. Hikawa, what's wrong with anything?
Mr. Hikawa, Mr. Hay...
Oh!
Get out of the way!
Don't come any closer!
Father...!
There's nothing to be done, he's dead.
Yes.
Is he all right, Mizuki?
He doesn't seem to have any injuries.
Did he die of frostbite, or a heart attack?
Come to think of it, he's had heart problems since he was little.
I guessed as much.
Ran, you can call the police now!
Yes, right away.
What's wrong?
Something's not right.
The taser's gone.
Listen to me!
Children should stay out of it!
Mr. Hikawa said
he always carried a taser in his pocket
to protect himself!
Not the door;
maybe someone was with her and she took it.
Eh?
And why?
No, this is unlikely.
Look closely.
There's only one guy's prints.
And they're prints from these boots.
In other words,
Mr. Hikawa was walking alone along the side of the creek from the village
and had a heart attack while walking across this snowy plain.
What about the gun?
I would say this is the explanation.
Surely he must have left it at the hotel.
That's impossible.
Yeah, but... the prints...
What if it's all a set-up by the culprit?
What if?
Like in stories about mysterious footprints in the snow...
and stuff like that.
(Kogoro) Come on, man!
Footprints... Footprints in the snow?
I've got it!
Indeed, it was a set-up by the culprit!
-Listen up.
- (all) What?
The culprit made it look like
that Mr. Hikawa has had a heart attack
by poisoning them or something.
So, he's changed his boots to ones...
the same as Mr. Hikawa's,
who had already taken them expressly,
carried it on his back, carried it over here..,
and took the taser from him.
To return, he stepped in the same footprints he had left,
but walking back.
Are you sure this can be done?
Walking backwards?
Mm-hm... It's possible.
Hey, hey, hey!
Look!
Ah!
Aaah!
Aaah!
"How come you have so much snow inside your hood?"
Yeah, right.
Eh?
I see how he did it!
The super-simple trap of the culprit!
Oh, yeah?
Let's see, it snowed a little while ago, didn't it?
The culprit was with Hikawa,
they've wandered away from the stream and he killed her here,
because it looked like she had a heart attack.
Afterwards, the snow that fell erased the tracks of both of them.
Then, the culprit waited for the snow to stop...
and changed his boots for others of the same type as in Hikawa,
and walked backwards to the stream...
without having to watch where he was stepping.
This explains why there were only one type of footprints left, right?
Also, look at the inside of the hood at Hikawa.
There's a lot of snow, inside!
I'm sure that when the snow stopped,
the culprit removed only the snow on his head and shoulders,
because it looked as if he had walked all the way here
after the snow had stopped.
But this trap could only work in one case.
If we found the body right away, right?
If it had been left here just as he had left it,
and it had snowed again,
the tracks he left behind would have been erased again.
Therefore, there is no doubt that the culprit...

It must be someone who knew perfectly well that we would pass this way.
"Or someone... who drove us here."
But the snowshoeing information panel is visible to everyone.
can be seen by everyone,
anyone who looks at it can tell who's coming through here.
"He-he-he-he... That's right."
One question, Mizuki.
Can you tell us where these footprints end up?
In Muto's hut, do they go?
At Takehiko Muto's hut.
Yes, they do.
This hut can also be reached by car along a road.
Ah, this is the road where we went yesterday with the snowmobile.
I find it very strange... that in Hikawa I didn't go by road.
"Or maybe...in Hikawa and the culprit....
...didn't go on the road expressly."
"They have taken the path of the stream so that no one would see them
and walked toward the hut."
"But why?"
Sorry for the wait.
Mr. Hikawa's body
has been taken to the university hospital,
and the coroner is currently examining it in detail.
Although we have already confirmed that he died of a heart attack,
until a thorough autopsy has been performed.
we will not know whether he died of natural causes
or someone made it look that way.
Someone made it look that way?
Are you implying that Mr. Hikawa was killed?
(Watanabe) At the moment we don't know yet.
Mr. Yama, where were you today at two o'clock in the afternoon, and what were you doing?
This afternoon I was not with Mr. Hikawa,
and I went for a walk on the eastern side of the forest.
-Yes.
-Did you go alone?
-No.
-Did you meet anyone while you were walking?
All right, thank you.
Next.
Miss Tachihara.
I was with Toma, who was exhausted by the day's news...
and she stayed... in the room, in our country.
Can anyone confirm this?
I don't think so.
(Watanabe) Mr. Muto?
I was in the workshop, in the hut I have near the swamp, working.
In the workshop, you say?
Isn't that the cabin on the mountain
near where Mr. Hikawa's body was found?
-Can anyone corroborate that?
-Yes.
No, no one!
I'm not with anyone, me, when I work, you know?
If so, could you explain how it is that Mr. Hikawa...
was on his way to his mountain hut?
How should I know, listen...!
Are you sure, that Hikawa wasn't coming to your workshop?
What?
It's not you, what has hit the Hikawa and then killed her?
And you haven't hinted that you wanted to talk about the Mizuki?
Go ahead.
Can you explain what you're talking about?
When the Hikawa was young,
he asked the Mizuki if she wanted to marry him, and she didn't accept.
But in Hikawa he still had feelings for Mizuki.
That's why I say: if I told him about the Mizuki, he would surely go.
Don't smoke!
Well, I thought it was in Muto that he had feelings for her.
Tell me, why the hell should I kill, me, in Hikawa?!
Because you seem to have had a lot of trouble because of the swamp!
It's so ridiculous, it's not worth answering.
And finally, to finish, Miss Tono.
She has been with us at all times, so she has an alibi.
(Watanabe) Oh, really?
Very well, then.
What do you have to say, Miss Tono?
There's no point in saying anything?
Okay, we'll leave it here for now.
We will get in touch with you for more details
when we find out if Mr. Hikawa has been killed.
If so..., shouldn't we search them?
At this time we do not yet have the authorization to do so.
And, if by any chance any of them had taken the object in question,
I'm sure they would have hidden it somewhere anyway.
(Watanabe) Thank you all for taking the time.
(Genta: sluggish) This man speaks very slowly.
- (Ayumi) Yes.
- (Mitsuhiko) Ouch... I almost fell asleep.
(Sonoko) Geez, you, it's freezing cold!
Why do we have to do all this to see the sunrise?
Don't complain and walk.
I don't know who it was, what has killed in Hikawa.
I know.
If it had been in Muto...
"Considering the footprints in the snow," I said,
"He wasn't killed in the mountain hut,
but the culprit was waiting for him at the snowy plan."

"After killing him, the culprit went to the stream."
But... how is it that in Hikawa he decided to go by the creek and by the plan,
where no one would see him?
And if in Muto he had been asked, in Hikawa he would have missed it.
That's true.
I would have gone by the village road and by car.
In any case,
I'd like to know if the murder in Hikawa and the explosion are linked.
If there is a link, I don't think this story will end here.
I'm sure something will happen again.
(Mobile: vibrates)
"Again?"
"Leave a message on the answering machine. When I can I'll call you back."
You got the answering machine again?
Damn, again!
Yes.
I wanted to explain about Mr. Hikawa, but...
Who knows if it's really the people, that crazy deduction freak!
Let her be.
You've already felt it.
Besides, what time do you think it is?
What time?
That it's not in Toma, that one?
Kuro...
-Tom, what are you doing here?
-Tom!
The grave... of the Kuro...
The Kuro is the dog that found Toma 8 years ago.
Why is he dead?
Is he really dead, the Kuro?
Toma!
What are you doing?
Why did you come here?
Mother...
Why did you leave the house without telling me?!
Come on, Mrs. Tono.
Why did you come here?
Why did you come here?
May I know what is happening to me?
(Here) I don't understand...
All my friends are people I don't know and... Kuro is dead...
I just... I don't know what to do anymore...
I don't get it!
Kuro... Kuro!
Take it!
You can't do anything about it.
His body is already 15 years old, but psychologically he's still 7.
I imagine it must be difficult for him to understand what has happened.
Just the opposite of what happens to us.
-Mom!
-Tom.
Ooooh!
(All) Ooooh!
(Ayumi) Look!
Look at the glittering snow!
-It's diamond dust.
(Ayumi) -Oh!
This isn't snow.
Diamond?
A treasure fallen from the sky!
No, man, no.
This happens when the water vapor suspended in the air freezes
and tiny ice crystals form.
Look at this.
Here, look at this.
That's pretty cool.
How cool!
A treasure!
Here you go.
What's the matter with you?
Are you okay, Toma?
The memories...
But what is it?
I've seen this light before.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
-Tom.
-Tom!
-Tom. -Tom.
-Tom.
(Takes) No..., no... I don't... I remember.
That pretty, uh, diamond dust?
Of course it was!
It was like we were in wonderland!
Miss! (Laughs)
I want to do it again!
Hey, I was about to remember something, but...
Yeah, I thought maybe it was related...
to the memory of when you fell down the ravine...
"And I tried to find out,
"But that day it snowed from the early morning,
and no diamond dust was seen."
Well so it must have been, what did you see?
Where are they at Genta and the others?
They said they went out for a moment to play with Toma.
Eh?
Gee, I hope they do not return to carry some head!
(Toma) That we will go far away?
The mother will give us a warning if we go too far away from home.
You know what, Toma?
Here, what do you think if we go near the ravine where you fell?
Who knows, maybe you'll be able to remember a lot of things.
-It's next to you, don't worry. -It's next to you, don't worry.
-But... -But...
-All right? -Yeah.
-Yes. -Yes.
-Yes.
-Come on, cheer up and go!
-Iupi!
-Let's go.
We tried to do it.
-It'll go very well.
Don't worry.
Let's see... Where did these kids go?
Maybe in the camping area?
Where the memorial service will be held.
Yes, I understand it starts at 10 o'clock. It's a little over an hour away.
I hope they don't bring any more.
(Kogoro) If so, I'll give them a taste of my fist.
They are dam workers.
(Agasa) They must have come to attend the commemoration ceremony.
What's not clear to me is whether they can leave the dam alone.
Do not suffer, girl.
Two colleagues have stayed to keep watch.
Wow, did you hear me?
Man, I'd at least like to drink the coffee they make here!
(Man) We're sorry we made you suffer.
Apa, Sonoko!
About that..., I'll come later.
Come on in!
Understood.
Don't run, you'll fall!
What's up?
Hello!

Hey, you're Toma's classmate, right?
What did you come to see in Toma?
Yes..., I wanted to show him something, but I don't think he's here right now.
And what did you want to show him?
What is it?
Ah!
This photo is from 8 years ago, right?
I was about your age.
What's that?
These binoculars...
Yes.
It's at school, isn't it, the photo?
You even wore them to school?
Yes, this was the distinguishing feature of Toma.
He wore them whenever he left the house.
"This means he didn't necessarily go swan watching."
Ah, that was a gift he gave me in Toma.
He took great care of himself, of the Kuro.
I would come to show him this drawing and this picture and talk to him,
but..., ah !, I don't know if it would make him suffer more.
"The other day, in Hikawa he unfolded a sheet of printed paper,
which was folded facing out and showed it to everyone."
"Wouldn't it be more natural to fold the printed side inwards
to keep it from getting dirty?
Eh?
Ah, no, no, nothing.
What's wrong with the drawing?
Thanks for showing it to me.
It's just that I have to go back to the hotel!
Don't suffer!
Don't run, you'll fall!
AAAI!
(Woman) Gee, here I will not be able to change the sheets?
(Woman 2) Hey, you've opened the door?
(Woman 1) - No.
(Woman 1) Of course not.
-What?
You didn't open it?
They'll come to check for fingerprints and prints.
What?
Don't smoke!
What am I going to do now?
They'll suspect me!
-Come on, you, don't scare me!
-Man, they'll arrest you.
That's just it.
A robbery... in a jewelry store?
"On the 15th, around 11 o'clock at night,
"Misuzu Jewelry Store, Shinjuku district,
was robbed."
"The owner, Eiko Misuzu,
"who was working after business hours,
was stabbed to death with a sharp object."
"The thief fled with a haul of jewelry
worth 1 billion yen."
"This case, if I remember correctly,
"happened when I was in third grade,
and the culprit still hasn't been found, I think."
"But how come in Hikawa he had this item on him?"
"Wait a minute... The date!"
"Just as I suspected."
"It's the night before
the Yama hit-and-run case."
"The other day at Yama I was sitting next to Hikawa."
"In Yama not to look at the side of the paper that we others look at,
but the other side."
"He looked at the article on that side and grimaced."
"Maybe..."
(Mobile: vibrates)
Kudo.
I fail to locate on Mitsuhiko and the others.
"And also..."
How's this?
Listen...
(Communication: cut off)
"(Explosion)"
It was the cell phone base station, this?
Both!
The landline phone is not working either!
"The base stations, both landline and mobile, have...!"
Wow!
Don't tell me there's been an accident just today.
"No. That's no accident!"
(People: whispers)
(People: whispers) Huh?
Yes, I feel you.
"Can you feel me, Ai?"
"How are things?"
People here are getting nervous because the cell phones aren't working.
I thought so.
"Ah, I heard that the children had met Toma and were going together."
"And then it seems that the four of them disappeared."
"Okay."
You have to come immediately!
"It can't be. They've gone..."
Let's walk in the snow!
We really like the snow.
-Yes, we do.
I'd say so.
-It's this way, isn't it?
- (Ayumi) Stop it!
Will you shut up?
We like the snow very much...
We like the snow very much...
- (Genta) I know I'm making noise.
-(Ayumi) What?
Are you still following us?
-Oh... I'm so sorry!
Let's walk!
We walk.
We walk...
-What the hell is going on?
-He's still following us!
What are you talking about?
-Yes, we run!
-Get out of here!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
-You mail!
-We'll explain it to you.
But what's the matter?
(Ayumi) Since when are you following us?
-We can't dawdle!
-It's been a while!
- (Mitsuhiko) I have no idea!
- (Ayumi) Do you have bad intentions?
- (Genta) Why do you think we ran away?
- (Ayumi) How scary!

(Takes) "That day... I was running away too..."
Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Shot)
Yes.
Have you felt it?
I'm not staying part!
Run!
It gives me a bad feeling.
Stay here!
Aaah!
All right, all right...
You've got a lot of nerve being a kid.
A cave!
Then we hide them.
Hurry, hurry!
(Ouch) Wait!
Wait, wait!
Yes.
I don't like it!
Ay, I leave it to you!
Damn, what the hell are you doing, these, here?!
Come in more.
This cave is very deep.
-Hurry, get in, get in!
-Hey, you!
I'm not going in!
Do you want to die in such a place?!
But an adult can't enter here, can he?
Well, he could have entered Toma, couldn't he?
Besides, what are you going to do if he shoots from outside?!
What are you thinking...!
Let's see!
Do you want to die in a place like this?
What are you thinking of going into a cave?!
I've already said it.
Of course you did!
How?
Someone was chasing you and you're going to run away?
Yes.
I remembered it a while ago.
"I suspected it. I'm beginning to understand it all."
E... what?
Wow!
What if that's what I think?
Listen to me, I have to hurry.
What do you think?
I have to get to the dam before he does!
-I'm not following you!
-What's in the shot?
Tell us, we don't understand it!
I still don't have any proof and these are just my deductions.
The culprit of it all...
"I think it's in Yama."
"If he broke into the jewelry store in Tokyo 8 years ago," he said,
"He killed the owner
and ran off with the jewelry, it all fits."
In Yama, he was being chased by the collectors of a lender,
he came to Kitanosawa,
"...which was his hometown, where his grandmother lived."
"And on the way here, at the entrance to the village,
he ran over the Natsuki."
"A in Yama panicked."
"If the police stopped him,
they would discover the robbery and murder."
"Because, of course, the jewelry he had stolen was in the car."
If you hit someone, the most logical thing to do is to get out of the car...
to check on that person.
Most likely while looking for the Natsuki,
"Who had fallen off the cliff,
he ran into you, here."
With me?
You had followed your mother,
who had gone out before it was daylight, right, Toma?
You wanted to go see her at the hospital and you passed by the accident site.
"That's why..."
-Mother.
How... how happy...
- (cries)
Oh, mother..., how glad I am to see you!
For Toma was the continuation of what had happened 8 years before.
Yes.
"For Yama, it was very easy to stun Toma
and put him in the car."
"That's why he kept driving, because he didn't know what to do with him."
"But things got complicated for him."
In Toma he woke up
and saw the stolen diamonds scattered around the car.
Ah, that's why he's been about to remember something....
when he saw the diamond dust.
It was a real treasure.
"As in Toma had seen the jewels,
in Yama he finally decided what he would do."
Ah!
Aaaaah!
-He hid them somewhere!
-The jewels are at grandma's house?
Yes.
In fact, in Yama she wanted to locate the house where she had lived.
He turned himself in because he thought he would get out after a few years.
"But it turned out that he had committed
"A more serious crime than he had imagined,
and during that time the town was submerged at the bottom of the swamp."
"To recover the jewels he would have to drain all the water from the swamp."
-Empty the swamp?
-The water?
-What?
How!
-The purpose was the commemoration.
Because the dam workers would also attend.
Only two men would watch.
They would not imagine that there could be bombs, the shot.
-They will all die!
-But if this happens, the people....
That's why I have to try to get to the shot before he does!
Look!
A light!
-We've made it!
-It's the exit!
How nice!
There is no danger, you can go out!
"The drainpipe. If we go through here..."
"Yes, sure. It's the shortest way."
So, Hikawa's killer is also...?
What?
Yes, it's in Yama.
Two obstacles had to be overcome in order to carry out his plan.

The first was in Hikawa.
"In Hikawa, he had been a classmate....
"And he was a life insurance inspector,
"I was to find out that in Yama was the criminal
"who had robbed the jewelry store and killed the owner..,
so in exchange for taking a cut he offered to help him."
Therefore, in Yama he was to make it look like he accepted,
and he wanted to kill in Hikawa before blowing up the dam.
Now it all fits together.
After all, blackmail?
is usually one of the main motives in murder cases.
And, of course, the perfect person to present as the culprit,
both for blowing up the shot and for having killed in Hikawa,
was in Muto.
In Yama he wanted to frame Muto,
because en Muto reproached en Hikawa for selling his land.
But how did he do it because in Hikawa it was up to the snowy plane?
Well, it is a hypothesis, but....
What?
In Muto?
It seems that he has smelled the plan we had in our hands
and says he wants to come talk to us.
Depending on how it goes, we'll have no choice but to get rid of him.
He might have said something like that to Hikawa
to convince him to go.
And they went by the stream and by the snowy plan, because there is no one.
The other obstacle was that he learned that the governor
planned to attend the commemoration ceremony.
If the governor came,
logically he would be accompanied by a large number of journalists.
Although he had blown up the stations that the phones were not working,
he had to prevent
news of the destruction of the dam.
Of course.
Even if he leaves the new town submerged under water,
then he will need time to search for where the treasure is hidden.
Therefore, to prevent the governor from coming,
he blew up the subway tunnel and took the opportunity to test the explosives.
But I don't think he was counting at any time
that in Toma he could wake up.
As in Toma he had forgotten
what had happened the day of the hit-and-run,
in Yama he breathed easy.
But when he saw the diamond dust,
he was on the verge of recovering his memory.
That's why Yama wanted to get the four of them off his back.
Then he would just take the jewels and run away.
I'm sure he also has a plan to secretly get away.
(Genta) What's the matter, Toma?
Yes.
-No.
-Are you tired?
That I said something that upset you?
It's just that something's wrong and I don't know what it is.
I'm sorry, but now we have to hurry.
As in Yama has chased in Toma,
I'm sure you've wasted more time than you wanted to.
I guess he hasn't been able to get the pump in Toma yet.
Remember that two men have remained on watch.
If so, we still have a chance.
(Mitsuhiko) Not yet?
(Genta) Why does it always have to go uphill?
That's it, go up.
-(Mitsuhiko) That's it.
-(Mitsuhiko) On account.
Oh, I'm knackered.
Here, you're coming.
Up you go!
We've already entered the dam facility.
(Mitsuhiko) We're not out of danger yet.
(Mitsuhiko) -Well, no.
-(Mitsuhiko) Everything all right, Mitsuhiko?
I'm so bald I can't move another inch.
"Logical."
Stay here and protect Toma, okay?
I'll notify the workers who've stayed behind to guard the dam.
-Receiving!
-What?
Count us in.
I'll go take a look at the hut where Muto has the workshop,
which I'm sure is near here.
Be very careful, en Yama might have gone there first.
I know.
I know, I know.
You guys hide session, hurry!
E... Are you all right?
Please wake s!
"He has no wounds."
"They've been tasered."
Wait a minute.
It can't be!
It's the same kind of bomb as the one in the subway tunnel!
But how the...?
He came by car or snowmobile.
(Mobile)
(Ouch) Shinichi, I've arrived at the workshop.
Yes?
But this looks bad.
In Muto is unconscious.
"I suspected as much."
The workers I found have also lost consciousness.
They've probably been attacked with a taser.
"What?"
Wait a minute.
How strange...
"This is all happening too fast."
What's wrong?
Answer!
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"
Shinichi, please!
What's wrong?
It can't be...
-Don't call.

-Bomb?!
I am telling you because you are the famous detective Mouri.
If anyone knew about it, panic would spread.
Oh, right, excuse me...
The information about the bombing comes from a reliable source?
We have been informed that they have found some debris
that could be from a timer.
We are concerned about the two workers who have been left at the intake.
We can't get in touch with them from here.
If they return to the dam, will they be able to use their cell phones?
Yes, because there is a telephone station nearby.
Then maybe you can call Conan's phone.
Yes.
All right, let's go.
(Gunshot)
Another feature.
What if something has happened to him, to Conan?
It worries me.
I can't take it anymore!
Let's go, guys!
-Yes! -Yes!
-All right! -All right!
Ah!
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Stupid brat.
If you hadn't stuck your nose where it wasn't wanted,
you should die without pain.
There's no one else.
Go on, spit!
Where are the others?
I see you'll have to feel pain again to learn your lesson, eh?
Ah!
You bastard!
Iah!
You brat!
How can you not take me seriously?
I don't have time to play with you now!
Do you understand?
Ah!
Since there's not much time left, I'll believe you've come alone.
Don't suffer, if the explosions start in 15 minutes...
the sky will be filled with people.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Apa, boy.
So long...
(Gunshot)
Ah!
Mizuki!
"Now the sound of the gun has sounded different. I've been hurrying!"
- (Ai) You?
-Wait here!
-Haibara!
How nice!
You're all fine!
Mizuki..., how dare you?
Come on, give it up, Yama.
Ah... Yes.
Are you all right, Conan?
How come you came here?
I just had a bad feeling
and I came running.
Is it you, the rifle?
Ah!
It's just that... I have a hunting permit and I'm a very good shot.
Ah!
Oh, right, right...
Mizuki!
-Ah!
-Give me that!
Ah...
(Child: call)
-Hey!
What's the matter with you?
-Tom!
That day...
It's her, whom I saw that day!
She was wearing glasses then, but I'm sure of it!
You'd never understand my dreams, big sis!
What the...?
But... What are you doing?
Ah!
What do you think you're doing?
So... So, the person you saw in Toma 8 years ago...
was Mizuki.
That's why she couldn't enter the cave.
That's what you told Kogoro yesterday, isn't it?
I don't like to go into dark and narrow places.
Mizuki!
What's the meaning of all this?
-You talked about a cave, but... -Conan...
-Conan...
What do you mean?
Don't tell me that...
Yes, the person who attacked us earlier was the Mizuki.
What?
The Mizuki was afraid that Toma, who had witnessed the incident,
would regain her memory.
From there she began to work at the reception desk of the hotel
that was built in front of Toma's house in the new town,
and has been watching over Toma discreetly for 8 years.
Is it true..., Mizuki?
Then, when he woke up in Toma...
he took off his glasses,
put on contact lenses and changed her hairstyle...
in order to prevent Toma from regaining her memory when he saw her.
You took advantage of what Kogoro recommended, didn't you?
I tried wearing contact lenses.
But it didn't help.
In Toma, she started to regain her memory.
That's why you did your best
to shut him up before he regained it completely.
But... I don't understand how one can be so cruel
and push your own sister under the wheels of a car.
I had no intention of killing her!
I just wanted her to fall and feel some pain.
But as it turned out, she fell to the ground...
just as Yama's car was passing by!
If this got out, I could never live here again.
When I thought I got scared,
and suddenly I realized that I had the rifle in my hand.
The only... the only thing I wanted was for Toma to go as far away as possible.
That's... that's why.
In fact, I had no intention of killing him.
I know, Mizuki.
I know that.
I know, Mizuki.
I know perfectly well that you didn't mean to hurt anyone.
Because... being able to fire at Mr. Yama
from down there and hit him in the shoulder just right.

to make him drop the rifle...
it is clear that if he had wanted to, he would have touched us.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Still... I'm glad, the way everything went.
So you can free yourself from this nightmare
that has haunted you for the last 8 years.
Besides, I was able to see the beauty...
that was hiding behind those glasses.
Muto...
Anyway, I want you to know...
I'll wait as long as it takes for you to come back.
-Oh... Conan!
- (Mizuki: continues crying)
(Mizuki: continues crying) What?
The light is flickering!
"Geez, before...
In Yama said 15 minutes, dammit!"
Everybody out of here!
It's about to blow!
Don't waste any more time!
Hurry up!
-Yes.
-Run, Toma!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Don't stop, run!
Ayumi!
No.
Are you hurt?
"This doesn't look good. If the explosions continue, the socket will burst!"
"This noise is bad."
"The outer wall is starting to crack."
"I have to do something!"
"It's only a matter of time before the intake gives way!"
"If all the water comes out at once... the village will all die."
"What can I... what can I do to rescue them?"
(rumbling)
"The ski resort!"
Ah!
Aaaaah!
-Is everybody there?
-Are you all right?
-How?
-No, not Conan.
-What do you say?
-Find one less guy.
I think he disappeared right after he saved me.
Conan...
"What are you up to?"
How?
There were still more bombs?
No!
Aaaah!
-Reculeu!
We must leave here!
-Enrere, back, let's go! -No!
No!
Conan is down there!
-Conan!
-We won't move until he doesn't come back!
"But what are you doing, Shinichi?"
-Yes sir, Conan!
-That's it!
All right, Conan!
-Huh?
-Huh?
But where, now?
Wow!
Don't tell me he wants to stop the water.
What is he doing?
What he's up to is reckless.
- (Ayumi) Yes, it is!
-Impossible, he won't be able to do it!
Conan can do it!
There is nothing impossible for the Junior Detective League!
(Ai) "Shinichi, we all trust you...."
"If I remember correctly,
there was a closed ski resort just before arriving in town."
"If I take advantage of the new snow, what I've been thinking maybe it will work."
-We... We're in trouble!
-Oh, man!
What happened?
-We have to go!
This is dangerous!
-The... the shot!
"Come on, at this rate I won't make it in time."
"Even though it's dangerous, I have to go through the forest!"
Let's go!
Ah!
I'm out of my mind.
Damn it!
Please hold on a little longer.
If all the water comes out of the swamp, what will happen to the new town?
-That's not a coherent answer!
-Well, that will be the end.
There is no doubt... the town will be washed away.
Oh... Oh, no!
Eeeeh?
I see it.
It's in Conan!
Oh, mother!
What's that one on head gate?
An avalanche!
It will try to cause an avalanche to change the direction of the flood!
Conan!
Damn!
But why?!
Ah!
Oh, no!
Conan!
Punch, punch, punch, punch!
Punch!
Punch!
(clattering)
Oh!
Oh, no!
-Run!
-Yes!
He's made it!
"Please make it in time!"
Aaah!
Watch out!
"Ran..."
Noooo!
Conan!
(All, from afar) Conan!
Conan!
Where are you, Conan?
Conan!
Conan!
"I feel everyone's voices."
"I don't know how, but I seem to have survived the avalanche."
"I have to get out of here."
"Oh, no..., I can't move my body..."
"I have to... I have to do something."
Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
(All) Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
This brat, this brat!
What time is it?
How long has it been?
- (Ai) 11 minutes 50.
(Ai) -If I remember correctly...
It's been almost 12 minutes since the avalanche happened.
(Ai) -That means...
-What?
If 3 more minutes pass, time will be up!
Oh, no!
Come on, everybody look in Conan!
Don't tell me that Conan...
-What?
-What?
You mean the avalanche...
Please, let it ring!

(Call)
Sound!
Quiet, everybody!
Let's see if you can feel this brat's cell phone!
Conan, where... where are you?
(Cell phone, from far away)
(Mobile, far away) Here!
What? (All) Conan!
(All) Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
(Mobile)
I've found it!
Conan's cell phone!
-It's over here!
-Has it rung?
Where is it?
Please, come out, Conan!
Please come out, Conan!
This way!
Start looking over here!
Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
Conan!
-Neither here.
-Renoi.
Oh, no!
Conan, where are you?
But... where are you?
Come out, please!
Why don't you come out, Conan?!
Ran, your hands are bleeding!
(cries)
Conan..., won't I see you again?
And to think that, once the line is crossed,
you might never see each other again.
-It's... joke, isn't it?
-Oh, no.
Conan, don't die!
Less than a minute to go before the time limit.
Ran.
-What's up, Ran?
-Come on, don't give up, guys.
We're looking for help.
Shinichi...
Please, if you're near here...
If you're near here, please help us.
Please help us, Shinichi!
(Echoes) Shinichi!
Shinichi!
Shinichi!
Shinichi!
(Mobile: vibrates)
(Mobile: vibrates)
"It's the voice... It's the voice of the Ran."
(Mobile: vibrates)
Ran!
-... soccer ball!
-Huh?
It's a...
It can't be!
Conan.
Conan!
Conan.
Conan!
We've found it!
It's here!
Conan, react!
Hey, come on!
It's here!
They've already found it!
Please wake up.
Wake up, Conan.
Conan!
Ra... Ran...
Ran...
Conan.
Ran... Ran...
Conan, I'm so glad.
Thank God.
Viva!
Long live!
"That's what I call being foolproof."

"That afternoon, in front of Yama's old house...
"Which had been submerged at the bottom of swamp,
they found a bag with a suitcase, and jewelry inside."
"At Yama, when they showed her the evidence, she confessed everything..,
and the case was closed."
"The Mizuki stated.
"About the death of her little sister 8 years old.
and the police asked her to explain the incident to them in detail."
"In Toma has not yet been able to fully recover her memory."
"But she has not given up hope,
"Because having regained the smile he had as a child,
I'm sure it won't be long."
(Woman) I have sent you all his things to this address.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for everything.
I hope he will be back soon, in spite of everything that has happened.
-We will be back for sure!
-We will be back!
(Car: horn)
Hey, let's go!
Hurry up!
Don't waste any more time, I'll leave you here, eh?
Ouch...
Why are you in such a hurry, now?
Ah!
I haven't even bought Makoto's gift yet!
Hey, where are you going?
I haven't either.
Come back, we don't have time!
"Come to think of it... What did you want to buy her?"
(Ayumi) We haven't bought the gift for the lady either!
But... we said the bone cakes, right?
But what the heck?
We were buying her the swan mug!
It seems to me that we should get the owl.
"Eh? That was it."

(Ai) And why don't you buy all 3 things, so that you don't have to choose?
- (Agasa) Hey, hey, you...
-The doctor will still pay.
(Ai) "Sure. I get it. It was written by the children."
(Agasa) Hey!
If you plan to buy gifts, hurry up!
Smart ass!
We have to get there early, otherwise I won't be able to watch Yoko's show!
15 minutes!
We must leave in 15 minutes!
(All) What?
Go!
Hurry up!
"Blow, 15 minutes again."
