(Genta, with a singsong voice) We have been invited to a barbecue!
A barbecue for lunch, a barbecue for snack...
and another one for dinner!
For the cart, these poor people have only invited us to eat.
Well, I'm really excited
that couple we met at the campsite
invited us to a barbecue.
MHM, it will be because they had left the rice at home...
and we gave them some.
Yes, but if it wasn't for the kidnapping case, we wouldn't have met them.
Eh?
We changed the day of departure for the kidnapping case,
and that's why we met them.
Yes, we had to go to the campsite on Sunday.
We were supposed to go to the campsite the following Sunday,
but the police summoned us for questioning.
Hey, Ay, how could you risk coming and being seen?
It was too dangerous, and the doctor and Subaru could do it alone.
I came because Subaru wanted me to accompany them.
And I couldn't stay at home with my arms crossed.
What?
Imagine if they had killed you in the end!
Come on...
I didn't want to miss the show.
What do you mean, you didn't want to miss the show?
I find it a bit strange.
As far as I know, it's the first time you've called him "Subaru".
You're starting to like him?
-Huh?
-Don't make that face.
They won't get away.
No, this... this has nothing to do with it.
Mm? (Cell phone ringing)
(cell phone ringing)
Hello!
Conan, how, life?
Hello?
Who's calling me?
Ouch!
It's all good.
Yes, more or less.
"Come on, cheer up, you're so bored!"
"Just think, the other day I rescued you from a dangerous madwoman!"
Let it go!
What a joy!
You are safe!
Yes, you're right.
I can't thank you enough.
Ah, well...
Who are you... talking to?
Ah?
This voice... it's from that Ai Haibara.
-If it's the Ran, put her through. -If it's the Ran, put her through.
-What is it, Conan?
Who are you talking to?
"Bah, never mind."
Whose... what voice are you talking about?
Today, classes have ended early,
and now I'm on my way to the detective agency.
Why don't you all come over here?
We've been invited to a barbecue today, I can't come.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
Uh, what-what do you mean?
What's this about a barbecue?
Yeah, that's right.
He hung up on me.
Earlier I heard Conan say
that they were invited to a barbecue today.
Oh, I'm sorry!
And why didn't you tell me before?
Don't tell me you've come to get the Ran
because you want to see the little boy with the glasses.
What's that?
Ah, no, it's not Conan.
Actually, I'd like to see the Amuro, Mr. Mouri's apprentice.
Ah, right.
You saw each other in that dark street,
and then, at the police station, we were questioned separately.
You fell in love!
By the way, do you know her, this girl, Haibara?
I don't really like her.
Yes, you mean Ai?
But what's she like?
She's a good girl, but she's not like the others.
Well, I see her as... a grown-up with a very bad mouth
that someone would have shrunk into the body of a little girl.
Mm.
What do you mean, an adult?
Sometimes she says things that only an adult would say.
Yes, exactly, and sometimes she behaves just like the little boy with the glasses.
Mm-hm.
But I guess the Ai Haibara isn't a fan of Sherlock Holmes.
Of course, you haven't known him long, in Conan,
you still don't know that he and Shinichi like him a lot,
Sherlock Holmes.
(He thinks) "I do know. For a long time."
(Shinichi voice) "The summer memories are so vivid
that they impose on the passage of time and solve mysteries."
"We've only seen it ourselves: a couple quarrels over a misunderstanding."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult, and he's Detective Conan!"
Kimi no Namida ni Konno ni koi shiteru,
Wow This Summer day Summer night, soba de waratte itai yo.

Bouhatei atsu sunahama.
"Machiwabita Kiseki Yatta otozureta.
Dou ka Kono mama stay with me.
Everything for you I ll always think of you.
Hoshi Furu yoru wa koi shikute,

Mueve tomerarenai my sweet song,

Kimi no egao ga Konno ni Yuuki kureru,

Kimi no yokogao Zutter Zutter mitsumeteta!

(Conan's voice) "Not a millimeter of forgiveness (first part)."
(Door: doorbell)
(Door: doorbell)
-Oh...
How strange.
If we arrived right on time.
- (all) Oooh!
-Happy Halloween!
Halloween?
That was many days ago!
And besides, for Halloween the ones who dress up are always the children...
who go from house to house.
-Yes.
-Yes, exactly.
(Man) I've already told you, me.
But since you don't listen to me...
So what?
I thought the kids would find it funny!
Yes, but in the end, it's always in a screwball situation.
Like last Christmas,
when you insisted on wearing that reindeer costume.
I dressed up as a reindeer so you wouldn't want me to be
to be Santa Claus in a miniskirt.
-I'm the age I am.
No problem?
-You think you're a teenager?!
Come on, please don't fight.
(Genta) Wow, that's good!
- (all) Mmm!
-This meat is delicious!
Yes, but if you want to eat well, you also have to eat vegetables.
Haaaa!
-You be quiet, Ai.
-And you too.
(She giggles)
I love eating with the kids.
I'm having a great time.
-No, we don't.
-You two don't have children?
And we've been married for 10 years now.
I guess if we had kids,
my husband wouldn't try to pick up other women.
Huh?
Oh, gee...
Oh, I'm sorry!
I shouldn't say such things in front of the children.
-Hey, Sumika.
- (Agasa) Don't suffer.
(Agasa) -No, I don't know.
-Do you know where I left my cell phone?
Did you check if it's in your coat pocket?
Yes, I've already looked and it's gone.
It's important, my head has to send me an e-mail.
Don't tell me you left it in that bar again!
Well, I'm not going to look for it.
Are we there yet?
They made me go to work and I couldn't pick it up!
And you took advantage of it to spy on me.
These messages that I had received
and then you did something much worse, right?
Yes, I sent a reply to all the women...
who had sent you suspicious messages:
"Husband stealer, so die!"
And then, my friends left me aside.
Now I understand what happened!
Yes, you do!
It happened because you wanted to flirt with other women!
And what did you expect?
If when I come home I find a hysterical jealousy,
it's normal that I want to find comfort outside of here!
Ah, I get it!
You always come home late because you're with another woman, right?!
(Agasa) Please...
(Agasa) -Ah...
(Agasa) -Ah!
I'm s-sorry.
It's just that we're always the same.
Don't mind us, I'm very irritable lately.
Come on, please help me look for my cell phone.
If I don't answer it right away, my head gets very angry.
Are you sure the mail you're waiting for is from your head?
Yes.
It's about our mahjong game.
Why don't you call me from your cell phone?
See if I can feel it and find it.
Yeah, but... since this morning, I can't find it either, my cell phone.
But I'm sure it must be somewhere in the living room.
Do you think this couple will last long?
Yes, I do!
When two people love each other, they're sure to fight.
Even dogs shouldn't get involved in married fights.
-No, since I'm not a dog...
-People, you're not hungry for anything.
-Yes, it does.
-What?
You're leaving already?
But if you've come all this way, why don't you go upstairs now?
I just remembered that I have to do something.
And as Mr. Mouri's apprentice is having a party today,
I'll come back another day.
Girl, I can't believe it.
You're leaving because the little boy with the glasses didn't come today.
No, it's not that!
I promise you that I have to do something important and I had forgotten.
To make up for it, next time...
I'll let you tell me a lot of gossip.
Especially things about your boyfriend.
Gee, Masumi, you're such a giggly girl.
Are you sure?
A long time ago, there was a person who never laughed.
I've become like that because I always tried to make her laugh.
Masumi, where are you going?
What's the matter with you?
I thought I saw an acquaintance.
Hey, why did you run away?
An acquaintance?
(Thinking) "No, it's impossible."
AAIII, I'm too full.
-I can't fit any more.
Will you take a picture of him, at Genta?
Yes, I want to document his belly,
to compare it with Dr. Agasa's belly.
Eh?

What do you say!
Well, I think they are almost the same.
-Eh?
- (mobile: vibrates)
- (mobile: vibrates)
-Hey!
It's a cell phone.
I guess it's that cell phone you were looking for a while ago.
Hey, how about I tell them we found it?
Au, go on it, I'm sure they must still be in the living room.
Yes!
Excuse me, I found your...!
I've had enough of forgiving you.
-Ah!
No, Sumika!
-I'm going to kill you!
Ca-calm down!
Su... Sumika!
You'll die!
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
Come, please!
They're fighting again!
What's that?
Again?
Leave them alone.
But the woman has a knife and says she wants to kill him!
Eh?!
What are you saying?
We have to stop them!
Aaaah!
Mrs. Konno!
Mrs. Konno!
Please open your eyes!
Please react!
(Shinichi, thinks) "She's still breathing."
"She's very pale and I can hardly feel the dust."
"She's losing too much blood, she won't make it."
(Conan voice) Eh?
Hey, Conan.
This thing she's got stuck in her chest, do you think it's better if we take it out?
Don't touch the knife!
If you take it out, the wound will open up and he'll die.
Haibara!
Where is it, the ambulance?
I've been told it'll take 10 minutes yet.
Understood.
Mr. Konno, bring us pillows and a blanket.
Hey!
Cushions and a blanket!
It's the same!
Doctor, Ayumi, you bring pillows.
Mitsuhiko, go get a blanket and bring it here.
-Right now!
-Yes.
(Shinichi, thinking) "This woman is not very warm."
"She's only wearing a thin sweater and an apron."
"And her pants only go halfway down her leg."
No, we don't want water.
Hey, Conan, can I get you a glass of water?
But it's the kitchen, isn't it?
Go see if you can find a plastic bag.
Now I might throw up.
-We'll bring you the cushions.
-Okay.
Put them there under your feet, you should have them a little raised.
Got it.
This way we'll reduce the blood flow in his legs
and increase the circulation in the chest area.
Okay, we got it.
Let's go, let's go!
Conan, what do I do, with the blanket?
Cover the area from where the knife is stuck to the legs.
We must prevent the shock from lowering his body temperature.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Now, while we're waiting for the ambulance,
we need you to tell us your wife's blood type...
and if she has any allergies.
(Agasa) This man is in shock.
React!
He is in shock because he accidentally stabbed him,
but we need the blood type and history of allergies!
When they got married, they promised each other eternal love!
Su... Sumika.
Sumika doesn't have any allergies.
But her blood type is... AB negative.
What did you say?
That your wife is AB negative?
Only one out of 2,000 people is!
Oh, call the hospital right now!
Chances are they don't have your group.
-If they don't, it's okay.
-Yes.
Fortunately..., my wife and I have the same blood group.
(Agasa) I think I know what happened.
But I would like you to tell us.
Can you explain to us why you stabbed your wife?
I'll tell you the same thing I told the doctors a while ago.
My cell phone is to blame for everything.
Eh?
Remember when I couldn't find it and I started looking for it at home?
Well, I found it in the living room, under the sofa.
Then I saw that my head still hadn't sent me any mail.
When I was about to call him to confirm
that the mahjong game was tonight,
my wife took my cell phone and told me that he wanted to use it
that he wanted to use it to call her, to see if he could find her.
The cell phone was in the garden, I found it.
-Yes.
-Right, Ayumi?
And then I ran to give it to him.
-No.
-Are you fighting about it?
We started fighting after he called her cell phone.
Where did it come from, this contact?
You have a contact that wasn't there before, and it's a woman!
Here we go again?
You spied on me!
You took my cell phone and read my messages!
Of course I did!
It's normal for a woman to watch her husband.
Every night, when you go to sleep, I check your messages.
You don't do that.

The members of a couple also have a private life!
You're bad, I don't know why I married you.
You took the words out of my mouth!
Sumika had a knife in her hand.
She told me she wanted to kill me and jumped on me.
As I struggled, I felt that I lost my strength and fell.
And then I realized that the knife was stuck in the middle of my chest.
-I think so.
-That's what you saw, Ayumi?
The only thing I saw was that Mrs. Konno was pointing the knife at him
and shouted, "I've had enough of forgiving you!"
All right, then.
It looks like she stuck it in self-defense.
Well, what I find unbelievable...
is that they're still a couple.
But it wasn't like that before, my wife.
When we met on the bus at the blood bank,
she was a very cheerful, giggly girl.
-That's normal.
We meet very often, you and me.
As we have a very rare blood group, it's easy for us to coincide.
But... lately she was always in a bad mood.
When she came home from work,
she would always say that she was tired and had a bad conscience,
and she didn't feel like cooking dinner.
Sometimes I wanted to help her and I would cook,
but she didn't like the dishes I prepared and they made her throw up.
I brought her to the campsite where we used to go, though,
when she found out that I had left the rice,
she got very angry and we had a fight.
That's when we met him and you gave us some rice,
and she changed his mood.
But I... I can't take it anymore.
But... I really like her, Mrs. Konno!
She dressed up for Halloween because she thought it would be fun for us,
and, while barbecuing, she laughed a lot.
Please, please..., I don't want her to die, I want her to get well!
Calm down, Ayumi.
(Ayumi) Yes!
I know she'll be fine.
(Remember, go Subaru) "Don't make that face."
(Voice: resounds) "They won't escape."
Don't make that face.
I'll protect you even if it costs me my life.
(Think) "On Dai Moroboshi."
"My older sister's boyfriend, who betrayed the Organization."
You know what?
If this lady is saved,
it'll be because she invited us to the barbecue today.
Ah... I guess.
Yeah, you're right.
If I hadn't found her cell phone
and Ayumi hadn't run to give it to her,
maybe we wouldn't have realized that they were fighting
and we wouldn't have been able to save her.
(Shinichi, thinks) "It's true, it's too many coincidences."
"It all went too smoothly."
"As if he caused it, the accident."
"But how did he do it?"
Secret love.
Secret love.

They take a long time.
Don't suffer, Ayumi, I'm sure she'll be fine.
- (mobile: vibrates)
-Yes.
- (mobile: vibrates)
-Oh!
A message.
This is Mrs. Konno's cell phone?
-Mm-hm.
-What we found earlier?
Ah...
Let me see it.
But what are you doing?
You can't read other people's messages.
(Shinichi voice) "The other day you told me that you weren't feeling well
and asked me for advice.
I think you should go to the doctor."
(Think) "Mm? Why is there a heart?"
"What's a heart doing in this message?"
"Why...?"
Gee, Conan, now you want to look at the messages she sent too?
Eh?!
(Conan's voice) Ah...
(Shinichi, thinks) "This is..."
(Conan voice) Hey, Mitsuhiko,
didn't the Sumika tell us that she sent threatening replies
to all the women who sent messages to her husband's cell phone?
Yes, but there are no threats here.
From what it says here, it seems that Mrs. Konno is in a bad mood...
because she's not feeling well.
Exactly, that's why there was a glass of water in the kitchen.

If she's not feeling well, that means she's sick, right?
It seems to me that she wanted to take some medicine,
because when I went to the kitchen, I found a glass of water.
(Shinichi, thinks) "A glass of water?"
And was there any medicine next to the glass?
No, next to the glass of water there was only a sugar bowl.
And then I took the glass to bring it to the lady,
but... but...
Atxim!
-Atxim!
-What's wrong with you?
Are you all right?
Let's see if you need the medicine.
-Atxim!
-Do you think you have a cold?
I don't think so... It's my nose, it itches a lot.
Gee, I can't... Atxim!
Now try to cover your nostrils with your index finger.
Do as I tell you, and plug your nose tightly.
Like this?
If it doesn't work, try pinching your nose.
-Ha-ha!
It looks like a magic trick!
-Oops, it's stopped!
(Shinichi, thinks) "A magic trick?"
"Oh! I get it!"
"Yes, exactly! Now I know how your wife has attacked."
-The light has gone out!
-Ah!
-Sumika!
-He means they have finished operating on her.
(Ai) On the cell phone in his hand a light signal lights up, look!
(Shinichi, thinks) "This is the voice message service."
"Just as I thought: it wasn't self-defense."
"Now we have to see what it will do next."
(Conan voice) "Don't miss the next episode!"
" 'Not a millimeter of forgiveness (part two)'."
