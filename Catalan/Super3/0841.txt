Punch.
Oysters.
There's nothing I can stand less than rainy days.
Well, he should have stayed home, shouldn't he?
Hm?
Shut up, donkey.
I have to take advantage that there is no Ran, that happens very little.
How can I stay at home when I can go out for a drink?
But it's that Ran has left us dinner ready before leaving.
If he scolds her afterwards, it's not my fault, eh?
Hm.
Look who's talking!
What about you?
It's good that you accompanied me, too, right?
Hehe!
Because, if it's me,
it's always easier to make up some excuse, if it's convenient.
Mm-hm.
Let's see... what would you like, for dinner?
(Shock and braking)
Hehe... Well, I don't know...
I don't like this noise at all.
What's the matter?
Yeah, it could be an accident.
It could be an accident.

"The bus stop in the rain"
Eh?
Hey, hey, are you okay?
He just lost consciousness.
Is he alive?
But he's... I don't understand what he's doing out here in the middle of the street.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Kogoro, look over there.
What is it?
It's death.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Take my cell phone and call the police.
What's the matter?
I don't think there will be.
(Siren)
Hey, what are you doing standing in the middle of the street?
-Is that Mr. Mouri?
-Inspector Megure...
We were coming back from an investigation.
What are you doing here, Inspector?
We saw a suspicious car stopped in the middle of the street
and we wanted to know what was going on.
What about you, Kogoro?
What are you doing here?
It turns out... that Conan and I were passing by nearby
and we felt a collision.
But, when we got here, we saw this.
Hm.
I see there's not even a security camera around here.
No.
And, also, being at night, and with the rain,
I doubt very much that we'll find any witnesses
to give us any clue as to what happened.
Well, that means we have no choice but to ask this man.
but to ask this man;
what state is he in?
I don't know, but I'd say he's in no danger.
We've called for an ambulance.
I don't think it'll be long.
We understand.
We'll have to wait until he regains consciousness.
Takagi, have you found out the victim's identity yet?
Yes.
Luckily, he had his wallet and cell phone in his pocket.
According to the ID card, his name is Naohiro Tsutsumi and he is 31 years old.
He probably died of a concussion
caused by a strong impact to the head.
From the smell, I would venture to say that he had consumed alcohol.
Perhaps the man was drunk and crossed the street without looking.
Hm.
But even so, we can't assume it was an accident.
Aah...
Uh-oh.
What?
Aah!
Aah!
You always do that, you.
You always have to go snooping around crime scenes.
Hm.
Oops, stay here and be good.
Ooh... Geez, what a headache...
What... what happened?
Do you remember anything?
(Man) Well, actually...
I remember I was driving along and all of a sudden...
Oh, man.
How is... How is the person I ran over?
H-has anything happened to him?
-No... it can't be...
-It didn't come out, I'm sorry.
(Takagi) L-listen, are you all right?
-No, I don't think it's necessary.
-Do you need medical attention?
Just in case, let's get you checked out.
The ambulance won't be long, it should be here soon.
I'll be right there.
How's he doing?
How is he?
I saw that he has a cut in his mouth,
but I didn't find any other major injuries.

So you are in a position to accompany us to the scene?
Yes, of course I am.
Then please come with us.
Yes.
Toshiaki Kikuchi.
Let's start with the name.
What's your name?
We understand.
And what do you do?
Okay, okay, okay.
Well, right now I'm unemployed.
If you like...
Na... Naohiro?
It's you!
Naohiro!
But how can it be!?
What happened?
What a tragedy!
What's the matter?
Oh... You knew her, the victim?
Yes.
Eh?
I don't believe this!
How could I run you over?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
So... you and the victim were friends?
Actually, he was a former co-worker.
Ex-partner, you say?
We were both recently laid off.
We joined the company at the same time and we were pretty close.
And the last time we saw each other we made jokes and everything
because, when they had decided to lay off selected employees,
we had both been selected at the same time.
Yeah, right.
I understand that it must be a bit difficult for you,
but could you describe to me in detail
how the accident you had went?
Of course.
"I went to dinner at a friend's restaurant...
and then I took the car home."
Oh!
- (crash)
- (hard braking)
"A person with an umbrella appeared in front of my car and I slammed on the brakes.
and I slammed on the brakes.
The thing is, with the rain and at night....
I know that's no excuse, though.
Hm.
He says he was coming home after dinner.
But I don't suppose you've had any alcohol, have you?
Evidently not.
Not a drop, I assure you.
Oh.
This umbrella...
Hm?
(thinks) "Must be the victim's umbrella."
Excuse me, may I ask what you're doing?
Uh?
Ah, it's you, boy.
I've come to get my umbrella.
I can't keep the inspector's,
and I have to keep it here inside the car.
(Takagi) Inspector Megure, the ambulance guys found this.
Yes, it looks like it.
It looks like they found something.
(Takagi) Eh?
(Takagi) What is it?
We found a suicide note from the victim.
"This life is too hard. I can't take it anymore."
Oh.
That can't be right.
A suicide note?
So, this means it wasn't an accident.
Everything seems to indicate that the victim committed suicide.
Hm?
But where was it found, this note?
Where was it?
Well... It was the paramedics.
They told me that they had found it
in one of the pockets of Mr. Tsutsumi's jacket.
Mr. Kikuchi, considering that you knew the victim,
do you know why he might have wanted to commit suicide?
Because he had been fired.
At first he started looking for a job with a lot of enthusiasm,
but... he didn't have much luck.
(Tsutsumi) Gee.... If I won the lottery, everything would be fine.
What you need is a job.
Hey, have you found something yet?
What?
But there's not even a company that wants to rent me.
Not even to try it.
I already know the answer.
Come on, don't say that, man.
Don't talk to me about work, you're depressing me.
I feel like drinking and everything.
Fuck.
Could you lend me some money, please?
You're not going to collect the company's liquidation?
Yes, sure, but I've already spent it all.
Oh, man.
-What are you doing?
-Come on, give me something, man!
Ha!
Look, I'll take one of these tickets.
And now, do you plan to do something?
I don't know.
If I run out of options, maybe the solution is suicide.
Are you really going to kill yourself?
Just kidding, man.
-Oh!
-Goodbye.
Well, from what he says, he was out of work...
and, besides, he was having financial problems.
I can't believe he was so desperate to kill himself.
I wish he'd talked to me before he...
Hey, Takagi, there's something behind the note.
Hm?
Hm?
You're right.
At first glance, it looks like a piece of thread.
It could be...
What did I tell you, huh?
Mind your own business, kiddo.
Ow, go sit down.
Oh, it hurt me!
It's started raining harder now.
Maybe we should take some shelter, huh?
Yeah, he's right.
Hm?
Hm.
Hm.
Well, as there are no suspicious circumstances,
we consider it a suicide and case closed.
By the way, will I... be charged with anything?
-Well, let's see...
-Have I committed a crime?

This is up to the Transit Department,
so I don't know what to tell you right now.
There are several options.
It could be negligence.
But it could also be considered involuntary manslaughter.
Sure, I understand.
"You're wrong. It wasn't a suicide."
"What a rage! Although I don't have enough evidence..."
Atxum!
Wow, you, I'm soaked.
It seems to me that this coat is not very waterproof.
Eh?
"Yes, of course!"
"It must be this way."
"I've got it."
I find it takes a long time to come, don't you, Traffic?
Yes.
According to the ambulance men,
it looks like there's been a multiple collision on the Ohashi Bridge to Beika.
Ah, here we go again.
Gee, here we go again...
Oh!
Mouri, what's wrong with you?
Don't tell me you've already solved it.
That's what always happens to him, isn't it?
(Kogoro voice) Yes, I've already solved the case.
It's a premeditated murder, and it was committed by Mr. Kikuchi.
But a moment ago you said yourself that it was a suicide.
Yes, because I was fooled...
by the magnificent interpretation of the culprit.
But what does it say?
Don't believe it.
Mr. Kikuchi, your testimony has some inconsistencies.
Hm.
(Kogoro) Please, Conan, show it to the inspector.
Yes.
Here, Inspector Megure.
I found it by the car.
Take it.
It's probably Mr. Tsutsumi's umbrella.
Hm?
It looks like an ordinary umbrella.
Mr. Kikuchi said that a person appeared in front of the car...
with an umbrella in front of the car.
How could that be?
This one was closed.
It's strange, isn't it?
Not so much, because it's possible that it closed...
with the impact of the accident.
(Kogoro) If you look closely, it is an umbrella with automatic opening.
To open it, all you have to do is press the button.
But, to close it, it is more complicated;
you have to slide this part down.
As you can see, if you don't make a deliberate effort to close it, it is impossible for it to close on its own,
it is impossible for this umbrella to close by itself.
So, I don't know at what point I would have been able to close it.
It can hardly have closed after
Mr. Kikuchi ran over it.
-Of course.
-And that means...
It's just that first it was a blur, the accident.
But now I remember that Naohiro didn't have it open, the umbrella.
It's just that... I got confused.
I'm sorry about that.
Well.
So you got confused...
I'm telling you the truth.
Right after the accident, I was very upset.
It seems to me that Mr. Tsutsumi closed the umbrella.
Tsutsumi has closed the umbrella
to get into his car.
Am I wrong?
Where are you going, Mouri?
When I arrived at the accident site,
the lights inside the car were on.
Hey, hey.
Are you all right?
"When you went back to the car to get the umbrella,
you closed the passenger door and the lights inside the car went out."
So you mean to say that, at some point,
someone has opened the passenger door.
And, for some reason, they didn't close it properly and it was left open.
Mr. Kikuchi,
How is it that, in order to get the umbrella from the back seat,
did you get in through the passenger door?
Well, because...
It seems to me that you wanted to hide the truth,
because he knew that the car's interior lights would give away...
that he had let Mr. Tsutsumi open the door so that he could get in.
Th-that's a lie...
The truth is that he had a date with Mr. Tsutsumi in this street.
Tsutsumi on this deserted street,
where there are no security cameras.
"He waited,
and when he saw her arrive, he told her to get in the car."
"And when he closed the umbrella to pull up the passenger seat
and knocked on the door, you started backing out of the car.
"It must have been like that,
as you made the abrasions on the fingers of your right hand."
"Then you stopped the car....
"And you started off again at full speed,
this time towards Mr. Tsutsumi, who wasn't expecting it."
Wait a minute.
How come you backed up first?
I find that absurd.
No, he did it to get enough thrust...
and kill a person by ramming the car.
If the rearview mirror on the passenger's side
is bent forward proves
that the car had to go backwards first.
"When it reversed,
the mirror collided with Mr. Tsutsumi."

Ah!
(Wheels: squeaking)
"After running him over,
"He got out of the car with the suicide note
that you had prepared yourself."
"You then put it in the victim's jacket pocket."
"You returned to the car and made it appear that he was unconscious."
Here's what actually happened.
B-but there's no sense to it all, don't you see?
Do you have any proof to begin with?
You can't conclude that I'm a murderer just from what you've explained.
Yes, now you're right.
All the evidence is circumstantial.
We don't have enough to charge you with murder.
There is one piece of evidence.
Look at the note that the victim's corpse has turned up.
(Kogoro) Look closely at the paper.
What's wrong with it?
Don't you find it's too neat?
If Mr. Tsutsumi had been run over by a car
with the note in her pocket,
the paper would be much more wrinkled.
(Takagi) Well, now that you mention it, you may be right.
Also, the note is wet in a strange way.
(Takagi) That's true.
There are some pieces that are very dry.
What does that mean, Mouri?
It means that the suicide note was waterproofed.
And who could have any interest in doing that?
(Kogoro) I don't think anyone sprayed the note with waterproofing.
Rather, it must have been in contact
with some other water-repellent substance
and the paper has been impregnated.
Agent Takagi, can you take a look
in the glove compartment of Mr. Kikuchi's car?
Of course, right away.
Oh!
There was this.
It's car wax, and there's also the cloth to apply it with.
(Kogoro) Mr. Kikuchi, you waxed the car today, didn't you?
The fact that only the right sleeve repels water
(Kogoro) The fact that only the right sleeve repels water clearly demonstrates this.
If the blue-colored fibers found in the note match those of the fabric
match those of the fabric,
we'll know for certain that the note in Mr. Tsutsumi's pocket
was planted by you.
I was probably hoping that the rain would wash away all the evidence.
But, in the end, it went against you and gave you away.
That day, when you were dispatched in Naohiro,
she told her all of lies about me in my head
and she got me fired too.
(Snoring)
Hm?
(snoring) What's wrong?
Naohiro!
Why did you tell those lies?
-Well, I didn't really have any reason.
-I was sent away because of you.
But, since I was dismissed, I wanted to drag someone else along with me.
What are you talking about?
You ruined my life just for this reason?
Look, now that we've both been sent away, we could be good friends.
What?
What are you saying?
"Just... on a whim, you destroyed my life."
I couldn't forgive him.

Oysters.
It's about time.
Let's see if we can have dinner for once.
Yes.
Wow, now it's raining again.
Hey, where's my umbrella?
Oh, oysters!
What? I left it on the bench at the bus stop.
I left it on the bench at the bus stop.
I'm going to look for it now.
Aaah...!
"It's a classic: when it stops raining, you lose your umbrellas."
Too bad you came along, Conan.
Otherwise, today would be a perfect day.
In fact, I came because Ran asked me to.
Eh?
Well, I'm so glad to see that you're already in better spirits.
Well, it's thanks to you.
If you agree, I'd like to bring you here.
To an amusement park?
