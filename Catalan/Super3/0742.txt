Come on!
Good one!
What?
-No!

"The promise of the soccer player."
What a rage, the Big Osaka have failed again.
So what if they fail?
Since when are you a Big Osaka fan?
No, we're not Big Osaka fans, we've always gone with the Spirits.
But, one day, at the school's soccer practice,
he came to see us in Sanada.
And even though it's not our team, we're excited to cheer for them.
(Genta) But, without Higo,
Big Osaka has a hard time winning games.
(Genta) That's true,
but as en Higo has been selected to go to the World Cup,
he will not be able to play this tournament.
In Higo and Hide are the strikers who will represent Japan in the World Cup.
That's why he's replacing him in Sanada today, right?
Yes, he is replacing Higo in Sanada.
-Hey!
-But we have to tell him...
Don't call me substitute, tell me...
Supersubstitut.
Is it clear to you?
Yes, it was very clear.
But first a little more and mark, right?
I saw that he shot with his right foot.
If he hadn't, the defender would have intercepted the ball.
I think it was a good decision.
What did you mean?
You mean?
I think the dribble he made in this play was not necessary.
Without changing direction and shooting into the left corner,
I'm sure he would have scored.
And why did he change direction?
He did the same thing a while ago.
What do you mean by that?
Before, in Sanada he was alone in the goal area...
and he got a perfect cross.
I was convinced that left-footed.
(Public) Buuuu!
You're right, he shot with his right leg with such bad luck...
that he sent the ball over the sticks.
Indeed he did.
If the left is his dominant leg,
I don't understand why he's shooting all the time with his right leg.
Maybe what's happening is that he wants to show his coach that he can also shoot with his right foot.
that he is also capable of shooting with his right.
But when it comes down to it, he hasn't come off.
But there is another issue.
In Sanada he does something a bit strange.
I've noticed that he keeps looking towards the stands.
Another time.
See how he looks at the stands?
Maybe she does.
Maybe he's looking for someone.
But from here you can't see it well.
What is certain is that he looks worried.
Gee, what if there's someone who has blackmailed her...
and forced her to miss the goals?
Eh?
Just kidding, it's impossible.
What's that?
But why is it impossible?
Conan, are you saying that because you have already seen a similar case?
A case like this?
No, and now!
I've imagined strange things, don't worry.
We watch the game.
"But it's more than obvious that today in Sanada he doesn't play as usual."
"I'm sure there's something wrong with him."
Ayumi... Genta...
You heard what he said in Conan, didn't you?
Do you think he meant it?
This thing you said that someone is blackmailing you in Sanada
because he misses all the goals?
Yes.
I think Conan has reason to believe that something is going on,
but he's withholding information from us.
Well then...
I vote for us 3 to investigate the case.
Yes.
Conan!
We'll be right back, we have to go to the bathroom.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Ah.
Look at that man.
He's very suspicious, isn't he?
Well, let's go up and take a closer look.
-Come on, Sanada!
-Sanada!
Come on, let's go!
-Come on, come on!
Run, run!
-Come on, cheer up.
(Man) Calm down.

Press.
Press again.
Relax, Sanada, it's okay.
Have you seen her?
Yeah, this guy keeps his eye on the two girls
of the two girls cheering in Sanada.
It's very suspicious.
What's up?
Kaoru!
Aren't you in Conan?
What are you doing here?
Did you come to watch the game with your girlfriend?
You're mistaken.
Is that so?
No, it's not...
Oh, all right.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
You're not here for work today, are you?
Don't wear the press vest.
No, I'm having a party today.
Thanks to that exclusive,
I'm back in the local news section.
But since that attack,
I'm very interested in watching Takahiro Sanada play.
Ah.
Now I follow him to every match.
By the way, haven't you noticed anything strange in the way he plays?
Yes, today he is not the same player as usual.
A couple of days ago they settled down in the hotel
where he always stays when he comes to Tokyo
and I took a few pictures of him during the morning training session
on a field nearby.
And during training, did he also shoot with his right leg?
No, he didn't.
I took pictures of him practicing his penalty kicks
and he always shot with his left.
He would shoot strong, straight shots towards the left corner of the goal.
He practiced this shot many times, and he didn't do anything else.
"I was already thinking about it."
"But today, why does he shoot with his right?"
(Audience: cheers)
Shoot, shoot!
Come on, let's go.
Run!
Oysters.
On the stick.
Brings back a lot of memories, the field... where he trained.
Yes, the Nishishiba Sports Park.
Ah, you've been there?
When I started high school,
we played a soccer tournament on this field.
"A few days before the game, I went to the field to test the turf,
and then I practiced shooting at the goal."
"And I also tried the shot that's in the photos.
"That Kaoru took at Sanada,
a strong, straight shot to the left corner."
"But he always sent the ball over the sticks."
Caram, the young soccer prodigy...
missed penalties with no goalkeeper in goal.
He had just started high school.
What about high school?
You said you had just started high school.
Oh, I wasn't talking about me, I was talking about an acquaintance.
Ah.
Come on, run!
Run, run!
Sanada!
Come on, come on!
Run!
Run!
Hey, what's that?
What he's carrying in his lap.
Well, I don't know.
Looks like a black tube.
A gun.
I think it's a gun.
But pistols don't have such a fat barrel.
(Mitsuhiko) "No, it's a silencer;
It's so the shot won't make any noise."
(Mitsuhiko) "I've seen it in spy movies."
(Mitsuhiko) "Now I get it.
The girl cheering at Sanada must be his girlfriend.
The man with the glasses and the mask is blackmailing him in Sanada
and told her that if she scores any goals during this match, he will kill her.
That's why he shoots with his right, but his dominant leg is his left.
-Ah!
-What do we do now, Mitsuhiko?
Shall we tell the security guards?
(Shouting)
(Cheering)
Good one, Takahiro!
(cheering) Oh.
(cheering) Shit!
(cheering)
-He scored a goal.
-We have a problem.
-No, please!
-Don't shoot!
What are you doing?
Have you gone crazy?!
-He's blackmailing Sanada.
-We won't let him.
Ayumi, go get the security guards.
Listen, this isn't a gun.
What's wrong?
Hey, what's wrong?
What's gotten into you?
Let me go at once.
We thought he wanted to shoot a gun with a silencer.
It's a video camera.
To record on the sly.
But... but what does it say!?
I'm not recording anything!
Ah.
It's the man who's stalking Yuki!
So the girl wasn't Sanada's girlfriend...?
Looks like they're just fans of yours.
You guys are irresponsible.
It's a good thing it was just a video camera.
If it had been a real gun,
we could've gotten a bad rap.
Maybe so, but I was able to get some great shots.
Thanks, guys.
I'll buy you a bite to eat at the bar.
-They just blew the halftime whistle.
- (whistle)
Yay!
That's you.
(Shinichi's voice) What donkeys!
If you hadn't said what you said, they wouldn't have done anything.
Okay, you're absolutely right, but, be that as it may,
I'm sure there's something wrong with Sanada.
I'm going to the bathroom.
What's wrong with you?

Do you want me to come with you?
No, I'm fine.
"I was looking for this child."
Oh.
Uh?
Hey, excuse me.
What's wrong with his ankle, that kid?
He fell off his bike and twisted it.
Well, no, I'm not.
Ah.
And you're his father?
Well, he doesn't look like the coach of a soccer team.
This boy is a friend of Takahiro Sanada?
Why do you say so?
Because Takahiro always looks at him and just now he made signs to him.
Something.
What is the relationship between a child who falls off the bicycle
and a professional soccer player?
Why do you ask, this?
When Sanada's team is in Tokyo,
he always goes to train at the field in Nishishiba.
And on his jacket he wears just that.
Nishishiba Soccer Club.
I'm the manager of a supermarket in Nishishiba.
"A couple of days ago I went for a walk
near the sports park in the neighborhood."
(Beat)
- (thump)
- (squeaking)
Did you hurt yourself, kid?
-Oh, sorry.
-The ankle.
I was practicing penalty kicks
and I sent the ball over the sticks.
Ouch...
Does it... hurt you a lot?
"And we took the boy to a hospital I know in the neighborhood."
Now I won't be able to play soccer.
Don't worry.
In 10 days you'll be as good as new.
-And you will be.
-But I won't be able to kick hard.
If your ankle still hasn't healed completely,
you can always kick with your left.
You always kick with your left leg.
-Ah...
-Could you also shoot with your right?
Of course I could.
I'm a professional player.
I can kick with my right.
Then, in the next game, score a goal with your right foot.
And then I'm going to try, too.
"That's why in Sanada..."
After a few days in Sanada sent us tickets for today's game.
But since Koh's parents could not come, I have accompanied him.
Thank you very much.
(Beep)
I do not understand.
How can it be that a player of the professional league
make such an idiotic promise because he unintentionally hurt a child?
It's just that Sanada is a very impulsive player.
In fact, this is one of the strengths he has.
I hope he scores a goal in the second half.
Yes, and that he doesn't take such disastrous shots.
I want him to score a fantastic goal.
"But there is something that worries me."
(Phone)
Sports park maintenance office, tell me?
(Phone) Eh?
Mouri?
Is that the famous detective Kogoro Mouri?
Mr. Fukazawa explained everything to me.
Can't you forgive the promise to Sanada?
I can't, a promise is a promise.
What if I tell you that you didn't really get hurt because of Sanada?
It was Sanada's fault.
He kicked the ball and... He kicked the ball and... Eh?
Let's see, do you remember exactly where you fell off the bike?
Huh?
I think it was over here.
Are you sure about that?
I know because I had just crossed the crosswalk.
Which direction did the ball come from?
Diagonally, from behind.
See, in Sanada it was right here,
and he practiced hard, straight shots into the left corner of the goal.
But one time he shot too hard
and the ball went over the sticks.
In Fukazawa he was here.
The ball should have gone over his head
and then continued in this direction.
You see?
As in Sanada he always shot to the left corner,
the ball couldn't have passed behind you diagonally,
because you're at the height of the crosswalk.
What's that?
Then why did you...?
I can only think of one possibility.
The ball didn't go over Mr. Fukazawa.
It actually went straight at your friend
and hit him pretty hard.
It stung him in the face.
It stung him in the face.
Hey, what happened to him?
How come his glasses are crooked?
One of the temples is half broken.
No, it wasn't that.
It was the ball hit, wasn't it?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
If the ball hit Mr. Fukazawa,
how come it then stung me and made me fall?
You're right, as I explained it to you,
the ball couldn't have gone to you,
unless Mr. Fukazawa
had been very angry after receiving the hit
and threw it in the direction of the crosswalk.
No, that's not true.
When I saw the ball, I was here,

and I'm pretty sure it went over my head.
Actually, in Sanada he shot this way and the ball knocked you down.
Come on, think back.
The ball came diagonally and hit you from behind, right?
Mr. Fukazawa.
You know the park has a surveillance camera here?
Huh?
I called the maintenance office
and asked them to check the footage from the day before yesterday.
But...
"(Fukazawa: moans in pain)"
"Ah... Coi de pelota!"
Why did you do all this?
My intention is not to blame him for anything, really.
I'm sure he's a good person.
But it's important that the truth be known.
I had to do it for Sanada, and also for Koh.
Foul.
It's a penalty!
(Shouting)
Nobu.
We trust you.
Let's go.
"If I shoot with my left foot to the left corner,
I'm sure I'll be able to score."
"But if I do, I'll break the promise I made to that boy."
Eh?
(Beeping)
(Shouts of disapproval)
I can't believe it.
That's so loud!
It's failed again.
Oh, shit.
It's all right.
The game's not over yet.
-And get your act together.
-Shut up.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
He-he.
In Sanada it's special.

So, did you get the ball?
I'm sorry for deceiving you.
Really, Sanada, Koh, I'm really sorry.
It's okay, really.
It will help me to play soccer better.
Yes, please calm down, Sanada.
I apologize.
Even if the ball was thrown by you,
I also have my share of the blame for the injury he got in Koh.
And, on top of that, I hit him in the face.
I'm sorry for that.
Sanada...
But you shouldn't have missed this penalty.
That they found a woman's dead body where we came from?
Don't... don't smoke that...
It can't be.
"I can't believe it!"
(Kogoro voice) The slap on the wrist made me react.
The case is still not completely solved.
What do you mean it's not solved?
"Don't miss the next episode: 'Too much of a coincidence."
