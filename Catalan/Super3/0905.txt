The Witness, seven years later (part one)."
How fortunate to be able to spend the weekend in this place!
Sometimes you have really good ideas, father.
What is it?
The ad for the guesthouse where we'll be sleeping tonight, perhaps?
It says here that it is well known
for its great variety of beers.
I see what you mean.
That's why the father wanted to come here.
My mouth is watering just thinking about it...
And who is he?
The Prince of Beer?
Yes.
But you don't know him?
His name is Otar Minakitaya.
He's quite a famous character!
He's on TV.
Besides, everybody knows him because he has a blog...
and a program where he is a beer critic.
That's why they call him "the Prince of Beer".
Some time ago... he formed a comedy couple with another celebrity.
They were called "Otaria and Kyujiro Minakitaya".
(Man) Yes, but they say that Kyujiro committed a crime 3 years ago...
and that this affected them and made them split up.
Good morning!
My name is Ide.
Oh!
You are...
-You're mistaken.
-Mr. Mouri, right?
I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri.
I didn't expect to meet someone as famous as you!
How do you do?
My name is Hiroko.
Are you staying overnight at the Hatobue Inn, too?
-Yes, I am.
You too?
-Yes.
I've read that the Prince of Beer leaves you in the clouds
and I couldn't help but come.
Sorry I'm late.
I'm Ohara, from Hatobue Guesthouse.
Mr. Mouri, Miss Fujiyoshi, Mr. Ide...
-And you must be Mr. Shirogane. -Exactly.
We're all here.
Pugin.
I'll take you to the inn.
It takes about 20 minutes,
so we should be there a little before half past five by three.
(Woman) Please leave.
I've already told you.
I don't have to discuss anything with you.
-You must understand that I just want to... - (car: approaching)
Welcome!
I'm glad to have you here.
I'm the manager of the guesthouse.
My name is Asako Yuri.
-Welcome.
-My daughter Mion.
You must be tired from the trip.
Please continue for a while.
This... is scenery from the surrounding area?
Yes.
The scenery around here is very beautiful.
If you like, I can take you for a walk before dinner and show you around.
And... what is this?
Ah!
Magnets we use for the cows.
When the cows are grazing,
they often swallow some key or some metal object
that is camouflaged in the middle of the grass.
It can be dangerous for the animal.
To prevent them from hurting themselves, they are made to swallow a very strong magnet,
which attracts the metals and protects their stomach.
That's why we call it "cow magnets".
Yesterday a customer was playing for a while
to see how many plates he could hook.
But my game is much more fun.
You tell me what you think.
It is played in a group.
You have to put all the plates in a row.
The first one to drop the badge loses.
(Man) You didn't have this the last time I was here.
Otar!
We didn't expect you so early.
It's him!
The Prince... of Beer!
Soc... I'm a big fan of yours.
Could you sign my book, please?
-So much!
-Oh!
I'd love to!
You have it.
Thank you very much!
Look!
He signed it!
What's that?
Would you like some tea, Otar?
Yes, thank you, Asako.
Do you come here often?
Yes.
They have an excellent collection of beers.

In addition, the place is very quiet...
and can be savored while breathing fresh air.
In fact, it's a real luxury.
I come almost every month.
And this shield?
What is it?
Ah!
It's this.
It's the emblem of Byun, the masked comet.
He's a superhero?
Yes, he was... in a series seven years ago.
A terrible evil one wants to conquer the Earth.
He comes from the world of demons and his name is "Dyark,
the king of space darkness".
But Byun protects her.
He had been one of the minions of the evil Dyark,
but he met a girl from Earth
and was touched by her kindness.
He decided to reform and change sides
and vowed to protect Earth.
Yes, I remember, from this series!
But I think... they took it off the air before it ended, right?
Yes.
It was taken off the air at the most exciting time.
And so much so.
Because it had ridiculous ratings.
They should have respected the show, regardless of the ratings!
It was a very cool show.
Iah!
(Breaking)
Mion!
Easy, love, breathe.
We didn't mean to interrupt.
I'm sorry.
Isn't she all right, the child?
Oh.
It's time to start preparing dinner.
From now on, you have free time until 6:00,
which is just about the time the dining room opens.
I think I'm going to go for a little walk.
Anyone want to join us?
Yes!
Are you coming with us, Mion?
Yes.
I'm coming with you.
So I'll be your guide.
Are you in?
No, I'll rest until dinner time.
I'm staying here too.
I have... a half-finished book.
I'll stay and read.
I have to talk to my manager, but I'll join you some other day.
I'm serious.
Yes.
Too bad.
Then let's go the 4 of us.
You have fallen this paper, Mr. Shirogane.
They don't deserve it.
Thanks a lot, kid.
Oh!
Another car.
You can see he must be doing very well in Otaru.
First he bought a small van,
then a sedan, and now this.
God-hay-do, to be able to afford three cars!
Inspector... All indications are that he drowned.
None of the items he was carrying allow us to identify him.
Well, that... we also found that blow.
Today, for a pre-dinner drink, we brought a fruity beer.
Fruity?
In Belgium, for years now,
they have a tradition of adding fruit to beer.
They put cherries, or raspberries?
Oops!
What a nice smell!
It looks like... it has yuzu in it.
Of course it does!
Yuzu is a typical Japanese citrus fruit,
with a very refreshing taste and a very characteristic smell.
Come on, now, let's toast!
Here's to all of us!
Cheers!
Cheers.
Ah!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
What a peculiar taste!
It's sweet but the citrus gives it a tartness.
Next will be a Pilsner.
In Japan, this beer is very well received.
It has body, just the right bitterness and a fantastic smell.
Now we'll have an India Pale Ale.
Uh!
It's quite bitter but it's a real treat!
Mm!
What a good meat!
Next is a Porter.
The roasted aroma of the malt is quite noticeable.
It has a flavor reminiscent of the bitterness of an infused coffee.
It also combines perfectly to bring out the flavor of the meat.
Instead of desserts,
we'll have a special beer for you, if that's okay.
This is beer?
Wow!
Of course it's beer!
It's very good beer.
It's not very bitter but it has a very refreshing taste.
It's true!
Being so blue,
I thought it would taste sweet like Blue Hawaii...
They have added gardenia pigment, that's why it has this color.
The taste has nothing to do with the image you get by looking at it.
It's deceiving.
I admit that it has fooled me too, the appearance.
(Door, open)
That's it.
You've lost, Ran!
"This man... we saw him at noon."
Excuse the interruption.
Are you policemen?
"What are you doing here?"
You... aren't you Detective Kogoro Mouri?
That's right.
Yes, I am myself.
Mr. Muramatsu,
I already told you this noon what happened that day.
Yes, you did.
But now I come for another topic.
"What day should you talk about?"
We come... because today, at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon,
we found the body of a man
in the swamp about 7 kilometers to the west.
In fact, he died of drowning, but of what?

Accident?
Suicide?
Murder?
We have all lines of investigation open.
The river that runs through the back of the boarding house
connects to the swamp.
We're investigating all the houses
or places up the river from there.
Does this man look familiar to you?
Have you ever seen her around here?
-He knows him, maybe?
-This man...
Yes, he's a client.
He stayed here... about two months ago.
Yes, that's him!
Shujiro Kitamoto.
What?
Who... who did you say?
But... what's the matter?
You... are you Mr. Otar Minakitaya?
This... is in Kyujiro!
-Yes.
-Your artistic partner?
In the photo he looks very changed, but... That's him.
His real name is Shujiro Kitamoto...
And when... did you last see him?
3 years ago, when we stopped being a comedy couple.
I haven't seen him anymore.
I'd heard he wrote about celebrities.
In the tabloids?
Well, now that you mention it,
he's been asking me a lot of questions about you.
These reporters have a bad reputation.
They'll do anything to get an exclusive.
I know she was drowning in debt
and that creditors were threatening her in a worrying way.
I was supposed to come...
to see if I could find dirt on Otaria.
But as it turned out...
According to all indications,
death occurred today at around 1:00 noon.
What were you doing at this time?
I was filming until half past twelve in the city center.
Then I drove up here in my car.
From there it takes about a couple of hours.
"We were on the train. We were there from twelve o'clock until one o'clock."
What about you?
The two of us were here getting everything ready for when the customers arrived.
-And the rest?
Where were they?
-Yes.
-We need information.
-And what do we have to do with it?
I was on the train at that time.
I came with the same train as Mr. Mouri.
And I was on the bus at that time.
I got on at twelve o'clock at Tatsukawa and arrived at Nishiokuho at ten minutes to two o'clock.
with ten minutes to two o'clock.
I arrived an hour earlier with the fast train
and went for a walk around the station.
We will need you to identify yourselves
in case we need to call you back later.
My name is Toru Shirogane.
I write for the local magazine.
Masanari Ide.
Web designer.
Hiroko Fujiyoshi.
I work for a stationery company.
-And that... does that ring a bell?
-Oh!
It's in Byun, the masked comet!
Do you know if Mr. Kyujiro liked this character?
-I don't know.
- (Mion: cries)
Mion!
Mion, are you all right?
Before too... you got nervous
when you heard about the masked comet.
No, nothing's wrong.
What's wrong?
That's it, isn't it?
Now that you mention it...
a while ago, there was a violent murder in Haido, wasn't there?
A financier was attacked
and robbed him of all the money in his suitcase.
They say that the killers had covered their faces
with masks of Byun's character, the masked comet.
That was about 7 years ago.
That's right.
Yes, I remember now.
And a little girl saw it all.
(Body: falls down)
"A witness."
Mion!
Mion, breathe, please!
Come on, let's stretch it out in the other room.
Mr. Ide, may I ask what you've done?
What did you do?
I didn't...
(Door: knock)
But... who's calling at this hour?
Oh!
Hiroko!
- (sliding doors) - (door, open)
There's more information, Inspector.
-Come in.
-We have the autopsy result. -We have the autopsy result.
The water in the lungs wasn't from the swamp, it was from the tap.
-Yes. -Yes.
-What do you mean?
This means that...
That the victim was killed somewhere else.
And that later they made the transfer of the corpse
with the intention of dumping it in the swamp.
The Otar Minakitaya is the first suspect we have.
But... who did all this?
I was thirsty and came down to get a drink and found him like this.
Father!
Mr. Minakitaya doesn't answer.
What's that?
Did he lock the door from the inside?
And he closed the door from the inside.
Mr. Minakitaya, are you all right?
Please answer!
Otar, shall I sit down?
-Mr. Mouri.
A copy.
-Thank you very much.
-Maybe you've locked it.
-It won't open.

What if it has fallen and has been done wrong?
Father, let me.
Mr. Minakitaya!
It's too late.
It's already dead.
But he's still warm.
This means... he died very recently.
"They had closed inside and out. There's no doubt about it."
"The window is also locked from the inside."
Mr. Mouri!
There's a blood mark down here.
There.
Where?
And it looks like a footprint.
It must be Mr. Minakitaya's.
Look!
There's something written there!
It's the emblem of the masked comet!
So, she was murdered?
-Did she want to leave us a message?
If the masked comet is the culprit...
Let's not lose our nerves.
She may also have had too much to drink,
and fell and hit his head.
(Mion) The masked comet is back!
I... I had forgotten everything.
Everything, but now...
-Miona... -Aaaaaah!
Mion!
Mion!
Are you all right?
Wake up!
-We have to take her to the room.
-Yes.

(Kogoro) I beg your pardon?
-They're the same.
(Kogoro) -What does it look like?
Mr. Otar was one of the criminals.
What about you?
You're such a good detective...
