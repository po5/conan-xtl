DETECTIVE CONAN
The high-speed train explosion
Where have you seen, shaving the train on the day your friend gets married!
Won't you ever change?
What do you want me to do?
I fell asleep because I finished late from the meeting.
You fell asleep at the entrance because you were drunk!
I let you come and now you're giving me a lecture?
Man, the party's in Kyoto, right?
Of course we want to come, eh, Conan?
Ah... yes...
And why did he have to come?
You want us to leave him alone?
Oh... Aren't they new, these shoes, Conan?
Yes, Dr. Agasa gave them to me.
(Agasa) I have prepared a fantastic invention for you!
It's a pair of superchery shoes!
If you kick the ball, the criminal will be shot!
Electricity and magnetic force increase muscle power.
And the glasses?
Ah yes, I have them.
I've installed a mini-circumference.
I'm sure it will do you good.
(He thinks) "You mean it will work, when I need it?"
-Hurrah!
It's a fast train!
-Hurrah!
Hurrah!
We also had to take these kids with us?
Don't suffer, I've already paid the travel expenses.
How are they, parents nowadays!
Conan, let's go and have a look around the train!
It will be fun!
-Let's go!
-Yes!
The parents of these kids are a problem.
But what about the parents of this one?
They didn't even call us.
"Geez..."
I go to the bathroom.
"I'm not a freeloader for fun!"
Those men are to blame for all this.
"They made me drink that potion."
"They're such..."
It's them!
"Now I have a chance to steal the potion from them."
"When I return to being Shinichi Kudo, a teenage detective,
I will reveal all their criminal acts."
"Prepareu's-e!"
"But what the hell are they doing, on this train?"
"It looks like they're waiting for someone."
"Now is the time
to attach Dr. Agasa's minimicrophone to his seat."
Get out of the way, please.
I-I haven't done anything.
You're sure?
Let's see... Ecs!
Conan, you're a very bad boy!
We always get it because of bad kids like you!
The chewing gum is wrapped and put in the ashtray!
Like this.
"I'll feel the voices, from here!"
Conan, you have to take example from them.
Way to go, kids!
We always get along!
Come on, let's go!
Conan, knowing you, it wasn't just a prank, was it?
What secret weapon is it, that chewing gum?
Are they spies, those two?
It would be funny, but I just wanted to make a joke.
Oh, did you?
Yes.
What a bore.
Wow!
What a boring kid!
Come on, let's go for a ride on the train!
-Yes, yes, yes, yes! -Yeah! -Yeah!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm a bore.
Get out of the way, kid!
Hey? (Laughs)
What's the matter? (thinks) "They're not!
(thinks) "They're not!"
"It's not the men in black."
"I was wrong, what a fool I am."
Gee, they traded the wallet for a suitcase.
"Mmm... This gives me a bad feeling."
"That's very strange, they took the suitcase by mistake."
"I've got it! I'll use the microphone!"
"He said that if I adjust the frequency with this dial,
"a special wave would stimulate my eardrum.
and that I could feel it with my glasses on."
(Microphone) "Now I can smoke..."
"I feel them!"
Eh?
There's something, here...
(Microphone) "Oysters!"
(Microphone) "It's a chewing gum!" "What luck!"
It's been an easy business, hasn't it, partner?
"Don't shout so much."
"Don't be afraid, man. Nobody can hear us."
Imagine, 4 million just to carry that wallet.
What was in it?
Information about the gold market.
"If we use it right, we're going to make a lot more than $4 million."

The other will be thinking about the fortune she will win,
and looking at the landscape from above for the last time.
For the last time?
In that wallet we gave her,
there's also a bomb that will explode within 10 seconds of being hit.
"A... a bomb."
(Microphone) "If you drop the wallet..."
That information is very important,
he will have it well caught.
Besides, the bomb is programmed to explode at 10 past 3 o'clock.
A time bomb?
Not exactly: when the time comes,
it will automatically activate the detonator without even realizing it!
And, after 10 seconds, there will be a multiple explosion!"
What!
Multiple!
Mu-mage... multiple... multiple...
-64! -64!
You mean multiply.
8 times 8, 64.
Oh, right...
8 times 8, 64... 8 times 9...
-72! -72!
What a fright he has given me, this child.
(Loud speaker) Nagoya, Nagoya...
(loud speaker) Quickly!
Shitada!
Let's go, let's go!
Yes!
"Freeze, I want to ask you something!"
Stop it!
Hey, hey, hey!
I can't leave you alone even for a moment.
Deixa'm estar!
Let go of me!
"Oh... Now we're lost, without those guys..."
"Wait a minute, the guy they made the deal with, though it's the train."
"Oysters! It's 40 minutes to the explosion!"
"I have to find that guy soon..."
"But how will I find him?"
"There are hundreds of people, and I don't know what he looks like..."
Conan, come back!
That nano!
Where the hell did he go?
-A bomb!? - A bomb!?
That's right!
There's a person with a bomb on board.
He stopped at the next station and make everyone get out!
Do not make jokes to older people.
Just so it's a child, we don't have to get her off...
Okay, wait here.
I'll ask Superman to help us.
(Thinking) "It's bad business. They don't believe me. What can I do?"
Hello, Conan.
Anything interesting going on?
If something happens, tell us about it.
"These are the only ones who would believe it."
"Black wallets are everywhere."
"It would be impossible to check them all."
"I guess I'll have to look for the bomb alone."
"I have to find a clue."
"What were they talking about, those, at first?"
Ah... Now I can smoke...
"What do you mean?"
"The restaurant is a non-smoking area."
"The guy they were dealing with doesn't like smoke."
"So, it's the non-smoking car!"
How many non-smoking cars are there, on this train?
There are 8.
-What is it? -Is it a riddle?
"There must be another clue."
(Remember) "4 million, to carry that wallet."
"-What was in it?"
"" -Information about the gold market.
"The other will be thinking about the fortune he'll make,
and looking at the landscape from above..."
From where do you see the landscape from above?
The second floor of the first class carriages.
And the first class non-smoking...
-It's the second floor of car 7. What's there?
Come on, let's go!
No, no, it is too dangerous for the children.
(At the same time) We are the Junior Detectives League.
(At the same time) Let's go!
(Think) "Who must it be, what's carrying the wallet with the bomb?"
"There's one person, two..."
"3..."
"Y 4."
"We'll have to look at the portfolios one by one."
"The stock market and, gee... a gold Rolex!"
"This one must be loaded with money. All right."
Hey, let me play, too? This is not a toy.
There are rounds and squares, right?
You won't let me work.
Get out of here!
You nasty!
Then let me play with that black thing.
What's the matter, kid?
Are you lost?
Oh, my goodness!
Have you seen?
What a beautiful view!
Yes!
There's a fantastic view of Fuji-San today, from here...
Fuji-San...
What do you like, Fuji-San?
Yes, I like it very much!
"Wow! It's closed..."
You're making me nervous!
Didn't I tell you to leave?
"Too bad!"
Miss, maybe you went to the restaurant?
Yes, why?
Did he go with those men in black?
It looks like you.
Ah, it's not me.
I'm sorry, but I went alone.
Sir, have you gone? I don't have time to go!
Excuse me, don't be angry.
Eh, it was the restaurant, you, a moment ago?
Eeeeeh?

You went to the restaurant just now!
Ah, yes I have.
Disneyland is a fantastic place.
I've been there many times.
"Anyway, I'll come back later, to see this old man."
"Wow! What elegance!"
Hey, hey, did you go to the restaurant?
What are you saying?
N... no, in fact I'm not interested in them, am I?
"Wow! A napkin from the restaurant!"
"This guy went to the restaurant. Very good."
Hey, listen, I got a paper airplane stuck up here.
What can I have?
Excuse me, excuse me...
Let's see, where is it?
I can't find it.
Don't touch it!
AAAAAAAAA!
(Remember) "In that black wallet there is a high-tech bomb
that will explode within 10 seconds of being hit."
I have to get it!
Eh?
-Very good, Genta!
Good timing!
-Very good timing!
By the way, what's this?
It's... that's...
Get me out of my mind!
Hey!
There's... Underpants!
(laughs)
You're... you're a fucking peeping Tom!
I never want to see you again!
Conan, and you too, stop fooling around!
"Fourteen minutes to explosion."
"Anyway, we've ruled out one suspect. 3 to go!"
"Who's got the bomb?"
"Oh, those bastards...!"
A time bomb?
Not exactly, when the time comes,
it will set off the detonator automatically without realizing it!
"Sure... the bomb will be triggered by some signal..."
"And the 3 remaining ones have..."
"A computer..."
"A telephone..."
"And a walkman..."
"I don't solve anything, with that. All 3 are suspects."
"I'm missing a clue."
Where are you going?
I thought I told you to stay put.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Have you been recently.
I'm thirsty... Wait a bit.
I want a souvenir.
On the way back.
I want to go for a walk.
Nothing at all.
You're a bad boy, Conan, very bad.
"My God, 7 minutes to go!"
"The only solution is to explain everything and evacuate the passengers..."
"But who will believe the story of a little boy?"
"They would only believe me if I did something."
"If I explained to the Ran that I'm Shinichi Kudo."
"She would believe it. And people would listen to him, to her."
"If this train explodes,
me, the Ran, the other passengers, everyone..."
Ah... listen, Ran...
Come on, Conan, you won't convince me.
Don't be a pest and sit still in your seat.
Ran, listen to me.
Here we go again!
It's a very serious matter.
Ran, I'm sorry...
I told you a lie.
A lie?
Yes, listen Ran,
I'm not Conan Edogawa or a little kid.
In fact, I am...
(Genta) -We've already passed by the sea? (Ayumi) -While you were fooling around.
But the seats in this band overlook the mountain.
"Over the mountain?"
What a beautiful view!
There's a fantastic view of Fuji-San today, from here....
"I'm sure she was sitting in the sea corner."
"You can't see Fuji-San from there."
"Then where did you see it from, Fuji-San?"
"In the restaurant!"
"Those guys were sitting on the side of the mountain."
"You saw the scenery from there!"
I'm sorry, I went alone.
"And if it was a lie she made up
to disguise that you had been with those men?"
"The bomb is..."
"In that woman's purse!"
"Oysters! Only one minute to go!"
(Loudspeaker) "Notice to passengers."
"In consideration of the rest of the passengers,
we ask those who wish to use the cell phone,
please go to the platform to make calls."
"That's the way it is! A cell phone!"
Quiet... What is it now?
Guys, come here!
La Ran will bring us lunch right now!
-I'd like a steak!
-I want rice!
-I'd like a nice plate of lentils!
Hey, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!
(Thinking) "Computers and walkmans
you can't touch a specific key at ten past three!"
"But a telephone... if you tell someone to call..."
I'm late!
Hello, it's me...
After 10 seconds, there will be a loud explosion!
Aaaaaaaah!
What's going on?
Wh-who are you?
Conan Edogawa!
A detective!
What?
A detective?
Conan!
It can't be!

Have you been up to mischief again?
I'm just a kid!
Eh?
"Then the train stopped."
"Inspector Megure and his men went up to investigate."
"We were late for the wedding. It was a disaster..."
"But no one took it badly."
"In her confession,
the woman had paid 4 million to those two guys
so that they would pass her some information
and through that telephone she would receive the instructions
to open the suitcase containing the information."
"But those two guys didn't want to spare her life."
"And those two guys..."
"The police also stopped them at a roadblock."
"I jumped the gun
and mistook those bastards for the men in black."
"Who knows where they must be now?"
"I don't know, but I won't give up!"
"Sooner or later I'll track you down. Sure!"
("Step by step")

DETECTIVE CONAN
Listen Conan... what did you want to tell me a while ago?
I don't remember.
Don't pretend!
You had a very serious post!
Listen Ran, I'm neither Conan Edogawa nor a little boy.
My real identity is...!
Your identity is...?!
Well... Ah... the truth is... I'm... I'm...
-An imp! -An imp!
Hey, Ran, what are you doing?
I'm making chocolate.
Valentine's Day only happens once a year!
A date?
All right, see you later!
If you have to catch one, make it a good one.
This will be a no-brainer!
The killer...
...is you!
(Adult voice) The prime suspect is.....
