"An accusing red wine"
Good morning, Mr. Shiratori.
Welcome to my rest home.
I hope you enjoy the party we'll have tonight.
I'm sure I will.
Thank you for inviting me, I'm very grateful.
By the way, where is Mr. Mouri?
In Mouri is here, with a first-class wine!
Father, no! (He thinks) "But what is he doing?"
No!
You can not stir it, the wine, this way!
No?
Why?
Because the sediment mixes with the wine and takes a long time to settle.
The lees?
Yes, it is the solid substance that is deposited at the bottom of the bottle
and that mixed with the wine can change the taste.
Don't worry about it, it is not serious.
I'm glad you could come, it's an honor to have you here.
Mr. Hirose will be looking forward to seeing you.
Thank you, sir.
The honor is mine.
I thank you for inviting me
to Mr. Hirose's 70th birthday party,
the president of the National Wine Association.
I have been told that the French government awarded him a medal.
-Excuse me, could you come here for a moment? -Yes.
Please, I would like you to bring Mr. Mouri
up to date on the details of the party.
Mr. Mouri, we would be very grateful if during the party...
to participate in a sketch that we have prepared.
-What do you think? -Of course, with pleasure.
- (doorbell) -Oh, will you excuse me for a moment?
Here's the script to be learned.
Father, are you sure you can do it?
Yes, sure. (thinks) "Yeah, sure..."
"Now he's hidden in the trunk of the car. It's you, the murderer!"
It seems to me that you shouldn't say that.
Your paper is a sentence one line above.
Mm?
Ah, it can't be!
Alas, what have I done to deserve this?
Eh?
If you want, you can take the cable car up to the top of the mountain.
There's a great view from the top.
Yeah, good idea.
Shall we, Conan? Yes.
(Organizer, from afar) May I know why you came?
No one invited you, Akamaru.
What are you doing here?
Making trouble?
Don't act surprised.
I know you have a magnum of Petrus from 1959.
Yes, a wine you will surely never taste no matter how many years you live.
Oh, and you're sure you'll appreciate it?
Come on, if you're incapable of knowing the difference...
between two Châteauneuf-du-Pape.
Poor Mr. Hirose, what a birthday awaits him.
He will remember his 70th birthday party.
I should have been the one to organize the party.
Shut up at once!
Conan, you don't get mad.
D'acord.
Today everyone will know who the great Murozo Honjo really is.
Aw, run, go inside, so everyone can see what a good-for-nothing you are.
Conan, go!
Ah! Hey, what's wrong?
You haven't seen it?
No, I haven't seen anything.
Why didn't you?
"And as he didn't find any place to leave the corpse,
he decided to hide in the trunk of the car."
Uh... "But... his wife, who didn't know anything about anything,
"took the car and took him to... ".
"I ask you not to underestimate me, please."
"I am the famous detective Kogoro Mouri!"
Excuse me, do you mind going somewhere else?
Oh, excuse me.
Ah, you've been in a hurry.
We wanted to stay longer, but Conan didn't feel well.
He got a stomach ache and we had to go back early.
What are you doing here?

I'm looking for something I can't find.
I guess it must be inside the house.
-Where do you want me to put this? -You can leave it right here.
Excuse me, do you think that man might know where the one I can't find is?
Eh?
The man with the white hair and the brown jacket.
Yes, the man you were talking to before.
Oh, yes, he was.
We had some work things to sort out.
But he's not here anymore, he's gone.
Oh, how serious.
"Clearly I can't accuse him of having committed a murder
just by pure intuition..."
-Eh... eh... - "I need..."
Yes.
"I need proof."
Have you found it yet? Not yet.
One question: do you know what time people arrived?
Around four o'clock, I think.
What do you want? Nothing, I'm just looking for...
You again?
What is that thing you're looking for everywhere?
Something that moves, like a hamster?
Obviously it must be very hard to find.
No, it's a ball.
You!
It can't possibly be the ball here.
Only Mr. Honjo can enter, he has a fingerprint code.
If you say so...
Quiet, wait!
Mr. Koike, why doesn't this boy help look for the ball?
Let's see if they can find it together.
While Mr. Koike is looking for it,
you can go upstairs and watch TV for a while.
I'll do that.
Kamen... Yaiba!
Do you like Kamen Yaiba too?
My grandchildren like it very much too.
They will start school this year.
Yes, very...
It's impossible for me to learn it, all this.
The sentences are too long.
I've already asked you, I thought you couldn't do it.
I don't know, I could ask Mr. Honjo...
instead of doing this sketch just to make a short speech.
Yes, please.
Conan, wait! What's up?
How's your belly?
Does it hurt, though?
No, I'm better now.
It came again.
Conan, but...
Mr. Honjo, how about changing Mr. Mouri's sketch...
for a short speech?
It's just that it's very difficult for him to learn the role.
Of course, of course.
By the way, Mr. Mouri, could I speak to you for a moment?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
(Shinichi voice) How so?
Yes, of course, first you hid Mr. Akamaru's body here,
but as he was afraid that I would find it,
then he decided to move it to a safer place.
And the safest place in the house, for him, is the wine cellar.
(Man) Viva!
Bravo!
Thank you for coming here from so far away, Mr. Hirose.
It is an honor.
Thank you, Mr. Honjo, the pleasure is mine.
It is I who must be grateful to you all
for the party you have organized for me.
Thank you all very much from the bottom of my heart.
This is Mr. Hirose, the president of the National Wine Association.
He is 70 years old and the party is in his honor.
(Mouri) Ah!
The medal is the one awarded to him by the French government!
(Honjo) We toast the health of Mr. Hirose,
for the 70 years and may the successes continue to accompany him.
-(all) Cheers! - (all) Cheers!
How nice!
Mr. Mouri, remember that you have to make a speech.
Don't forget.
A moment of attention.
Now we will taste the wines I have chosen for tonight,
some top quality Bordeaux.
We will start with a wine from the 1985 vintage, a Château Haut-Brion.
-Is it a very expensive wine?
-Well, yes, my goodness, yes.
-It must cost about 100,000 iens. Ah!
I can't wait to try it!
But think that what makes a wine good is not the price.
Have.
Good aroma, and it has a very fine and elegant taste.
Very good!
Come on, Mr. Mouri,
you too find it has a good aroma and a very fine and elegant taste?
And now we will taste a Château Mouton Rothschild.
This one is from the 1982 vintage.
What a beautiful drawing!
Yes, they did it for the label.
By the label?
Yes.
It's a characteristic of Château Mouton.
Every year the house commissions some famous artist
a drawing to add to its label.
In 1970 they commissioned the Russian-born painter Marc Chagall.
Really?
Now we will taste a Château Le Pin 1992.
A 1986 Château Lafite Rothschild. An excellent wine.
And a Château Margaux 1990.

It's... it's very good.
I congratulate you, Mr. Hirose.
Tell me about the incident that took place in Shouhei Kusaka's warehouse.
What I can tell you is that without me the case would not have been solved, ha-ha-ha!
Mr. Hirose, would you excuse me for a moment?
-Hold on, Mr. Honjo.
-Yes, say.
I don't see Mr. Akamaru.
He hasn't come?
Who is the Akamaru?
In Goro Akamaru is a French translator
and a well-known wine critic as well.
(Conan voice) At three o'clock Mr. Akamaru was here.
And how do you know that?
Eh?
Because I've seen him outside.
Isn't it true? Ah, yes!
He was very sorry he couldn't stay for tonight's party.
He came expressly to apologize and apologize.
-Well, I'm very sorry. Yes.
And now, if you'll excuse me...
I just wanted to talk about that incident in the wine cellar.
Oh, yes, of course.
Hey, Conan! Where are you going?
I don't know, but he had a bellyache earlier.
I'm sure he must have drunk too much fruit juice.
Ah!
Father, did you hurt yourself?
I saved her by the skin of my teeth.
Relax, nothing happened.
Nothing at all.
Eh?
Conan!
Is this the ball you were looking for?
I found it in the parking lot.
Hidden in a corner.
Yes, it's the same one.
That's nice!
Thank you very much.
It's been more than half a century, now,
that this wine is waiting to find someone to taste it.
We can say that it is a jewel enclosed in a bottle.
It is a magnum of Château Petrus from 1959, one of the best vintages.
- (woman) Oh!
- (man) From 1959!
(Man) It was an extraordinary year!
And I have the honor to offer it to you, Mr. Hirose.
Thank you very much, Mr. Honjo.
It really makes me very happy.
The wines should be opened a few hours before and decanted,
but a wine like this one here does not lose its qualities,
even if one commits the sin
of drinking it-right after uncorking it.
Eh?
What is this?
But Father, you broke the decanter!
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to.
Anyway, it's all right.
After half a century,
I'm sure that if I pour the wine directly into the glasses,
we'll find it just as good and satisfying.
- (flow) Are you sure you can do this?
- (woman) I don't see it clearly.
The wine should be treated as if it were a woman.
For you, sir.
Mm?
-What's wrong, Mr. Hirose?
-The dregs have mixed with the wine.
-Eh?!
-My goodness...
-It has also lost its taste.
-It's impossible. -It's impossible.
-May I taste it, please? -Of course.
Thank you.
It's true.
-How can that be? -What did you do?
Stir the bottle?
Of course not!
I'm not a beginner!
It could be that the temperature has risen a little in the cellar.
That's impossible, the temperature in the cellar,
we have it completely controlled by a computer.
Wow, what a mystery...
(Thinking) "Of course, I get it."
"What has happened is this:
when Mr. Akamaru made fun of Mr. Honjo,
the latter, in a fit of rage, killed him...
and hid the corpse in the barrel, next to the tennis court,
but when he saw that I was looking around the house..,
he decided to move it to put it in a safer place,
and took it from the tennis court to the cellar."
"But Mr. Akamaru didn't die from the blow to the head, he's still alive."
"Then, when he saw the bottle of Château Petrus there,
an idea occurred to him."
A Château Petrus.
Cheers, Honjo...!
"As Mr. Akamaru is not known and has not appeared anywhere,
he's probably unconscious, or much worse."
"I should go into the cellar, but how can I do that?"
"Only Mr. Honjo can open it."
"I know!"
I don't understand what could have happened.
Ah!
It seems to me that the wine has gone to my head.....
Father, what have you got?
Oh, of course!
I can see why they call him Sleeping Kogoro.
Oh, what's the matter with him?
What's wrong with him?
(Kogoro voice) Mr. Honjo, I'm sorry to tell you that you've been set up.
-A trap? -Yes, of course.
Someone in this party who is envious of you
must have come here just to make a fool of you.
He snuck into the cellar,
took the bottle of Château Petrus you just poured and tampered with it.
Yes, by force!

It is the only explanation.
I want to know who did it!
Wait a minute, it can't be, that's impossible.
For someone to have been able to get into the cellar
must have used my fingerprints.
(Kogoro voice) It's most likely that whoever broke in,
is someone familiar with the security system,
and it's quite possible that person is still hiding in the cellar,
where all the wine is.
A person in the cellar?
This is horrible!
We must prevent this person from damaging any more bottles.
We must go down to the cellar immediately.
-Yes, all right.
I'll go down.
-It's dangerous.
He can't go down alone.
We don't know what whoever's inside is capable of.
He's right, and the more of us there are,
the less chance he'll have of damaging more bottles.
-But, we can't... -I'll go with you.
-And me too.
- (man) Yes, and me!
- (man) I'll accompany you too.
- (man) Let's go, let's go.
Mr. Akamaru!
Mr. Akamaru!
Sit me down?
Answer me!
Sir Akamaru!
-Hurry!
Call an ambulance! Yes!
What's the meaning of this, Mr. Honjo?
I... eh... I...
Mr. Honjo, I have to call the police.
He always laughed at me.
He used to say that I couldn't be a wine lover
because I had neither the class nor the education it took.
Mr. Honjo, I don't know, are you really a wine lover?
-Of course I am! -Allow me to question it.
The cellar is a sacred place
for anyone who appreciates wines
and using it to hide a crime is unforgivable.
(Conan voice) "Fortunately, Mr. Akamaru recovered,
and the case could be considered closed."
"Finally, the only victim of this case was the wine bottle,
"which was ruined
because of the unhealthy rivalry of two people."

What a smell!
What sweetness!
What a fabulous aroma!
How much was the bottle worth? 10,000 yen.
But, unbeknownst to me, I convinced the people at the store...
to exchange it for another bottle, a 1,000 yen bottle.
"Très bien!"
(He thinks) "Lucky he is not able to differentiate the taste of a good wine
from one that isn't."
(Thinks) "This thing that's happening to me could be..."
Exactly, it was the miraculous substance...
that could make the child's body that you have now
transform back into his teenage body.
Shinichi!
Shinichi!
Don't tell me you've...
(Conan voice) "Don't miss the next special episode!"
"Shinichi Kudo, the killer!"
