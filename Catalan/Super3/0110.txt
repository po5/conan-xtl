DETECTIVE CONAN
The Cooking Class Murder Case, Part One
Cooking class?
Yes.
The cook Michi Uemori teaches at her house.
Sounds familiar!
She's a French cooking teacher, right?
Yes!
Sonoko suggested we go there this Sunday.
Thank you for dinner.
I told her I wanted to learn French cooking
and she suggested we go together.
What time does it start?
It starts at 5:30 at 7:30 and ends at 5:30 at 10:00.
At 5:30 at 10?
No way!
It's too late!
But Haido is nearby and... However, you won't go.
Let's go!
We'll go with her!
Maybe they'll leave us free food French cuisine delicacies!
French cuisine delicacies?
At Sonoko she had an urgent order and couldn't come.
I didn't come because I wanted to try French cuisine,
but because I was worried about you.
Yes, yes!
I know that, father... Yes, I know... Do you really understand?
Father, it's here.
You're Ran Mouri, right?
Yes!
The teacher told me about you.
Come on in.
Thank you. Thank you.
Come in.
Ah, thank you very much.
I'm the teacher's assistant, my name is Yuko Komiyama.
Over there in the back is Mrs. Kazue Yashiro, one of her students.
She was a classmate of the teacher's and now runs a boutique.
Mucho gusto.
Molt de gusto, ma'am!
It's my father and this is Conan.
Wow!
This kitchen is to take off your hat.
This is the kitchen?
Wow, what a big oven!
The oven is a must, for French cooking.
That table over there is where you eat the dishes you've prepared, right?
You got it right.
In Nishitani.
Bon soir!
I'm here!
(Opens a door)
I slept wonderfully.
I'll introduce them to you.
This girl has come in place of the Sonoko, is the Ran Mouri.
Her father and Conan.
Molt gusto.
Likewise, girl...
Kaoru is the daughter-in-law of teacher Uemori.
My name is Nishitani, nice to meet you.
He's a French chef.
My goodness, Kaoru, why is that in your eye?
Ah... I just got an owl.
Where is she, Sonoko?
That she was sick?
No... It's just that she had to go on an urgent errand.
Maybe she didn't want to come to class.
The teacher always gets angry and scolds her.
Be prepared for the worst.
Mrs. Kazue, stop scaring her.
Don't worry, you won't be the only one who gets yelled at.
Ah... Yes.
(Thinking) Teacher Uemori is very strict.
(Thinking) "I understand...
Sonoko used the Ran to get out of the course."
Ah, Yuko, I'll help you.
By the way.
Could you tell us where she went, Ms. Uemori?
At the beauty salon.
Ah, the beauty salon.
Eh?
At the beauty salon?!
The French cookbook that the teacher wrote has become a best seller.
has become a best seller.
And tomorrow, to celebrate, there will be a big party.
Extraordinary.
She clothes the ideas to someone else and uses them to make gold.
One third of the recipes in the book are not hers.
They are Yuko's creation!
Don't go on, Mrs. Kazue.
Don't talk about it.
What's that?
Why is that?
She has taken the recipes you invented!
As much as you've been working for Michi for 5 years,
these recipes are the fruit of your efforts.
But the teacher has added some nuances...
Whether she added a little or a lot, the recipes are yours.
Stop denying it and do something about it.
Stop it, Mrs. Kazue!
This is a matter between the teacher and Yuko.
We can't talk about it.
Oh, right, like you receive financial support from Michi,
she understands that you can't criticize your teacher.
Y... they're two completely different things.
Wow.
You mean, so different?
Maybe you can explain it to us.
Well, look...!
(Thinking) Come on.

This atmosphere is becoming unbreathable.
(Opens a door)
The teacher is back.
Welcome back, teacher.
I'm home.
I'm late.
Ah, you must be Ran Mouri.
Yes!
Nice to meet you!
I'm Ran's father, at Ko...
My shoulders are all messed up.
Nishitani, come here, please.
Uh... this... My name is Kogoro Mou...
Here, the blouse you wanted, I've made it to your liking.
Leave it there.
-Kaoru, take my pols. -Yes.
Did you see what a woman, she doesn't even have a word of thanks!
Is the teacher suffering from some special condition?
She's a fat mass!
Whenever she goes out, she has her pulse taken.
The Kaoru was a nurse.
He's got a little speed, but don't worry.
Her son is an executive of a trading company.
He spoiled him too much as a child, now he has a terrible complex.
Michi mistreats her youngster a lot.
The teacher's husband died of an illness, is it true?
Yes.
He was a quiet man and a very good person.
-I've had enough.
I'm going to change him. -Yes.
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll get the aprons!
Just a moment!
You can't smoke in here!
Excuse me, if you want to smoke, please do it outside.
Ah, thank you.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Where are the toilets?
At the back on the right.
There's one for men and one for women.
I'll go there too.
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Yuko... I said all those things before, but I...
Ah, it's you, Ran.
Sorry, I mistook you for her.
Well then, let's get started.
This afternoon we'll prepare a mushroom pot,
duck with orange sauce and pears au gratin with wine.
(She thinks) "Come on, she'll cook with the ring on?
"As masterful as she is, this denotes an unprofessional attitude.
"At Nishitani, she wears one too!
Teacher and disciple must have been..."
That's great!
Will you duck?
For me... It's one of my favorite dishes!
Yuko!
Hey, yes!
I'll make it right away.
What?
Fences the door?
I'm sorry...
(Thinking) Big mouth.
You're a fool, father.
First we'll prepare the mushroom terrine.
I'll do the preparation of the dish up to half.
Watch how I do it and try to prepare its equal.
First we cut into slices 200 grams of mushrooms.
What are mushrooms? They are a kind of mushrooms.
We saut√© them in butter.
You will see that they release the water,
and you have to wait about 10 minutes until it has evaporated.
This starts to smell good.
But it's a long time before we eat.
Young lady, you have good hands, for cooking.
Thank you very much, madam.
Ah... You're so clumsy, Kazue.
You haven't changed a bit over the years.
My goodness... So you can't separate the yolk from the white.
-Only the white is used. I can only see with one eye and...
I don't want any excuses!
Listen Yuko, haven't you taken out the gruyere cheese yet?
Ah, excuse me.
I'll do it right away.
Really, all 3 of them are a real mess.
The teacher's got a bad temper....
(Thinking) "Now you can understand why Sonoko would want to run away....
As in Nishitani does well she doesn't say anything to her."
Aaah!
I can't take it anymore!
I'm going to smoke!
Wait.
To get out, I have to force my way through the kitchen, right?
At the back, where the toilets are, there's the back door.
What?
Caram.
It's open.
What a lazy family...
What happened?
A blackout?!
Who's there?!
Yuko, go to the meter room
and see if the power's gone out.
Didn't you hear a noise, like a glass door being opened?
A glass door?
(Yuko) Excuse me!
Excuse me, can you give me a light?
Y..yes!
That's strange.
How come, the switch...?
I've already turned it on.
Ah!
Oh!
Gel?
What's this doing here?
Huh? (Laughs)
It's very strange.
Someone has made a setup to cut the light!
What's that?
This weight must have been attached to a ring with this thread.
And then they've hung the ring on the switch.
That is, if the ice melts...
the ring pulls down and disconnects the switch.
But why did they make a setup like this?
Back to the classroom!
Something may have happened!
Father!
What happened?
The teacher's chest hurts and she's having trouble breathing!
Ran, who opened the glass door at the entrance?
Well, no one opened it.
No one?!

My back... My back hurts...
When we were in the dark I felt a stinging in my back...
It's hard to breathe.
Maybe it's a nervous condition.
(Thinking) It's hard to breathe?
It can't be!
Excuse me, madam!
Hey, what the hell are you doing? Co... Conan!
(Thinking) I thought so!
You've been stung by a bee, Kogoro!
A bee?!
Look!
Here is a red mark!
This spot corresponds to the back of the right lung!
The right lung.
Ah!
This is...!
Ran, call for an ambulance right away!
Call Inspector Megure!
Eh?!
Ah, yes!
(Thinking) "If she's not rushed to the hospital, she's in danger.
Who could have done it?"
Don't go a single step away from this classroom, please.
And don't touch the glass door at the entrance!
What right do you think you have to order us around?!
I'm sorry to show up so late,
but my name is Kogoro Mouri and I am a detective.
A... that famous...?
Detective Kogoro... Mouri?!
What the fuck is the meaning of this?
Do you want to tell me?
All indications are that Mrs. Michi Uemori
has been hit with something sharp in the back,
like an ice chopper or an ice pick.
-What did she say?
-An ice pick...
...stuck?!
Yes.
On the back of the lady, there was a red mark,
as if she had been bitten by an insect!
If she had been stuck with an ice-crusher or something like that,
she would have been left with this mark.
And when we talk about a puncture with an ice pick, it can reach the lungs or other parts of the body,
it can go all the way to the lungs or other internal organs.
So, the fact that he had trouble breathing was due to this?
It is possible that he has a punctured lung.
So, who is the aggressor?
Shortly after the power went out,
some people felt the glass door open,
so that someone from outside may have entered.
But we can't deny the possibility that the suspect is in here.
I understand...
Listen, don't leave this room.
First, we'll take fingerprints from the glass door.
Who was it, the last person to touch the handle?
Mr. Nishitani!
Of all of us, he was the last one to enter.
After him, when teacher Uemori came back,
Mr. Nishitani opened the door for him.
We will take his fingerprints
so that we can differentiate from the assailant's fingerprints.
In the meantime, tell me the facts in detail.
Yes, Inspector.
So, this back door was open.
Yes, Inspector Megure.
According to my deductions, after the beginning of the class,
the assailant entered from behind,
sneaked into the room of the counters
and prepared the set-up with the ice.
Then, he left through the back door,
hid in the garden and waited for the lights to go out.
When the power went out, he opened the glass door,
entered, committed the murder and fled.
But the classroom was completely dark.
How did the assailant manage to find the teacher?
She may have been wearing something shiny
that the assailant could have used as a reference.
No!
The teacher wasn't wearing anything like that!
I think so too.
The assailant must have been wearing an infrared visor.
With it you could see in the dark.
(Thinking) "You mean?
"An infrared visor is not as easy to obtain as you think.
"In Kogoro it says that the assailant must have come from outside.
"But the fact that there are no traces of the assailant throws me off.
"Maybe before opening the door he bothered to take off his shoes?
It's absurd!"
What do we have?
Both the handle inside and outside the glass door,
we've only found Mr. Nishitani's fingerprints.
One possibility is that the assailant put on gloves.
Since the last one to touch the handle has been on Nishitani,
it would make the most sense.
There is only one strange thing,
the prints on the outside handle are intact,
but those on the inside are partially erased.
This is not normal at all!
If the assailant was wearing gloves and had opened the door from the outside,
it would be Mr. Nishitani's prints on the outside that are smudged.
Therefore, if they are the ones on the inside handle, it means....
(Thinking) The offender opened the door from the inside!
What do you mean, from the inside?

That the aggressor did not come from outside!
This leads us to believe
that someone of this kind has opened the glass door from the inside.
Probably with a handkerchief or something else.
In other words, this means that the aggressor is one of you!
It can't be!
(Cell phone rings)
Megure.
What?!
Yes, yes, understood!
Mrs. Uemori has died of respiratory failure caused by a hemorrhage in the lung!
caused by a hemorrhage in the lung!
Gentlemen, this case has become a murder case.

DETECTIVE CONAN
The murderer is you, Mrs. Kazue!
Nishitani, there's something,
the mother didn't want to continue helping financially.
Yuko, you must have resented the prescriptions she took from you.
Now I know!
The murderer is you, Mrs. Kaoru!
