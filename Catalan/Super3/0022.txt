DETECTIVE CONAN
The serial murders on the luxury cruise ship
Oh, what a beautiful view!
I was worried at first, but we've been very lucky.
Hmm.
Your father got the time wrong,
but thanks to him, we're going with this huge ship.
Lucky this ship stopped at that island.
Otherwise, we would have had to stay 3 more days on that island.
Wow, they must be very rich, the ones who rented this boat.
Hey, is something wrong?
No, it's nothing.
I was thinking about my parents, who died in an accident.
I wish they were here on a day like today.
On a day like today?
Is something wrong, Natsue?
Ah, Takeshi!
Today's a very special day because we got married.
You got married today?
Of course we did!
On Hatamoto Island.
Where you were.
We were very excited.
Ah, congratulations to both of you!
Why did you choose this place?
Most of the island is owned by the family, the hatamoto clan.
Our ancestors are buried there.
It is a centuries-old tradition of our clan to get married on the island.
Gee... (man) (man) Idiot!
This boat was reserved exclusively for our family.
What are they doing, strangers on board?
Father, I'm sorry, but they had a problem and I wanted to help them.
And may I know with what permission?
You have not even consulted me!
Who do you think you are?!
Eh?
I'm very sorry, Father.
Don't worry.
Grandfather was in a bad mood after the ceremony.
When he tasted my cooking.
Uncle Jyoji...
I knew father hated European food..,
but I didn't imagine he'd get so angry.
You mean food?!
Maybe I'm just not a very good cook yet.
That's not true!
It was delicious!
Hey, what a flower you're wearing.
Where did you get it?
When we were leaving the ceremony, Natsue put it on me.
It was a dream I had since I was little.
I dreamed that I would give it to the person I loved.
It only grows on the island.
What a pair of chicks.
Such a father, such a son!
You see, what a remedy!
I wish you wouldn't go through life as an artist!
Kitaro, you who are his father... you should take away his worries!
-Yes, stop. Are you here, Takeshi?
Aaa... yes.
I want to talk to you.
Come to my room.
Yes, OK.
Take it easy, be patient, kid.
He's got a bad temper, but he's old... he's got a short time left to live.
And now that my older brother is dead,
most of the family fortune will be yours.
Tieta Mariko, I don't think it's that simple.
What do you mean by that?
Akie, you know something, don't you?
Mmm... don't be scared if I tell you...
But, but this is absurd, it's impossible!
Yes, it is possible.
Grandpa wants to make it public in Tokyo.
What a face he has, this man!
And here we are, drowned by debts!
We still have 24 hours until we dock in Tokyo, Aunt.
We must do something.
This is Takeshi.
Come in, come in.
Excuse me.
I'll be honest, kid, you made a great speech.
I understand why the Natsue chose you.
Thank you very much, sir.
This scratching your cheek when you're embarrassed... you're identical.
Yes, you are identical to Isao Zaiko, your father!
You may be able to hide your family background,
but you won't fool me!
You wanted to avenge your father,
that's why you came to work in our company
and you're going to conquer the Natsue.
And I wonder what you want now.
Do you want money?
Or maybe you want my life?
What, what's wrong with you?
Why don't you say something?
Answer me!
This is the patriarch of the Hatamoto clan.
Wow.
They all came to your wedding?
Yes... 9 in all,
minus deceased relatives and relatives who live far away.

Yes it takes, in Takeshi, you do not find, Natsue?
Yes.
He's gone to Grandfather's cabin to talk to him.
They must be planning some sinister plot.
What a pair!
What do you say, Akie?
-It's about time.
You're late. Sorry.
Mmm?
Hasn't the father come yet?
No, but I don't think he'll be late.
He should be here any minute.
You're late.
Have you washed your hands, son?
Yes.
And you, Ran, what about you?
Do you have a boyfriend?
No, and now, she's still a child, Ran.
That's what you think.
Yes, I have a boyfriend.
Oi, Conan?
Aaa... eh... yes.
That's nice!
And how is he, this boy?
Well, he's smart and he's a great soccer player,
you can always count on him and he is very handsome!
Why are you turning red, you?
He's a great detective, just like my father!
What are you saying?!
Your father is...
Didn't I tell you?
Yes, my father is a detective.
What... what's wrong?
Above all, don't explain it to Grandpa!
He can't see the detectives.
He says that those who meddle in the miseries are useless.
(thinks) "That's the perfect description of Kogoro."
Sir, it's almost time for dinner.
He's waiting, sir.
(Thinking) Eh?
A flower?
Takeshi!
At last.
You're very late.
Sorry... I've been meditating for a while in my cabin.
Are you OK, Takeshi?
You don't look so good.
Oh!
Where's the flower?
Eh?!
Gee, that's strange.
Where did I lose it?
Excuse me for coming in and interrupting you, sir, but you are expected to...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
-Who called?! - The butler!
In the father's cabin!
Mr. Suzuki, what happened?
It's useless, he's dead.
It's... it's impossible.
Avi!
No!
Don't let him come in here!
No one can come in here until I say so!
I'd say Mr. Hatamoto has been dead for about 40 to 50 minutes.
Mr. Suzuki, you came to look for him and found the body, right?
Yes.
Where was he, 40 or 50 minutes ago?
Shortly before or shortly after 8 o'clock.
Mr. Detective, around 8:00, I was preparing dinner,
I was in the dining room.
That's right, father,
he was stopping the tables, when we were in the dining room.
Mr. Suzuki, are you sure the door to this cabin was locked?
Yes.
How do you close this door?
It locks from the inside,
to close it from the outside you need the key.
Considering that the windows do not open,
no one could have entered from the outside.
Gentlemen, the room was locked!
A locked room?!
But then, the grandfather...
...committed suicide!
But that's strange.
If it was a suicide, there would be something near the corpse.
(All) What?
We're missing the weapon.
He died from a stab wound to the abdomen.
But there's no trace of the dagger.
Maybe he did it with sharp ice.
It happens to them, to the mysterious murders.
He leaves no trace.
Why should he kill himself like that, Mr. Hatamoto?
Don't think about it.
It's obvious that Grandpa did it to hurt us.
He wants us to be suspicious and violent.
Because he hated us all.
Everyone except Natsue, obviously.
But what are you saying, Akie?
He's capable of doing something like that.
It's suicide!
It's so obvious!
It's murder!
What?!
It is very simple to state.
You again, boy?!
Come here and look at the door step.
There's blood, isn't there?
If he had killed himself, he would have had the door closed,
and there would be no blood near the door.
So, the door was open when she was stabbed.
Of course it was!
He was probably stabbed when he wanted to get out of the cabin!
Well, who closed the door?
Yes, who could it have been?
You mean he's holding on, your theory?
What?
What?
What?
Ah, I get it!
Of course you do!
He has closed in Kozo, the door!
(All) Impossible!
He has stabbed her outside the cabin.
He has entered and has closed the door to flee from the murderer.
He has fainted and died!
Right, yeah... that makes a lot more sense.
Gee, Mr. Kogoro, what a brilliant deduction!
Yes!
Just a moment.
This means that everyone had a chance to commit the crime.

La Ran, Conan, Natsue and I were sitting at our table,
so we were ruled out.
And that's also because of Mr. Suzuki.
The murderer is someone who was not in the dining room.
And so I can say that it is one of the 7 of you!
Sir, did anything strike you when you came in?
No, nothing special, sir.
Ah, but there was this flower in front of the door.
-A flower? -What?
This flower...
-It's the one I put on Takeshi! -What?
Come to think of it,
you're really late to the dining room, aren't you?
Eh?
Yes, you're right... I've been in my room...
Takeshi, don't strain yourself, you don't need to lie!
I was in the hallway, and I felt what was going on in there!
You and the father were arguing violently!
I was on the verge of fainting, Takeshi...
when I felt that you are,
when I knew you were the son of the Isao Zaiko!
Excuse me, but who is he, this Isao Zaiko?
Uh, well... aaah...
he was the president of Zaiko Industries.
He committed suicide when his father took over his company.
And after a year, his wife died of an illness,
as if she died of grief.
Someone adopted his only son.
I didn't think about it, let it be Takeshi.
Takeshi, is this true?
Takeshi!
It's true... I'm the son of Isao Zaiko.
My name is Takehiko Zaiko!
But, but I haven't... I haven't...
His plan was to befriend the Natsue to avenge his father!
So he was introduced to the Hatamoto family,
and was waiting for the chance to kill at Kozo.
So, tonight... he has committed the crime!
You're wrong!
I didn't kill him!
Natsue!
Wait!
I thought you were honest and brave, but I was very wrong.
Jyoji, don't...
You messed up, dropping the flower at the scene of the crime!
But what do you say?
(Think) "They wiped the blood off the ground in front of the cabin."
It was here, the flower, sir? And so much, I'm absolutely sure.
(Think) "What is this?"
"Eh? A crumb of bread!"
"A crumb of bread in the victim's blood....
what can it mean?"
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Suzuki.
They served bread, the food they made to celebrate the wedding?
Yes, of course, it's natural, it was a French cuisine meal.
The chef was Mr. Jyoji,
owner of a very prestigious French restaurant.
And everyone ate?
Yes, everyone, except Mr. Hatamoto,
who hated European cuisine, and especially bread.
He said he got sick just looking at it.
Being a chef, he must have his knives here, right?
Sure, he always takes his favorite knives with him.
Hey, little boy, children shouldn't ask indiscreet questions.
Come on in!
Stay here for a while and calm down!
Let me out!
It wasn't me!
I didn't murder him!
You're crazy, Takeshi!
Tomorrow we'll turn you over to the Tokyo police!
Get ready!
We already have a motive and sufficient evidence, don't we, Mr. Detective?
The motive is credible.
All we need to do is find his fingerprints on the gun.
Here, have some juice.
Thanks for that.
And for you, too, little man.
Thank you very much.
You were lucky, Aunt Mariko.
Thank Takeshi for murdering grandfather.
He won't make that ridiculous announcement about his will.
You're right.
Now, the Hatamoto estate is yours.
Since you're my husband and I'm the eldest daughter...
And Ichiro will be able to spend as much as he wants.
And later, the whole company will be yours.
I don't want it, the company, mother.
You don't think of keeping the old man's estate for yourselves, do you?
Ah, don't suffer, all the grandchildren will do well.
Stop it.
Shut up.
Today the father died.
Now don't try to act like a good person!
You abandoned the family to become a chef!
I know the whole truth, Jyoji.
You asked father for money for your restaurant,
but he put you out for a walk.
Didn't he?
You wanted money, too.
You should be happy.
I'm sorry to inform you that Mr. Hatamoto,
before his unfortunate death,
had drawn up a will explaining what was to be done.
But what did he say?
The will will will soon be made public through the company.
-He is able to have left...-...his entire estate....
(All) In the Natsue?!

Yes.
And according to her last will,
the company will be transferred to whomever she decides.
And now!
This is absurd!
What a mess!
I don't know why I wasted my time marrying Akie!
Did you marry me for the money that grandfather could leave me?
Of course I did!
Do you think I would have married a spendthrift like you?!
How dare you?!
You think you're a musician but you have no talent!
Natsue, what's wrong with you?
What are you doing here alone?
Nothing... don't worry, I was just thinking.
You were thinking about Takeshi?
I trusted him...
I trusted him a lot, Takeshi.
I can't believe it, that he married me to kill grandfather.
I'll never trust anyone ever again in my life!
I believe him, Natsue.
What do you mean?
I can't tell you why...
but he doesn't seem like a bad person in Takeshi.
He's the man you wanted for a husband.
He can't be a bad person!
But Ran...
Didn't you hear a strange noise down there?
Did you?
Natsue, did you hear anything?
No, I didn't.
Nothing at all.
(Thinking) "Well, I heard something!"
"I heard something falling into the sea and another strange noise."
Where are you going, Conan!
Conan, wait!
What's the matter?
But what's wrong with you?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
He probably died of a concussion caused by a blow.
The murder weapon must have been a steel pipe.
Who could have done such a thing?
What if she had died in Takeshi?
No.
It's locked back here!
Hey... Conan!
It's not locked!
Get out of the way!
It's not!

DETECTIVE CONAN
-What?! - What?!
Wasn't it the warehouse?
It was, when I have closed the door, but not now.
It was him.
He has killed the father and Tatsuo.
By force!
The noise that Conan says he felt,
it must have been the murderer hitting Tatsuo on the head.
And the noise of something falling into the sea could have been the weapon
or maybe the murderer has thrown himself overboard,
because here it couldn't be hidden.
Takeshi...
It is likely that the killer is still on board hiding!
I want everyone to go take shelter in the mess hall right now.
Takeshi has no reason to kill me.
He doesn't remember?
He wants to avenge the death of his father,
who committed suicide when his company was taken over.
But also...
he could be... he wants to execute the entire Hatamoto family here!
Yes, because I know you are unfaithful to your husband, Akie!
It's you, the one who wanted his money!
Ichiro also detested grandfather
because he had destroyed his prize-winning drawing.
Ichiro!
Ah... the leg!
It's mine, this knife.
(He thinks) "All the ends of this mystery have been tying together!"
In the next episode...
The luxury cruise ship serial murders, part two.
