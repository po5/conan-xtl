DETECTIVE CONAN
Muggers in the hospital
(Snoring)
I'm home.
Eh ?!
Weren't you going to Yoko Okino's concert?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Socks!
Socks!
Tie! You're a case, father.
Jacket! Drive with caution!
Tickets! Count...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
with the stairs...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aiaiaiaiai!
For the love of God, bring me Yoko Okino's concert!
Today is the last concert of the tour!
She broke her leg and she's in an ambulance.
This is no cab, man!
(Kogoro) Yoko!
It makes me maaaaaal!
(Genta) -It's a huge hospital!
(Mitsuhiko) -So much.
Which room has she been admitted to?
I don't know.
I'll ask the reception.
It's room 503. Let's go, let's go, then!
(Genta) What a fool,
look who fell down the stairs and broke his leg...
And for dessert, when he was going to Yoko's concert.
Nobody asked you to come because you were passing by.
Is it so obvious?
In Conan he was going to teach us how to play soccer.
Guillem here.
Au, it doesn't matter, let them come to see him because he was passing by.
The first days he was in the hospital he had a lot of people coming,
but lately nobody comes...
He should be grateful for the fact that they come.
Oi, neighbor?
What a mean guy.
He was taken to this hospital a week ago.
He had a very serious car accident.
Oh!
Yoshio!
It's strange, you coming.
How are you feeling, father?
How's your waist?
Much better.
It seems unbelievable that I have to be here because of lumbago.
Are you taking your medicine?
Yes.
Although I haven't taken today's.
You're a diabetic and you should take better care of yourself.
By the way, and Yumi?
Didn't you come together?
Ah, yes.
You mean Yumiko...
She stayed at a park that has a skating rink.
Wow, I was really looking forward to seeing my granddaughter.
What's up with that.
Yumiko is very playful.
You know that.
-What the hell do you want! -Ah, nothing...
Don't stare at me like an asshole!
Ah, they've already caught them, those criminals?
What's that?
The robbers of the bank where you work, when you were there.
No, they ran away.
No one knows.
In this case, why don't you ask Mr. Kogoro Mouri for advice?
I'd be happy to.
Mo... Mouri, you say?
That famous detective?
Ahem... Yes.
Ah, all I did was stand trembling under the table.
(Father) Shame on you.
Are they the ones who stole 100 million and still haven't been arrested?
That's right.
They stole 100 million without anyone noticing anything.
(Father) "Before they had cut the security systems."
"It was a brilliant plan."
"They say they must have belonged to a criminal organization."
How cool!
100 million!
I could buy anything I wanted!
-Stolen money doesn't make a profit! -You're right.
How many robbers were there?
I don't know...
I stood under the table shaking.
But at first his head must have said "hands up" or something.
If you don't want to die, I want to see face down and hold still!
Well... maybe...
Ah, father, I have to go, ha.
Com?
So early, you're leaving?
I'll come back another day.
Son, see if you'll bring me a little something.
Yes.
(Man) Excuse me.
(man) Excuse me!
I'm a policeman.
You are Mr. Yoshio Sekiguchi?
Ah, yes, I am.
You wanted anything?
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Along with your father,
there's a man who was admitted for an accident.
Has anyone visited her?
No... I don't know.
It's the first day I've seen him.
Well, I have things to do.
I know what happened.
The robbers have boarded a boat and fled.
Or they're hiding in some mountain.
And now!
They've gone shopping with the stolen money!

(Thinking) "The logical thing would be for them to wait
before circulating that money."
Although there is a possibility that they are very close.
"Ginko" is "Bank" and "Kinko", "which are the surroundings".
What a good joke!
-Let's make him sleep forever!
Mr. Sekiguchi, what did you think?
But he was in high spirits just now.
You must be tired.
Today we'll end the game of deductions.
What about me?
Conan, at 3 o'clock I want to see the program where Yoko will be on.
Ask for a wheelchair.
It's funny from time to time, living in a hospital.
It's totally impossible!
I am incapable of this barbarity.
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Do not do whining because I tell you to do a dirty job.
Do you know?
In that room there is Kogoro Mouri!
Besides, the cops don't stop hanging around!
Don't worry about the torca, their hands are tied.
Don't even think about that detective.
Before the key hour, 2/4 of 4, he will disappear from the room.
"He wants to watch a program in the lobby."
"Those little kids have gone to ask for a wheelchair."
B-but I dare not do it, in front of my father!
You've given him the sleeping pill!
Well, don't be so delicate, now!
And my daughter?
Is she all right?
What a heavy guy.
(Phone)
Yes, say?
Ah, say.
What's the matter with you?
Your daughter?
She's playing with a smile.
Who also wants to talk?
Listen to her.
-Dad?
-Yu... Yumiko!
I'm a very nice girl, that's very funny!
When you've talked to the doctor, will you come?
Yumiko!
Yumiko...
It has, the little something your father wanted.
Do you understand?
You have until half past five on the 4th,
when the doctors start going through the rooms.
Check in when they relax their surveillance.
I can't do that.
I'm no killer.
I have never fired nor touched any gun!
Don't you see that if you raise your voice, they will suspect us?
Press the gun hard against that guy's body
and make the trigger go without releasing it!
Shoot him with all the bullets and it's all over.
But I...
Wash your face and do it when you've regained your nerve.
Think you're doing it for your daughter.
-You took too long, Conan.
-What the hell were you doing?
I just suddenly had a stomachache.
Did you wash your hands well?
(Think) "Look who's talking..."
So, we weren't wrong at all?
No.
The ruts of the car used for the robbery
and those of the vehicle in which the Akabane was riding match.
The robbers made the mistake of leaving him for dead because of the accident
and abandoned him.
Coincidentally, the Akabane is in Detective Mouri's room.
I was told that he had broken his leg, but...
Yes.
His right leg.
Again?
He broke it not long ago.
He's not what you call a lucky man.
I'm heading back to the station.
When you can question him, let me know immediately.
At your service, Inspector.
Ins... Inspector ?!
(Thinking) "This is my chance!"
"Now that individual can't do anything to me."
"I can explain everything to this inspector and maybe he..."
For... excuse me!
What did you want to tell us?
Ah, yes.
There's something that...
-Don't make fools of us. -Don't make fools of us.
-Eh?
My partner told you very clearly.
When we loosen our vigilance, you play the game.
If you play us for suckers again, you'll have a bad piece on the loom.
What does he want?
He feels sick and asks us if we can bring him some medicine.
Ask the doctors, they understand.
You can say it.
You had to ask for a chair!
How long were you going to make me wait?!
It is that Conan has suddenly disappeared.
Marrec of the devil!
I'll leave him full of dents!
(Kogoro) Conan, get ready!
Push, push, push, push, push, push, push!
That's bad!
What are you doing?!
Yoko's program will begin in a moment!
-That's what you get for leaving! -Conan, you push, too! -You push, too!
Yes, right now.
If Yoko's finished, you'll get all the blame!
It hasn't started yet.
You see? We're on time!
Listen, I want to ask you a favor.
I'll do it.
Trust us.
-Praying them though, will that be enough? -Yeah. -Let's go.

Hey, kids!
Didn't we look at it together?
(Think) "I'm lost. I'm at a dead end."
"I can't trust anyone."
"Twenty-four minutes past three. The cutoff time is five thirty four."
"If I don't kill him, the Yumiko..."
"Throw the Yumiko off that rooftop!"
"Exactly, I have to do it. I have to do it because they make me."
"I've been told that they've arranged it all
because I eliminated her so that they wouldn't be discovered."
"It looks like he's one of the partners they committed the heist with."
"Killing him... Nobody..."
(Adult voice) Leave it.
You've been asked to kill the Akabane, haven't you?
And inside this box of doughnuts is the weapon.
How did you... How did you know?
Don't look at me;
if you don't, they'll find out.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Go on.
He goes with this box of doughnuts
and his father is forbidden to take sweets because he's diabetic.
He said he was leaving and he's still here.
Anyone would think he's wearing one on his head.
Also, inside the hospital it is forbidden to use cell phones.
But, even though I've seen her calling him,
I can't tell how many men are around to keep an eye on him.
They are holding your daughter hostage on the roof of that warehouse, aren't they?
While you were looking out the window out of the corner of your eye,
you whispered your daughter's name.
And I saw someone spying on her.
I was set up.
Taking advantage of my father's state of health,
they made us come to the hospital.
If you value your daughter's life, kill the Akabane!
It's his fault that he went to your father's room by chance!
Those uncles also want to kill you.
They want to do it after you kill the Akabane.
I'm sure they are the same ones who robbed the bank.
They want to shut the mouth of what was left in the car.
Being an employee of that bank, they'll make it look like you planned it.
No...
If we relate these deductions to the report we heard earlier,
we arrive at this conclusion.
(Megaphone) In a few minutes the doctors will go through the rooms.
I only have 3 minutes.
There I have to go.
(Think) "In Genta and company are not on time."
"And I don't know how many guys are watching him."
Oh!
Cream puffs!
You'll give me one, won't you?
No, wait!
Oysters!
There's a gun!
What a cane!
Watch out!
They're in cahoots with the cop!
Hey, kid!
What the hell do you want to do?!
Let me go!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
-What's the matter? -Yoko! -Yoko!
Yoko!
Yoko!
She fainted when she took over the ball.
(Thinks) "Another one!"
(Mobile)
Di?
Was it a success?
No, a failure!
Take the girl and get out!
Oh!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Can you feel me?
(man's voice) You don't see me?
Look at the front door, chard!
Are you all right?
-Yumiko! -Is there Yumiko over here?
My name is Yumiko.
This is the woman who was with you?
Conan asked us to tell you:
"The plan has failed,
then we will contact you, leave the girl".
What does she mean?
This man too?
Papa!
Papa!
Papa!
Yumiko!
Yumiko!
Yumiko!
Yumiko!
You're hurting me, Dad.
I'm happy for you.
I've asked Inspector Megure to come.
If you tell him, everything will be all right.
(Come on, Conan, let's go.
You had to teach us how to play soccer.
(Genta) Of course!
(Genta) Wait a minute!
Who are you, boy?
Conan Edogawa, a detective!
-Come on!
-Yes!
Conan, and the ball? Wow!

Kogoro Mouri's room?
He was admitted for a fracture.
(Kogoro) Let 's go!
Let's go!
Yoko!
Yoko!
Pretty!
(Kogoro) All right!
Way to go!
Mr. Mouri's room is... It's no longer necessary.
Yoko!
Yoko!

Oh, Mother!
I've sprained my ankle!
Ran, send for a doctor!
You'll get it done!

(At the same time) Fox wants to take your life?
Watch out!
It's a rifle!
On the ground!
I, the famous Kogoro Mouri will corner this assassin named Fox,
the guy who hasn't been caught.
This guy gives me a bad feeling.
A terrifying journey, part one
