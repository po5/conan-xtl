"My name is Shinichi Kudo and I am a young detective."
"One day I went to an amusement park with the Ran,
and there I saw a suspicious exchange between some men in black."
"I was so engrossed in watching them that I didn't see a third man."
"He gave me a blow and made me drink a potion,
and my body shrank."
"If they found out I was alive,
the people around me would be in danger."
"When the Ran asked me for my name, I said....
Conan Edogawa!
"And to get information from those men,
I went to live at Ran's house, since his father is a detective."
The blackmail case of those killed in the stadium, part one.
The Lion dance beast looks like Inspector Megure.
What are you doing, Takagi?
It's true, he looks just like him!
Isn't it?
-It also looks like Genta. What do you mean?!
-Look, it's identical!
-What?!
Now you'll see!
-Wait! -Aaaaaaaaah!
Come on, guys!
If we don't pass, the game will start.
Yes!
I know!
I know!
What, come on, Mitsuhiko!
Y... yes.
Ran, daughter, bring me more!
What's another one?
That was the sixth one!
Today is New Year's Eve, let me drink as much as I want.
If you always drink as much as flights and more...
By the way, where did he go, that stopper?
To watch soccer, the final of the Emperor's Cup.
What nonsense, going to watch soccer on the first day of the year.
There's nothing better than drinking sake while watching Yoko on TV.
-Convida'm! -Convida'm!
Rock Paper Scissors!
What is it, this damn show? It's a New Year's special.
In the afternoon they're doing a TV series with Yoko in it.
What are you saying?
It doesn't come on until the afternoon?!
What a bore!
I'll take a nap.
When the series starts, please wake me up.
Ah, just a moment, father!
This way you'll get a good night's sleep!
Oysters.
(Shouts of enthusiasm)
Hey, who has marked it?
Who has marked it?
He scored it on Hideo, the Spirits!
He received it from Naoki and finished it off.
Hideo is a crack!
He played with the risk of injury to get into the National Team.
It's a pity that they missed the World Cup.
It's shameful that they didn't win any games!
But how come everyone was so excited?
For my father, it was a dream to see Japan in the World Cup!
It's a super important competition.
Donkeys.
The World Cup is the most important sporting event.
It is logical that the whole of Japan was so excited.
It's a pity that Japan didn't win a single match.
There is nothing important that is easy.
You talk as if it's not about you.
After watching the games, you were the one who was the angriest!
Me? It's true!
You kicked yourself against the table!
To see Japan in the World Cup was my dream since I was a kid.
What do you say, Conan?
Since you were a kid?
But you're still a kid...
How many years have you been watching soccer, you?
No, it just so happens that...
What's so funny, Haibara?
What's so funny, Haibara?
When he gets tangled up with soccer,
the famous detective turns into a madman.
Leave me alone.
Why don't you watch the game?
I came to join you.
Those people know the face I made when I was a plug.
If a television camera would focus on me and broadcast,
they would find me immediately.
If that happened, you would be in danger too, wouldn't you?

That's why I didn't like coming here.
Hey, what are you doing?
So nothing will happen even if you focus, you see?
Come on.
Now forget about those and be in the game!
Soccer matches are better to watch live!
(Think) "Kudo, you couldn't imagine even dreaming."
"You, very soon,
you'll be going all the way
in the secret project that the Organization has been handling for years."
(Male) Carve and pass from camera two on camera 3.
Do not lose sight of the play of the goal!
-Daix√≤, Mr. Kaneko... -What's up?
I'm busy.
I should take this call.
A call for me?
They've been calling for a while.
They say if you don't get on, we'll regret it.
What are you...
Yes, this is Kaneko the filmmaker.
Hey, who are you?
(Man) I'll say it once, hold your ears.
Middle tier, the spectators on the right side.
Look at the children in the front row leaning on the railing.
Camera 13 was free, right?
Have him focus on the spectators on the right side.
Hey, yeah.
Hey, camera 13!
Ni t'immutes.
Eh?
When you watch such a funny game, you react like this.
-Come on!
Hide!
-Force!
Now, now!
Dribble!
Do you know what emotions are?
Like your heart pounding?
Who knows.
If I were looking for one, maybe I'd find it.
When you came to school you were also unflappable.
Mixing with kids is humiliating, but you won't be disturbed.
You wouldn't be surprised.
After all, you were.
I was able to take it easy so that you were there.
Because you had gone through the same thing as me, and you were there.
(Kaneko) I see them, there are 5 children.
The boy on the left wearing the blue cap?
What's wrong with him, this kid?
Aaaa... excuse me, can I ask you something?
Say.
How old are you, really? 84.
I was joking.
Actually... Oh!
-What's wrong? -What's wrong?
-What was that?
The ball suddenly bounced...
Conan!
Hey, freeze!
(thinks) "A hole in the ball..."
"Two! It can't be."
You can't go down to the pitch!
Excuse me, but we dropped the cap.
The cap?
(He thinks) "It must be over there, somewhere in the corner of the sideline."
"That's it!"
Ah, you mean this one, kiddo?
Is that the one you dropped?
Eh ?!
Quiet, kid!
What the fuck are you doing?!
Stop it!
What do you think you're doing, kid?!
(thinks) "It's a 26 millimeter bullet."
"And with a one-piece steel sheath!"
(Kaneko) It's a gun!
Someone has fired it in the stadium, Mr. Inspector!
Where is it, the victim who has been shot?
(Kaneko) There isn't one.
They have shot at the ball.
At the ball?
As demanded by the man on the call,
we looked through the monitor at the ball
that had rolled under the boy with the blue cap.
Suddenly, the ball jumped up and deflated.
He was shot!
But they might as well have done it with an air pistol.
It was probably a Tokaref.
Co... Conan!
(At the same time) The Junior Detective League is here!
You guys are here too?
Is that her, the one with the blue cap that he had seen on the monitor?
Uh, yes.
That's right.
The ball suddenly deflated.
I went down to the pitch and found it.
This bullet was embedded in the sideline.
It looks like a Russian-made bullet.
Look!
What do you mean?!
A 26-millimeter bullet... Russian-made.
Of Russian pistols using this ammunition, there's the Tokaref.
Many are smuggled through China.
It is an extremely deadly and high-powered pistol.
Since we didn't hear any shots, there must have been a silencer on the barrel.
Hey, kid, how do you know all this stuff?
Ah!
Well, in fact, he explained it all to me at Kogoro.
(Thinking) Wow.
What a mess of a man, what a thing to explain to a child.
Let him be suspended!
Put an end to this match and evacuate the spectators!
(All) Yes, sir! Don't do it!
He's... the man on the call has warned me:

if the game stops, or if he sees that we are doing strange things,
he will shoot indiscriminately.
He will shoot everyone!
As he says ?!
(Shouts of enthusiasm)
Let's see, what does he demand, the blackmailer?
We have until the end of the first part
to prepare him 50 million yen and leave him in a bag.
He will call to tell us where to leave it.
Did he tell you?
Yes, on Nichiuri Television.
The blackmailer could be someone with a grudge against this TV station.
Or it could be a terrorist.
Do you remember ever hearing the voice of the man on the phone?
I don't.
It was a heavy voice, it was hard to understand.
Maybe he'd put a cloth over the earpiece
or maybe he was wearing a mask.
Have you prepared them, the 50 million?
Yes.
Now they were going to take them.
The plainclothes policemen mobilize him,
disperse in the stands of the spectators!
When the blackmailer calls back it will be time to try to catch him.
You must stop all the people talking on cell phones!
(All) Yes, sir!
Here mail danger.
You torneu's-in torneu's at home!
Y... yes...
The nano in the cap was a girl?
How rude, is that you do not see it?
That's weird...
The man on the phone told me that the 5 children,
I looked at the boy in the blue cap.
Wait, Mr. Inspector!
If you try to arrest the blackmailer it will be a disaster!
What do you mean?
If the ball was under us, they shot near us, right?
Yes.
The range of a pistol is insignificant,
if it had missed the shot would have failed.
If it was close, how do you understand that he mistook it for a child?
From the dress, you can tell it's a girl.
With the railing she should not have seen the skirt.
(Off) "If she didn't see it because of the railing,
it means that the person who was looking from the opposite side...
and the one who actually shot, were different people."
At the very least there must be two people, or more!
Inform the inspectors!
Tell them not to do anything until I tell them!
(Think) "But how will we do it?"
"Will we be able to find the blackmailer, with so few clues?"
"To find him in this stadium, in the middle of 56.000 people..."
"How are we going to do it?"
(Radio) "To all the staff scattered in the stands!"
(Radio) "The blackmailers are two or more people!"
"We think one of them has a Tokaref!"
"Even if you see someone suspicious don't jump on you!"
"Continue surveillance!"
"We don't know what they are capable of, to help one of their comrades!"
Try not to let them realize that you are police inspectors.
Make every effort to look for them!
The blackmailer will call back to say the place where he wants the money.
You must have well located the people who use cell phones.
And then there are the binoculars.
When the blackmailer was talking on the phone,
he was looking at us from the other side of the bleachers.
From so far away, he spotted a group of 5 children,
and he noticed that one of them was wearing a blue cap.
And on top of that, he saw the ball.
You can't see that with the naked eye.
Apart from the cell phone, he must have binoculars or...
-Theater binocles! -Telescopes!
Portable video camera!
A camera with a telephoto lens would look pretty suspicious.
Yes, that's true.
One of them must be carrying something that allows him to look from a distance.
(Cell phone rings) Inspector!
The call!
(Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!) It must be from the blackmailer!
Calm down.
Guys, they're calling.
It could be him. (Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!)
Tell me where the people who are now talking on the phone are from.
Listen to me well.
If it's the blackmailer, try to stall him. (Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!)
Ah... yes.
Yes, hello?
I'm Kaneko the filmmaker.
Yes.
Hello?
Yes.
Hello?
(Man) Why didn't you put it on?
I hope you didn't call the cops.
No.
I just took...
(It's the blackmailer.
Look for him!
That's the way I like it.
Have you prepared the money?
Aaaaa..., yes.
(Man) You will leave money at the exit of access 18.
You will leave them when the discount time starts.
Don't get confused.
Ah, wait!
Sit me down?
Sit down?
He hung up!
How did it go, did they find him?
This is sector E. An older man in a black sweater was talking on a cell phone.

This is sector B!
I have one person.
But he's still talking, so...
He might be contacting his accomplices now!
Keep watching.
Hey, Takagi!
How do you have it here?
At the time of the call there were 8 people talking on the phone.
Have you also watched the empty rooms and internal corridors?
Yes.
We also went into the toilets,
but there was no one talking on the phone.
And no one left the stadium.
We also checked the spectators one by one with cameras,
but at that moment only those 8 were talking on the phone.
We can't be wrong.
One of the blackmailers must be one of these eight people.
Mr. Inspector, the blackmailers will come to get the money, won't they?
Well, they're supposed to.
Keep an eye on those 8!
Before they become aware of our presence,
I want them in the sack tied up tight!
Eh?
Where's my radio?
Where is it?
Ah, you mean this one? Yes, this one, this one.
Here you go! Ah, thank you, Conan.
Attention, all units...
What have you installed, on the radio?
A listening device.
I want to be aware of the movements of the police.
By the way, where are the others?
I told them that if they showed half of the entrance they could go back in,
and they came in quite happily.
Ben... happy?
Don't tell me that those...
Here in Genta!
Here in Genta!
Have you found anyone suspicious?
Over!
Here in Mitsuhiko!
There is no one suspicious.
Over!
Ayumi!
What, this way?!
Nothing.
I can't find anything suspicious. (Transmitter sounds)
Yes!
Ayumi here.
"Ayumi here"?
What does this mean?!
What's he doing?!
That guy has a gun!
For he shoots, the Palmar!
Stop these blackmailers for us and march!
(All) Noooo!
You're a kid too!
We also want to help you stop the bad guys!
We're the Detective League, weren't we a team?!
Okay...
But even if you find someone suspicious don't act on your own.
You let me know no matter what! (All) YES!
What do you think...
We can trust.
They wouldn't see children as a threat.
This is true, but...
Oysters!
They've already added the discount time!
Now they have to put the money in the exit of access 18.
Here the Sato, the bag, is still where it is.
Here at Tamiya.
Nobody has approached the bag.
She's... she's already come.
He's wearing a gray trench coat, mask and sunglasses.
The man, now he's taken the bag.
People around? No one, he's alone...
Very good...
We take help us
The gun!
Look for the gun!
He's not taking it anywhere!
Speak up!
Where is the gun?!
(Phone: man) "Don't touch it! Do not touch my partner!
"If you don't, you'll murder someone from the audience! Let him go!
(Man) So you've alerted the cops...
This wasn't our deal, was it?
Nichiuri's Kaneko Realizer!"
It's just that I...
"You made fun of us."
"I charge someone to show what we're like?"
Wait!
(Think) This man is dangerous!
(Phone: man) Who do I charge?
I have targets to give and sell."

That gentleman!
We've got you!
-Children enough! -We won't let you run away!
I've already recognized you, sir.
You're the one blackmailing Nichiuri Television.
In the next chapter...
The blackmail case of those killed in the stadium, part 2.
The clue to the next Conan is... The TV camera.
In the next one, the outcome of the case and of the game.
Watered the blackmailer and... Goal!
