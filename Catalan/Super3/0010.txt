DETECTIVE CONAN
The case of blackmailing a footballer
I'm looking forward to tonight's game.
Eh? You mean the soccer match.
Ah, the soccer cup final.
Who do you think will win?
-Who do you want to win!
The Tokyo Spirits, who have Hideo.
He has scored in 17 consecutive games.
He's good at Hideo, but I like him better at Naoki.
Well it looks like Naoki has been injured in training
and will be out for a season.
The Great Osaka, where he plays in Ramus,
makes a more balanced attack and defense.
(He thinks) "Soccer..."
Why don't you come in?
You're here to consult something, aren't you?
Thank you very much.
My name is Ryoko Akagi.
I'd like to find a person...
She suddenly disappeared... and believe me, I don't know what to do.
Look, it's her picture.
We were dating.
What?! What?!
You were dating Shinichi?
Yes...
How can it be, that Shinichi made me...
You must be confused.
You must look a lot alike...
How can I be confused?
We've even made kisses!
K-k-kissing?
(thinks) "Are you kidding."
He's a rogue.
He goes around saying he's working on a case and must live with some girl.
He must be...
Children should shut up and listen!
But I can't go on living without Shinichi!
At this rate... at this rate...
"What can I do? What does he want? Why does he do this, this, this girl?"
(Phone)
(Kogoro) You were just making kisses?
Maybe you broke more things.
(Ring)
Yes, she is right.
I can't tell you this... (ring)
Detective Mouri's agency, say.
Shinichi, lucky I found you.
Doctor Agasa.
That new invention I gave you... the battery is missing...
All right, okay, I'll tell him right away.
See you later, Shinichi.
Was that Shinichi, this one?
Yes, he said he'll call the Ryoko to stay.
My Shinichi will come to see me.
I'm so happy!
Then we'll go to Ryoko's house.
Eh, but why Ran?
Because Shinichi might go.
So we can ask him a few questions.
Ryoko, can't we come?
Yes.
Then I'll stay.
I don't care about girlish nonsense.
I'm staying too.
Or not.
I'll be right back.
Come in, please, come in.
(Thinking) "I'd say this door's been forced."
"There are only men's and children's shoes."
"I don't live any women, here."
(Adult voice) "Hiding something. What is she trying to hide, this girl?"
Let's see, the tea must be....
Ah, I've got it...
The spoon...
The teapot should be here.
Ryoko, about how long have you been going out with Shinichi?
Since we've been friends since we were little, I'd like to know.
Do you feel me, Ryoko?
Ryoko Akagi!
You were saying, Ran?
(Thinking) What does she think she is?
Now she's acting crazy.
"This needs to be investigated some more."
"Mamoru?
But-but what does it all mean?
"Mamoru?"
It looks like it's from a child, this room.
Who is it, this other one in the picture?
It looks so familiar.
(TV) "The match is heating up here, at the national stadium,
where the cup final is being held!"
"Who will score the first goal!"
(Think) "Why did he turn on the TV?"
"He sure has little desire to talk to me!"
Ah, look at the soccer.
That's right, Conan.
At the Ryoko you really like soccer, don't you?
Uh... Yes.
(TV) Hell, no!
Hideo Akagi is feeling the pressure.
"Akagi!"
"The boy in that picture is in Hideo, Tokyo Spirits."
"Hideo Akagi."
"Then, that boy, in Mamoru Akagi, is Hideo's brother."

"I read that she had lost her parents two years ago
and that she lived with her brother."
"This girl doesn't live here, she's an imposter."
"What is she doing here? And using her name?"
(TV) "My God! He has failed her again! In Hideo has missed the shot again."
"Why does he make these mistakes? He seems to do it expressly."
"Could it be that...? What if this girl was...?"
"I will use Dr. Agasa's invention."
This is my latest creation, the lunch box with integrated fax!
And what's so original about it?
It's a lunch box with a fax, I don't see anything special!
(Phone)
Hello, hello!
(Adult voice) Hello.
Shinichi, it's you, isn't it?
(Ryoko) It's that... it's that....... it's, it's...
It's a...
kidnapping.
And Mamoru Akagi,
Hideo's younger brother, who plays in the game they televise,
is the victim.
The kidnapper demanded that he lose this match.
You wanted to contact me,
and you made up that story that you were going out with me.
They threatened to kill you in Mamoru if you reported it.
Ryoko Akagi is a fake name so that no one would suspect.
You wanted me to come to Akagi's house to tell me the truth, didn't you?
Yes.
But how do you know, that he's been kidnapped?
You haven't come here yet.
Ah... Ah...
Well, look... you know I'm an exceptional detective!
Write me a detailed report of the kidnapping and fax it to me.
The number is...
Yes... yes.
What's up?!
Shinichi called you, didn't he?
I'm so glad, Ran.
Shinichi understands my situation.
(thinks) "May I know why she's crying, this girl?"
May I know where you've got to!?
Shinichi, come here and tell me!
What?
I'm sure that...
Shinichi!
I can hear my voice on another phone.
Wow!
"This means Shinichi is...
in this house!"
Very good.
Ah, he's coming.
Let's see...
"It went like this:
Mamoru had already disappeared
when I went to make him breakfast this morning."
"I'm sending you a letter left by the kidnapper...
and another that this man had Mamoru write."
This one.
"Friend, resurrect in Mamoru?"
What a strange sentence, if he's asking to be rescued.
Eh?
What are they, these dots?
Shinichi!
Where are you?
Come on out there!
Shinichi!
Gee, it seems to me that the Ran will be more troublesome than the case.
(TV) "In Hideo makes a center. Oops no!"
"The ball is going the wrong way."
"He has missed again."
"In Takeda is well placed! He shoots!"
"And Goooooool!"
"This is our Hideo!"
"It was a fantastic play. He had it all figured out!"
(Fax)
"You've broken your promise, you won't see your brother."
He drank oil!
It's too late... Mamoru...
(Thinking) "I have to run."
"I must hurry to find the kidnapper...
or they'll kill Mamoru."
"A little boy has been kidnapped."
"No matter how much resistance I put up,
it's not normal for the room to be in such a mess."
"The diabolical investigation."
This game went on sale yesterday!
But the package is empty.
She can't have taken the game, the child, if she's been kidnapped.
In Genta said...
-L'heroi dies in the middle of the game.
En-And you have to resurrect him to play.
Resuscitate him!
It could be that...
"I thought so!"
"En Mamoru has named the hero after himself."
"And in this way,
the Mamoru of this game, is the hero of the game."
Eh?
"Naoki?"
I could understand all this if it said Mamoru, Hideo, or Ryoko,
but who's Naoki?
A friend of Mamoru's?
Wait a minute Hideo and Naoki ring a bell.
In Hideo it's good, but I like it better in Naoki.
In Naoki Uemura, last year he signed for Tokyo Spirits!
And these two points should be...
If the letter before "friend" was a "y".....
I got it!
(Phone)
Yes, say!
(Adult voice) Stay calm: I know where he's hiding in Mamoru.
You do?
Tell me where he is, Shinichi!
Where is he, in Mamoru?
Just a moment.
Ryoko, do you know a person named Naoki Uemura?
Yes, Shinichi, he's a friend of Hideo's and lives near here.
Maybe Naoki came to play with Mamoru?

Yes, Naoki is very fond of computer games.
Why do you ask?
Because she hasn't been kidnapped, en Mamoru.
The marks on the lock of the door that make you think it's been forced,
and the mess in the room,
are staged by the culprit,
to make it look like a ruthless kidnapper.
It can't be!
Probably, the sentence before the one in the letter is:
"I will tell en Naoki to resurrect me in Mamoru."
The culprit has cut out words.
The person who has taken in Mamoru is....
Exactly.
The culprit is in Naoki Uemura!
In Mamoru must be at home.
(They call)
Shinichi, now I've found you, now I've found you.
Shinichi!
Get out of here!
I know you're in here!
(Adult voice) I'm the toilet, how do you want me to come out?
Ah, sure!
Mmm... I get it.
(adult voice) All right!
(Think) You'll open the door though!
Ran, wait, wait!
What do you want now?
Shinichi's on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.
If you have to say something, tell me here.
It's important and I don't want anyone to hear it.
Listen to him.
Something important?
(Thinking) Just for me.
Don't want to mess me up, now!
I'm not in the mood!
What are you going to tell me now, Shinichi?
Come on, come on.
Go on, say, say!
(hangs up)
(slamming door)
Shinichi!
Don't run away!
Conan!
Shinichi just ran out of there.
He detested him!
He said he was going, Shinichi?
To save Mamoru.
He must have gone to Naoki's foul.
He's gone to Naoki's house?
Very well.
I want you to come with me!
(Announcer) "Gee, no! Hideo's failed again!"
"What happened to him?"
(Think) "Mamoru..."
(Intercom)
Yes, who is it?
-I'm Ryoko. (Boy) -What's the matter?
I'm busy.
Anyway, open the door for me.
What's the matter with you?
Let me in, please, please.
No.
My girlfriend is here.
And I don't want her to get suspicious.
Mamoru!
Feel me!
Mamoru!
Answer me, if you're here!
What's that, those screams?
Get out of the way!
Shinichi!
Get over here right now!
Mamoru!
Ah!
Hello, Ryoko!
Ooooh!
Mamoru!
Bad.
It's not done, leaving home alone.
But, I left you a message.
I just wanted Naoki to resurrect the hero of the game.
-Are you sure, Ryoko?
Okay, Mamoru? -Yes, I swear.
Hey, Hideo!
What are you doing?
I won't forgive you, if you lose!
Mamoru...
Hey, Hideo, the second part is starting!
(TV) "Goal! Two to one!
(TV) "Goal! Two to one! Hideo's shot went in!
"Something must have happened to him in the first half!"
Oh.
Change what a hero.
It's always the same with him, always.
Hideo is a genius...
and I have to fight for popularity, for everything.
He always outdoes me.
(Off) "In high school, we made more or less the same goals."
And I've trained myself every day, to be better than Hideo.
I've trained and I've caught him, but I had to beat her.
"Until .
...he broke my leg at the last game."
"Of course! He broke it expressly."
I was so afraid he was going to get over it.
Thanks to him, I have an injury that will last me 3 months.
It will be impossible to make up for lost time.
But, I didn't want to hurt her, at Mamoru.
After the match, I would have sent her home,
and I would have already disappeared.
He just wanted to make me suffer a little.
(TV) End of the match!
3 to one!
The Tokyo Spirits have won!
Viva have won!
My game is over too.
Ryoko, call the police and tell them the kidnapper is here.
(TV) "Hideo, who would you like to dedicate it to, this great game?"
"Well, I would like to... dedicate it to my brother Mamoru,
but I'll dedicate it...
to my friend Naoki."
"I want to say to Naoki Uemura, my main rival,
that if it had been here, we would have scored more goals."
"Naoki, my friend, get well and come back soon."
He's... he's an idiot, he still doesn't know what I've done.
Look what a jerk he becomes.
Forgive me for bothering you at a time like this, but...
Tell me for once where have you hidden Shinichi?
Shinichi isn't around here.
Do you want us to call, Ran?
"My phone's in my wallet!"

I haven't known him for a long time.
Shinichi gave it to me today.
Ah... (Phone)
(Phone)
Damn it!
It won't open!
Just now it won't open!
(Ring)
"It's stopped."
Are you here, Shinichi?
Oh, my lord!
Shinichi, you won't escape this time.
Who is Ryoko?
And what were you doing at her house?
Weren't you working on a very difficult case?
(Adult voice) I-I was just...
Liar!
This girl cried.
She cried when she talked to you on the phone.
I don't know what the hell is going on, do you hear me?
Now I'm the one who feels like crying...
Shinichi, come here right now and tell me about it!
Shinichi!
Ran, listen to me...
I'm completely innocent.
Eh?
Please don't cry.
Who are you, to tell me not to cry?
It makes me sick...
Seeing you cry is what tastes the worst to me.
Eh?
What's the matter?
I have to go now.
Wait, wait, wait!
You didn't answer me.
Shinichi!
It's Dr. Agasa!
Hello, Ran.
If you're looking for Shinichi, he's run off all flushed.
Blushing?
It tastes so bad to see you crying.
I don't understand anything at all!
Doctor Agasa, I think this is Massa speaking.
Look who's talking, you coward.
Au, shut up.

Is it true, that, Ryoko?
Yes!
Of course, it's true!
Well...
"On that day, no one told the police."
"But the Ran made Ryoko explain it several times
and my name was cleared of suspicion
after 3 days."
Ayumi, can you hear me?
The game is over.
You can come out now!
What?
Ayumi, wait, don't open it!
Eh?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Think) What if the Ayumi had gotten into the car of the girl-killers?
Watch out!
