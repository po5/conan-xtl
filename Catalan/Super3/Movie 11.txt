(Police: sirens)
(Takagi) Emergency!
Officer 503 calling Central.
(Male) "What emergency do you have, 503? Over."
We just located the car of the robbery suspects.
We're following them on Miyuki Street, they're heading towards Sotobori.
"Receipt."
"Please report the model and license plate number of the vehicle.
and describe the suspects."
This is agent 503, copy.
The vehicle is a black minivan.
Shinjuku 500, SA 3255.
As for the suspects... they are Lupin and... Fujiko!
- "Don't kid me, 503." - I'm not pulling your leg!
- (people: shouting) - (sirens)
Agent 503 in Central.
In Lupin has turned left from Miyuki toward Chuo.
"Agent 503, don't be funny. Over."
That's no joke, I'm serious!
(Cars: horns)
RECO, Sato!
Do me a favor and slow down, you feel?
-Weren't you talking to Central, you? -Ah, yes!
Agent 503 in Central.
The suspects have turned...
How dare they wear a mask on Lupin?
They'll regret it!
Hello, good afternoon.
1,237 yen, please.
(Sirens: approaching)
(Loudspeaker: Takagi) "Police! Stop immediately!"
-What happened? How cool!
(Speaker: Takagi) "Stop right now! That's an order!"
"I repeat. You have no escape!"
"Get out of the roadway and stop the vehicle!"
You asked for it.
As they give, they take!
- (wheels: screeching) - (cars: horns: horns)
Oh, no!
He got away from us!
-Agafa't very loud! -What?
-Sato, may I know what...? - Shut up or you'll swallow your tongue!
-What are you going to do? -Shut up!
What are you doing?
-Takagi, call Headquarters. Right now.
(Horn)
What a face!
I've already called!
They're sending a reinforcement patrol and an ambulance.
-They've been looking for him. What?
For having put on a mask of my first love.
-Y... your first love? -Go check on Fujiko.
Hang in there, the ambulance will be here soon.
-Sato! -What?
Fujiko is also unconscious, but nothing serious has happened.
Good.
How did you come up with the idea
the idea of using the masks to commit a robbery?
Y... island... Komi.
Komi Island?
Aha!
Is that where you were planning to spend the stolen money?
-N-no... -What do you mean?
-What's wrong with him, on Komi Island? -What's wrong with him, on Komi Island? -I... Jolly...
I-lly... Roger...
-Jolly Roger?
Ring a bell, does it ring a bell? -No.
-No... -Mom, will you come at once? -Hurry up!
Hey, do you know how to use this?
Let me.
Teach, what fish will we see, in the sea?
(Man) Good morning, sir.
What's the name of the reserve?
Kogoro Mouri.
Soc detective.
We are two adults, two teenagers and five children.
One moment, please.
The newspaper "Nichiuri" publishes an enigma every week, you know?
It's very complicated to solve.
If no one gets the answer right, the prize money goes into the jackpot,
and once it accumulated 30,000 yen.
And do you know who got the correct answer and got the money?
No... I don't... I don't know...
Was it...?
That's right!
For someone like me, guessing is a piece of cake.
(Thinking) "But I solved it myself! What a nerve."
With this 30,000 yen I could have gone to Paris, you know?
It seems like a city tailor-made for a classy guy like me.
But I thought about it
and in the end I felt bad about going on vacation alone.
That's why I took the whole troop, so they can have fun too.
-I'm generous, right? -Yes...
-So? -I'm sorry.
Unfortunately, there is no reservation in your name on the list.
What does it say! "What a surprise."
W-wait a minute.
I made it myself, the reservation.
I'm sorry, but your name doesn't appear on the reservation list.
What do you mean, we'll have to sleep outside?
With this subtropical climate there must be a lot of bugs, on the island.
-We shouldn't have vingut. -Va, we'll figure something out.
We are not abroad, here we can understand everyone.
It's just like a woman, Haibara.
Well, she's no girl, I'm sure of that.
The receptionist will call the tourist office, don't worry.
Poor guy.
But I just phoned to confirm the reservation.

and they told me that everything was correct!
It must have been a mistake...
Hello everyone!
I'm here.
You must be the famous detective Kogoro Mouri, right?
Oh, my!
I'm sorry, I'm Iwanaga from the tourist office.
I'm Iwanaga from the tourist office.
This month we've had a sudden increase in the number of tourists.
All the hotels are full.
You can't imagine how happy we are, on the island!
Even so, I have found them accommodation in a pension.
We will not leave the famous detective Kogoro Mouri!
Au, let's go.
I'll accompany you.
-Useless. He's a sucker.
Who are these guys?
Treasure hunters.
Treasure hunters?
What do you mean, they go to the toilet? How?
I say I'm going to look for treasure when I go to the toilet.
Don't get confused, Genta.
They are people who travel around the world looking for hidden treasures.
Alza!
But how did you figure it out, that they are treasure hunters?
Ah!
Fixeu's-well.
All 3 are quite dark,
but their hands are much darker than their arms.
See?
This means that they usually wear wetsuits.
Also, their hair is bleached because of the seawater.
Couldn't they be simple divers?
Yes, that wouldn't be strange.
But that sign makes me think they're treasure hunters.
Oh!
Treasures! Yes.
It must be like a dream,
finding an old treasure buried at the bottom of the sea.
DETECTIVE CONAN.
THE PIRATE FLAG AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN
My name is Shinichi Kudo and I'm a teenage detective.
What do you mean?
I don't look like a teenager, you say?
This is Ran Mouri, my best friend and classmate.
One day, we went to the amusement park together...
and I witnessed a suspicious exchange
between two men dressed in black.
I was so focused on observing those two men,
that I didn't notice another one behind me.
He made me swallow a poison
and, when I woke up...
(Conan voice)... my body had shrunk!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
they would want to kill me and the lives of those around me would be in danger.
That's why Dr. Agasa advised me
to hide my identity.
When the Ran asked me what my name was,
I thought to tell her that I called myself Conan Edogawa.
Since her father is a detective, I went to live with them...
to get information about the men in black.
This man is Ran's father, Detective Kogoro Mouri.
They call him "Sleeping Kogoro".
And do you know why?
Because of me.
This is Sonoko Suzuki.
She is Ran's classmate.
Her family has a lot of money, but she's not uptight at all.
This is Dr. Agasa.
He has created many inventions adapted to my new height.
And here we have Ai Haibara.
Her name is actually Shiho Miyano.
He had been a member of the Men in Black.
To escape from the organization, she shrank...
swallowing the same poison they had made me drink.
I still haven't figured out who they are, the men in black.
But as the detective that I am, I assure you that I will unmask them!
I'm small but I have the brains of an adult.
A detective who solves all mysteries!
There is only one truth!
Mr. Iwanaga,
how come they sell so many treasure hunters on this island?
A couple of weeks ago a treasure turned up.
-That's why, I suppose. A real treasure?
So, is it true what they say?
That they found silver objects in the Palau Submarino?
-Yes, it's true. What is it, the Underwater Palace?
Look.
See that little uninhabited island down there?
That's the island of Yorioya.
About 200 meters east of the island,
the bottom of the sea,
there's some kind of sunken building made of giant stone blocks.
Ten years ago a rumor spread that near Komi Island there were some ancient underwater ruins.
there were some ancient underwater ruins.
Many scientists came to investigate them,
but they couldn't tell whether it was an artificial construction
or a whim of nature.
They say that there used to be
more surface of the island of Yorioya out of the water,
but about 300 years ago an earthquake in sunk a part of it
and was left with this shape.
An earthquake that caused a landslide?
Yes.
The seabed around the island
is formed by a layer of methane hydrates, they say.

The earthquake dissolved it all at once and the detachment occurred.
That's one of the theories.
(Hey, Conan.
What?
You know what they are, these "butane nuts"?
Methane hydrates?
Under conditions of low temperatures and high pressures,
water molecules trap methane gas molecules and form Clathrate.
You can also say "flammable ice".
-Flammable gel? -Clatrat?
I don't understand anything at all.
He-he-he!
I'll give you an example.
Have you ever built a house of cards?
Imagine a castle made of water molecules.
Methane gas is trapped in the spaces between molecules.
Therefore, when the temperature rises and the pressure falls,
the structure wobbles.
Until, in the end, the castle collapses and releases all the methane.
Of course!
The island, which was at the top of the structure,
lost its foothold and the landslide occurred.
Yes, in other words you could say it like this.
Ahem, ahem...
I heard it the other day on TV.
He-he-he-he!
Ah, now I get it.
What an ass!
May I come in, Mr. Mima?
Soc from the tourist office.
Mr. Mima, what is it?
Mr. Mima!
This has nothing to do with the hotel before.
What?
Excuse me, I don't think he's here.
And I called him earlier.
-What's this commotion? -Ah, Mr. Mima! -Ah, Mr. Mima!
I'm taking Mr. Mouri and family, as we agreed.
One night with full board is 5,000 yen.
If you don't like it, you can leave.
-Wait, Mr. Mima. -Who does this guy think he is?
He's a good man, but he's stubborn.
He's a good man, but he's stubborn as a mule.
Let's see... Who's in the mood for a game of hidden treasure?
I do!
I do!
And the ladies will want to go diving, right?
I can go with the car, it's on my way.
Very kind, thank you.
And the gentlemen, what do they want to do?
The treasure hunt game is a lot of fun.
I need to rest for a while, don't worry.
And Mr. Mouri?
Will he play treasure hunt...?
No.
I need to make a drink, me.
Do you know a bar with a good-looking mistress?
Do you?
Ay...
(Woman) Let's see...
The Ran Mouri and the Sonoko Suzuki, right?
Do you want to rent the complete equipment?
-Yes. Kimiko!
I'm coming!
I guess these wetsuits will suit you girls.
They're size M, I hope I got it right.
Yes. They're perfect.
That's great!
I'm glad, because we're spoiled for choice here.
They'll fit us first class, no pateixis.
I really like them!
-Yes? -Let's go, we're leaving.
Hey, just a moment.
When you're done, put everything back in its place.
- (bell: chimes) - See you later.
(Bell: ringing)
These men are treasure hunters, aren't they?
That we'll have to dive with them? -No.
They asked me for the compressor to fill the cylinders.
We have more and more riffraff, hanging around here.
Ah!
Since they found the silver objects.
Yes.
Besides, they say that Anne escaped from prison...
and hid the treasure on the island.
-Who is it, Anne? -This one. -This one.
(Recording: male voice) "They say it's about 270 years ago,
"In the 18th century,
the Underwater Palace was on the surface of the sea."
"The evidence to prove it was found inside the Palau:
an alfanje, which is a kind of cutlass, and a pistol."
"The cutlass and the pistol
"Had the initials of two female pirates engraved on them.
"Who lived around 1730:
Anne Bonny and Mary Read."
"Both sailed under Captain Jack Rackham."
-What?
Two women pirates, you said? -Yes.
Anne Bonny and Mary Read.
They were both part of the crew of the pirate Jack Rackham.
They say that, when the British attacked their ship,
the men of the crew hid in the hold.
and they went out to fight the enemy together,
back to back.
Oysters!
Back to back?
Yes.
Each covered the other's back,
so they could focus on the enemies in front of them.
They survived because they trusted each other.
Wow!
Ran.
You know what?
If I had to ask someone to have my back,
you're the only one I'd trust.
So-Sonoko!
Just kidding!
But you'd pick Shinichi for sure.
That one?
And now! Are you sure?

Of course not! (Sonoko: river)
(Recording) "Anne escaped from prison in the Bahamas
"And set course for the Pacific Ocean,
"where she continued to play the pirate
while waiting for the Mary to get out of jail."
"Legend has it that the treasures they stole between the two of them
are hidden here, on the island of Komi."
"Come on everyone, search for the hidden treasures of the Anne and Mary!"
(At the same time) Come on!
Do you think they're real, Kudo? (Shinichi voice) I don't know.
It would be very strong if they were.
Maybe it's a set-up to promote the island.
(Shinichi voice) What?
In this case, I would find it even stronger.
Both would be.
I'm here!
Sorry to keep you waiting... Ah!
(Thinks) "Mother of mine." Oh!
It's got it.
It's the treasure map.
Leaving here you must find 5 hidden locations
where there will be a seal and a riddle to solve.
The starting point is where we are now.
Put the seal in the corresponding box on the map.
Inside the chest there is a card
with the clue to get to the next location.
What a childish game.
Don't be like that!
Look how excited they are, them.
"10 y 12".
This is the key to finding the treasure hideout?
The next clue reads:
"Pirates shine even when the sun goes down."
-What does this mean? -Guys, good luck to you.
If you find the treasure hideout, I'll give you a very special prize.
Oh!
A special prize?
What can you eat?
You won't know until you find the treasure.
We won't stop until we find it, then!
You still don't know if it's some food...
(Conan voice) Mr. Iwanaga.
Yes, say, boy.
Did you make up all the clues in the game?
(Conan voice) What?
Well, yes... Oh, by the way.
At the town hall there are bicycles for rent, I advise you to take one.
Going on foot all the time is exhausting.
Yes!
I see you're looking forward to it too, Kudo.
(Sss)
- (ps, ps, ps) -Oh!
(ps, ps, ps) -Oh!
We're about ready.
Let's go then.
Do as Kimiko tells you and enjoy your strength.
And above all, watch out when you get to the south of the Palau.
-There is a pretty deep ravine. Don't scare us, woman!
Don't worry, I won't let you out of my sight.
-Thank you for joining us.
Is he already here?
What happened?
-Taurons! -(Mitsuhiko) What?
(Mitsuhiko) As the clue talked about the setting sun,
we've come to the west end of the island,
but where should it be, the chest with the next clue?
Shut up, I got it!
The clue said: "Pirates shine even when the sun goes down".
Right?
It can only be... the surface of the sea!
-Of course! -And then?
Then what?
How do you want there to be a seal, in the middle of the sea?
Ah, of course.
I don't think that's it, then.
He-he-he-he-he!
Oh, my... Oh.
Hey, look!
-What's there? -They look like fish.
-I'm sure they're eels! -Here defect, eels! -It's obvious!
It's obvious! What?
Eh, Conan!
Tell me, what is this so obvious, eh?
That you've discovered something?
Do you know why fish swim all together?
-Because... -To play together.
So they can eat together when they're hungry.
That's right!
And do you know what fish eat?
Plankton, I guess.
That's right.
-Ooooh! -So cool!
And what's in here? Look at her.
Ah!
They're sea fireflies!
Now I get it!
"Pirates glow even when the sun goes down".
The clue was referring to this place! It is here!
"Thin pirates laugh."
And the ones who aren't thin don't laugh, then?
(Shinichi voice) What's wrong, Haibara?
I saw someone disembarking with a neoprene stained with blood.
What are you talking about!
I couldn't see if it was the Ran or not...
-Conan, where are you going? -We must leave you alone for a while.
Continue looking for the treasure!
You too?
Don't worry in the least, I'll stay with you.
I'm sure we'll find the treasure without them.
Yes, I'm sure we will.
- (slides: approaching) - (door, open)
Yes, I'm sure we will. (Conan voice) Are you all right? Hey, Conan!
What are you doing here?
Are you okay, Ran? Yes.
-We're fine. (door opens)

Yes, we are fine. How are you, Mr. Uehira? -Hello, Kimiko.
You diving with them, you?
No, I was doing a dive with these girls...
near where they were.
But I find it very strange that the sharks attacked them just because they did.
Especially since there were 3 of them but they only attacked one...
What are you saying?
No, nothing.
We're in trouble!
A shark attack...
(Kimiko) In fact, it's the first time I've seen sharks, there.
(Kimiko) What happened?
(Shinichi voice) It turns out that the Kimiko says
that only one of the three men have attacked, the sharks.
Wasn't that a coincidence?
These men are professionals,
they should have the resources to chase the sharks away.
What did you see?
A plastic bag.
Fish blood.
That's why they attacked it.
Yes.
Someone filled a plastic bag with fish blood,
closed it and hid it in the neoprene vest.
"The water pressure
increases by one atmosphere every ten meters of depth."
"At the surface of the sea there is one atmosphere of pressure."
"At ten meters depth, two,
and at 30 meters, the pressure is four atmospheres."
"At this depth,
the fence of the plastic bag cannot withstand the pressure and bursts."
"Sharks are able to hear sounds from miles away.
"And they have a sense of smell that allows them to smell the blood
even if it's diluted 1,000 times."
A murder? Yes.
Or an attempt, for now. (Door, open)
(Drunkenly) Hey, you, quatreulls!
May I ask what's on your mind, you two?
(Conan voice) We're investigating a case.
A case?
And how come no one has warned me, the...?
Ah!
The famous detective... Kogoro Mouri?
What a big mouth!
What a big mouth!
Anyway, if she was bitten by a shark,
there's nothing to investigate, it was an accident, right?
-Oh! -Huh?
What did you want to show me, you?
What did you want to show me?
Oh, fuck.
How did it go?
I did everything I could, but I lost too much blood.
-I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. Ouch!
What a tragedy, we only lacked a fatal accident!
(Kogoro) Actually, it wasn't an accident.
-Oh!
You are the famous detective...-Kogoro Mouri, yes.
(Kogoro) Father! Mr. Mouri!
(Kogoro) Hey!
What do you mean, it wasn't an accident?
Someone used a bait
to lure the sharks and make them attack you.
Hidden underneath the wetsuit vest
was a plastic bag containing fish blood.
You guys are treasure hunters, right?
Motive is not lacking, for having done so.
Hey, Ran.
What?
You know where they keep it, the scuba gear?
Well... Now that you mention it, I doubt they keep it in the hotel room.
They must keep them at the dive store on the island.
We saw that they were going to fill the tanks.
Eh?
(Think) "Whoever tampered with the BCD must have done it here."
(Haibara) "Taking it away would have been too risky."
(Haibara) Come here a moment, Kudo.
What's wrong, Haibara?
(Haibara) Look.
This is where you rinse the stuff,
that's why it's always muddy.
(Haibara) Listen.
Can you take a couple of pictures, please?
In the meantime, I'll go check something.
Wow!
Since when am I your secretary, Kudo?
And now, you're no secretary.
You're my partner.
Oh.
That's what I wanted to hear.
You'll take the photos, right? Of course I will.
Do you have a moment? Mm?
Say.
At night there's someone in the store? You play detective?
I live just behind the store and Kimiko's, in an apartment near the harbor.
At night there is no one. Ah.
Besides, as there are no thieves on the island,
we don't lock the door, even at night.
Hey, Kimiko.
You locked the store last night, didn't you?
What? Yes, why do you ask?
Yes, why do you ask?
This little detective is asking me a lot of questions.
Now I get it!
You're trying to find out if someone tampered with the neoprene, aren't you?
Mm-hm.
Well yes, I closed the store last night,
and I opened it myself this morning.
But we never lock up, at night,
so anyone could have come in.
(Haibara) And so?
Have you found any clues?
No.

So far, I haven't seen anything strange.
I hope it won't take too long.
("Walkie-talkie": acoustic signal)
(Conan voice) What happened? (Genta) "Like 'what happened'?"
"May I know what you're doing, Conan?"
"Without you we'll never find it, the pirates' treasure!"
Why don't you try waking up on your own for a change?
(Ayumi) "We don't know enough, us!"
Let's see, where are you now?
(Ayumi) "We're going towards the suspension bridge." The suspension bridge?
"It's drawn the treasure map." Let's see, the treasure map...
Ah, yes.
I see it.
(Genta) "Come on, hurry up and come!" I'm coming...
(Shinichi voice) I have to go.
Hey, Haibara.
Are you coming? No, I'll pass.
I thought so.
Hey, hey!
What's that supposed to mean?
But if the road is cut!
Wow. (Iwanaga) Hey!
You've been left alone? (Conan voice) Yes.
I saw your friends going to the suspension bridge.
That's where I wanted to go, but I found that the road is cut off.
Yes, how bad I know!
Last week's landslide left the road impassable.
If you continue a little further, you'll find a path that turns left.
Can you make it on your own? Mm-hm.
Thank you, Mr. Iwanaga.
You're welcome.
Be careful! Yes!
I give up, guys.
I don't understand anything at all!
Don't suffer, Conan said he'd come.
And if he doesn't come, we'll go out anyway.
We'll get our wits about us.
Look out!
There's a sign on the other side of the bridge!
-What should it say? -Let's go see it.
I'm starving!
-Hey, where are you going?
Wait for me! - (wood: creaks)
(Wood: creaks)
-Atura't! -Stay where you are!
(Wood: creaking) What?
Wh... why?
Well, because...
-Well... because... What's wrong with you guys?
-How much do you weigh, Genta? -39 kilos!
Bullshit!
Maybe a little more... 45 kilos... (Mitsuhiko) Then don't come!
It says on the sign that the bridge will break down
if anyone over 40 kilos passes!
And... and you tell me now?!
-Of course, I understand! -What?
"The skinny pirates laugh"
means that we will solve the mystery by crossing the bridge!
It's true!
If the skinny pirates laugh, the fat pirates must cry!
Help me!
Mommy!
-This is it! Yes!
What do you mean?
"Pirates don't cry."
It's already 4 o'clock. We'd better continue tomorrow.
Yes.
But how will we make it back?
I don't know.
As long as Genta is kneeling there in the middle,
we can't cross if we don't want the bridge to sag...
Hey, hello!
What are you doing down there?
Conan!
We found it!
All right, guys!
The clue says: "Pirates don't cry"!
The problem is that the bridge will break
if someone who weighs more than 40 kilos passes!
Does it say so, on the sign? No.
It says: "Prohibited the passage of persons weighing more than 40 kilos".
"Of course. That's why they laugh, the skinny pirates..."
Nothing will happen, you can cross the bridge!
The sign is part of the clue.
Someone weighing less than 40 kilos can only be a child or a woman.
And there can't be any clue
that only children or women can find!
Thank you for coming, Mr. Inspector.
But it wasn't necessary for you to go to the trouble of coming expressly.
There are some things that have me worried.
Inspector!
Thank you for coming expressly.
Hm.
I want a status report. Yes!
At your service.
They treat us like criminals.
I thought we were the victims, us.
Then behave like real victims...
and explain the truth of what happened.
Let's see.
Have you ever seen these two men?
I don't know them.
I haven't seen them, me.
Last night they robbed a supermarket in Shinbashi
and took the money from the till.
They say you made them do it.
That they did it because you accepted them as colleagues.
What's it to me!
I guess they were doing comedy, inspectors.
Not a damn thing!
Do you have any evidence to prove it?
It's their word against ours.
Come on, let's go.
We don't get nervous.
Fancy a refreshment?
Nothing.
If you don't have any more questions, we're going to rest for a while.
You really don't suspect anyone of wanting to get rid of them
for any particular reason, Mr. Matsumoto?

No, I can't think of it.
-A reveure. -Hold on, just a moment.
Could you give me a light, please?
I've neglected the lighter...
-Tingui: Oh, that's nice.
Thank you, very kind.
Ah...!
I'm fed up!
What a way to waste time.
Of it... Can I have the soda?
I'm so thirsty I'm dying.
Oh, I'm so thirsty.
In fact, that pair hasn't even been touched.
And we haven't been able to get the prints off them.
Yes.
But even if we did,
it would take too long from here to get the results of the analysis.
Either if the scientist came or if we sent the lab.
Come to think of it, Takagi, I didn't know they smoked.
Excuse me.
Does anyone have a bottle of instant glue handy?
(Agasa) I know we're having dinner, but...
-A riddle! -Ha-ha-ha!
(Agasa) That's right.
(Agasa) "Here we go." (Agasa) Again?
I'd seen it coming for a while.
In the fish kingdom, next to the underwater ruins,
the traps of the former king came to light.
and it was decided that the sea bream should be crowned the new king.
Tell me, who do you think the previous king was?
You have 3 choices.
One: the squid.
Two: the pop.
Three: the crab.
Which is the correct one?
Mmm...
Ah!
I got it!
The third one, the crab!
And why is that?
Because he cut off the heads of his enemies with the tongs.
Yes?
That's bad!
Don't be a beast!
This would be too cruel...
Okay, I'm sorry.
-It's pop, right? -Yes?
And why do you say that?
The pop king stole the riches of his kingdom and kept them for himself.
Try to imagine a pop and you'll see.
You say that because he has many legs to steal, right?
-Yes, that's right! -Well, you're wrong.
Then it's the squid! -Yes.
And why?
I'll tell you!
This time I've found the solution.
What is it?
"King" in Japanese is spelled "O-sama".
"King squid" would be "ika-sama".
Which means... "cheating"?
Sure, the cheating king!
-Yes, that's right! -That's very suspicious...
Conan, it's no good!
-That was... -A trap.
-The moon is beautiful, today. -Yes.
Mr. Mima, how come you offer accommodation to tourists?
Well... because I live alone and I have to be smart to pay the bills.
The town hall asked me to offer accommodation.
They are selling more and more, to tourists.
I understand.
We'll try to bother you as little as possible,
as long as we stay in your house.
At least they are not treasure hunters...
Speaking of treasure hunters... The famous treasure really exists?
Mm-hm!
Hyenas don't go where there's no prey to hunt.
Although the one they'll find may not be what they imagine.
I don't understand anything!
What do you mean, pirates don't cry?
Please don't complain so much and try a little harder, Genta!
Hey, guys!
What does it say, the clue?
That pirates don't cry?
Yes, that's right.
If it said "Pirates cry", you'd know where it is.
"Pirates cry," he said?
Maybe that's where we'll find the answer.
Do you want us to go take a look?
Mm?
Where did you say you want to go?
It's not time to go anywhere, what if I leave it till tomorrow?
Tomorrow maybe the weather won't be so nice.
You mean it will get worse?
The wind will be blowing from the south, and in these conditions it's dangerous to go out.
A storm could form.
This is called "folk wisdom", isn't it?
Why don't we all go together?
That way we'll get dinner down.
Yes!
So, what are you going to do, Takagi?
I'll try the cyanoacrylate method.
Cyanoacrylate is a component of instant glue,
and the vapors it emanates will react
with the moisture inside the box
and will help us to extract the fingerprints.
Now you just have to be patient until the prints appear.
Wow, when did you learn all this?
Well... I saw it in a movie a long time ago.
and Mr. Tome from the lab confirmed it for me.
Good for you.
Hopefully it will turn out as well as the movie.
(Wind: whistles)
Hey!
Is this where we'll find the solution to "Pirates don't cry"?
I don't know if you'll find the solution, but this is where they cry.
They cry...
It must be the wind.
Sounds like someone's crying.
Yes, it is true.

But the wind was blowing before, on our way here.
I know, you don't need to say it.
This sand contains a large amount of quartz.
How? It's very fine.
Now I understand!
-Where are you going, Conan? -That you found the solution?
(stomping: squeaking)
Listen, guys!
(squeaking)
-Alça! -It's singing sand! -It's singing sand!
Sure it is!
That's why pirates cry, because of the noise it makes!
From there, you'll have to wake up.
That's how we'll do it.
"And now we have to find the place where pirates don't cry..."
"It must be there!"
Come!
It's quiet here!
That's where the pirates don't cry, then!
(Children: laugh)
"It's true, they don't cry."
The next clue we have says: "The souls of pirates go to heaven".
Another clue that is not understood!
I think you've taken it too seriously, Mr. Iwanaga.
What? The head of the tourist office.
Didn't he say before that he made it up, the clue game?
Yes.
For him it must be part of his job, all of it.
Ha-ha-ha!
He's worked hard.
Mm?
What's the matter?
Where are you going, Conan?
"This is getting interesting."
Conan!
Excuse me, I have to stop somewhere.
Coming through!
But...
-Wait, Conan! -Here we go again.
The nano doesn't know how to work in a team.
In a case...
Oh! Mm?
It worked!
Now we just need to scan them and email them to the lab.
-Well done, Takagi! -Renoi!
Thank you, Takagi!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
If you want to transfer to the scientist, just say so.
I'll gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
There won't be any, thank you.
You can send it to the head office now.
Yes, sir!
(Chika) What are you doing?
I went out for a walk and I got lost.
Where to, the pension?
Not there, thank you.
Good evening!
How are we doing, Takagi?
Is there any answer from the head office?
No, they haven't said anything yet.
D'acord.
(Alarm)
(Alarm) What's going on? (Alarm)
It's the alarm of the Tourist Museum!
(Alarm)
This means that the Tourist Museum has something happened, right?
Yes, but the alarm goes off from time to time.
We'll go take a look just in case.
-Where is it? -It's... next to the town hall.
-Take the car. -Yeah, yeah.
We're waiting for an answer from the head office, won't you be on the case?
Yes, I'll take care of it.
(Alarm)
(Alarm)
How come strange things don't stop happening today?
- (Computer: acoustic signal) -Ah!
It has already arrived!
Let's see...
But... but if...
(Alarm)
(Alarm)
- (Matsumoto) Come in, come in! - (Alarm)
(Alarm)
(TV: man) "...the weather forecast."
"Tonight the wind will start blowing from the south, and tomorrow..."
What a disappointment.
I asked for a bar that had an attractive mistress.
(People: uproar)
What a scandal!
You can't even drink in peace here.
That's why I can't stand tourist places.
I've had it up to here!
What's this racket?
What's the fuss?
What's going on here?
-Wait a minute! -Aaaah!
What are you doing?
There isn't a bar on the whole island with a good-looking mistress, Mr. Iwanaga!
Don't you find them pretty enough?
Look at them in the dark and I'm sure they'll get better.
-Enough excuses! -I'm too busy, now!
What's the matter?
They've broken into the exhibition hall of the Tourist Museum!
-What?
A robbery?
Get out of the way! -Ah!
-Hey! -Hurry, get in!
-What? -Either get in, or stay here.
Just a moment, I'm coming up!
Take strong, I'll go like a bullet.
Hey, sir!
You haven't paid me!
Excuse me, sir!
-What is it, madam? -A gentleman has left without paying.
Catch me!
I can't believe it!
What else will happen?
So they have broken the showcase with an iron bar.
Very risky.
(Mobile)
Did you get the water clear, Sato?
Yes.
Conan was right.
They've been shot.
There are bloodstains on the ground.
Understood.
See that no one touches anything.
It will be quite complicated, that. "I can imagine."
"At least take a couple of pictures and come over here."
Understood.

The a... the cutlass and the gun!
Were they valuables?
They were found inside the Submarine Palau.
They were Anne Bonny's cutlass and Mary Read's pistol.
Do not suffer!
From now on, I'm taking over the case!
Hip!
Mm?
Mouri, your cheeks are red.
Ah, no, it's just that... when I saw you all gathered here,
I was embarrassed.
Kogoro Mouri!
You are under arrest!
For leaving without paying,
stealing a bicycle and driving drunk and speeding.
What?
What?!
Aaaah!
"Shame on you..."
Is... is it true, all of this? Yes.
He left a bar without paying
and stole Mr. Iwanaga's bicycle.
-The mistress told me. I didn't steal anything!
I let Mr. Iwanaga get on the bike behind me!
Didn't I?
Didn't I?
Yes... yes...
Ah!
By the way, Mr. Inspector.
The result of the fingerprints has arrived.
Oh, my goodness!
Is this true?
Mitsushi Matsumoto.
He's wanted for stealing valuable works of art
from museums and ruins around the world, and for murder.
-God-have-do! -What a pearl!
An international search and seizure warrant?
They're after treasure, then.
Anne and Mary's.
A treasure, you say?
What's another treasure,
apart from the gun and cutlass they've taken?
Yes... The Anne Bonny and Mary Read were female pirates.
They are real characters who lived 300 years ago,
and legend has it that they hid their treasure here, on the island of Komi.
-And this treasure really exists? -Yes.
The pistol and the cutlass they stole prove it.
Mr. Mouri, didn't you go to a bar with a beautiful mistress?
There was nothing pretty about the landlady.
She was an ordinary woman.
He's got me all tangled up, this guy!
"I thought so."
He's got something on his shirt.
What's that?
What's that?
"I get it!"
How to get off the island?
There's a ferry, but it leaves in the afternoon.
Unless they try to escape by boat.
Good.
Tell all the fishermen to keep an eye on the boats.
Yes!
I'm going to do it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What's with the handcuffs?
Aaaaah!
Inspector Megure.
This Matsumoto end I saw him a while ago.
It was at the Grotto dive store,
and I think he was giving money to the owner.
How? (Sato) Inspector Megure.
We just arrived.
(Sato) Thank you.
We got our work cut out for us, boys.
The owner of the Grotto did business with Matsumoto.
You two will go to the store.
We'll go to the hotel where she's staying in Matsumoto.
- (at the same time) Right away. Mr. Inspector!
The handcuffs!
(Genta) How does it look, the weather?
Well, it's pretty windy, but it's a nice day.
We can continue!
Let's enlarge the image.
(Shinichi voice) The tread doesn't match the tire.
This is not the bike we're looking for, doctor.
Conan! (Conan voice) Yes!
Conan, breakfast! I'm coming!
What are you looking at?
Looks like a GPS. A GPS?
What's it doing, on a bike?
Wow!
What's taking so long, Conan?
He'll be here soon, be patient.
Mi-te! Excuse me.
It's about time!
Are you flying to starve me to death, or what?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Eh!
And Mr. Mouri?
He had a meeting at city hall and he's out for the morning.
Mm-hm.
Molt bien!
We're all here, then.
-Bon appetit! - (all) Bon appetit!
This boy always has an empty belly.
Do you like it?
I'm hungry.....
I want more!
(all) Guys.
On your way to the bridge you met Mr. Iwanaga?
Mr. Iwanaga?
Ah, the one from the tourist office?
Yes.
-No, we were alone.
Oi? -Yes.
We were the only ones looking for the treasure.
Of course we were.
Are you missing anything or is there enough food? Yes, don't worry.
It's all very good.
By the way, are you going diving today?
No.
We've had enough, with yesterday's scare.
But..., as we won't have time tomorrow,
today we'll go out for a boat ride.
I advise you not to go sailing in the afternoon.
The sea will be rough.
Will the weather be bad in the end?
Then we should also hurry to find the treasure.
That's true.
We only have one clue left to solve.
Let's go out!
Oi, Conan?
Ah... It's just that... I have to go on an errand, me.
You have to go without me.
Ostres!
It doesn't matter.

If he doesn't know how to work as a team, I'd rather he didn't come.
We'll find the treasure without him and share it equally.
Let's go!
(Think) "To the other default bikes, from GPS."
(Woman) Mr. Iwanaga, here's the latest weather report.
(Woman) Oh.
What a mess!
Looks like a typhoon is coming.
Notify the fishermen's cooperative and the hotels, please.
-Yes, we're on duty!
At Matsumoto and the Izuyama they haven't returned to the hotel.
And there is no indication that they have left the island,
so they must be in hiding.
We know that at least one of them was hit by a bullet.
He will need medical assistance.
We have agents watching the clinic, but so far they have not seen them.
We have questioned the owner of the store.
Last night in Conan she saw...
how in Matsumoto she asked him to prepare a boat for her so she could run away.
I have already told you!
I have no idea where they are hiding, in Matsumoto and his partner.
The store is not enough for me to make a living.
That's why I accepted the money he offered me.
Although it will be my fault, in the end!
Understood.
The shell casings you collected in Takagi look pretty old.
As if they've been in storage for a long time.
We've asked the Friends of Hunting association
to identify the rifle.
(Door: knock) Come in.
May I come in?
We have received a call.
Mr. Mineo's rifle, the Friends of the Hunt, has disappeared.
Really? What do we know about Mr. Mineo?
Well... he's an elderly gentleman who lives alone.
He takes care of his niece, Chika Mabuchi,
the owner of the dive store.
I need you to talk to Mr. Mineo right away.
And bring Miss Mabuchi over here.
Understood.
Please retrieve the stolen cutlass and pistol.
I beg you! We'll do our best.
But... if they knew we were here,
why did they commit the robbery just now?
Good thinking.
Normally, Agent Uehira is alone.
They would have had a much easier time getting away.
Maybe because they were afraid
that we would discover his identity if they expected more.
By the way, what about the reinforcements from Tokyo?
The pressure is too low, they can't come by helicopter or boat.
Yeah...
We'll have to get our act together on our own.
We'll have to find Matsumoto and his partner,
plus the person who shot at them yesterday while they were running away.
Oh!
Mi-te!
-I've already found him! -Alive!
-The last clue was very easy.
Y-Yes!
"The souls of pirates go to heaven" could only refer to the watchtower.
(Mitsuhiko) "The clue is the numbers on the seals.
Come, go look for our treasure!"
The Chika has gone out to check the state of the sea.
-(Mitsuhiko) "She must wait for you.
I'm already here!
How serious.
Today it is too dangerous to go sailing.
-L'onatge is too fort.-What a pity!
We can not do anything.
What if we go to the beach, instead of going out to sea?
- (door, open) - (bell: tolls)
-Good morning, Mr. Uehira, good morning.
What a bad face you make!
What happened?
Chika, could you come here for a moment?
Inspector Megure wants to talk to you.
Excuse me.
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you think?
How is it that those two men stole the cutlass
and the pistol from the Tourist Museum?
If they are treasure hunters,
they must have intended to find the treasure.
The fact that they took such a risk to steal these weapons
must mean that they need them to find the hiding place of the treasure.
That is why I suspect
that right now they are on their way to the place where the treasure is hidden.
Do you know where you are?
Why are you asking me this very question?
Because I know that you... were a treasure hunter, right?
Even if it were true that I was a treasure hunter,
I don't know why you're insinuating that I know the hiding place of this treasure.
Because you told us so yourself.
Speaking of treasure hunters, the famous treasure really exists?
Hyenas don't go where there is no prey to hunt.
Although the one they will find is perhaps not what they imagine.
"What they will find is perhaps not what they imagine".
So you know perfectly well what it is, the famous treasure.
Come with me.

How come there are red numbers and blue numbers?
-What?
Ah..., yes.
There are two unknowns.
We must find out why there are different colored numbers
and what the numbers themselves correspond to.
(Mitsuhiko) They could be an address of some house on the island, right?
I've got it!
We'll ask Mr. Mima!
(Mitsuhiko) Wait!
How strange!
Why should the inspector want to talk to Chika?
It must be the case.
It must have been a misunderstanding.
-Wait for me inside. -Yes!
Load him this too, in the van.
What do you think you've done?
(Matsumoto) Get in the car!
If you don't want your little friend to get hurt.
Is it true he was a treasure hunter?
Yes, when I was young.
I came to the island to look for Anne and Mary's treasure,
and I stayed to live.
I fell in love and married, and became a fisherman.
This map is 300 years old.
Gee, that's funny!
The clue game is based on the map.
The Iwanaga, from the tourist office,
drew an exact replica of the ancient map
because no one has ever succeeded in deciphering the mystery.
Someone drew this map 300 years ago.
And that someone was precisely Anne Bonny.
-What? -Yes.
What's that supposed to mean?
That if we decipher the map we'll find the treasure?
-Yes, that's right. How cool!
300 years ago houses didn't have numbers.
They usually used the letters of the Latin alphabet.
Let's see, the letter that makes 5 is...
-Wait.
B, C, D, E... E! Yes!
The seventh is G.
And the dozen... A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M...
-The dozen is L. -L!
We continue.
We have them all.
Above, the red numbers.
Below, the blue ones.
All of them with the corresponding letter.
Now we just need to put them in order.
It looks like a name.
The first name would be in red and the last name in blue.
Very well seen.
Do you think it could be a reference to a pirate's name?
Yes, it's possible.
Look, guys!
If we order them like this, it looks exactly like a name!
Jolly, maybe?
"Jolly...?"
Hurry up, get going! Ah!
Hey! Iaaaah!
Iaaaaaaaaaah!
Freeze!
Ran!
I see we've run into an expert karateka.
Keep still, or your friend will be in danger.
Oh!
Our boat!
I don't get it.
What's she doing here?
We asked her in your head to leave her to us...
in exchange for money.
No..., it can't be...
We'll have to leave you here.
There's no gas cylinders for everyone.
Kimiko! (Izuyama) Stop!
Don't take another step!
Get in the boat, hurry!
Oh, my gosh!
I always have a hard time with these things...
Let's see, how about this?
-Y... What do you mean? -No, GRROE doesn't sound right.
Jolly Grroe? No.
Roger.
Jolly Roger.
-Jolly Roger? -And who was he, this one?
A famous pirate, maybe?
If we translate it, it means "Jolly Roger".
In fact, the Jolly Roger...
was something that the sailors of the 18th century
didn't want to see anywhere near.
The name comes from "jolie rouge," meaning "red flag."
and "old Roger," the devil's nickname.
-Flag? -The devil?
Yes.
The Jolly Roger is drawn on the map.
It's the pirate flag.
You know everything, Conan!
You've figured it out! Mm-hm.
What's this?
A drawing made by a sailor who passed by this island
aboard a Spanish ship some 300 years ago.
Soon after, the island sank into the sea.
They say it was because of a methane gas explosion.
(Iwanaga) "They say there used to be more surface area.
"Of Yorioya Island out of the water,
"But about 300 years ago an earthquake sank part of it.
and was left with this shape."
(Mitsuhiko) "Yorioya Island?"
Is it there, where the treasure is? Yes, probably.
But we are still missing something.
A clue that tells us the exact location of the hideout.
-What have you got, Conan? -You've already found it?
Look at the pirate flag.
The teeth of the skull.
Doesn't it look like letters?
They do!
They look like capital letters.
On the top teeth it says: D, O, S.
And on the lower ones: D, E, O, S, A, S.
-What does this mean? - (Haibara) "Two goddesses".
"Two goddesses" means "two goddesses" in Spanish.

How strong! -You're super smart, Haibara!
We've got it, then.
We should get to the island.
But... those men were looking for the treasure at the bottom of the sea, weren't they?
What does that mean?
That it's hidden at the bottom of the sea?
No.
If it were underwater, some clue would tell us.
Poseidon, the king of the sea, is a male god.
I imagine that pair must have found another entrance.
What's that?
The entrance to the Two Goddesses
was blocked by an earthquake years ago.
No adult could get through there.
They found another way in!
That's why they risked stealing the gun and the cutlass,
even though they knew the island was full of police.
(Door, open)
-The girl in the tent! (Door, open) -Oh!
What happened?
-Where is she, Mr. Mouri? -He's not here now.
-He's gone to the town hall. They've taken the Ran and the Sonoko.
-What?! - By boat.
Who did it?
Who took them away?
By... Matsumoto.
The treasure hunters.
They're on their way!
On the island of Yorioya!
Go currents towards the town hall and notify Mr. Mouri.
-Okay! Yes!
Be very careful.
Yes.
Mr. Mima.
Don't you have a boat?
I need you to accompany me to the island.
What are you talking about? I don't care about the treasure.
I want to rescue the Ran and the Sonoko.
(Agasa) Shinichi...
I mean, Conan.
The children told me they've kidnapped the girls.
Yes.
I know you'll want to go rescue them, whatever he says.
Wait a moment, I have to give you something.
(MIMA) Go get the boat ready, I'll be right back.
Understood.
Take this with you.
They are mini air pumps.
When you activate them, you'll have oxygen for about 10 minutes.
Unfortunately I only have two.
Have them used as a last resort.
(Shinichi voice) Thank you very much, doctor.
You two will have to share a cylinder.
But he doesn't need us for anything now!
Oh, of course you do, you must help us with something else.
Make preparations!
(Thinking) "No way!"
Ah!
Ah! Sonoko!
It's your turn, Miss.
What do you want from us?
Don't worry, your turn will come soon, too.
What are you saying, now!
That those hooligans have kidnapped the girls?!
-And where did they take them? -To the treasure island, of course!
On the island of Yorioya.
Those two men have found the treasure hideout
and took them with them.
Prepare a boat!
We have to go rescue the girls!
R-right now.
I don't understand!
How come they've taken the girls hostage?
They'll make them more of a nuisance than to search for the treasure.
They have a good reason.
What's that?
Someone shot them last night and they are wounded.
The place where they want to make the dive to find the treasure
is where the sharks attacked them yesterday.
What?!
They want to use them as bait?
I think so.
They are there!
(thinks) "I knew it."
What now?
We don't have much time!
Let's go to the island of Yorioya! How!
I'll be able to enter through the gate of the Two Goddesses.
(thinks) "Oxygen!"
Come on, my-te-las!
You live!
Take the torch and come with us.
You don't know the way, do you?
If you stay here alone, it won't last long.
(Izuyama) Come on, hurry!
(Izuyama) Hey!
No need to push us!
Where are we?
It's not the first time we've come here.
But today, the treasure of Anne Bonny and Mary Read will be ours.
Stay here and don't be brave.
Following the path, a little further up,
there is a small chapel dedicated to the two goddesses.
The entrance is at the back! I would have gone!
We only have half an hour of margin.
If not, we will not be able to return.
All right, thanks!
I'll find the girls and bring them back safe and sound.
"Anne Bonny and Mary Read, right?"
"How strange! The driveway is big enough for an adult."
Last week's landslide left the road impassable.
"Sure. The earthquake widened the driveway."
No... they couldn't possibly have....
If they've gone to the trouble of taking it away,
I don't think they've done them any harm.
Anyway, last night in Matsumoto and his partner...
were shot a couple of times and wounded.

They must have thought that the smell of blood underwater would attract sharks.
(Kogoro) What are you saying?
That they needed them to use as shark bait.
Stop, Mr. Mouri!
Where are you going?
Let go of me!
I'm going to save my daughter!
No way, Mr. Mouri!
The weather is getting worse by the minute!
-Let go of me! -May I?
What do we do now, inspector?
We'll have to turn back.
We have no choice. (Trona)
(Trona)
Get in the house, boys.
It's dangerous to stay outside.
And now!
Here we are well protected.
In Conan, Ran and the Sonoko are in danger.
-Yes. -Oh, so much.
(Continues thundering)
(Sonoko) The water level has dropped.
There will be low tide.
Who wants to go through that...? You guessed it.
It's a shortcut to the treasure.
Come, take the cylinders and come.
So it was true, the story of the pirates!
(Sonoko) It looks like it.
Leave the bottles and come in.
-(Sonoko) What?
I just...-Hurry up!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Bones!
Bones!
Bones!
Ha!
Don't worry, there seems to be no danger today.
Eh?
It's gas.
The gas?
Depending on how the wind blows, the gas accumulates in this chamber.
That's why you made us go in first!
Why did you think we brought you all the way here?
Come on, get in.
Come down. It's here!
Already found!
Ha!
What an idiot!
This is what happens to you
if you try to open the door with the fake objects.
It's logical.
-You, open it. -Me?
I'll do it.
Ah!
Ran!
How come it doesn't work?
(knocking)
Stop it!
I get it!
I know why it won't open.
Have you figured it out?
Anne and Mary always fought back to back.
So..., they must get like this!
(Door: noise)
(Matsumoto: river)
(Izuyama) At last!
We've found it!
(Matsumoto: River) Eh?
Give me the torch.
(whistling in admiration)
-Fantastic! The treasure!
Where is the treasure?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Don't be impatient!
Ran.
What do we do now?
We could take the opportunity to flee,
but we have no oxygen and the low pressures won't let us surface.
You're right.
We'll have to wait here until they come looking for us.
This is it!
There's a draft!
The corridors are communicating!
(Matsumoto) Shit!
It's gone!
There's no treasure here!
(Izuyama) Not only is there no treasure, there's not even a single coin!
I don't know who it was,
but someone got in before us and took everything.
This is not what we agreed!
I followed you because you promised me a mountain of treasures!
Shut up and don't burden me!
It's over.
We'd better play the deuce as soon as possible.
Yes.
But first we'll have to get rid of what no longer serves us.
I'm sorry about that.
This was your destiny from the beginning.
Don't come near me!
Ran, watch my back!
Be careful, Sonoko!
You'll die!
Watch out!
Oh, man!
She's really strong, this girl!
Ha!
She is strong, yes.
But no matter how strong she is, she can't do anything against us.
Always keep a bullet in the chamber.
Girls, get down!
Are you all right?
Ran, Sonoko?
(Sonoko) You've come at just the right time!
But how did you know we were here?
There is another access to the island of Yorioya.
So does it really exist, the treasure of the pirate women?
No, they have not found, of treasure.
They say that someone has passed here before
and took everything that was there.
That you felt it?
Too bad, isn't it?
You can come out now, don't hide.
You followed me here on the sly, didn't you?
Mr. Inspector, even if we can't get out with the boat?
The wind seems to have died down a bit, right?
Mr. Mouri...
According to all the forecasts,
the sea conditions won't improve until tomorrow at dawn.
But... but look, the wind is not blowing as hard as before!
Try to calm down, please.
How can I be calm, eh?!
My daughter has been kidnapped!
And I have to trust that the little quatreulls boy will rescue her
while we're sitting here with our arms crossed.
waiting for the rain to stop!
Stop it!
I understand you perfectly,

but we can't go anywhere until the storm has really died down.
As soon as the wind eases, we'll go get the Ran and the Sonoko.
Be patient.
Damn it!
You can come out now, don't hide.
You followed me here on the sly, didn't you, Mr. Iwanaga?
(Footsteps: approaching)
And... and now!
Put like that, it sounds like a bad thing.
I just wanted to... help you rescue the girls.
Then how come you brought a rifle?
Because... they were wanted criminals all over the world, weren't they?
This rifle... isn't it what Mr. Mineo lost?
What? No, and now!
No, and now!
You brought it because you were afraid that they would take the treasure, right?
I didn't come for treasure!
Mr. Iwanaga.
When you gave us the map,
you told us that you had invented the clue game.
Yes...
Well... I've seen the same numbers at Mr. Mima's house.
Specifically, on the treasure map...
that Anne Bonny drew 300 years ago.
So you knew the map because you'd seen it before, right?
You couldn't figure out the clue to the hiding place...
and wanted the tourists to solve the mystery.
Come to think of it, you tried to convince the father...
to help the kids look for the treasure...
If a famous detective helped the kids, they were much more likely to end up solving the mystery..,
they were much more likely to end up solving the riddle.
In addition, to keep track of the tourists who participated in the game,
installed a GPS on the rental bikes.
I-I did it so as not to endanger the tourists!
When you assign the corresponding letter to the numbers that appear on the map,
you read "Jolly Roger", the pirate flag.
Before the earthquake of the sinking,
the island of Yorioya was shaped like a skull.
That is why the Anne Bonny left this clue.
Perhaps even the name of the island of Yorioya
is a variant of Jolly Roger, don't you find?
If I am not mistaken, you had also arrived, up to here.
But "Jolly Roger" has yet another meaning.
What do you mean?
On the real treasure map there is a Jolly Roger,
a pirate flag.
In the teeth of the skull is where the second clue was hidden.
"Two Goddesses", a clue that refers to two goddesses.
Co... Conan!
Yes!
If you followed me here, you must have seen it too.
The shrine dedicated to the two goddesses,
which indicates the entrance to the treasure hideout.
Yes... of course.
And how do you know all this?
Wow!
I was wrong from the beginning, then!
Who tampered with the neoprene vest
and shot at the treasure hunters with a stolen rifle
it was you too, wasn't it?
In the backyard of the Grotto
and in the place where the bullet casings were found,
I found the ruts from your bicycle.
He-he... I've made mistakes that even a little kid has seen.
It wasn't a little boy.
What?
What?
It was Mr. Mouri.
In fact, he explained everything to me before he came.
And he told me that Mr. Iwanaga's clothes smelled like gunpowder.
Since he used an antique rifle,
gunpowder residue must have stuck to his clothes when he fired.
Of course, now I understand.
In Kogoro Mouri has well earned his reputation.
(rumbling)
U... an earthquake?
(rumbling) Oh.
It's already happened.
(rumbling) Ah!
We're in danger here, we touched two!
Yes.
And we have to take out that pair.
Yes!
Help us, Mr. Iwanaga! Yes!
The exit!
What now?
The exit is blocked!
It's gas!
We enter the ship, hurry!
(Thinking) "What a mess! If this keeps up..."
Conan.
Can you think of anything?
For the moment, take this pair in the cabin...
and connect them to the canisters, just in case.
Because don't inhale the gas.
You two can use this to breathe.
Huh?
What are these?
Some mini-canisters that Dr. Agasa has invented.
What about you, Conan? Don't worry, I've got another one.
Ah.
Oh! Oh...
"What now? The gas is coming in too fast..."
"The gas?"
"This gas must be methane."
"It's building up on the roof of the cave."
"If I could use..."
"I need... I need something to..."
"There!"
I need you to listen to me very carefully.
It's very important, girls.
The sea water is coming into the cave,
and that means the walls aren't thick.

Therefore, if we blow up the gas and break the roof, the ship will be able to....
What?
Don't... don't tell me you want to go up to the surface with the ship!
You mean it will be all right? I can't know.
What is clear to me is that, if we do nothing,
we'll die of gas poisoning or drown underwater.
We have to try.
We don't lose anything by trying.
Yes.
How do you plan to do it, Conan?
When I'm ready, you throw that piece of chain up high...
and I'll slam it against the ceiling.
If it works, it'll set off a spark that'll explode the gas.
You guys will stay in the cockpit
and breathe with the oxygen cylinders.
The explosion will probably
will consume all the air in the cave at once.
And you, Conan? Don't worry!
When I've fired the chain, I'll enter the cabin with you.
Don't suffer for me.
Oh...
Understood.
Mr. Inspector...
Prepare the boat!
Let's go to the rescue!
Yes!
We have everything ready, Conan!
Let's go, let's go.
"I'm drowning!"
Conan.
Conan!
Hang on, Conan!
"Ran!"
Hurry, hurry!
We have to go faster!
Oh, my gosh!
A... a pirate ship?
Ran!
Are you all right, Ran? I'm fine, Father!
Saved!
Get out of here!
Watch out! Jump in the water!
Sonoko!
Eager! Yes!
So what?
Have you found it, the treasure? No.
There was only a ramshackle pirate ship.
Do not you think it was this, the treasure?
I mean...
the map that Anne Bonny drew wasn't a treasure map.
Maybe it was just a message she left
so that Mary Read could find it when she got out of prison.
A message?
Know that I am here!
And I will always wait for you, Shinichi.
Just kidding.
Sonoko!
You've gone too far this time, you smart-ass kid!
In fact, it could be that the nano wasn't entirely wrong.
It's very likely that Anne Bonny had built the boat
to make her dream come true:
reunite with the Mary when she escaped from prison
and the two of them would sail the seven seas together again.
But the Mary contracted a very serious illness
and died in prison.
Anne waited for her until the end of her days, and she also died.
"The ship was orphaned, buried in that underwater cave,
waiting for someone to free her so she could return to the sea."
And today, after 300 years,
he has helped her return to the surface
to make her first and last voyage.
Now she has followed in her captains footsteps and disappeared.
I don't usually get so sentimental,
don't hold it against me.
The fact is that 300 years have passed
and we can not know if all this is true.
(Think) "No. There is no doubt that the Anne waited for the Mary, Kogoro."
"It proves it that there is drawn
under the skull of the pirate flag."
"Anne and Mary's gun and cutlass."

(Tuuut)
Ran.
What's that?
Can I ask you something?
"At the time you left me your minibomb,"
how did you know I didn't have one?
Because you're just fine... like him.

One day, a couple of years ago,
we had just come home from school and it suddenly started raining.
I'm on glue...
Here, take the meu.
Eh?
You're in a hurry to get home, aren't you?
Yes, thanks.
What about you, Shinichi?
I'm a detective, in case you didn't know.
I figured out that an unexpected downpour was going to fall
so I grabbed a spare umbrella.
Really?
Wow, that's great!
I'm meeting my mother.
I'm going, I'm late!
I'll bring it back tomorrow! Yes!
"But Shinichi didn't have another umbrella."
He came home soaked from head to toe and got cold.
That's why at the time I thought you were identical.
You can see it coming a mile away, with this silly face.
"On top of that, he calls me a fool..."
