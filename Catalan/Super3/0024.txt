DETECTIVE CONAN
The mystery of the beautiful amnesiac
(Mermaids)
"The brilliant efforts of the famous detective Kogoro Mouri
resulted in the arrest of Hitoshi Yuda,
who escaped from Musashino Prison last night."
"Yuda had planned the murder of his wife Keiko
to collect life insurance."
"But Mr. Mouri's investigation proved that he was guilty."
Are you calm, father?
What do you mean?
Man, I'd be afraid he'd want revenge.
Revenge?
Yes, don't you remember?
You'll pay for it, you'll see.
Keep in mind, Kogoro Mouri!
He said it, don't you remember?
Don't worry, don't worry about anything.
Imagine he comes looking for you.
What are you going, then?
(Think) "He should be looking for me, and not Kogoro."
(Kogoro voice) According to my investigations, it's you, the murderer.
Confess!
He has escaped from prison.
He wouldn't risk getting caught.
He must have left the country.
I hope you're right.
Anyway, I'm going to try my luck.
I'm coming with you.
Eh?
Where do you want to go?
Come on, Conan.
To do what?
Well, to protect my father, obviously!
(Shouts of encouragement)
All right, come on, I'm waiting for you.
(thinks) "What patience!"
"Why does he want to come to places like this, this man. Eh?"
(Adult voice) What are you looking at, this one?
He's not looking at the race...
Come on, go, go!
Go, go, go!
It flies like the wind!
Look at Kogoro!
What if this guy was...!
Where is he? Where is he?
What a disaster of a day!
Going with the boy has brought me bad luck!
(Think) "What a face he has."
Oh!
Maybe I'm lucky again.
My luck has definitely deserted me.
(Thinks) "Wow! What muscles she has, this girl!"
Despite the fall, she hasn't sustained any serious injuries?
No, she just has a problem that she will have to deal with.
Although she is physically normal, she only remembers her name: Maya.
What? What?
You mean...... that she suffers from amnesia?
More specifically, it's a case of reversible amnesia...
a partial loss of memory.
Was it the result of the fall on the stairs?
(Thinking) "No, I don't think so. It must have occurred before."
"But where was it?"
-Will he recover, doctor?
-Of course he will.
But we don't know if it will be tomorrow, in a month or in 3 years.
It is terrible!
Well, I, Kogoro Mouri, I stake my reputation as a great detective
that I will get him back on his feet!
(Thinking) "What does this have to do, this, with being a detective?"
Hello, Miss Maya.
What, you're better now?
I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri.
I picked her up when she fell.
You're a detective?
Miss, you don't panic and concentrate.
Can you remember where you were when you lost your memory?
Please make a little effort.
I don't think she came from far away, in that state.
Well, I deduce that he must have lost his memory near where he fell.
Are you sure you don't remember anything at all?
Excuse me, but you have a very muscular body.
Maybe he was coming out of a gym.
A gym?
Yeah... he's got a fantastic physique.
Yes, I'm sure he must be into bodybuilding or weight lifting.
He plays sports, that's for sure!
(thinks) "He has a scar at the base of his finger."
"What can he do, that he got a scar here?"
Does he do things with wires or something?
Eh ?!
I don't... I don't...
What happened? What's wrong?
I'm in pain!
My head hurts.
It's the only one I remember!
Help me!
Look what has happened, because of your talk!
Now that...
...I seem to be getting my luck back.

You are getting very involved.
Will you make it?
You told her you'd help her get her memory back.
Well, I have no idea.
Ai, sir.
Did you take them from the hospital, these things, Mr. Kogoro?
Yes... it's the only one I had on me.
(thinks) "A piece of a jigsaw puzzle
and a page from a book."
"The Gospel according to St. Matthew, chapter 5, verse 3."
Isn't that a page from a Bible? From a Bible?
Yes, you're right, Conan!
This must mean...
that this girl is a believer...
Tearing a Bible, if she were a believer?
No, of course, it's unthinkable.
This means that...
That she used it to write something down.
To write something down, is there anything? There are some marks.
You're right, Conan.
Yes, he must have written something to the previous page
and he was also supposed to tear this one up?
Look, 9, 13.
Gee, look, it says "last supper" here.
Maybe it was a dinner date.
Yes, this must be it.
But then with whom?
I don't know.
Who knows?
Who would she have met?
(thinks) "Where should I write this?"
"To discover his identity, we should start there."
"A place where there might be Bibles to take notes."
"No, a place where there's a Bible handy..."
"He jots something down and tears it up."
"A hotel!"
Aren't there Bibles in hotel rooms?
Eh?
A hotel?
This is a very fine paper.
It's very soft, it's a good paper.
Yes, it is!
It must be from an upscale hotel!
This reduces the odds a lot.
You're right!
There aren't that many either!
Let's make a round of the good hotels!
Eh ?!
You also want to come, you?
What do you mean?
Ah, nothing...
Are you sure you are well?
Yes, the doctor has given me permission.
I'm not asking you, father.
Don't suffer for me, I'm fine.
The most important thing is to know who I am.
I have to recover my memory.
They must help me.
Lord, help me!
You let me do it.
According to my theory,
this leaf came out of a Bible from a high-class hotel!
It won't take long to find the hotel where it was.
(Think) "If only it were that simple..."
Come on, guys!
We'll start with the Mount View Hotel!
Hurry up, if you don't want to be left here!
This... Excuse me.
Is she staying at your hotel, this lady?
Is she?
She's a client of the hotel, this lady?
Ring any bells, this lady?
It's the hotel that makes 12... I'm so tired.
Good morning, Miss Tachibana.
Welcome to the hotel.
Eh?! Eh?!
You know her, are you sure?
Yes, this lady is a guest of our hotel.
We know that Maya Tachibana has been staying here for two days.
Maya, we made it!
That's it!
We've already taken care of it.
Oh!
Ay-ay-ay!
As a salary!
I'll look into it.
Play two, big guys!
There's nothing that can give us any more clues.
Miss, don't you remember anything?
What a pity...
We can't know who he is
because the address and phone number on the hotel register are false,
but on the other hand, we know he's staying here.
I don't get it.
Maybe not even the name, it's not real.
I don't know who I am...
What's your problem, with the pendant?
Aaaaaaaah!
I have a splitting headache!
I can't take it anymore!
Maya! Maya!
Don't go away!
Careful, Maya!
It's that man!
Get out of the way!
(Think) "Why is he chasing Maya, the man from the racetrack?"
Are you all right, Father?
Are you all right?
What's happened?
What has he done, this car?!
I understand everything now.
Miss Maya, someone is after you.
The amnesia was caused by the shock of the aggression.
I'm sure of it.
Where is she, Conan?
"This neighborhood is full of one-way streets and dead ends!"
"Maybe I'll catch up with him!"
"But the look of the Maya, like one who chases his prey!"
"And his reaction so fast! Who could it be?"
"Shit, I've lost him." (Sirens)
Out, out.
Move along, move along.
Come on, move along.
Hey, hey, Mr. Policeman, what happened?
Go, child, get out of here, it's dangerous.

What time did it happen, the accident? Three hours ago, and now get out of the way.
(Think) "Three hours ago..."
"The overpass where we found her 3 hours ago...
is near Beika stop number 5 and the hotel."
"Sure! It could be...
that she got on the bus in front of the hotel,
"and that she went with the crashed bus,
and that the collision caused his amnesia."
"He went over the pedestrian bridge..."
Bus... truck... we have collided...
Yeah, I remember... I remember, I remember, I remember.
Very good, Conan.
You guessed it! It was by chance.
Why did she leave without being seen by a doctor?
I'm not sure, but maybe because she was being chased by that man.
And even if she lost her memory
she acted instinctively to run away from danger?
Why don't we get on the bus?
Good idea, Ran!
Maybe then Miss Maya will remember where she would have gone.
It's no use.
Don't you remember anything?
Make an effort!
Don't be in a hurry, you've already remembered something.
(Thinking) "With so many people getting on and off the bus,
it's hard for anyone to remember it."
I think it was here.
I wanted to get off here.
We have to go for a walk around here.
Watch out!
(thinks) "Maya?"
"This pair... What if they were..."
"He had a hidden wire, in here?!"
What did he want, this asshole, to kill us?
I'm going to look for him!
Father, come back!
"I'd say he's not after the Maya, not after the Ran and not after me."
"He wants to charge into Kogoro!"
Ran, stay with her, I'm going to look in Kogoro!
Hey, wait!
Come back!
I have a headache.
Aren't you feeling well?
You should stretch.
Come here!
"If it lags behind Kogoro, it must be..."
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
La Maya, she's gone.
But what are you doing here?
Can't you see?
Ran, help us!
Salvats.
Salvats.
This is terrible, guys!
The Maya has disappeared!
What?! What?
I'm sorry, I just took my eye off her for a moment.
What if that man had taken her?
(thinks) "It's very unlikely. I don't think that's how it went."
She must have recovered her memory?
In any case, we have to find her.
Go over there.
All right, let's go, Conan!
Come on, Conan!
That woman has ruined everything!
Now I have to go back to... eh ?!
Mmm, so this was it, my target.
It's too late!
I wanted to see Detective Kogoro die a miserable death!
I don't want anyone to bother me, anyone.
Oh... Maya!
I remember everything, sir.
That man is in a ship here.
It's here. New Avinguda corner 13?
What if the numbers in the Bible corresponded to an address?
What?!
So this means...
Of course it does!
The last supper referred to this place, right, Conan?
It's in Yuda.
It was him again!
The target in Yuda was the father?
Look, the last supper.
That piece was for this puzzle!
That means he must have already passed this way.
Who is she, this woman?
What's her relationship to him?
What is this doing here?
(Think) "The piece of the puzzle was the key
to access Kogoro's file."
"She was coming to get it."
Now I get it!
Ran, call the police, quick!
Where are you going, Conan?
But Maya, how did you know where this guy was hiding?
(Think) "In Yuda and Maya knew each other."
"But who should it be, she?"
(Yuda) You'll pay me.
Keep well in mind!
"That muscular body she has, and those fast movements,
and that she took the bus because she couldn't be followed..."
"It's all so well planned, she could be a pro."
"Surely in Yuda he hired her to kill Kogoro!"
Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Adult voice) I swear en Kogoro has gone this way!
Miss, you've regained your memory
when in Yuda you threw that cement block in the street.
That's right!
I got my memory back thanks to en Yuda!
At the hospital, you should have realized that you are a murderer
who uses a retractable cable to kill.
You are very clever to have deduced only these things.
Who are you?
In Conan Edogawa, a detective.
A detective?
Father!

Father!
Are you all right, Father? What happened?
It seems to me that this time I have failed?
(Tune from "Step by step")
DETECTIVE CONAN
It seems to me that both Yuda and I have missed the target.
Oi, dear detective?
What did he say? Did he say something?
Aaa... no.
He said that only the great Kogoro can capture in Yuda twice.
Lucky again, eh?
What's up, nano?
Well, next race I'll be golden!
Describe me the kidnapping with all the details.
I do not want to believe that the Naoko... It can not be, that!
You have a reputation as a scoundrel!
You sure have a lot of enemies, don't you?
I'm not just saying that because I want your filthy money!
Ran, come on!
(Adult voice) He's not satisfied, even if he just wants revenge.
Next episode, fake money in a kidnapping case!
