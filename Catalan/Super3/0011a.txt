DETECTIVE CONAN
The murder case of the "Moonlight" sonata.
How unlucky.
Everyone saw the cherry blossoms,
and the very famous Kogoro goes to work on an island of misfortune.
All because of that letter.
"Next full moon night,
the shadows will begin to disappear from Moonlight Island."
"Please investigate. Keiji Aso." (Phone)
Detective Mouri, please say?
(Male) It's two days before the full moon.
You have the 500,000 yen fee on your account.
-Hey, who are you? -Envelope, come on.
Keiji Aso, from Moonlight Island.
Just a moment!
Hey, listen to me!
Damn, what a selfish customer.
I find it okay,
relaxing on an islet off the coast of Izu, right, Conan?
(Man) Keiji... Aso?
There is no person by that name here.
Please look again.
He sent me a letter and I'd like to...
You're not on the list of residents, sir.
I've only been living on the island a short time and I don't know everyone.
-What's the problem? -Supervisor...
This man has been hired by a resident of the island...
Who hired him?
-Yes, a man by the name of Keiji Aso. What?!
He said... he said Keiji Aso!?
-Did you hear him? -It can't be.
And now!
-What does he say, this one? -It's impossible.
It can't be.
It can't be because he died... 12 years ago.
What?!? What?
(Supervisor) "He's a famous pianist, he was from our island."
(Supervisor) "A full moon night 12 years ago,
"He had been back on the island for a few days,
and he did a concert at the community center."
"And then, all of a sudden,
he locked the family at home and set fire."
"He's going to stab his wife and daughter with a knife....
and they say he played the piano amidst the flames,
as if possessed by the devil."
"He played Beethoven's 'Moonlight' sonata."
Mmm... A letter from a dead man... that's a joke in very bad taste.
Maybe it's not a joke.
Considering they've deposited the fee for you,
there's probably someone who wants me to look into Keiji Aso.
If we ask the mayor of the town who were Mr. Aso's friends,
maybe we'll find out something.
You are right.
The village mayor is the community center, right?
Kenta, pretty, above all don't be unhappy, okay?
Do not suffer.
Good bye.
Good bye. Good bye.
Miss... excuse me...
Where is it, the community center?
Ah, yes... break the next corner,
and go to the end of the street.
Are you coming from Tokyo? Yes, we just arrived.
I used to live here too, in Tokyo, a while ago.
But this island is beautiful, and so different...
And it's so quiet.
(Loud speaker) "Shimizu, Masato Shimizu."
"Protect the fishing industry..."
Well, maybe not so much,
now that the municipal elections are coming up.
Eh?
Municipal elections?
The candidates are Mr. Shimizu, who represents the fishermen.
The current mayor, Mr. Kuroiwa, who has lost popularity,
and the richest man on the island, Mr. Kawashima.
According to my patients, Kawashima has...
Ah, listen, nurse...
we are not interested in anything, the municipal elections.
I am Dr. Narumi Asai!
And I have a medical degree.
Oh, she's a doctor.
At the community center you will find these men.
Tonight they are holding a memorial
for the third anniversary of the death of the former mayor, Mr. Kameyama.
The third anniversary of the death...... of the former mayor?
(Man) Do not let the mayor exploit us!
(People) Don't let the current mayor exploit us!
My goodness, it's the memorial of the former mayor of the town,
and this group here!
I swear!
They are annoying!
Hirata!
What are they doing here?
Shut up!
Yes.
Yes, Miss Kuriowa.

Hey, aren't you worried?
Why, Shuichi?
For the election.
They say your father has little chance.
That's true.
The vast majority of villagers will vote for me.
That's only because you know how to handle money!
I learned from you.
There are some people who want to see the mayor.
Who are they?
Just today...
-He's a detective from Tòquio. -What!?
A detective?
And now... How long are you going to make me wait?
Where is it, Conan?
A piano!
Hey!
Conan, don't touch anything.
Let's see what's this?
What a big room!
Gee, the back of the center overlooks the sea.
What a dirty piano.
Why don't you clean it up a bit?
No!
Don't touch it!
It's the piano...
that Mr. Aso played at the concert the day he died.
-It's cursed. What do you say now?
Damn, the piano?
It's not only him...
The same thing happened to the ex-mayor.
You mean, Mr. Kameyama, the honoree of today's memorial?
Yes... it happened 3 years ago.
"One full moon night...
I was passing by the side of the center and heard the sound of the piano."
"But, theoretically there was no one, downtown."
"I called out in case there was someone, and the sound stopped."
"I entered the room and found Mr. Kameyama."
"He had died of a heart attack."
"He was playing the piece that Mr. Aso played amidst the flames."
"That sonata, 'Moonlight'!"
Because of all this, since that day,
everyone says the piano is cursed.
Stop it, Conan!
There's nothing wrong with this piano.
Please wait at the entrance until the memorial is over!
Hello, but are you all around here?
Dr. Asai, which memorial?
Yes, Mr. Kameyama was the first person I visited when I came to this island.
when I came to this island.
Ah, Mr. Shimizu.
I found it on my way here.
Hello, my name is Shimizu, I'm very happy to meet you.
Hey, Kawashima...
you hired this detective to check up on me, didn't you?
You fool.
What are you running away now?
I'm going to the bathroom.
(Think) "How strange."
(Adult voice) "They say no one plays the piano, and instead it sounds good."
"Someone is secretly tuning it for some reason we don't know."
"And... what the hell must it mean, that letter?"
(Piano: "Moonlight")
This melody... #

The sonata!
I'm going. #
Conan! #
-The cursed music! -The piano plays again. #
Oooooh! #
-Look!
Another dead one! -Oooooooh!
(Kogoro) It's Mr. Kawashima! #
(Think) We're too late! #
It's death. #
But what happened?! #
Ran, come on, quick, call the island police! #
Dr. Asai... examini'l, please. #
Yes! #
(Adult voice) "The letter predicted #
that on the night of the full moon a murder would be committed! "#
The curse!
It's the curse of the piano! #
Ha!
What curse!? #
Look, the cursed music comes from this cassette. #
This is just like the previous deaths.
And it's obviously a case of premeditated murder.
What ?!
Murder?!
On what basis do you say that?
Who the hell are you?
Well, I'm a famous Tokyo detective...
Kogoro Mouri!
That famous astronaut?
It's what's in those mystery novels.
-That's what Akers says! -Well, who the fuck is he?
(thinks) "Seawater."
It's got to be 30 minutes to an hour since he died.
Most likely cause is drowning.
It looks like he drowned.
He's drowned.
But let's make sure with the autopsy.
Dr. Asai is right.
See this coat in the water?
It must be Mr. Kawashima's.
There are indications that she was dragged
from the door leading to the sea to the piano.
And now, look at this:
the door and windows were closed,
and there's a piece of the tape that's blank.
How do you know all that?
The murderer must have taken her out to the sea during the ceremony
and drowned her, dragged her body out here,
started the cassette and came out in the lobby.
Isn't that right, Kogoro?
Ah, yes... yes, yes, and so much.
If the door of this room was closed,
and we didn't move from the entrance,

the assassin must have returned to his seat during the ceremony.
Wait a moment!
Are you insinuating that the murderer is still here, among us?
Yes!
He is among you!
Did anyone see Mr. Kawashima get up, during the ceremony?
Yes, I saw him leave.
He said he was going to the toilet.
Did anyone see if he lifted anyone else?
It's impossible to remember all the entrances and exits.
Well, do you know if anyone had a grudge against Mr. Kawashima?
Not exactly a grudge,
but the one who benefited the most from his death is Mr. Shimizu,
who's also running for mayor.
What?
Mr. Kuroiwa, here's to you too!
You are right.
It means that the father is sure to win.
As long as someone didn't cheat to swing the vote to him...
-What do you say? -Miss Kuroiwa!
Come on, calm down.
But why did the murderer bring the body to this room?
To blame the murder on the curse of the piano.
How long has this piano been here?
Since Mr. Aso gave it the center 15 years ago.
Ah, so it was Mr. Aso...
Yes, there's his name engraved on the lid.
Mmm...
What is this?
This is...
It's sheet music.
It wasn't here, this afternoon.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
And who is this?
It's Mr. Nishimoto.
They say he was loaded with money
and that he was fond of wine, women and gambling.
But after the death of the former mayor,
he seems to be afraid of something, and he never comes out.
It seems to me that he and the former mayor were close friends.
Eh?
(laughs) It's true.
The police, stop.
Ran, you took so long.
It's just that I had to look for him all over town.
Let's see, who is it, what I wanted to see?
It's him.
Kogoro Mouri is a...
-Ah!
He's that famous... -Yes!
...astronaut, right?
You've got the wrong person.
(Kogoro) It's late tonight.
We'll start the interrogation tomorrow morning.
Why are you talking about murder?
It's Mr. Aso's curse.
(Kogoro) You're right.
Why haven't they burned it, this sinister piano?
Hm.
You're right, you're right.
Maybe it would be better to make it disappear quickly, this piano.
Shuichi?
I've been very stopped by Conan's deductions.
He likes to play detective.
Everyone said his deductions were so convincing.
Because I try to imitate Mr. Kogoro.
I always watch how he works...
Compared to me, this boy is a peewee.
Miss, we'll be leaving for our inn.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Please, sir, solve this case soon.
I don't want to examine any more corpses.
It'll be solved soon, now that I'm taking care of myself...
(Thinking) "What an ass..."
"This case has a lot of added complications."
"Wait a minute!"
"Now I remember, the letter said..."
will begin to disappear."
"This is not over yet."
(Kogoro) What!?
There will be more killing!
Conan, are you implying that this letter predicts it?
"The shadow will disappear" means that clarity will absorb it.
"Clarity" refers to the sonata "Moonlight".
(Kogoro) The piece that Mr. Aso was playing during the fire
and the piece played by the mayor of the town when he died.
Beethoven's "Moonlight" sonata.
And all 3 deaths have been related to a piano!
Go to the inn, quick!
Just a moment!
Ran, let's go, too.
Come on, let's go to the center!
Where has it been seen, spending the night with the corpse and, moreover, with a child?
What a joke, girl.
I told you to go to the hostel.
But Conan said...
Let him say what he wants.
And who moved the body?
It was me.
It hurt me that the victim was in that position.
Well, too bad, because we hadn't finished.
Wow, the score is missing!
What are you saying?!
Ah... I didn't want it to go astray...
I have it.
I'm an old man...
Eh?
The score of the sonata! What?
The "Moonlight Sonata"?
(Piano: "Moonlight")
(Piano: "Moonlight") Ah!
What are you doing?
How badly you play!
There's a mistake in the fourth bar of this score.
In the fourth measure? It could be that it's...
...Mr. Kawashima's last message!

It could be that the murderer came looking for her...
Hello...
The people at the inn told me I could find you here.
Dr. Asai!
I'll bring you some food.
Come to think of it... I'm really hungry.
Thank you very much.
That's not how you were born here, Dr. Asai.
No, I spend my weekends in Tokyo.
I've always looked forward to working on a small island like this,
surrounded by nature and quiet.
I've been here for two years now.
Dr. Asai...
Mr. Kameyama, the former mayor who died three years ago..,
died of a heart attack?
(Asai) Yes, he had a bad heart for a long time.
But he had... an unhinged expression,
as if he had seen something dreadful.
Did you notice anything else, Dr. Asai?
Let's see...
Oh, come to think of it... Yes, I think there was a window open.
It seems to me that there was a window open.
I think they said someone forgot to close it.
Which window was it?
I remember.
It was this window.
Who's there? Who's there?
Quiet!
We won't let you run away!
Shit, we've lost her.
That's what I figured.
This one was coming to get the score.
(Kogoro) Very well!
Tonight, we'll have to stand guard.
Hey, Mouri... Mouri!
It's already afternoon.
Ins-Inspector Megure, what are you doing here?
This island is part of the Tokyo metropolitan area.
Of course it is...
If you're looking for the score, Conan gave it to me.
I have been informed of all the details.
These 3 have been awake until we arrived.
The only thing sleeping is you and this old man.
We're doing research at the town hall, and I want you to come help.
And so much.
I don't think it was necessary for us to have slept there.
Father, how are you?
You know who it is, the murderer?
Don't be silly,
all 38 people at the ceremony are suspects.
It won't be easy to find out.
Hey... and when is it my turn?
I know you're tired, but you're the last one.
Then I'll go wash my face.
Mr. Kogoro, listen, how many people do you have to interrogate?
Well, the ones you have to interrogate are...
Dr. Asai, Reiko Kuroiwa, who is the daughter of the mayor,
and her boyfriend, in Shuichi Murasawa.
On Shimizu, the other candidate.
On Kazuaki Hirata, secretary.
And now they are interrogating on Ken Nishimoto.
So, there are 6 people, but they take a long time, with this guy.
He doesn't say anything.
I have a feeling he's the murderer!
Even if you believe about the cursed piano?
These rumors make these misfortunes happen!
But, Mr. Mayor...
-Destroy us!
Did you understand me, Hirata? -Yes, sir.
How can it be...
You want to leave me alone!?
What motive could I have, me, to kill Mr. Kawashima?!?
Reiko is getting hysterical.
She keeps shouting.
(She thinks) "That's funny, if he's already been questioned,
why doesn't he go home, Mr. Nishimoto?
Eh?"
Eh... I'm going to the washroom!
You didn't come in here, Mr. Nishimoto?
No.
Oh, my!
He went upstairs!
(Piano)
This music... #

It's the second movement of the sonata. #
Where does it come from, this music? #
(Think) From that room! #

Mr. Nishimoto! #

(Think) We're late. #
Oh!
Father!
Don't let anyone in! #
Get the lab boys down here now! #

The lab people have returned to Tokyo
to do the autopsy on Kawashima. #
Go.... and now what do we do?
If there's anything I can do to help... #
Dr. Asai.
But after that, it narrows down the number of suspects.
So the killer is someone from here.
Yes, because we had all the entrances very well guarded.
(Think) "Wow! Who is it, the murderer?! Who is it, the murderer?!"
