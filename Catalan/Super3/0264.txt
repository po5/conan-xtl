The water that flows has no form.
The wind that blows is not seen.
Cases, deductions, mean freedom.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is Detective Conan!

Thank you very much.
If it hadn't been for you... Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
They don't deserve it.
Mr. Okada, I wish you the best of luck in all that is to come.
Thank you.
-Shall we go, Terumitsu?
-Yes, sure.
See you again.
Yes.
Have a good one.
Mother!
What?
Have you won again?
I didn't win.
He's the one who won.
I just helped him.
Wow!
I made you wait a long time, didn't I?
A little bit.
To make up for it, Conan says you could buy us lunch.
I'm sorry about that.
Something came up and I have to go.
Don't worry, though, I'll find a solution.
Mrs. Kisaki, the car is waiting for you at the entrance.
Thank you.
Kuriyama, won't you take Ran and Conan to a nice restaurant, please?
(Woman) Ah, Kisaki...
Kujo.
I've already heard that you've taken Shinji Usami's case.
That's right.
That's true.
I had planned to come yourself to say.
(Flow) Kuriyama: Who is she, this woman?
She is Reiko Kujo, known as the Madonna of the police,
one of Tokyo's most brilliant prosecutors.
She's handling the case your mother has accepted.
(Thinks) "So this is the famous Madonna of the police."
I'm very excited that we are on trial, dear Kisaki.
Don't be too hard on me, okay?
And you don't be too hard on me either.
You have to be nice to me.
Of course, we're colleagues.
Well, then.
I'll see you around.
It seems to me that Kisaki has won another case lately.
Well...
That's the end of it.
Because I'll give her a taste of the taste of hard defeat.
THE JUDICIAL CONFRONTATION OF Kisaki AND Kogoro, (PART 1)
This mother of mine...
All she ever thinks about is work.
Hey, Kuriyama: what's this case that Kisaki has taken up now?
Mm?
Do you remember that a month ago a man's body was found
at a construction site in the Haido district?
Well, the victim...
"He was a man named Tsuyoshi Hirazawa."
"Apparently,
"someone hit him over the head with an iron bar and he died."
"At the crime scene they found the car key of the only suspect...,"
at Shinji Usami, whom the Kisaki must defend in the upcoming trial.
Do you know what the motive for the crime is, according to the police?
From what I've heard...
he was drunk one evening, 3 years ago,
Tsuyoshi unintentionally pushed the Usami's son
down the station stairs.
"Poor Masaki hit his head and was left."
Oysters.
Evidently, in Hirazawa he was charged with manslaughter,
"But the judge took into account that he was drunk...
"And suspended his sentence."
How can that be?
How can a child die and not be put in jail?
Give me back my Masaki!
Give me back my Masaki!
The police think that the Usami killed in Hirazawa
to avenge the death of his son.
That he did justice himself.
What a sad story.
And... what does she say, the Usami, about all this?
That he was also drunk that night and doesn't remember anything.
Good afternoon.
Go on, please.
What, did she remember anything since the last time?
No.
Nothing at all.
Oh, well.
Come on, let's go back over the facts from the beginning, then.
That night, around 5:30 p.m. on the 8th,
you met the victim at the Yamazen tavern, right?
We met by chance and got into an argument.
The problem came later.
You found the victim in those construction sites between 2/4 of 10 and 10.
I need to know is where you went and what you did during this time.
If you remember anything,
however irrelevant it may seem to you, you have to tell me.
By the way, it is impossible for me to find your wife.

He never answers the phone.
Forget about him, this one!
Why should I?
Even though they're divorced now, she was his wife, wasn't she?
She must be worried about you.
She hates me.
She's Refum, whatever happens to me.
It's like I'm dead, because of her.
- (girl) Mrs. Kisaki! -Kuriyama.
You found him?
-According to the address the police gave us, it should be around here.
(girl) Mother!
This way!
This way!
-Ran!
What are you doing here? -I feel...
Conan said he wanted to help us and I thought that...
What did you think, Conan?
You're walking around this neighborhood at this hour.
Yes, but this is the bar we're looking for, isn't it?
You mean this is where Usami's wife works?
This sign says "Mimasu".
This must be it.
It's a very strange name, isn't it?
Fortunately, I've already forgotten it completely.
Mrs. Kameda, I'd like to know why they split up,
but I want you to tell me... the truth.
Whenever he drank a little too much,
he would tell me that I was to blame for Masaki's death,
that I wish I had died instead of him...
We fully understand how she feels,
but now her ex-husband is in a very difficult situation.
If you could explain something to help him, maybe we could....
I don't want to remember anything about that bastard.
The scene is close to here, isn't it?
If you knew any details about that night...
it would help us quite a bit in our defense, Mrs. Masako.
I told you I don't know anything.
If that's all you came here to talk about, you can go now.
- (door, open) - (Masako) Good evening!
Hey... (door, open)
Father!
I... may I know what are you doing here?
And what do you do, handsome?
-I always come here to make a drink before going home.
Kogoro: you know them, these ladies?
Eh... Yes... well... no... See you again.
He comes often, this man?
Yes, Mr. Mouri is a regular customer.
He's very nice.
Come to think of it, that night too...
Ah...!
That night... maybe it means the night in question?
You mean you know something about what happened?
That night... my husband... I mean the Usami came to the bar.
Mr. Usami came here?
Yes.
Are you sure it was the night of the murder?
Yes.
It was that night.
It was the first time he set foot here, and also the last.
Wow!
Do you remember what time you arrived, at least approximately?
Well, I don't know.
But I'm sure Mr. Mouri will remember.
In Kogoro?
Thank you very much for the information, madam.
Don't think that I did this to help the Usami, eh.
Looks like we're finally starting to see the light.
(Kogoro: croons drunkenly)
Hello! (Calling) Father!
Eeeh!?
Coi, Ran!
Are you still up?
Where have you been?!
Where have you been...?
Where have you been...?
You look more like your mother every day.
If you have any complaints, tell her.
Some things don't change.
-Look who had to talk. -Ugh!
What a smell of alcohol!
Ha-ha-ha!
Radiating tòxiiiic gases!
(Think) "Ay señor!"
Flights stop?
I just came to ask you something, period.
Ha-ha-ha!
If you want to know intimacies, I will not tell you head.
Hey, do you remember the murder that happened...
at that construction site in the Haido neighborhood?
Yes, it does ring a bell.
That night you also went to the Mimasu bar, as you often do, right?
Eh?
You keep a close eye on me, don't you?
I'll make you some coffee, to see if it will clear up your ideas.
It's not necessary, they've already cleared up just by looking at it.
Well, that's good.
Have you seen this man?
Mm?
I'd say I saw him... just the Mimasu.
Can't you be more specific, please?
I'd say it was a day...
"I'd had a bit to drink and was taking a nap at the Mimasu."
They call him.
The phone!
The phone!
Yes, hello?
Talk to Mouri.
Yes, hello?
You can't hear anything in here...
And then I saw that guy.
You're sure?
That you don't trust my word?
No, I don't.
But you have to be sure.
If you only saw him in passing, how come you're so sure?

Good detectives, one look is enough.
And besides, when I got off the phone,
I came back in and he was sitting at the bar.
What's weird... Mm?
Ah...
-Are you done talking? -Yes.
You've made a mistake.
You're a new customer, aren't you?
Ah... It's an old acquaintance.
Aaaaah.
Well, I guess I'll start to pass.
No, man.
Stay a little longer, Mr. Mouri, please.
I'll... I'll buy you another round.
You invite me?
Come on, then!
I can't say no!
That guy left after half an hour.
When I was leaving I saw a police car pass by
and they told me that someone had been killed at a construction site over there.
Do you remember what time the bar arrived?
Twenty-five past nine.
Eh?
And how is it that you know the time so exactly?
Woman, I'm a detective for a reason, right?
You saw it on your cell phone clock, didn't you?
Shut up?
At what exact time was he killed, in Hirazawa?
Exactly, we don't know.
They estimate between 2/4 of 10 and 10.
If the Usami arrived at the bar at 9:25, he has a perfect alibi, right?
You're right.
Just counting that we can trust what this one tells us.
You're doubting my word again!
Of course you are!
You said you were totally drunk, didn't you?
Casum la olla!
- (Kisaki) As if I don't know you! - (Kogoro) You're as uptight as the mother...
Hello.
(Kisaki) Oh!
Hello, mother.
Ah, she's here.
Ah, hello.
Hello, Conan.
We wanted to bring the father, but he got away from us.
He's upset.
Well.
Did you remember he went to his ex-wife's bar, the Usami?
No.
Forgot what you did when you left the tavern.
So, even though we can't fill the void.
Eh?
What do you mean?
The gap?
Reviewing the succession of events, in Conan has realized one thing.
The Usami and in Hirazawa left the tavern at 2/4 of 9, right?
And when in Kogoro saw the Usami the Mimasu bar it was already 9.25, right?
But from the tavern in the Mimasu bar there is only a quarter,
walking at a normal pace.
I should have arrived at 3/4 of 9.
You're right... There is a gap of about 40 minutes.
What could I do, for 40 minutes,
with a man I couldn't stand and couldn't see?
And then... then there's Mr. Mouri.
Oh, well, that's fine.
Don't worry about that.
I've already noticed, I have no bread in my eye!
But I'm not worried for the moment.
At the Usami's ex-wife's bar?
Yes.
They are trying to find a witness to certify the defendant's alibi.
No matter how much they insist,
the ex-wife's testimony has very little credibility in court.
It seems to me that they also plan to subpoena Detective Kogoro Mouri.
Apparently, when the Usami went to his ex-wife's bar, he was.
Eh?
Ah, yes?
So Kogoro Mouri is Kisaki's ex-husband, right?
That's right.
You're absolutely right: they're divorced now.
I think we're going to have some fun.
Hey, father.
You'll testify for the mother, won't you?
I already told you, didn't I?
If you kneel before me and ask me, maybe I'll think about it.
Father!
Oh, my lord.
Here's your plate, noi.
Moltes gracias.
Eh?
There's even pop!
It's called iidako.
In Tokyo there's not much custom to eat it, but it's very good.
That's right!
It's really good!
When you have finished it, the children can start to pass.
(Mobile) This is your phone, isn't it, Father?
-Can you pass it to me?
(Beep-beep) -Yes, right.
(Beep-beep)
-Thank you.
Yes, hello?
Who am I talking to?
Eh?
Where are you coming from?
Aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!
(Door: closes)
Hey, who always hangs his coat here, in Mouri?
Yes.
Because it doesn't get dirty.
(Thinking) "So, that night too..."
"Wait a minute! If so..."
(Kogoro) Come on, guys!
Mm?
He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he...
Come on, let's go home! We haven't finished talking yet.
The children's hour is over.
Now it's time for the grown-ups.
Come on, come on!
Good-bye, good-bye!
But, father!
What a face he has!
Eh? What is it, Conan?
Maybe it's that woman who called you.
But this woman... is the prosecutor.
Good evening! - (Kogoro) Hello, I've been waiting for you!
That's strange.
What should he love him, the father?
Namely.
(Man) We started the first session...

of the trial against the defendant Shinji Usami.
First, we will feel the arguments of the prosecution.
The defendant is Mr. Shinji Usami,
residing at Oozawa Tsubo-no-Uchi, Shimokasuya,
Yamanashi prefecture.
According to the indictment, Mr. Usami, on the day...
Is this the list of the prosecution's witnesses?
Yes.
There are more or less than we expected.
So... according to article 199 of the penal code, he is charged with murder.
It's nerve-wracking, isn't it, with these trials?
Yes.
Very well, then.
Let's proceed to hear the witnesses.
-Senyoria. -Mm?
What does the prosecutor want?
Before we begin,
the prosecution would like to add a new last-minute witness.
I would like to call to the stand...
the famous private detective...
Mr. Kogoro Mouri.
(Audience: murmurs)
-How can that be?
This is a surprise. I don't know.
I have no idea.
How is it that the father should be a witness for the prosecution?!
"Wow. I saw that coming."
Any objection from the defense?
You decide to do it yourself.
I accept Mr. Kogoro Mouri to testify as a witness.
(Thinking) "What must he be up to, Reiko, subpoenaing Kogoro?"
"At last you will know the taste of defeat."
"So, the Madonna has also realized it."
"How much we have it raw..., Kisaki."
Why did they summon Mr. Mouri as a prosecution witness?
I don't know.
But I'm sure they're up to something.
I was surprised when they called him as a prosecution witness,
but he will testify on behalf of the mother, won't he?
Yes, he will!
"At least for the moment."
And the next Conan:
"The judicial confrontation of the Kisaki and Kogoro (Part 2)"
