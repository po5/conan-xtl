(TV: man) "And here comes number 7, the Blackest Nightmare..."
(TV: man) Come on!
Come on, run, run, run!
"The Sunflower Kid, number 4, won't be beaten so easily."
"Who will win? The Blackest Nightmare? The Sunflower Kid?"
-Nooo!
- "What an exciting race!"
I've lost again!
Ouch... And when did you bet this time?
Eh?
Woman, not much, really.
Confess!
About a thousand yen in the last 5 races.
Not really.
And you haven't won a single one, have you?
That's good.
You'll go without pay this week.
What are you talking about?
Next week the G-Race starts and I can't...
Hm.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
What a day!
I can't do anything right today.
Why do you say that?
When I went out to place my bets, it was sunny as hell.
"And as soon as I got there... a thunderstorm."
"When I went out, I went to buy tobacco."
"And the brand I always buy was out of stock."
"Besides, at that moment someone bumped into me...
and all the coins went on the floor."
To top it off, the wallet fell in the middle of a puddle...
and the betting slips got all wet.
You see?
Wet.
They're useless now.
Yes, let it be.
What would you like, for dinner?
Well... I don't have much of an appetite.
I'll take anything.
"Anything."
And then you'll say you want a hot dish.
What's the matter?
Well!
Well, this ticket says
that you bet on the Pirate Spirit in race 9 and won.
"In race 9, the first place finisher was number 8,
Pirate Spirit."
"The prize for yen wagered is 10,500 yen."
Really?
But that's 100 times what I bet!
And that means you won...?
Well, that's if you bet 10,000 yen...
Eh?
Mm.
What's that?
One million yen!
Ah!
Unbelievable Soc!
I made it!
But didn't you say you only bet 1,000 yen per race?
How can it be that for this n'apostessis 10,000?
Or maybe when he dropped his wallet on the ground,
the person with whom you collided also dropped it
and mistakenly picked up his betting slip.
Or maybe I made a mistake in marking the amount I wanted to bet.
But whatever.
If I picked it up off the ground, these slips are not named.
So if someone dropped it, you can forget about it.
It wouldn't have fallen off, would it?
Hm.
And now, let's have dinner to celebrate.
Come on, let's go to the Beika Iro.
Come on, let's go to Beika Iroha Sushi.
There it is!
Today is a fantastic day!
(Think: Shinichi voice) "Didn't you say you were having a bad day?"
"A new day begins with splendid sunshine."
"It's the hour of love and mysteries."
"We are presented with a mystery at the sushi restaurant."
"What happened to the winning horse betting ticket?"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a kid, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"An old-fashioned Tokyo-style detective show. Part one."
Hello.
Hello!
Good evening. Good evening.
Wow.
We have the whole restaurant to ourselves.
Yes, today the restaurant is pretty empty.
But it's better, isn't it?
As if we reserved it just for you.
Bring us a beer and three large sushi plates.
Ah, the one with the kid, please don't put wasabi on it.
Yes!
One beer and three large sushi plates.
One without wasabi.
But, hey, father, haven't you overdone it, asking?
You don't need to suffer, woman.

That I have this here.
It's misappropriation.
You shut up!
I see you have very good taste, eh?
With the horse race of the Pirate's Spirit
you must have won a lot of money.
What do you mean?
How do you know?
You didn't see me taking the land ticket, did you?
What ticket?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I just figured it out, this racing thing.
How did you know?
Everyone knows he lives next door and loves to gamble at the track.
And it's also known that he only comes to this restaurant when he wins a bet.
The manager told me.
Besides, he always orders the cheapest sushi,
he always orders the cheapest sushi, he has never ordered the big one before.
That's why it seemed obvious to me that today he won a jackpot.
And as they said on the radio that the jackpot had been won by those who had bet on the
those who had bet on the Pirate Spirit, it was clear to me.
What do you say?
Did I get it right, Sleeping Kogoro?
Did I get it right?
Did I get it right?
Yes, more or less.
You're... new to the restaurant, aren't you?
-Of course I am.
-I've never seen him before.
Kanenori Wakita, specialist in Japanese cuisine.
But I'm a very restless person and it's hard for me to stay in places.
The truth is that I've been changing restaurants until I ended up in the same one.
Aha.
In fact, I could define myself as a chef...
who goes with the flow of the moment.
Soc chef, but with only one eye....
(thinks) "Now that you mention it... that Rum guy..."
And the head lets me play waiter until I heal.
That I lost...
I don't know why, but all of a sudden it came to my mind...
that everyone said he was missing an eye.
Rum.
Whose eye?
He hurt his eye in an accident and lost it.
And that's precisely why he's wearing a glass one.
Hm?
Excuse me, sir.
What happened to his left eye?
Ah.
I've got something awful in my eye.
-No, no, it's not necessary!
-Would you like to see it?
Mr. Mouri,
I'm curious to hear about one of your cases.
Hm?
Since I was a child, I've had a passion for mysteries and riddles.
And from the moment I learned
that from time to time I would come to this restaurant
I was dying to meet you.
Well, if you want...
(Wakita) Sure!
You have to have a good eye to see it.
He made it look like there were dead people who had been resurrected as zombies
but they were just scenes from movies they had shot before.
-Yes, that's right.
-Renoi!
What a far-fetched case.
Let me have another one.
I'm sorry, I was so focused on the story...
I was so focused on the story...
But, Father!
This case wasn't solved by you, but by Heiji.
But I cooperated.
I was the first one to find the zombies.
"But I was sleeping like a child because of those poisonous mushrooms."
"The truth is that sushi without wasabi is worthless."
Here we have the cold beer.
-Come in, come in!
- (door, open)
Good evening, sir.
What can I do for you?
Let's see...
Nigiris, chawanmushi cream... And a coke.
Hm?
Coke?
And what should you do?
Ah, yes, sorry.
- (Wakita) OK.
-And a plate of marinated ginger.
Drink Coke with sushi.
But where are we going to stop.
There's a good league.
Even if you don't think so.
Yes?
Are you sure?
(Harashima) Excuse me.
-The washroom?
-Yes, sir.
Well look, that's the end of it.
Hm?
(Harashima) Thank you!
(Wakita) What can I get you, sir?
Uh, give me... a plate of nigiris, a cup of tea,
and also...
Hey, they have grilled fish today too?
Do they?
Yes.
Today we have horse mackerel, sir.
-Okay.
-Well, give me one.
You also do grilled fish?
Yes, but we started very recently.
We didn't make enough money with sushi alone.
As you can see.
Now they even have traditional desserts.
Oh, do they?
Well, I'll be glad to.
Oh, wow.
Ah.
And now it's raining.
Hm?
(Wakita) Good evening!
-The usual menu.
-What would you like, madam?
(Wakita) Excuse me.
And that means you want...?
Well, the menu I always order, of course.
-He's on sick leave.
The other waiter isn't here?
He had a serious car accident.
Oh, well...
Well look, give me a cocktail and a bowl of rice with seafood.
With lots of sea urchins and red caviar.
Yes.

- (Kogoro) The check, please!
- (Ran and Conan) How good everything was!
I loved the desserts.
(Wakita) Right away!
Mm-hm.
"(Ran and Conan) Look at you! And they were complaining so much, back home, before they came."
(Wakita) Well, Mr. Mouri,
I hope you'll tell me more of your stories another day.
I have given you a discount.
I paid for part of the dinner with my salary.
Oh, thank you very much!
You know what I'd like?
I'd like to see a crime scene.
If you take me, I'll buy you all the sushi you want!
Man, I don't always come across crimes like the one I've explained to you.
-Oh!
-Huh?
Who did it?
Which one of you stole my wallet?
I know the culprit is here, in the restaurant!
But what are you saying, woman?
How dare you come in and accuse us without evidence.
Why are you looking at me?
Hey, lady!
You can't come in here and start accusing customers!
So...
-Well...
-Where is it, the washroom?
It's over there.
At the back.
But...
Madam!
If you wanted to use the toilets,
you didn't need to make up this story.
-What... what did you find?
- (Kijirisawa) I've found it!
Let her come out right now!
Which one of you threw my wallet in the trash?
Can you tell me what happened?
My wallet was stolen when I was on the train.
I, as usual, had it in my purse.
Eh?
And how did you know I would find it here?
Because I also had my cell phone inside.
I came back home
and I checked on the computer the location of the cell phone with an application I have.
But none of the customers don't carry a bag big enough to hold a wallet like mine.
to fit a wallet like mine.
So I thought they must have hidden it in the sink.
Yeah, right.
And how long ago was it stolen?
Well, about an hour ago now.
Well, so... it was just before Mr. Mouri arrived.
And apart from these customers, no one else came to the restaurant.
This means, therefore, that the thief is still here.
The thief who stole your wallet on the train is one of us!
But... how are we going to find him?
If the thief is clever enough,
he's probably wiped the fingerprints off the wallet.
Maybe, but...
I managed to mark it with it.
Hm?
Oh!
A band-aid?
This morning I cut myself peeling an apple and put the band-aid on.
But because the cut was deep, a little blood leaked out.
So when I saw someone grab my wallet out of the bag,
I grabbed him by the arm and stained his right sleeve.
I guess if we take a good look at his sleeves,
we're sure to find a bloodstain on the culprit's shirt.
Not me!
See?
Everyone's sleeves are clean.
Not a trace of blood.
I'm sure there is.
I've marked it.
Somebody's got to be stained.
But, uh... how much money did they take from you?
I looked in my wallet and they didn't take them, the money.
Then I don't understand.
What they took from me was the ticket for the bet I had made at the racetrack.
A winning bet worth a million!
What?
What?!
A winning ticket worth a million.
Of course it was!
That's precisely why his wallet was stolen.
Of course it was.
We were on the train.
I was going to dinner with a friend when I heard on the radio that I had won.
Wow!
I won!
What?
What did you win?
I won at the horse races.
One million yen!
-I won!
-What?
Then it's your turn to pay for tonight's dinner.
Of course it is!
Woman for a fact.
I'll treat you to anything you want tonight.
Well, you said so.
I'll make the reservation.
Now don't back out.
No.
No problem.
We'll go to a French restaurant?
Eh?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Quiet here!
And that's how it happened.
Before I knew it, he was already gone.
(Wakita) And... you didn't get to see his face?
I was about other things, man!
I was trying not to get my wallet stolen.
Yeah, right.
But your friend didn't see it either?
She's nearsighted and can't see, from far away.
Besides, I was kind of looking for a restaurant to go to dinner,
she had taken off her glasses to read on her cell phone.

But... I'm sure I got blood on his shirt when I picked him up.
"I'm sure he still has the mark on his sleeve."
Someone in this restaurant
must have a bloodstain on their shirt sleeve!
Again?
None of us have the stained shirt, you've seen it before.
I want to see the whole sleeve.
Show me how well
Looks like you got it a little wet.
Yes.
I must have gotten it wet when I washed my hands in the sink.
You mean you didn't wash your sleeve when you went into the bathroom?
No, ma'am.
Blood doesn't come out that easily.
Although it would have.
You!
Show me your sleeve, too.
Eh?
Yes.
Look, my sleeve got wet too.
When I went to the bathroom, when I washed my hands, it also got a little wet.
I got it wet too, but it's not from washing my hands.
I got it wet in the rain.
When I got there it was raining a lot.
I also went to the bathroom once, but it's not from that.
What is it?
Father, listen to me for a moment.
You mean this winning ticket you found...
is not this lady's?
And now!
But what are you saying, woman.
But she says it was stolen an hour ago, right?
An hour ago, I was already in my office in front of the TV watching the races.
In fact, the horse racing broadcast...
has been over for 50 minutes.
And you only had time to watch one of the races,
when you came back, right?
This means that about an hour and a bit more ago
although you were close to the place where the bets are made.
Man, seen like that, it could be.
Maybe the person who stole his wallet was running to collect the prize,
and in his haste he bumped into you and dropped the ticket.
Woman... For the sake of power, anything can be possible.
Now don't tell me that you took it out of a wallet you found.
And now!
What are you saying?
How dare you, kid?
Come to think of it, Mr. Mouri.
You've hit the jackpot today too, haven't you?
IIH!
What did you just say?
Eh... What I wanted to say is that...
I... Of course I did.
The blood...
What do you mean?
We have to assume that the blood that came out of the band-aid
probably also stained the winning ticket, right?
The winning ticket that I have in my wallet
doesn't have any blood on it, you know?
What a silly thing to say.
I took the ticket with this hand, so it is not stained.
Hm?
Of course, it couldn't be stained.
-Hm?
-Hey, Mr. Mouri.
What do you think... if we play for the dinner money?
-I propose a game.
-Hm?
What do you mean?
We'll see which of us solves the mystery first.
The winner is the one who finds out who the thief is first.
But... but... but it's...
Neither of them has blood on their sleeves and...
we're not going anywhere like this.
The case has become an indecipherable mystery.
But, Father!
Eh... What's the matter?
I was just making a joke, woman.
Well, I'm not going to stay.
Here's my dinner money.
-Nano, where are you going?
You're running away?
-And I'm leaving right now.
Enough nonsense!
I've already paid and I'm leaving.
What's the problem?
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?
Are you meeting someone?
Well, I... I'm following a series on TV and I don't want to miss it.
You're leaving to watch a TV series?
It would be understandable if you were leaving to watch a live show.
But it doesn't make sense for you to run off to watch a series
that he will surely have programmed to be recorded.
If he can afford to pay what he ordered for dinner today,
which is by no means the cheapest,
I'm sure he's got a blu-ray recorder or something.
Yes.
I've programmed it to record.
You're right.
Well, bring me something to eat.
I'm glad you're staying.
-But I expect you to pay for the house.
I'm sorry.
But it's just that I should leave too.
What's your excuse?
It's just that I was meeting the wife and her parents
to go for a drink.
and for a long time now he hasn't stopped calling me to know where I am.
-Oh!
- (cell phone)
(Woman) "But where parents? Why aren't you coming?"
Woman, I've already explained.
Soc the restaurant.
I had a problem and I have not yet been able to leave.

-But what does he do?
- "What problem have you had?"
- "What? Who am I talking to?"
-Hello!
How are we doing, dear lady?
I am a waiter at Beika Iroha Sushi.
My name is Kanenori Wakita.
Let me explain.
A drunkard has hugged your husband in front of the restaurant
and knocked him to the ground.
Because it rained, his clothes are all soaked.
We are waiting for him to dry a little.
We made him go into the restaurant.
"Okay."
"Then tell him we're waiting for him at the Arsène, in Beika's building."
-Yes.
- "Will you tell him?"
Quiet, as soon as she dries off, she'll come here.
This should calm down for a while.
Oh!
Thank you.
I do not understand.
The Arsène is a very good restaurant.
How come you didn't want to take the opportunity to dine there?
It's just that my wife's parents are very strict.
Every time I meet them,
I get very nervous and I'm unable to eat anything.
Yes, I understand.
Every family is different.
If you wish to continue with this comedy, I can stay for a while.
But I must leave before 8 o'clock.
There's an auction of a painting on the Internet and I don't want to miss it.
And it ends today at 10 o'clock.
At the moment I have made the best offer,
but it's a very famous painting
and I have to be prepared in case someone makes a better offer.
You are a client of ours.
How come you need so much time to go home?
How far away do I live?
I didn't say that.
I'm half an hour's walk.
Then you don't need so much time.
Leaving here at 9 o'clock is enough.
My PC isn't working very well lately,
so I have to do it on my cell phone.
and since I'm running out of battery I have to charge it.
Well, if that's why.
Well, what can I do...
Ah!
Can you add a little more wasabi?
There is very little today, and it doesn't sting much.
And give me another cocktail, please.
Well, I'd also like a little more grated turnip.
I've had too little.
And give me another tea like the one before.
I'll have more ginger and another coke.
-I'll take them now.
-You won't charge us, will you?
"It's very strange."
"One of them should have on his sleeve...
the blood mark left by the lady."
"What is a mystery is to know
why they left the stolen wallet in this washroom."
"A professional thief would have kept the money in it."
"And the normal thing to do would have been
to throw it in the first garbage he could find."
"Why did you come to this very sushi restaurant?"
