DETECTIVE CONAN
The case of the false alibi
Wow, how cool!
You can tell, it's a 5-star hotel.
Aren't you excited, Conan? Oh, yes, I am.
Come on, let's go.
Kids, please, don't be so excited!
Before going to the restaurant I have to work a little!
Yes, we know!
Kogoro, look, isn't that man, your client, the lawyer?
(Kogoro) Ah, yes, it's him, Mr. Tatsumi.
You're a very famous private detective, Mr. Mouri.
(Kogoro) Gee!
I appreciate it very much, coming from you, Mr. Tatsumi.
There's no one who doesn't know you, sir, really.
And it's a very good thing, having the office in such a luxurious hotel.
When you do important business,
appearances are highly valued, Mr. Mouri.
"A big shot,
a famous lawyer who is a consultant for many big companies."
Wow, that's beautiful, that!
Mr. Mouri and company, what will you have?
Aaa... I'll have a coffee.
Don't suffer for them.
They'll be gone in no time.
And now, you needn't be in a hurry.
Make yourselves comfortable, please.
Good morning, room service?
"Why are you looking at your watch so insistently, if you're not in a hurry?"
Excuse me, I have to go to the toilet.
(Phone)
Could you pick up the phone?
I'll be right out.
Look, father, record the conversation automatically, this phone.
Hello?
Who's there?
(Woman) It's not you, king?
Aaa... no.
Who are you?
Mr. Sohei Tatsumi's wife.
Who else do you want me to be?
Ay caramba. # (Music box)
(Think) What's wrong? #
Tell my husband to put it on!
Yes, ma'am, one moment, please.
Aaaaaaaa...
Mr. Lawyer, it's your wife.
I always tell her not to call me here.
Di.
Now I have some guests.
I'll call you later.
Excuse me... If anything, let's get to the point.
One moment, please.
Ran, Conan! Ah... Yes, Father.
Come on, Conan.
Ah!
There's a cafeteria in the lobby.
Give them the room number and order what you want.
Thank you very much. Goodbye.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
Look, I'd like you to find out if my wife has a lover.
It's the Kazumi, my wife.
They've been meeting for almost an hour now.
Look, it's over there, Ran.
Hey, Father! Ah, he's here.
It's taken you a long time.
Is it an important job?
Man, that way...
What is it, Mr. Mouri?
The lawyer wants to know if his wife is unfaithful to him.
He's very insecure.
I was very surprised that he distrusts his wife so much.
"He wants me to investigate his wife."
But I took the job.
Now we can go to that restaurant you were saying, Ran.
That's perfect!
Now what, on second thought, father, where are we going?
This is the parking lot!
The restaurant is upstairs!
You're right. Aren't you lazy, take us to it?
"It's the lawyer?!"
(Kogoro) Come on, Conan!
I'm coming!
Aaaaaaaa... I think I've had too much to drink.
Oops!
Patrol cars.
What happened?
Boy!
What a big house.
"Mr. Tatsumi lives here?"
They must make a good living, these lawyers.
Inspector Megure, Detective Kogoro Mouri has arrived.
Thank you for coming so quickly!
Has something happened, Inspector?
Come with me to see this.
You, you wait here, understood?
It's Mr. Tatsumi's wife, isn't it?
Tatsumi's wife, right?
Yes, her name is Kazumi.
She's 27 years old.
Looks like she was strangled to death.
It's definitely a murder.
(Think) "Staples!? In the bathtub?"
(Kogoro) Hey, you!
May I know what you're doing, devil child?!
(Kogoro) Don't worry.
You must all come to the police station to testify.
To testify?
Yes, it's true that lately we had our problems.

And I had hired Mr. Mouri
to monitor my wife's movements.
And the approximate time of death?
Eh?
The autopsy will determine it,
but it would be between 2:00 and 3:00 in the afternoon.
Between 2:00 and 3:00... We were in the hotel, then.
(He thinks) "They take our statement, to confirm his alibi."
After the meeting with Mr.
Mouri,
I left the hotel.
I made some formalities and went home.
And I found him.
Kogoro, you were with Mr. Tatsumi between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m.?
Tatsumi between 2:00 and 3:00 this afternoon?
Yes, that's right.
He only left us for a moment to go to the bathroom.
It took him a minute or two.
And, oh, yes, the telephone rang.
Yeah, and she picked it up in Conan.
He said, "This is Tatsumi's wife. Who else do you want me to be?"
At that time she was still alive.
The conversation has been recorded on the tape of the hotel phone.
Perfect!
May I listen to the tape, Mr. Tatsumi?
Yes, indeed, Mr. Inspector.
Anyway, Mr. Tatsumi's alibi is true.
Tatsumi's alibi is true,
because it was with us, between 2 and 3 o'clock.
And it's 10 kilometers from the hotel to his house.
"Lawyer's wife murdered.
The investigation focuses on the victim's relationships?"
You mean her lover?
It could be that Mrs. Tatsumi was killed by her lover.
Tatsumi was killed by her lover.
The way the house was, it wasn't a robbery.
And if Mr.
Tatsumi has been cleared by our statement,
the number of suspects has been reduced.
What makes me more angry
is that because of the murderer, we are out of a job!
(Thinking) "This case just doesn't add up.
"I don't see it clearly."
"What was the need to put the body in the bathtub, the murderer?"
"What were those staples doing there?"
"Why was he in such a hurry,
and spent an hour in the office with Kogoro, Mr.
Tatsumi?"
"Why were you keeping an eye on the time?"
"Was it a coincidence that he made us pick up the phone?"
"What was he carrying in the trunk?"
"The starting point of these deductions is the hotel!"
Ah!
Is that you, Conan?
Conan, where are you going?
Come back!
I'll be right back, don't worry!
(Think) "Mr. Tatsumi's office is here,
the customers' elevator is over there."
"The employee elevator is over there."
"The fire exit is also far..."
"This is..."
(Adult voice) Wow, it's the muntac√†rreguesde clothes.
(Think) "Staples!"
"I got it!"
As usual, I've reserved a room next to the office.
Make yourselves comfortable, please.
"Always book a room next to the office..."
(Music box)
"This is..." #
"Where's it coming from, this music?" ##

"From here!" #

"That must be it?" #
"Do you use a music box instead of an alarm clock?" # #
What are you doing here, kid?
Are you a customer? #
Yes, I'm doing a scan! #
Looks to me like you're up to some mischief. #
(Think) "The same thing happened the other day!"
"The music box stopped when I was talking on the phone."
What a strange alarm clock.
Is there one in every room?
Yes, nice, there's one in every room!
It's a music box with a built-in alarm clock.
"Very good!"
"I've finally found the proof that Mr. Tatsumi is the murderer!"
You're late!
You're too late!
Why are you disappearing, if you know we have to go out?
Oh!
Where is he in Kogoro?
He's already gone!
What?!
It's been you!
It's you!
You murdered her, the Kazumi!
Police!
What's the problem?
Who are you?
My name is Hirose, sir, and I'm an architect.
I'm what you're looking for,
what was understood with the Kazumi.
What do you say?!
But I didn't kill him, the Kazumi!
Why did I have to kill him?
Now she was about to get divorced so she could marry me.
It's the first news I have.
Don't play the innocent!
You knew perfectly well!
You knew?
All right, let's suppose I knew.
But why would I want to kill my wife?
I've seen many cases of murders
committed because of complications from extramarital affairs,
and they always find the killer.

Pig!
Besides, I have an alibi.
It is impossible for me to have killed him.
Is that so, Mr. Mouri?
Of course it is!
I'm a witness!
I'm a witness!
Mr.
Hirose, it is said, isn't it?
What do you have to say?
Do you have an alibi?
We just want to know where you were between 2:00 and 3:00 this afternoon.
Ah, I... I didn't...
Come on, tell 's where you were!
I was set up, sir!
A trap, you say?
I got a letter from her.
She said she wanted to see me.
"I'd be waiting at my house at half past five for 3. Kazumi."
But the Kazumi wasn't there.
No one opened the door and I went home.
It was hard to believe.
Especially if I was at the scene of the crime at the right time.
Anyone could forge it, a letter like that!
Get rid of the police!
Let's go!
It's crystal clear that the murderer is you.
Inspector, please arrest me!
Besides, you've made me lose a client!
I'm not the assassin!
Mr. Hirose.
Hirose, will you come with me to the police station, please?
(Thinking) "Sorry, Kogoro!"
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Gee, what's wrong?
Are you all right, sir?
(Kogoro voice) I'm fine, thank you.
No, it wasn't me!
(Kogoro voice) No!
It wasn't him!
It's not you that should be turned over to the police, Mr. Hirose, sir.
Hirose,
but you, Mr. Tatsumi!
What's wrong with you, Kogoro?
You're accusing Mr. Tatsumi, now?
That's right!
And now!
What a big nonsense to say!
This will damage your reputation as a detective, Mr.
Mouri.
Well, I think you'll just have to eat your words, Mr.
Tatsumi.
You took advantage of a quiet moment at the hotel.
You were very clever.
You had me completely fooled!
The scene of the crime is not always the place where the body is found.
Because you didn't commit the murder here in the residence, but in the hotel itself!
but in the hotel itself!
What are you saying?! What?
What's got you now?
The call you answered at Conan...
We did a voice analysis of the tape
and the woman's voice matched the victim's.
Yeah, of course it was the victim.
Because it turns out she was calling from the guest room,
which is next to Mr.
Tatsumi's office.
What?
Next door?
The next room?!
(Kogoro voice) Mr. Tatsumi told his wife to wait for him.
Mr. Tatsumi told his wife to wait for him
in the guest room next to his office.
"And then, at the appointed time,
he had her call his office from a cell phone."
"When the phone rang, he told us to pick it up."
Hello?
Who's there?
"You would never guess that the person calling you is together."
"And when he finished talking to me he went into the next room,
murdered her,
put the corpse of the Kazumi to the clothes cart,
"took it to the clothes elevator,
and brought the bag down."
Around that time, the workers are eating,
and for a while, no one can see it, right, Mr. Tatsumi?
"But some staples got caught in the bag."
"The staples that attach the labels to those bags."
And those staples are the same as the ones in the bathtub.
But why would he put the body in the bathtub?
"He must have conceived this plan
when he realized that the bathtub and the trunk were the same."
"Because he knew that when he got home,
the corpse would have enrigidit into the shape of the trunk.
He then set a trap for Mr.
Hirose
by having him receive the letter apparently sent to him by the victim.
Finally, he used me to confirm his alibi.
He had it all figured out.
I'm very disappointed in you, Mr. Mouri.
I see you are not a good detective.
What proof do you have, to prove that I am the murderer?
With a guess, a court would never convict me.
You're right, Kogoro!
I have proof!
Inspector, please, I'd like you to do me a small favor.
The tape that was recorded on the day of the murder.
Is that the one you want to hear, Kogoro?
The tape of my wife's phone call.
What are you up to, detective?!
Play it, please, Inspector.
(Recording: Conan) "Hello? Who is it?"
(Kazumi) Isn't that you, King?

"Aaa... no. Who are you?"
"Mr. Tatsumi's wife. Who do you want me to be?"
(Music box) This...
A music box?! Xxxt.
Shut up. #
(Kazumi) "Gee!"
"Tell my husband to put it on, please."
Yes, ma'am, one moment please.
Aaa..."
(Kogoro voice) Stop it.
Don't you understand?
Instead of alarm clocks,
the hotel has these music boxes.
Mrs. Tatsumi set the alarm clock
to alert her at the right time,
but she forgot to stop it before calling.
There can be many places, of these music boxes.
Was there a music box at the lawyer's house?
There was none.
The murderer could have taken him away after committing the crime.
Impossible!
And may I know why?
Conan, the tape!
Right away.
Here it is.
It's a recording of the music box
in the room next to the lawyer's office.
(Kogoro voice) Play the tape, please.
(Music box)
It can't be!
A note!
There's a note missing!
That's right!
The music box is not working properly.
It can be as much that a tine is missing from the surface of the roller
as for it to have a broken reed.
No music box like this one, Mr. Tatsumi!
Tatsumi!
Hey, do you think we need to listen to the tape again?
It's not necessary, we've already heard it.
For a lawyer to have to suffer the blackmail of his wife...
His wife, you say?
She blackmailed him?
She wanted 200 million yen.
200 million?!
How do you think I got the social recognition I have?
Evidently, I was a good lawyer.
But at work, I learn a lot of confidential information.
And even if I don't ask for it,
my clients add a bonus to my fees.
Sometimes I've accepted kickbacks,
and she had found out.
I'll divorce you if you pay me 200 million yen.
You earn it with a year's commissions.
Cheap force, considering you'll save your reputation.
She wanted to collect the millions
and leave with this architect as if nothing happened.
I won't stand for it, I thought.
"I told him I would do it, but on one condition."
"That he would call me at a certain time from the hotel."
"She immediately agreed."
"She could only see that I would have the money."
"But she shouldn't have let him call."
It's true, and besides, if she didn't want to be enxamp√©ssim,
she should have listened to that tape before giving it to the police.
The tactic that was supposed to be used to commit the perfect crime
has ended up turning against him.
No matter how good a lawyer he is
and no matter how much thought he puts into all the details,
when the sentence is pronounced, it's always a lottery.
Until today, he had never, ever lost a bet.
Maybe he was a very competent lawyer,
but when it came to committing murder, he was clumsy.

(yawning)
Eh?
Inspector?
You didn't disappoint me, you got it right again.
He wanted to make a fool of you, but he couldn't.
Aaa... yes, of course, of course.
Tease?
Who was teasing who?
"How strong!"
"You have a better reputation every day, Kogoro."
(Think) "It's obvious, the murderer is Mr. Matsuo!"
"But he was only able to come back in 4 minutes?"
"I get it. He did it just like that! An optical illusion!"
(Kogoro voice) I'm about to start the TV program.
We wouldn't all be here if you were gone because you're the killer!
