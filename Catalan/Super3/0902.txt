"They have kidnapped the Eri Kisaki, Ran's mother."
"The woman was able to escape from the kidnappers
and hid in the same building where she was being held."
"With the phone she has taken from one of the kidnappers,
she contacted Ran for help."
Oh.
"S-some men have kidnapped me.
Help me.
Call the police."
What?!
"Are you serious?"
(Acoustic signal)
He has already answered.
He says he doesn't know where he is.
Wow.
It seems to be true.
They have entered them in the office.
(Acoustic signal)
So it's a lie.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Look carefully.
Well, it's not funny.
The photo is different.
The person who asked you to accept it doesn't have one.
That's true.
They are two different people.
The person who uses the account with Eri's profile picture is not her.
So this means that the person who doesn't have the photo is the mother.
Well... I don't know.
I'm getting more and more disoriented, to tell you the truth.
What?
What?
How what?
We already know.
You already know who it is?
Yes.
Because Mrs. Kisaki is a lawyer.
So what?
So in the legal field a comma is used that is different
from the traditional Japanese comma.
They use the comma typical of Western languages.
Shinichi told me one day.
They are so used to it, they use it all the time,
no matter what they write.
I hadn't noticed.
That's true.
In all the messages I have from the mother there is the comma you say.
"With some of the clues that we have been able to deduce.
"From the information given to us by Mrs. Kisaki,
we have rushed to the place where we think it might be."
This means that it is most likely in a windowless room
hidden somewhere from where it cannot see outside.
"Look for a place with these characteristics."
Understood.
It must be in a closet or something.
We'll start looking all over the building.
-I'll let you know so we find it.
- "Perfect."
Oh!
Ah...
"A new day begins with a splendid sun."
"It's the hour of love and mysteries."
"Mrs. Kisaki's life is in danger in her hiding place."
"Hurry, Kogoro! Run, Ran!"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The Eri Kisaki's distress message. Part two."
Ah...
(Guts: snoring)
What are you doing, you idiot!
What are you doing, you idiot!
How do you want me to hide in a filing cabinet, you too!
And, besides, your guts are snoring.
It's not here.
Come on, let's keep looking.
Yes.
(thinks) "Saved by the intestines."
(gasps)
Zojoji Temple?
What are we doing here?
Conan says it must be this way.
Uh... (gasps) But where are you going, now?
Conan!
Leave me the cell phone.
Mrs. Kisaki, would you sit me down?
"Now you will feel another bell again."
When you get the sound, tap the cell phone twice with your fingernail.
Okay?
He will feel it soon.
"(Two taps)"
(Think: Shinichi voice) "One second, more or less."
"Then, considering that the sound propagates at 340 m per second..."
"If from the church next to the detective agency
it was about a kilometer..."
"And from this temple it's about 340 meters..."
"Mrs. Kisaki must be either to Buroku-cho or Sutan-cho."
"Which one will it be?"
"In both neighborhoods there are a lot of buildings
where the kidnappers may have been hiding."

(Man) But how many times do I have to tell you?
It wasn't me, I'm not even hungry!
Don't fool me.
I heard your guts snoring all the time.
-Eh?
-Hm.
Hey.
Bring me in the room you searched.
What?
But there was no one!
Hm.
We'll see about that.
It could be that our fawn had an empty stomach.
I told you, there was no one here.
You're wrong.
The crate is still warm.
It was here until recently.
But now it must have changed its hiding place.
This means it may have moved closer to a window
and now he can give clues as to what he sees.
And if he tells his daughter what he sees through the window,
there's a good chance they'll soon know where he is.
And if they know where she is, they'll come and find us.
Come on, man, take it easy.
Don't be so nervous.
I've already managed to hack into his cell phone.
If he contacts his daughter by text,
it won't take us a second to find out.
Yeah, but...
And then, if you explain to them what you see from the window,
we'll soon know where in the building she's hiding.
and we can catch her.
-I hadn't thought of that.
-Of course.
"It gets complicated."
"If they can also read the messages I write..."
"I have to take a gamble."
"Please decipher the message."
Can you tell me what this is all about?
(Mobile: message, acoustic signal)
Now I'll tell you.
Let's see.
A message from Mrs. Kisaki.
"The crab is half done but, thanks to him,
the two swordfish are looking good.
It's a nice night tonight;
how about dinner out?"
What... what does he want to tell us?
Now he's talking about food?
It doesn't make any sense.
"The crab is half eaten but, thanks to him,
the two swordfish are looking good."
"It's a nice night tonight, how about dinner out?"
"Full moon."
"Two swordfish...
and a half crab."
"Sure!"
"Now I get it."
(Kogoro) A... Sutan-cho?
Yes.
Mrs. Kisaki is kidnapped somewhere in Sutan-cho.
Are you sure, Conan?
But how can you be so sure?
We've agreed that El Eri must be within the area
drawn by the intersection of two circles.
Maybe we are talking about Buroku-cho or Sutan-cho.
What I don't quite understand
is how you can be so clear that it is the second option.
What makes you think that it is Sutan-cho and not Buroku-cho?
Very easy: the message she sent us.
Let's see...
How?
"The crab is half done but, thanks to him,
the two swordfish are looking good.
It's a nice night tonight;
how about dinner out?"
He doesn't say, let it be to Sutan-cho.
The crabs are rather dark in color,
but, when cooked, they turn red.
Eh?
Oh...
That means, if the crab is half cooked,
it's not red all the way through, just a little bit.
That something that should be red,
is now only half this color and the other half is dark.
Some red.
Now it's half dark colored.
What could it be?
Another clue is when he says that "it's a very good night".
No doubt he is referring to the full moon.
Its light means that only half of a building has been illuminated.
And it can only be that one.
Oh!
The tower of Tohti!
It is true.
They always illuminate the whole thing.
Today they've only lit half the lamps.
I read it somewhere, that.
When the moon is full,
they only turn on half of the lights in the Tohti tower
so that the moon's spectacle can be seen better.
And what the two swordfish look good thanks to the crab,
did you also understand that?
That they look good is what he says because, from there where he is, he can see very well.
And with the fish, it reminds us of a sword.
In the past, they used to use catanas.
He is talking about two fish,
that is to say, he is telling us that there are two things.
And what can these two catanas be?
What could they be?
In the old days in Japan there was a very strong samurai.
Do you remember?
Ah.
You mean Musashi Miyamoto?
Of course I do.
Isn't there any building that reminds you of this samurai figure?
Yes.
One that is 634 meters.

6, 3, 4: mu-sa-shi in Japanese.
It's the Bell Tree Tower.
Mm-hm.
So, if you have Mrs. Kisaki somewhere...
from which, when the Tohti Tower gets dark,
you can see the Bell Tree Tower better, this means that,
it is most certainly somewhere in Sutan-cho.
We are lost.
The lawyer has written a message to her daughter
about some crab and swordfish.
And the daughter wrote back as if she understood her.
They are getting closer and closer.
And I also write to her as if I were her,
with contradictory information to entangle them.
Give it to me.
-Eh?
Commas?
-Commas!
He uses western commas, instead of Japanese commas.
That's why your daughter knew who you were from the beginning.
Keep writing to her, but now use the same commas as her.
That way she won't know if she's talking to her mother or to us.
Yes.
Okay.
Well, even if the daughter manages to find us,
it won't do her any good.
We'll just peel them both off and that's it.
The Eri hasn't told us which building it is.
How will we know?
Oysters.
(Acoustic signal)
The kidnappers use the same commas as the mother.
Let's see...
They've figured it out.
"I don't know, when I got out of the suitcase I was already inside the building.
From the looks of the inside wall,
I'd say it's a reinforced concrete building, but I'm not sure.
Don't be fooled.
The wall is made of wood.
I think it must be a wooden building.
Is it the concrete one... or the wooden one?
How will we know?
"Wow! They noticed that they were telling me apart because of the commas."
"We'll try something else."
He replied.
"I'd say, on the first floor of the building,
there is a metallic blind of mouse color, light gray.
One of those colors that give warmth."
Now he says, "No. The gray door is not metal, it's wood."
Wow.
Here we go again.
We're getting dizzy again.
Wooden or metallic?
I can recognize this.
The metal one.
But how do you know?
It's an expression she uses.
To refer to the light gray she says "mouse color".
And also that it gives warmth to clothes.
Help me decide.
Which one do you like better?
Well... I like the black ones better, to tell you the truth.
Oh, you do?
I thought the other ones were more elegant and warmer.
But they're mouse-colored.
Are they?
And the grays like this give warmth to clothes
and make you feel warm.
Huh?
A metal shutter... and light gray.
It's this building.
Oh!
"It's here."
Ran!
Kogoro!
I am here!
I'm here!
We're coming!
Eri!
Mother, we're coming!
Oh!
We've got you.
You've been hiding for quite a while, huh?
We just wanted to take off your clothes
and film you naked asking us to forgive you for what you've done,
but now that you've got the police here...
We'll strip you naked and knock you unconscious
and we'll take the opportunity to make a racy video of you
and we'll post it on the internet.
(Kogoro) Asshole.
The only one here who has the right to see Eri naked...
is me.
What do you think you are!
Now you'll see!
Are you all right, king?
Yes.
I am well.
But you know him, this man?
His wife wanted to divorce him for male violence.
I'm going to prove his guilt and that made him lose his head.
It seems that he has allied with other husbands who also lost lawsuits
and they wanted him to record a video asking for their forgiveness.
Eh?
-Hmm?
-Others.
And the other two?
There are two more.
A thin one, addicted to gambling,
and another fat one, who used to cheat on his wife.
Oh, really?
They must have already been caught.
(rumbling)
But what are you doing here?
Mh.
(rumbling) Huh?
(clattering) Huh?
-Wait'm.
-Fugim!
Ah!
Get... Get out of here!
Uh...
I... I won a kendo tournament, huh?
Iaaah!
Aah!
Eh... Ran... Are you alright?
Yes.
I'm fine.
But the mother, how will she be?
"I'd say...
"I'd rather worry about how these two have turned out."
"Although,
"When the door was loaded,
it became clear to me that I would have no problem leaving them estassats."
-What?
-By the way, Kogoro....
How did you get in through the window?
It's a third floor.
Well, well... Nothing...
What do you mean, "nothing"?

Is there an emergency staircase or something?
(Kogoro) Aw, let it go, woman.
It's all the same now, that.
It doesn't matter.
Yes, that's right.
An abandoned building in Sutan-cho.
Come at once, Inspector Takagi.
We've solved the case, we've notified the police.
It's all over.
Are you sure?
There's something we still need to clear up.
What do you... want to... say?
What... you... want... to... say?
Yeah, about you, Conan.
Discovering the clues and leading us here.
The way you've done it, it's not like a boy your age.
You, Conan, actually...
Yes.
You're right about that.
Yes.
That's exactly what you think.
Eh?
Look at that.
What?
"You got me, Ran."
"The boy asked me for advice and I told him what to do."
"Because of him, I couldn't have a quiet dinner, he's a pain in the ass."
"You can tell your mother
that from now on she won't receive anyone who doesn't have visiting hours."
"And if anyone shows up, to make sure before opening the door."
H-hang on, Shinichi.
"Goodbye."
In Shinichi has been communicating with me all the time.
He told me that you were too busy
answering chat messages.
Of course, that's why you spent the whole time with your phone in your hand.
I've already found it a bit strange.
Wow.
So you noticed that too, huh?
Of course I've noticed it, beautiful.
Of course I noticed it.
Oh, this Conan...
(laughs)
"I've gone from little."
"I already saw it, that he smelled something."
"I have done well to record an audio with my voice."
-Thank you, Mr. Mouri.
- (Kogoro) Thank you for everything, Takagi.
Would you mind accompanying me for a while at the police station
to take your statement about everything that's happened?
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'll stop by tomorrow.
Now I have to go to dinner
and then I'm meeting my wife for a movie.
Right?
Right, Eri?
Eh... Yes.
"Wow! They held hands."
"Does this mean they've made up?"
Eh?
Ahem!
That's good.
Then we'll talk tomorrow to arrange a time, won't we?
-Thank you very much.
-Well... Yes, of course.
Well, have a good night.

He spent half the movie saying, "objection, your honor."
And the strategy of attacking them where it hurts them the most is wrong,
it makes a bad impression on the judges.
Besides, you can't make the witnesses speak
without the permission of the presiding judge;
never ever.
And what about the scene in the bar where the general gets drunk and talks too much?
and talks too much?
It should be comical but it is inadmissible,
a breach of confidentiality that should be prosecuted.
And there is still another thing.
He was addressing the court in a despot's tone.
And didn't you think she was overacting?
What are you saying?
It made me think a lot about you.
It seems that they have copied you.
I think they have taken you as a model.
Don't talk nonsense.
I have nothing to do with this character.
(Kogoro) If it is nailed, woman!
(Kogoro) Oh.
I don't know why they always have to end up the same.
"Maybe she's right."
"With the name Saki Kirie, the name Eri Kisaki can be formed."
Why do you represent that I have to apologize, at this point?
Don't play clueless, you know perfectly well what I mean!
