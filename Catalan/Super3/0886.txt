(Voice Shinichi) "The Kazuha Toyama and Heiji Hattori
"They sell by inviting us to see
the new festive lighting that everyone is talking about."
"While we wait for the Ran and the Kazuha.
"Finish preparing dinner for Kogoro,
"Heiji and I went down to the Poirot Café,
which is located under the detective agency."
"While we are there, members of the drama club arrive...
"From Beika University:
"Meisuke Ozumi..., Yui Yamashita....,
I have Anzai... and Minoru Nagatsuka."
Let's go.
Come on, Su.
Let's watch Yui's birthday video together.
Hey, you've already finished your part, right?
Yes, and I sent it to the computer a while ago.
-But the Ozumi hasn't arrived yet.
-Yes?
Yes he is, but he's gone to the toilet.
Ah, maybe we'll make some noise.
We hope we won't disturb you.
We hope we're not disturbing you.
It won't start... I don't get it.
It's out of battery?
Uh, excuse me, could you plug it in somewhere?
Yeah, sure, sure.
-Thank you very much.
-It's got it.
The light!
Is it gone?
I thought I saw some sparks...
Yes, me too.
They came out of the socket.
-Yes!
-Azusa, check the leads.
Uh!
Ah...!
Aaaah....!
What the...?
-Yes!
-Azusa, hurry up!
But what's all this fuss?
(Woman) Aaaah...!
But I don't think we should call the police.
When they have stabbed her, as you can see,
her blood has stained my cheek.
Yes, and it stained my glasses.
So, according to this, we can be absolutely sure...
that the assailant's hands or sleeves are stained with blood.
(Heiji) Wow, I can't believe it!
But how can it be that no one has blood stains?
Excuse me, but it seems that they only suspect the 3 of us.
Couldn't it have been someone outside?
Maybe there was someone outside, and when the lights went out,
he came in with night vision goggles and stabbed her.
I doubt this was possible.
Mm?
Mm?
Why are you so sure, you?
Immediately after the man was stabbed and called it in,
I positioned myself... right in front of the door of the premises
to make sure no one could get out,
and I'd say I succeeded.
Ah!
So that's why when the lights came back on
I was standing by the front door.
Yes.
You must have good night vision, you.
No... I was using the cell phone to tru... Oh!
To listen to some music.
I took advantage of the light from the cell phone.
"Tru... music"?
Oh, by the way, excuse me... You still haven't told us your name, sir.
My name?
My name is Shinichi Wada, and I work in the medical field.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Shinichi Wada?"
"The curtain rises and the main character appears."
"He solves mysteries by doing a beautiful dance."
"A mysterious man, Shinichi Wada.
"appears before Heiji and the Amuro,
who are trying to solve the mystery of Café Poirot."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Amai uso nara tsuiteite.

"Solving mysteries at Café Poirot (part two)."
That's good!
But his name matches your name!
Ah...
Eh?
Hey, Conan, isn't your name really Conan?
Ah...!
No, that's not it!
In fact, you made a mistake.
He meant "your friend Shinichi's", you know?
It's just that Heiji often eats words.
Ha-ha-ha!
Yes, sorry...
He-he-he...
Ah, geez.
By the way, Kudo, have you figured out who the culprit is yet?
(Shinichi voice) Well, no, not yet.
But I've come up with a trick to keep the blood from splattering.
(Shinichi voice) What?
You too?
But... the person who might have used this trick...

...he can't have committed the crime.
Damn it!
I have to solve the case quickly so I can go to Kinza.
Eh?
Eh? (Conan voice)
(Conan's voice) Listen...
What's up, jester?
Sorry about something.
Ah...
Earlier you said that you and Anzai were just friends.
(Conan voice) Oh!
But that's not true, is it?
If there's something wrong, could you explain it to me?
It could be the key to solving the case.
I'm sorry, but I can't explain it to you.
Mm?
But it's just...
It's a secret... that I have to keep to protect a person.
I have to confess that at your age...
I didn't think I had any secrets myself.
Ah.
Alright, you guys.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Mm. Truth be told, of secrets, I have masses and all."
(Shinichi voice) Eh?
Hey, Kudo.
Do you know until what time it's on, Kinza's lighting?
I have no idea.
- (both) Eh?
- (man: his throat is wrung out)
"The autumn wind pushes the clouds gracefully.
Between them, the moon can be seen, its light dispelling the darkness".
(Tooru and Heiji, think) "A hundred poets, a hundred poems"?
- "Now I understand."
- "Sure."
(Shinichi, think) "I know how it went."
(Ozumi) Hey, inspector!
Mm?
Let us leave at once, man!
I'm sorry you stabbed poor Anzai,
but the culprit is none of us 3.
No one has any blood spatter.
I don't think any of us could stab someone in the dark.
You would have to wear night vision goggles.
I was already in the sink long before the lights went out.
- (both) Mm?
-I couldn't have stabbed him.
Besides, the glass in the bathroom peephole is frosted.
I couldn't tell where everyone was sitting.
- (all) Mm?
- "The autumn wind..."
"The autumn wind gracefully pushes the clouds.
Among them is the moon, which with its light dispels the darkness".
"A hundred poets, a hundred poems"?
What's this all about now?
Yes, it is a poem by Akisuke Sakya no Daibu...
that describes the beauty of the moon seen between the clouds
that want to be pushed by the autumn wind.
Just like the aggressor, who has observed, for a small space,
where everyone was sitting.
Eh?
Nothing.
Do not disturb me.
(Heiji) What are you doing?
(Heiji) Isn't it true?
I'm asking you, you've been in the bathroom all the time,
watching through the peephole,
Meisuke Ozumi.
(Heiji) Oh...
What what?
-Ozumi, is it true?
-But you..., Ozumi!
But... What's wrong with you?
I've said it before!
That glass in the sink is frosted!
(Conan's voice) Excuse me, Azusa.
Yes.
Do not you have tape step?
Why do you want to use it?
The science teacher taught me that sticking a piece of tape
on the rough side of a piece of frosted glass,
you can see just as well as if it were regular glass.
Huh?
Really?
Stick a piece of tape on the glass and look through the peephole.
Right.
Oh, you're right!
I can see through the tape!
Mm..., oh!
Oh! (gasps)
Inspector, can you see?
I can.
Although it's not quite transparent,
you can see perfectly well who is sitting in which seat.
-It has its explanation.
But how can it be?
It's difficult to see through frosted glass
because the roughness of the surface reflects the light
and make it blurry.
But when we stick masking tape,
what the tape does is fill in the irregularities of the glass,
it flattens the surface and makes it look transparent.
But... but I don't... I don't have tape.
There is more than enough
the wrapping paper from the Yui's birthday gift.
After sticking it on the glass and looking through the peephole,
you took it off and reattached it to the gift.
Even if I had looked through the peephole
I wouldn't have been able to stab someone in the dark.
-Oh!
-That's what you're going to practice, isn't it?
To your apartment, or somewhere else,
you set up the tables and chairs in the same arrangement as here,
so you can stab someone in the dark.
If you went last year to build a set up just like this cafe....,
I'm convinced that somewhere in a corner of the drama club
we can find the exact measurements.
I..., but even if I knew the layout,
it's not easy to stab a person.

Yes, from the face would be difficult, because the hands would be in the way.
But attacking from behind, as long as you know where your victim is,
is easier.
That's exactly why you arrived first and left your bag on the bench.
You assumed that your girlfriend, Yui, would sit next to you.
You are right, and if the bench was occupied,
the victim could only sit in one of the two chairs,
on the other side of the table.
But... but what about the blood?
If I had stabbed her I would have been splattered all over with blood!
Mm!
You've prepared everything well so it doesn't splatter.
Oh!
And how did you do it?
With a material found in the toilets.
- (traffic rumor)
- (woman) Be careful.
Oh, how wonderful!
Just missing the Tinkerbell flying, eh?
Of course, it's as if we were in dreamland.
(chattering commotion)
Kazuha, listen... Oh!
Kazuha.
Both of you alone, Ran.
I'm glad I came with you.
What's that?
If I'd seen this with Heiji...,
I might have ended up sad, or angry.
Oh, thank you, you're great!
Thank you, you're fantastic!
I really am.
Mm?
Ka... Kazuha!
Eh?
I like you too, Kazuha!
Ha-ha-ha!
In Heiji I would never have spoken this way!
Ah!
I'm sorry.
But thank you, Ran.
I'm serious.
What's he doing in Heiji now?
Yeah...
I'm calling him but he's not picking up his cell phone.
- (both) Eh?
- (girl) I've been waiting for you for a while.
I'm sorry, but... that thing about changing the meeting place at the last minute...
I wanted to eat a Poirot's sandwich.
You don't know?
Something happened at the cafe.
People are saying there's been a murder.
-Yes!
-Don't smoke!
They've stabbed a man, they've taken him to the hospital.
Oh!
Oh!
Paper... Toilet paper?!
Mm-hm.
That's how he avoided getting blood on himself?
He's wrapped both arms tightly,
as if he were a mummy.
You idiot!
By wrapping just your arms you couldn't avoid getting stained,
you can't know where it will splash!
(Heiji) Arms would be more than enough.
You removed the cardboard tube from the toilet paper,
put it on the tip of the weapon and stabbed the victim.
If when you pull the knife out you hold the tube against the body,
there's a lot less blood splatter.
That's why you used a long, sashimi-cutting knife,
because otherwise you couldn't have stabbed him through the tube.
"It could be that some drops splashed out of the tube,
but since it wasn't turned towards you, you didn't get splashed."
"Instead we, who were on the other side, in front of the tube,
we ended up with blood all over us."
"Then all you had to do was go back to the washroom
and wait for the light to come back on."
"In the meantime, you flushed the bloodstained paper down the toilet....
and put the cardboard toilet paper tube back in its place."
Then you removed the piece of duct tape from the peephole,
put it back on the gift...
and walked out pretending you didn't know what happened.
No.
I think you took the tape off before the light came back on.
He bent the tape so that it could be easily removed
even in the dark.
Because if the light had come back on,
even if it was just for an instant before he pulled the tape off,
and someone would have noticed the peephole...,
from the way the light was shining in...
would have been able to deduce that there was something stuck to it.
But, be that as it may,
the cardboard tube of the toilet paper roll is a little out of place:
a clear indication that someone has taken it out and then forced it in.
If the police... examine the tube, the case will be solved.
They will find traces of blood from en Tengo Anzai...
and your fingerprints.
-You never stab in Tengo!
-That's a lie, isn't it, Ozumi?
You're getting on my nerves.
How come you call me, your boyfriend, by my last name,
and the Azumi, instead, you call her by her first name?
I-I've always told you, I've always told you that we're childhood friends.
You're not just childhood friends, are you?
I know there's more to it!
It's... it's that...
What?
Do you see it?
You can't tell me!
I'm sure he's your ex-boyfriend, but you want to keep it a secret.
That's why I hurt him, because he felt the same pain as me!

To tell you the truth, I got scared,
because I stabbed her harder than I intended to.
Well, no, I think the two of them...
must be half-brothers... from different mothers.
-Oh!
-But what are you saying?
Yui, you told me before that you kept the secret to protect a person.
And that when you were little you thought you didn't have any secret.
You didn't talk about in I have,
but you meant someone in the Anzai family, right?
In this case the first person I can think of is her father,
who is a member of Parliament.
Now as a grown-up you had to hide it
because maybe something like that could end his career.
So, probably Yui...
must be the secret daughter of his mistress.
Well, th-that's what she told me at Heiji!
Oh?
- (both) Mm.
-Aaa... yes, exactly!
-Aaa... yes.
-Is it true, this?
While my parents were arguing about their stuff,
me and Tengo were playing together.
Since we were left alone a lot, we became friends.
This... is a lie.
It can't be, I don't believe it.
I don't know why, but I think you're pulling my leg.
-Ah...
- (cell phone)
A... call?
- "Too bad, you bastard!"
-Tell me?
"The next time I see you, I'm going to kill you!"
I know my behavior may not have been very correct.
I understand that you came to the wrong conclusion, but...
Hey, I sent Yui's birthday video to your cell phone...
so you can watch it.
Check it out.
And to think I had planned to turn the volume up really high
so you could even feel it from the toilet...
"Come on, bye! Come see me at the hospital, you guys!"
Aaa... the... the anniversary video?
"Attention to the news!"
"The Yui and I are step-siblings, from different mother. Yes, sir!"
"La Yui didn't want me to comment,
"Because there will be an election soon and my father is running,
but I don't care about that!"
"Take care of my big sister, okay, Ozumi?"
"Or do I have to tell you... 'big brother'?"
"Bye!"
No... it can't be...
It can't be...
(Cries)
Hey, what did it cost you to clear things up, instead of stabbing him?
Eh?
I can't keep wasting my time with these things,
I have to run to Kinza Island 4!
-No, we're not going to Kinza.
- (door, bell: nobody-nobody)
-Ka... Kazuha!
-We're going to the station.
We'd better hurry if we don't want to miss the train home!
Aaa... one moment, Heiji, wait!
It's just that we still have to ask him a few questions about the case.
But... I'd say the rest of the witnesses will be enough.
Eh?
But how...?
Shinichi Wada is gone too?
It was here until a moment ago.
Shinichi Wada?
He was a rather strange man, he said he worked in the medical field.
It could be a fake name.
Some time ago, Shinichi explained something to me:
That the Holmes novels that were translated into Japanese
during the Meiji era were set in Japan,
and that both Holmes and Watson
were described as being Japanese.
The Japanese name for en Watson was Shinichi Wada, a military doctor.
Just a possibility, but...
(Shinichi, thinks) "It's true."
"And he has decided to call himself Shinichi Wada and not Taioku Komuro,
which is the Japanese name for Holmes..."
"Do you mean that there is someone who plays Holmes
and who was telling you which poem to recite...
To give us clues?"
Yorisou Futari ni kimi ga oobaarappu.
Ironaki kaze ni Omois hasete.
Furet té no nukumori ima mo....
Stop Jikan wo tomete.
You Itsu no datte

Aita toki ni AENA.

Kawa no Nagare ni Inori wo komete.
Y've been thinking about you.
Y've been thinking about you.
Itsumo kokoro kimi no soba.

A great deduction.
I'm impressed.
(Mobile: woman) "It hasn't been any deduction."
In the background, as the man shouted,
I could hear the sound of something peeling off.
The sound?
Come to think of it, I think I heard a very faint noise....
- "(something peeling off: rac)"
- (man) "Aaaah...!"
But I'm very glad...
"...that my clue has helped in Heiji."

As one day, sooner or later, I will become his wife,
it's normal for me to help him, isn't it?
By the way, when you recited the poem about the autumn wind...
I was moved.
"I'm sorry I didn't do it better."
"So, what did you think of Heiji?"
"What do you think?"
I'm not the least bit surprised that he noticed.
His character and deduction skills
are remarkable.
Now, it seems to me that he's interested in a girl.
But he can't compare to you, Miss Momiji.
I, at Muga,
am willing to do my best to help you.
- (all) Eh?!
-Oh!
A box of in Kichiemon Samizu!
Mr. Tomoyose and his wife have made a donation
of all their books in the library.
We have placed them in this room.
(Kogoro) Mm... It looks like an ordinary box to me.
(Woman) It's exactly the kind of object
that the Silver Moon Wizard would like to get.
It's a very special gem.

'On Kaito Kid and the Secret Box (Part One)'."
