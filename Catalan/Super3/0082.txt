"The handle of a spinning clock, a shooting star..."
"My deductions are your medicine."
"Today's case will tell us about the secret behind a kidnapping."
"It's... Detective Conan!"

DETECTIVE CONAN
"In Mitsuhiko, Ayumi, Genta and I were playing
when we randomly bumped into Minami Takayama,
the singer of the Two-Mix group, who invited us to lunch."
"Minami had gone incognito from the concert palace
to look for her partner, because she couldn't find him."
"But in that same restaurant she was kidnapped in front of us."
"The kidnappers' demands
were the bag that Minami had left behind in the restaurant."
"They demanded that we bring them the Junior Detective League."
"It seems that their target is the Two-mix model."
"Complying with their demands, we took the bag,
and one of the kidnappers contacted us."
"He asked the Ayumi to go alone to bring the tape to him."
"But I couldn't allow that. And I came up with a plan."
(Phone)
(Ayumi's voice) Yes?
Hello?
(Kidnapper) I'm glad you're here.
There must not be any police...
No, there doesn't seem to be anyone.
From now on you'll do whatever I tell you to do.
Yes, I'll do everything I can!
The kidnapping of the famous singers, part 2
That Conan and Ayumi have exchanged roles?
What's on your mind?
-The kidnappers want the tape! -And Ayumi took it to them.
And Conan impersonated me!
Why didn't you tell us before, about the exchange of roles?
It was better to make them believe that their plan had succeeded.
That's why in Conan I didn't want you to notice the change.
But this way we will not be able to capture the kidnappers.
And Conan will be in danger.
No.
If he tracks you with these glasses...
Xxxt!
If you tell him everything, Conan will get the glory.
Even if we warn the police, it will take the same to arrive!
As we will have saved the Two-Mix...
"The Junior Detectives league saves them!"
Thanks so much, guys!
We're off the hook.
Thank you.
Let's go!
The Junior League of Detectives will capture the kidnappers!
(All) Yes!
Why are you calling like this?
Yeah... yeah... yeah, we're really hungry... wasn't that it, guys?
Yes, that's right.
We were saying yes, we were starving!
Well, let's go buy something to eat.
Come right back.
(All) Yes.
(All) How hungry I am!
How hungry I am!
How hungry I am!
How hungry I am!
(Phone)
(Ayumi's voice) Hello?
(Kidnapper) I see you're coming alone.
Now you'll take the tape on the second floor of the warehouse you see from here.
There the Two-mix are waiting for you.
Your work ends here.
You can start chanting prayers to Buddha.
(Knock on the door) I've brought it.
Really?
Thanks a lot, kiddo.
Who the hell are you...?
The guy who was in the restaurant isn't here?
-They're over there. I have no doubt.
I hope Conan's all right.
What are we going to do now?
-We have to talk to the police. We can do it from that booth over there.
Yes, let's go!
119!
Genta, this is the firemen's!
The one for the police is 110.
First you have to press this button.
(Man) Police, hello?
We want to talk to Inspector Megure.
(Police) What did you say?
Can you hear me?
Is there anything wrong with you guys?
What are you doing here?
They made me wear that tape.
Those guys have not stopped asking us where it was.
Why do they want it?
I'll tell you in detail when we get out of here.
The police will be here soon.
The police?
They must be on their way here because of my glasses.
They're connected to this transmitter.
Who... Who are you?
My name is Conan Edogawa.
I'm a detective!
-A... Detect?
Au, we're leaving before the other kidnapper returns.

The glasses you were talking about are these here?
Conan...
But you guys... What are you doing here?
I caught them when they were wandering around.
Why didn't you give the glasses to the police?
It's just that...
Ha-ha-ha!
I'll have a great time, with your friends...
...by sending them to the other neighborhood.
Good bye.
Since you're friends, you'll be charred in good company.
At least tell us why you kidnapped us!
Once in the other world ask the god Shaka.
"The countdown bell begins to ring."
"It moves our hearts and makes us go fast."
"See how it tolls: One, two..."
"Like fireworks shining out of season..."
Don't tell me that...
Yes.
It's the lyrics to the song on the demo.
And the motive for the kidnapping.
Satoshi Miyahara, am I right?
On New Year's Eve of last year.
he killed a man by the shōen temple.
-New Year's Eve? -The shōen temple!
That's where we came up with the lyrics!
The crux of the matter.
It seemed to them that the chimes were ringing before their time
because that murder was near the temple.
You stated: "I was attacked by a strange man with a gun,
and while we struggled, the revolver went off."
It was ruled that everything had been in self-defense.
But that revolver, you were carrying it to kill that man.
You executed your plan.
With the first shot you hit the heart.
Then you put a bullet back in the same chamber of the barrel.
To make sure there was no powder left on the body,
he put the revolver in the poor man's right hand.
He pointed it directly at the ground and pulled the trigger.
He thought there were no witnesses,
and while he was contacting the police,
the man sleeping in front of the door
removed the bullet and the incriminating cartridge.
There was a witness.
Someone had heard the shots.
Then we heard...
Yes, I mean the two musicians from Two-Mix!
"The countdown bell" is the chimes of the turn of the year.
"Fireworks" are the two features that were felt.
Then, "In 1996 comes running towards us."
If we add that the Two-Mix that night talked about shōen over the radio,
it becomes clear that two shots rang out that day.
You heard the demo over the radio!
That is why you set out to kidnap them.
I wanted to eliminate them and the model
before the police started to connect the dots.
I see you're a pretty smart guy.
Indeed, I am Satoshi Miyahara.
I killed the partner with whom we committed a robbery.
He showed up threatening to report us to the police.
We had to kill him.
It was the only alternative.
Didn't you think that by running away you were off the hook?
I had no choice.
Someone saw me before the events.
The high priest of the temple saw me.
Fortunately, the priest was hard of hearing,
and he was intent on ringing the bell,
so I left him alive.
But I would not have imagined that someone would make the lyrics of a song.
(Mobile)
Hey!
A cell phone!
Get it over here!
(Beep-beep)
(Beep-beep)
It's what my partner had taken from his long-haired little friend!
(Beep-beep)
With creatures, you must always be on the lookout.
(Beep-beep)
But it's too late.
(Beep-beep)
You'll burn to death before the police arrive.
(Beep-beep)
Make yourselves comfortable and enjoy the moment.
(Beep-beep)
Yes?
Hello?
Ah, that was you, Inspector Megure.
I've already released the hostages and that group of children.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
You didn't talk about the role reversal at Conan.
Some children called 110 asking for Inspector Megure,
but then they hung up.
When did they call?
About a quarter ago.
Why didn't you tell me?
Since they didn't say what they wanted, they thought it was a joke.
Did you trace the call?
No, it was too brief to do so.
If the kidnapper had cut it and not the children, it is possible that....
(Banging and gasping)
I can't!
It's still intact!
(Thinking) "If I spike it with full power..."
It comes out of the middle!
(Thinks) "Too bad! It didn't work."
Are you all right?
How are you doing?

If we go on like this, I won't be able to help them!"
Don't breathe the smoke!
Put your body lower!
Na... Nano.
You're all right, uncle?!
You have to resist!
Nano!
Damn it, you're always giving me work to do!
(cell phone rings)
What annoying cops.
(Beep-beep!)
Stop it!
(Junior detectives) Hello!
We've escaped, pacifier!
(Minami) We called you from a phone booth!
If you don't believe it, go look.
They're not here!
But how...?
How did you do it, to run away?
(At the same time) We made it!
This mobile phone-pendant has been very useful, hasn't it?
Of course it has!
Au, if we leave, we'll be on time for the concert!
Let's go!
To the ground!
Shi... Shiina!
Don't take me for a fool, kids.
I'm going to kill you one by one.
(Thinks) "You bastard!"
-Minami, you're fantastic! -You're super strong!
Ugh, so close!
"After 10 minutes
a patrol car arrived along with the fire engine."
"They arrested the kidnappers."
"Naturally, the Junior Detectives am getting a good scolding."
"But the Minami interceded on our behalf
and we were pardoned."
"Then we went to the Budokan with Inspector Megure's car."
-What are they doing? -They're more than half an hour late!
(Shouts)
We are arranged.
The spectators are very excited.
We're going to change clothes, wait for us backstage.
What?
Backstage?
Sure, I'd like to introduce you to everyone.
Everyone?
-The Minami hasn't arrived yet? -What the hell must they be doing?
Dipensin, now we're right behind the stage?
Hey!
You can't enter without permission!
Go back to your seats!
The Minami has asked us to come.
The Minami is here?
Leave the entrance of the first item ready!
Someone ask her how much she has.
-Excuse me, what is this? -Out! -Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!
-Are you starting? -That's good!
-It's about time! -They're finally starting!
The lights have gone out...
-I want to do it! -Quiets!

We are lost!
The music has started to play!
What shall we do?
The Minami is not here!
Hurry, stop the music!
If we stop it, the spectators will be furious!
-And what shall we do then? -I don't know!
Do you have the lyrics of the song?
The lyrics are the brochure of the single.
But what do you want to do?
Wait, you mustn't want to...

(Even if I run away from you, follow me, I'm begging you.
Even if I run away from you, follow me, I'm begging you.
You know I'll wait for you.
I want you to hold me!
You know I'll wait for you...
Haven't we heard this voice somewhere else?
Don't make jokes, you're scaring me.
(Shouting)
But who is singing?
How bad...- But it sounds like Takayama's voice.
So bad, have I done it?
(Break my lies)

-Well, we're off.
-Good job!
-Good job, guys!
-Good job!
Tell me, how did you like it, singing on stage?
-It was great!
-It's exciting!
I'd go back!
When you try it once, you don't want to leave!
What do you say, little detective?
How did you like performing at a concert?!
It's nothing to write home about, but...
Ah!
What a little loose!
(Knock on the door)
Yes, come in!
Are the musicians here?
Ah, Mr. inspector.
Is something wrong?
No.
I'm sorry to bother you if you're tired,
but I'd like you to come to the station to make a statement.
Ah.
Wait a moment.
There's no hurry either.
You have time.

It was a magnificent concert!
Thank you very much.
You have!
In appreciation for your help!
Practice, at home!
(All) Yes!
And also for you, gentlemen.
Thank you, it was also not necessary...
But while we're at it, shall we take a picture?
Ha-ha-ha!
As you wish.
Let's go!
How much do you make one plus one?
(All) Dooooooos!
