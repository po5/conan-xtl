DETECTIVE CONAN
The shiny fish
(Ayumi) -Oh, it's beautiful!
(Genta) How cool!
(Mitsuhiko) It's wonderful!
It could be a treasure map.
(Ayumi) -I liked the golden mask, it was interesting.
Although there are many treasures to be discovered around the world, and more beautiful ones.
Well, I'd love to go looking for one, treasure!
What is it?
(Ayumi) -What is it?
(Ayumi) -What is this? -There are some strange drawings.
(Ayumi) Hey!
Such is a treasure map!
(Ayumi) -What?!
-A treasure map?
What nonsense.
What's wrong with you, are you a donkey or what?
Don't you think you're Ayumi?
Man, I...
What do you think, fool? Why do you get so angry?
(Genta) So that the Ayumi doesn't say, of nonsense.
(Mitsuhiko) She always says things that are true.
Don't get angry.
I'm just saying that you can't find treasure maps on the street.
(Genta) Who says it, that not? I do.
(Mitsuhiko) How do you know? I don't know.
We'll go look for the treasure!
From today we are the Junior Detective League!
(Mitsuhiko) -Huh?
The Junior Detective League? -How exciting!
I, Genta Kojima, will be the boss!
Anybody got anything against it?
Sir, I'm starting to get a headache...
Follow me!
Yes! Yes!
-Where are we going?
-I don't know.
Let me see this piece of paper.
-Huh?
-Huh?
You got it.
See this sign on top of everything.
You don't remember anything?
-Eeeeh? -Eeeeh?
-Aaaaah! -Aaaaah!
Let's go!
Let's run!
(TV) "Dino Cabane, head of an Italian robbery gang,
was arrested last night
in an apartment near the Tokyo Tower."
"They haven't been able to get him to confess."
"Police are looking for Cabane's accomplices,
"but have no clue as to where they or the 15,000 coins
neither they nor the 15,000 gold coins they stole."
I already knew it had some connection to Tokyo Tower.
We are about to find the treasure.
What does it mean, these letters?
It says GOLD, here.
Gold?
Yes!
I know what it means!
The first O is an O as in wave,
the R is for rock, and the other O is for ocean.
O, R, O, means wave, rock and ocean!
Caram, Mitsuhiko!
I didn't know you were so smart!
Of course!
(Think) "What a bore."
There will be a huge treasure! Yes, believe it!
Of course there will!
I'll go to the best restaurants in the world.
I will go around the world 100 times!
I'll buy a rocket to travel through space.
What about you, Conan?
Well, maybe I'll save up.
Come on, I'm bored.
I'm sorry...
Come on, let's take it from here!
First we must decipher the hieroglyphic.
But... it's just that apart from the umbrella,
the other signs are so strange, that I don't know what they are...
I've got it!
A moon... it's a moon!
The treasure is somewhere where the moon can be seen over the tower.
The position of the moon changes every night.
Besides, it's hard to pinpoint the exact position.
Very well, then, where is it!
And you, Conan, have you thought of something?
No, but these other signs...
Aren't they abbreviations of other things?
There is a hat under the sign of the tower,
and underneath a pair of panties,
and the umbrella could be a brand of sweater.
And what do they all have in common?
(At the same time) A clothing store!
But we still don't know anything... Eh?
(At the same time) Let's go!
Hey, hey, hey!
Espereu's-e!
(Look for him, look for him!
He could be here...
Surely somewhere there's a clue!
Search!
Search!
Oh, no.
Hey, stop, stop, nanos!
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
(Man) Get out!
You are rude!
And don't ever come back!
(Genta) It wasn't supposed to be a clothing store.
I'm hungry.
-Shall we go get some food? (Genta) -Yes...

Could we stop by the bookstore?
They don't sell food in the bookstore!
Just a moment..., understood?
Wow, how cool!
See, that's fun!
Oh, yes, how nice!
(Thinking) "GOLD... GOLD..."
"Is that an English word?"
"No, it's not, here."
"Now I'll try..."
"Mmmm?"
"Italian?"
"Yes, the thieves are."
"I've got it! ORO, it means gold, in Italian! Oro!"
"This means..."
"... that this hieroglyph must be a treasure map !?"
(TV) "Dino Cabane, head of a gang of Italian robbers,
was arrested yesterday,
but his accomplices are at large somewhere in Japan."
"It is also unknown where the 15,000 gold coins valued at 600 million yen may be.
valued at 600 million yen..."
600 million!
Gee, what professionals.
Wow... it's all messed up again.
Father, you're a slob!
By the way girl... where has he gone, the boy?
Conan left early to go to the art museum.
Wow... how well they live, the children...
Hey, father belluga't!
Help me clean up, please!
(TV) "According to the Italian police...
(TV) "According to the Italian police,
there are 3 members of the gang of the Cabane at large
and we were informed that one member of this gang is Japanese."
What does he do, in Conan?
To know!
He has been with the signs for hours!
Maybe he has deciphered them.
(He thinks) "Wow! I don't get it!"
"What does it mean, this hieroglyphic?"
"Is it a map? Or is it some kind of message?"
Oh... what nerves!
Oh!
Look, look!
Maybe it's this sign!
See this sign?
It's the same as the second sign!
Yes, you're right.
This means... maybe this sign is...
This shop is located on top of the Tokyo tower.
These signs are store sign designs!
Well, if we follow the signs, they will lead us to the treasure.
But, let's see.
Where do we go from here?
The street "Moon view"?
You mean, the moon on the side of the tower?
That must be it... come on!
Look!
It's here!
An upside down triangle!
You're right!
It's just like the third sign!
Yes, it is.
So these signs are...
An aquarium!
It's a map of the route you must make
from Tokyo Tower to Nanbu Aquarium!
The signs are signs for the stores on the street!
And at the end of the street, you will find...
-A huge treasure! -A huge treasure!
-Let's go then!
-Yes!
I don't understand, the fifth sign, a star-shaped sign...
As close as we were to the treasure!
Look!
We have arrived at the aquarium!
Wow... It can't be!
"What's the meaning of this?"
"The street 'Moon View' goes from the tower to the aquarium."
"The fifth sign must be this way."
"And if my deduction wasn't correct?"
"But why was it written in Italian, the word gold?"
"If an Italian had drawn it..."
Then...
I think... I've got it, guys!
-Huh? -Huh?
We're back to square one!
Wait, Conan!
(Think) "The person who used the Italian word,
would not use moon to indicate a Japanese street."
"Luna means night! Something visible only at night."
Sure, neon lights!
Hey, Conan... what the hell did you find out?
The signs on this map are neon street sign shapes.
And the second sign is...
...there!
Look at it!
You're right!
Well, let's go, right away!
We must find the sign in the shape of an umbrella!
I don't see any sign, in the shape of an umbrella.
You must be mistaken.
I've already found it.
What?!
There.
Eh?
But you're blind?
It's a sun.
Ah, right, rain!
When they drew the signs, the forecast was for rain!
Now, the star-shaped one!
I've already found it!
-Look, I'm sure that's it! -A wheel!
It's just like the fifth sign!
Well, the sixth sign must be nearby.
But where?
I don't see it anywhere.
There it is!
That's the sixth sign!
Hey, Conan... you mean it's here, the treasure we're looking for?
Yes, according to the map, the word GOLD is next to the sixth sign.
But I've looked everywhere and I can't find the seventh.

The last sign is a sign in the shape of a fish.
Of course you can't find it.
It's a residential area.
There are no fish here, except the river.
The river, of course, man!
You mean a fish in the river!
What a ?!
Yeah, come on, let's go to the river!
Hey, wait!
(Ayumi) Hey... Come on, Genta... will you stop it?
It's dangerous!
Stop, man!
(Ayumi) Shut up!
The treasure must be this way, I'm sure of it.
Ouch!
How cold!
(Think) "No. All these signs... they're all things you see at night."
"It can't be that this last fish sign refers to a river."
"If I'm not mistaken,
this fish-shaped sign must be this way!"
(laughs)
Conan, what's so funny?!
(laughs)
I've finally found it.
I found the shiny fish!
(Mitsuhiko) -The shiny fish?
(Genta) - And where is it?!
Come on, follow me!
(Genta) Gee, boy!
I don't think we found any shiny fish, here!
It's so dark that I can't see anything!
Don't be discouraged and look out.
Look towards the river. (Genta) The river?
Look, over there.
From here we will see the shining fish!
(Ayumi) The lights reflect in the water and take the shape of fish.
(Ayumi) The eyes are the lights!
And the treasure must be here? I'm sure the treasure is...
Is it this way?
Eh?
(Ayumi) Wow!
A gold coin!
"Gee, what is it, that thing?!"
"It looks like it's got a rope tied to it."
"Man, they've hung up the bag of gold coins!"
Look!
The treasure!
It's the treasure!
Eh?
I heartily congratulate you, kids.
Eh?
But... Who are you?
(Think) "I've seen you in front of Tokyo Tower."
robbers?"
This treasure is ours, we found it ourselves!
Genta... be still!
What a rage!
Genta, are you all right, my friend?
"Very well..."
"So they don't know where the coins are..."
Who are they, those bad guys?
They must be those Italian robbers.
-Eh?
-A gang of robbers?
I've seen it on the TV news!
This means that the coins...
(Man) Exactly.
We stole these coins from an Italian bank,
but that was over a year ago.
We did it following the orders of our boss, the famous Cabane.
But Cabane tricked us and came in Japan,
and took the 15,000 gold coins.
"Then we came to Japan and found him,
but he had already had time to hide them."
He wouldn't tell us where he hid them,
and that's all we found.
"He wouldn't cooperate, so we reported him to the police,
and we looked for the coins following the signs."
But the paper flew away from us when we were at the art museum.
He picked it up and started to decipher the signs,
and we thought we'd let you finish the job.
But we hadn't imagined that you would find the coins.
Oh... A gun!
Conan, what do we do?
Sing boyfriend!
Where are they, the coins?
Where are they?
Speak up, kid!
The fish... What is it?
It's like I tell you:
the coins are just the point
where the fish and the view of the bridge coincide at night!
Ah, I get it...
Conan!
Why did you tell them?
Now they will kill us, when they find the coins!
(He thinks) "They want to kill us anyway..."
Oh my God, they'll kill us... In a moment they will kill us.
I think they will cover us with cement and throw us into the sea....
No, they don't want to leave any traces, and they'll burn us alive.
M... mom.
Papa...
Mama...
Listen, we can't give up so soon.
We still have a chance, but we must join forces!
Even if we join forces...
We're just kids...
We're the Junior Detective League!
You're right!
What do you want us to do?
Let's get up quietly so we won't be seen.
(Think) "We only have one chance."
"When they've found the coins, we'll run away."
Runeeeeeeeu!
-We made it! - We made it!
"We ran out and saw" go to report the facts."
"They arrested the members of the Italian gang
and the case was finally solved."

"It was the Junior Detective League's first feat."

DETECTIVE CONAN
Oh!
I congratulate you!
It seems impossible that I was able to decipher the hieroglyphic!
And captured the thieves!
-Me!
I have captured them all! -And I have deciphered the hieroglyph!
They are liars!
Conan did it all!
He has deciphered the signs and captured the thieves!
Yes, it was really impressive!
What?
Conan...
Thank you.
Wow!
Congratulations, little Conan!
You have a very pretty bride!
Hey, wait, no, no!
She's not my girlfriend!
Oh, it turns red, how cute!
I already told you, you're wrong!
(Genta thinks) "Screw you, Conan!"
(Mitsuhiko) "Screw you, Conan!"
(Genta thinks) "Geez, I wanted to ask more questions though!"
"Who has the bomb?"
I can't find it.
I can't find it.
Aaaaaaaah!
Nooooo!
"There's only one solution to make them believe me."
"I have to tell them that I'm Shinichi Kudo!"
