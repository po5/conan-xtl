Hmm...
Togashi!
Tell me what happened!
I need to know the truth!
Togashi...
Hmm...
Father...
(Shinichi voice) "Today, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon,
"This man, in Fumitaka Togashi,
was to testify before the prosecutor as a murder suspect."
"They were about to take him to the prosecutor's office. It all started yesterday."
"Love is magic and triumphs over mystery."
"Connect with Conan at the hour of suspense!"
"Mr. Mouri will endeavor to get a suspect to talk
in the interrogation room."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

(Birds: chirping)
Aaah...
Very good!
Go!
Pass it!
(Birds chirping) Very good!
Fantastic!
Run, run, run!
- Togashi! (Kogoro) -Huh?
(Kogoro) Congratulations.
You're now free!
Se... Mr. Mouri!
"In Fumitaka Togashi is an assassin that Mr. Mouri arrested
when he was a police inspector."
"He got out of jail today."
- (child 1) Oysters! - (child 2) Oysters!
(child 2) Excuse me!
Hey, mister!
Here, here!
Thank you, sir!
(boy) Thank you!
(Boy) Thank you very much!
Come on, I invite you to eat to celebrate.
What do you say?
Eh... I'm sorry, I have to go.
I've got to go.
What's that?
Hey, Togashi!
Wait for me, Hakamada!
"A few hours later, a crime was committed."
Ah!
Aaah !!!!
Iaaaaaaaaaaah !!!!!
(Wheels: squeaking)
Tonight, the parole officer Takehiko Sakuraba
parole officer Takehiko Sakuraba,
a resident of the Beika neighborhood.
(TV) "Police have arrested ex-convict Fumitaka Togashi,
"aged 32,
"who was released from Musashino Prison yesterday on parole
under the supervision of the murdered officer."
It can't be!
I don't believe it!
It can't be true!
(Mermaid)
Keeping your mouth shut won't make you look any less guilty, Togashi.
(Door, open)
Detective Mouri has come, it's outside.
(Siren) Who?
I get it.
It was you, who arrested Togashi.
Yes.
"He got into a fight with another nano over a trifle and killed him."
"His lawyer claimed self-defense,
"But the court was very defiant...
and, since he had a record, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison."
"But at heart he is a good boy who loves his mother madly."
"In prison he completely reformed himself
and became a model prisoner."
I can't believe he killed again.
And just yesterday, when he was released.
It must be a mistake.
I understand how you feel, but... (door, open)
Hm? (Man) Bufa, what a pearl.
They already say that, since people don't change just like that.
So, Inspector,
we will transfer it to the prosecutor's office as planned.
Yes, clarify.
I... can't you wait a moment?
Mr. Mouri, right?
There's a lot of talk about you.
Maybe you used to be somebody, but now you're just a simple detective.
Stay out of our business.
Kasamatsu, make the preparations.
-Yes. -But... inspector!
But the prosecutor's office isn't expected until 4 o'clock.
We'll take the opportunity to rest for a while.
And in the meantime, Togashi will stay in the interrogation room.
Ah...
What... what nonsense!
I guess you're joking.
Inform your superior for me.
Hm... Bah.
I thank you, Mr. Inspector.
Sleeping Kogoro.
We owe you a pile of favors, you know that.
I repeat: you have time until 4 o'clock.
That's clear.
Oh.
"This is how Mr. Mouri has obtained special permission
to interrogate in Togashi, but..."
Togashi!
Please tell me the truth!
Togashi!

Oh, father...
Hmm...
The victim's wounds are concentrated
on the right side of the body.
Ouch!
Who gave you permission to remove, peeping tom?
This means the culprit was holding the gun in his left hand.
Yes.
A witness confirmed it to us.
Well, the man you've arrested is right-handed.
Yes.
But there were wounds on the left side of the body as well.
The killer must have changed his handgun while struggling with the victim.
(Think, see Shinichi) "Maybe yes, it's a possibility."
"There's only one way to check."
Hey, where is the sink?
I'll wait for you not to get lost when you go out.
Thank you.
(Mobile)
Tell me?
Mr. Mouri!
(Mobile) Gee!
And the interrogation?
(Kogoro voice) "I've taken a break to go eat."
I'm calling to ask you a favor, Takagi.
(Kogoro voice) What?
Yes, oh so much.
To go to the crime scene?
All right, you understand.
I'll do it.
Also, regarding the Ran...
The father wants me to go home?
Yes.
He says don't worry, everything will be fine.
Besides, Conan is gone too.
I'll leave you, I'm in a hurry.
Hey, wait!
Wait, wait!
Go!
Here everyone goes his own way.
Co... Conan!
Mr. Mouri has forgotten to tell you some things
and he wants me to come with you.
What?
This is what he told you? That's right.
Hurry up, we're running out of time!
Don't you remember, Togashi?
The first few months you wrote to me from prison.
You told me that you had changed and that you regretted what you had done.
That you would become a new man and take care of your mother.
And so you did, you are going to start over.
I had never been so happy to have become a policeman.
But your mother must have had a joy.
I hope she's well.
What's wrong, Togashi?
What do you got, Togashi?
(Takagi) Aai... Quim remedy!
At least don't touch anything without permission.
Can you feel me, Conan? Yes!
(Kogoro voice) "Check the witness statement
from another point of the stage."
And how do you want me to do that? Listen.
The witness saw the culprit from this window, right?
(Kogoro voice) What?
Yes.
In fact, he's still here.
It's that lady.
That's strange.
Huh?
How come the two bloodstains are so far apart?
Ben observed!
Well, I don't know.
And these crystals must be fragments of the broken mirror.
Yeah, from the mirror on the closet door.
It must have shattered as the killer struggled with the victim.
And this is where the weapon was found? Yes.
No prints?
To the gun, you mean?
We haven't found any, the killer must have wiped it clean.
And apart from the gun... hmm...
also clean the door and other parts of the house that he had touched.
Let's see?
E-ei! Hmm...
No prints from the victim.
Well, no.
The kitchen, the toilet, the bedroom...
Even though the victim lived here, his prints were nowhere.
Why would the killer wipe them off?
What time was Mr. Togashi arrested yesterday?
And where was he?
Let's see...
At half past eleven at night, in Beika Park.
And what time did the neighbor see the crime?
10 minutes before, she says it was 10:20.
From here to Beika's park it must be 7 or 8 minutes running.
That means...
(thinks) "He didn't have time to clean up the footprints
after committing the crime."
"That's impossible!"
...he wiped the footprints before?
What nonsense!
What if while he was committing the crime...?
Shut up, maybe there was someone!
"Yes, it's very likely. But..."
The thing is that Togashi was alone when he was arrested.
Maybe they fled separately! The events are still very recent.
If we look for more witnesses... That's right!
Togashi, that time, when I arrested you,
"A group of hooligans had beaten up your friend
and left her seriously injured."
"You went off in a rage and lost your way."
Don't tell me you didn't do for someone!
That you wanted to defend someone, perhaps?
Togashi.
Talk, tell me what happened!
I need to know the truth!
Oh!
Here, stop it!
What? Isn't it...?
Who, this man?
That you know him?
(He thinks) "Yes, I'd say it's him."
"Now I get it!"

"Eh? What's this?"
By the way, we should look into what...
Mr. Mouri forgot to tell you.
That's right, I didn't remember!
Let's see, he said to check the witness statement...
from the scene of the crime and from the place where he witnessed the facts.
You saw the murderer through the window of the house across the street...
from this window, didn't you, ma'am?
Oh, yes, I did.
It was spooky!
There was a lot of thunder and the lights went out.
"I happened to look out the window and..."
Ah!
"I didn't see his face, but I got the impression he was looking at me."
"And then, all of a sudden..."
Iaaaaaaah !!!!
"But what does it say? That he threw the murder weapon against the window?"
-But ma'am, the murder weapon... -What?
"Yes."
"The weapon was not near the window but next to the closet."
-Are you sure? -I have very good eyesight, me.
I haven't changed my prescription since I was 30 years old.
And what happened after that?
I do not know, then I did not see anything else.
Although it continued to thunder and flash.
"Sure, I got it!"
"If this is what really happened,
the truth will be hard to fit."
"Mister Mouri!"
(Kogoro) J-is it time already, inspector?
I'm sorry, Mouri.
Aviat will be time, Mr. Mouri.
Just a moment!
It'll be a while yet.
Speak, Togashi!
Tell me the truth!
Let it go! Mouri, it's over.
Togashi...
Aah!
Easy, Mr. Mouri.
Ow, just sit here.
Inspector Takagi told me to tell you that...
Sorry, I'm leaving now.
May I know what happened?
What was it, this strange dance?
If he does as usual, he'll talk now.
(Kogoro voice) Wait a minute.
In this case there is a cat in the bag.
Yes, yes!
It's starting!
It can't be!
Is this the Sleeping Kogoro everyone's talking about?
(Kogoro voice) But I assure you that I will have it solved before 4 o'clock,
the time of the transfer to the prosecutor's office.
Okay, you're free to go.
But if... We're on schedule, let him talk.
Why do you say there's a catch in this case?
Based on what I've discovered,
it's very likely that at the crime scene
was someone else besides Mr. Togashi.
What... what are you saying! It doesn't make any sense at all!
Inspector Takagi is checking the identity of the other man.
And now he's going to say he's the real culprit, right?
And what else!
The neighbor across the street said it was him, the man she saw.
-She didn't see his face. -Well, yes, it's true.
And how come he had blood on his clothes, eh?
We've already tested it, and it matches the victim's blood.
And, unfortunately, we have a motive.
"A motive?"
The dead guy was a rogue probation officer.
"He was acting very cunningly so that no one could report him."
"He preyed on the weaknesses of the inmates' families
to extort money from them."
His mother was a victim of his abuse
and she died of an illness last year.
No? Ah...
So... (Takagi) No. (Takagi) No.
Hm?
There's another man who had the same motive.
His wife and son were extorted and committed suicide.
It comes out on the supermarket's security camera footage.
Tsuneo Hakamada, 34 years old.
Yesterday he was released on parole along with Mr.
Togashi.
In addition, Hakamada is left-handed.
This would explain why the victim's wounds were on the right side of the body.
were on the right side of the body.
It is true, the neighbor has testified...
that the culprit was holding the gun in his left hand.
Locate a certain Tsuneo Hakamada,
who was released from Musashino prison yesterday!
Right now!
No!
He didn't... he had nothing to do with it!
It was me.
I did it!
Did you...? What are you talking about?
Wh-what are you saying?
That Hakamada just turned you in?
What? How?
Really? (Togashi) Hakamada!
(Togashi) Hakamada!
(Togashi) But... (Togashi) Why?
Take it easy, Togashi.
I was planning to turn myself in
after visiting my wife and son's grave.
Then there's no doubt that the perpetrator of the crime is you.
Yes.
Togashi and I became friends in prison
and I explained to him that I planned to kill in Sakuraba.
He tried to stop me,
but I shook him off and committed the crime.
"When he arrived on the scene, en Togashi told me to run away,

"That he would take care of erasing the fingerprints
and whatever else was necessary."
"So I ran and fled without thinking about it."
And now he's been arrested in my place.
I was such an idiot!
That is to say, when Hakamada ran away,
in Togashi he didn't know what he had touched
and decided to erase all traces,
even those of the victim;
that's it, right?
That's right, yes. Ben solved, Mouri!
You've once again prevented us from locking up an innocent man behind bars.
Well, I wouldn't be so sure.
Inspector Takagi,
what time was it when the camera recorded at Hakamada?
Well...
Let's see... It was 10:20 at night.
Was it?
So...
"Yes."
"The exact time the neighbor saw the murder from her house."
What does this mean?
That Hakamada was in both places at the same time?
Wait a minute, this is impossible!
In Hakamada he had blood on his clothes.
There is no doubt that it was at the crime scene.
But later, when the neighbor across the street saw the murderer,
in Hakamada he was already gone.
Inspector Takagi.
What did she say, the neighbor, about the murder weapon?
About the murder weapon?
She said...
I didn't see her face, but I got the impression she was looking at me.
And then, all of a sudden...
That he threw the murder weapon at the neighbor?
That's right.
But it's weird, isn't it?
The weapon wasn't near the window, but in front of the closet,
in the middle of the shards of the broken mirror.
So the killer didn't actually throw the murder weapon at the neighbor,
but at the mirror.
What?
W... you mean that what the neighbor saw
was the culprit reflected in the mirror?
"Just the wood!"
"Therefore, the gun was not in his left hand but in his right."
O... oysters!
On the other hand, the murderer was also frightened....
"Seeing a lady reflected in the mirror."
"He threw the gun at her without thinking and broke the mirror."
This means that the man who saw the neighbor was right handed,
while the man who had already fled the crime scene was left-handed.
Wait a minute.
How could it be that the victim was killed twice?
There is only one possible answer.
"The victim, who appeared to be dead,
regained consciousness and was finished off by another man."
No... it can't be!
And this last murderer is... you, Togashi.
No... I couldn't spare him.
That wretch tore apart my family and Hakamada's.
I couldn't forgive him l'hi!
"And finally this long day in the interrogation room is over."

You should have told the truth yesterday,
when I sat in front of you in the interrogation room, Togashi.
Well, although I understand that you didn't want to talk...
to a cheap detective who didn't even know your mother was dead.
The truth is, I was scared to death.
I was afraid to tell the truth
But... if it hadn't been for you,
they would have put all the blame on Hakamada.
-Thank you, Mr. Mouri. What?
What... what let me?
Sometimes I have lapses.
Well, if you say so, I believe it.
Ha-ha-ha!!!
Ran.
Call Eri, please.
The mother?
Do you want to...? No, it's not what you think.
You want to ask her to defend Mr. Togashi, I know!
But we could have lunch together, couldn't we?
I guess, since we're meeting, we could eat together.
If she insists, of course.
(Thinking) "Come on! 'If she insists', 'since we're meeting'..."
"She won't be amused, sorry about that."
Aaah!
I had a shiver!
By the way, how did you get it on your leg?
"You don't have to do anything, you."
Haruna!
Let her be!
