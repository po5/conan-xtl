"The Nanami Kyodo, who does karate with the Ran,
"invited all of us members of the Junior Detective League
to go on a treasure hunt at the Kyodo residence."
"The family mansion he built in Seitaro Kyodo," he said,
"And, because he was a very creative engineer and a bit of a madman,
it's full of artifacts and all kinds of traps."
"The Dark Tower,
"A most mysterious construction,
is a good example, and it has no doors or windows."
"The Nanami was accompanying us.
"Through the interior of the mansion to show us around....
and, suddenly, we heard a woman's cry."
-It's the mother's voice!
- (woman) Aaah!
-Stop!
Keep the children away!
(woman) -Mom!
(woman) Mother!
(woman) Eh?
Momoe!
Momoe!
"Everything suggests...
it has fallen from the top of the Tower."
If you can't get in, to the Tower.
How could it have fallen from up there?
Then how did he get up there?
"We deduced that the murderer must still be inside the tower...
"And we started investigating to find the entrance,
but then Haibara disappeared."
What are you saying?!
(Ayumi) The Ai has disappeared!
(Genta) Ouch!
Haibara!
-Haibara!
-Haibara!
Where are you?!
From this mirror in the wind.
- (Ayumi) Haibaaaara!
- (knocking)
Surely there must be some other entrance!
Next door is the liquor store!
-I'm used to it, from my father.
-Agh!
What a smell of alcohol!
Look at that!
There's a mirror here too!
I don't understand what it's doing here, leaning against the wall.
The mirror isn't here by chance.
(Tsutomu) "When I followed the mother I disappeared."
"I don't know how to explain it better."
This smell...
Not smelled so much, that even t'emborratxaràs.
No.
It is the perfume worn by Mrs. Kyodo.
And all over this area here it feels much stronger.
Oh!
I disappear...
(Genta) What's wrong?
Now you see the ceiling, in the mirror, instead of us.
Because it has become a screen.
It's not a glass.
That's where you can enter.
Maybe that's where the treasure is.
Let's go in.
No.
Maybe there's the killer.
-Aaaaaah!
-Aaaaaaaah!
What do we do now?!
Eeei!
What do we do, Conan?!
What do we do?!
(Door, open)
Haibara!
(Ouch) Aaaah!
She doesn't usually knock like that anymore!
It's the Ay!
No.
I'll go.
You stay here.
We'll be right back!
No!
No!
I'm coming with you too!
Ah...
All right, then, but give me your hand all the time.
All right, then.
"Summer memories are so vivid that they stand the test of time
and solve mysteries."
"Search for the treasure in a world of miracles
and the truth will come to light in a tower that horrifies."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The Secret Treasure of the Dark Tower (part two)."
Tsutomu Kyodo, I understand that you are the person...
who found the lifeless body of Mrs. Momoe Kyodo, right?
Yes.
This is what it looks like.
Can you tell us what you were doing there?
What were you doing there?
Picking watercress.
I had gone out for a moment to pick watercress because I was cooking.
I have them in a hydroponic crop by the creek next to the tower.
Ah.
Okay, then.
The blue-green color of watercress stimulates the eye and the appetite.
Eh?
It's very strange.
Nanami.
Have they appeared, in Conan and company?
Just now I was calling him, Conan.
No one has seen them leave the farm outside.
And no... it can't be that they went to look for the treasure alone?!
Father!
What is it, this noise?
Don't get nervous!
It is not real!
A flood!

Close your eyes!
Aaaaah!
Aaaah!
Fire!
I'm burning!
It's not real either.
It's just hot air.
Try to calm down, Ayumi.
Mm-hm.
I'll try.
When you heard your wife's scream, where was it, you, exactly?
Near the rose garden.
I had gone out to look for her
to try to convince her to sell the property.
How did you know right away where your wife's scream came from?
Eh?
The rose garden is near the lighted hallway and the storage room,
but instead, you ran off towards the tower.
Well, I guess it's...
because I heard that the scream came from a high place.
What...?
"The tower is the only tall building on the entire estate."
That's why I thought the Momoe had fallen up there.
You thought she fell from a tower with no entrance?
I guess it all happened so fast that I didn't think of this.
Hm.
What?!
That the children have disappeared?!
Yes.
I've looked all over the house, but they're nowhere to be found.
Maybe they've already gone home.
No.
I also called, and they told me they were gone.
Those boys are a case as a basket case.
We continue to look for them, then.
Mr.
Nagase might think of some place to look that escapes me.
(Takagi) I have some bad news!
Will you join us, Father?
E-don Nagase... Mr. Nagase has disappeared too!
He has?
(Takagi) -Yes.
Where should we be, now?
-We've been walking for a while.
No matter what happens,
I'm not giving up until we find the treasure.
-But...
-No, me neither.
What?!
This is me here?!
Genta, I didn't know you had started a diet.
Don't laugh at me!
Stop it!
A door.
-...that will lead us to the treasure!
-Yes, maybe it's the door...
Now it's there!
Fuck!
The door also laughs at me?!
You will not escape!
-Hey!
Don't run away!
-Come here!
What is it?
It's gone.
-Look!
It's here land!
-Where did it go, now?
And how do we do it, to open it?
Aaaah!
Watch out, Ayumi.
Yes.
Aaaaaaaaah!!!
Genta!
Mitsuhiko!
Hey!
Is it wrong?!
Is it ok?!
-Yes, more or less.
-Yes, more or less.
What are you doing, Conan?
What are you looking for?
Something to open.
I've got it.
Yes.
It's opening!
Keep going!
S-somebody's coming!
(Conan) Huh?
-Afanya't, Conan!
-What if it's the killer?!
I don't know what's going on, but it seems to be closing by itself!
You can go through, Mitsuhiko, do it!
But if I let go of the door, it will close!
I've got it!
Wait for it!
I've got it!
Hurry up!
The killer is here!
Come on, we're running away!
-Let's go!
-Okay. -Okay.
Ooh!
-I don't get it.
-A little girl's room?
-Look, there's a doll up here.
-How can that be?
And this.
And that too.
It's glued!
And these books on the shelf are drawings.
Well, this sofa is real!
Why did they have to make this room?
Ouch!
Ah!
-Ah!
-Ah!
Ah!
-Ah!
-Ah!
Aah!
Aah!
Don't be fooled!
It's another trick!
The only one spinning is the wall!
Eh?
Get out of the way.
(Tsutomu)... and I saw myself as if in split images.
Maybe that's it, Tsutomu's memories.
Genta!
(Genta) Aaaah!
The assassin!
(Genta) Eh?
Y-yes it's a mirror!
(Genta) It's me!
This isn't scary.
Eh?
Aaah!
Aaah!
"Come on! Where are you?!"
Mitsuhiko!
(Mitsuhiko) Aaah!
Over there!
I thought I saw a silhouette.
Aah!
Is there anyone here?
There's no one, is there?
Aah!
Aaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaah!
It's here.
Ayumi!
(Ayumi) Aaaah!
Where are you?!
Where are you three?!
What?
Calm down.
(Think) "Getting nervous and calling won't help me find them."
"Think: what's the point of this tunnel?"
"And now, you go back yourself to rethink everything."
"Who could have committed the murder?"
"The scent of the perfume is to make us think
that the victim has entered the Tower."
"But what was near the Tower was in Tsutomu,

Mr. Nozomu Kyodo was in the garden, and Mr. Nagase was in the warehouse."
"Neither of them could have had the time to push the victim
from the top of the tower and back down again."
"These tools..."
"Wait a minute. Maybe I'm not looking at it right, all this."
"Both the tower and the subway passageway
were built 40 years ago."
"If they were in bad shape, it wouldn't have been usable..."
Of course!
Now I understand it all!
Soc... I'm in...!
I'm in...!
(Tsutomu) "It was very dark and the ceiling was very high."
"Of course! This is where the treasure is!"
"From the height of it, this must be the Dark Tower."
"But it should be round, not pyramid-shaped."
"A mirror! This means it could be..."
We've searched all over the estate and they haven't turned up
neither Conan nor any of his companions,
and Mr. Nagase isn't here either.
So now all that's left for us to do is to go look for the Dark Tower.
I am convinced that Nagase knew
that Seitaro had hidden the treasure in the Dark Tower.
I still find it hard to believe
that the treasure I thought was a dream really exists.
The treasure is not important!
The only thing that matters is that they are well.
All right, we can't waste any more time.
I ask you to help us find the entrance to the Dark Tower.
"Conan..."
"According to what Tsutomu has explained to us,
somewhere there should be some buttons."
They are there!
"These are the three colored buttons."
"Eh? And that, what is it?"
"Oh! I'm high up! From here I'll have a good view."
"Eh? This is..."
"A false nail from the Momoe."
"She must have pushed the button really hard
to have broken the nail."
Sir?
Yes, this is Inspector Megure.
I've already explained that we can't waste any more time.
Send in all the agents we have available.
We must search the Dark Tower from top to bottom... What?!
It won't be necessary to send in any agents!
Ah... what do you mean?!
And what are you doing up there?!
Now I'll tell you everything!
The one at the main entrance must be... the red one.
Hey, kid!
Come here at once!
Ah!
It's an earthquake!
The Tower is rising upwards!
No, Mouri, it's no earthquake!
Oh!
Look at this!
It's the entrance!
Welcome to the Dark Tower!
Do me a favor and come down right now, you feel me?!
I want you to see something, Mr. Kogoro!
What?!
No!
No way!
Would you mind coming up, please?
Couldn't it be that I've found the treasure?
-The treasure?! -The treasure?!
I'm coming up!
I'm coming up!
-It could be.
Wait, Father!
And I thought you were so afraid of heights!
The treasure!
The treasure!
I'm coming, dear treasure!
Where is it, the treasure?
Keep watch!
Ah!
Oh!
Oh... What caaaic!
What is he doing, now, here on earth?
Have you fallen asleep?
Oh, my goodness.
There is no one who understands him, this man!
(Kogoro voice) Forgive me for being like this,
but I just found out the truth.
What are you saying?!
Mrs. Kyodo has fallen from the tower,
but it wasn't a murder;
it was an accident.
An accident?!
What do you mean: she slipped or tripped?
No, it's all a bit more complicated.
She was looking for the entrance to the tower,
she climbed up here and found these 3 colored buttons.
"I'm sure she's opened the door leading to the roof first,
so she could get a good look."
Yes, yes, I'm here.
Conan, you're here, aren't you?
Mm-hm.
All right.
Got it.
Next, what you've done is you've pushed a button,
the blue one.
You should know, therefore, that I haven't tried it yet, this button...
and, therefore, I can't tell you for sure what it does.
Anyway, I know that something has happened,
and that, because of what happened, the victim fell from the tower.
At least that is what I have deduced.
Conan, press the button.
Right. The blue one, right?
The blue one, right?
"What... what's going on?"
(evil laughter)
Aaaargh!
What a beast!
Understandably so, if he was looking for treasure,

so frightened that he fell down the tower.
It's a hologram.
I guess back then that would have been state-of-the-art technology.
40 years ago, I'm sure it was.
Theoretically, holograms had been invented before,
but these holograms that use laser beams,
they were invented in 1971.
I-I saw it the other day on TV!
I know it's a tragedy,
but the hologram caught Mrs. Kyodo by surprise,
fell from the tower and died.
So, the conclusion we draw is that it was an accident.
The Momoe kept up her madness until the end.
I apologize for having caused you so much trouble.
But it is very strange, because, according to Tsutomu's recollection,
pressing the blue button meant that the treasure should appear, right?
Earlier Mr. Kogoro explained to me how it went.
He said that Mrs. Kyodo had pressed the wrong button.
Did she press the wrong button?
You mean Momoe didn't press the blue button?
Do you remember
that you said earlier that the vegetables had a green-blue color?
I am only interested in being able to prepare these vegetables,
with this beautiful blue-green color.
Yes.
You also said that watercress was blue-green.
The blue-green color of watercress stimulates the eyes and the appetite.
I was wrong!
When I said the blue button I always meant the green button!
Eh?
Yes, my boy.
But you're not the first one to confuse green with blue.
And I guess that's why you should always talk about the green-blue color.
The catch is that this confusion has cost a person his life.
Who knows what would have happened if the mother had pressed the green color,
instead of blue.
(Nagase) That she would have seen what in Seitaro wanted her to see in Tsutomu.
I see that in the end it has all appeared.
Yes!
And, moreover, we are all well!
At the end Mr. Nagase has rescued us.
Yes.
He came to get me out of the elevator, which had broken down.
We were lucky to have Mr.
Nagase.
Otherwise it could have been much worse.
I'm sorry you had to go through such a frightening experience...
because you didn't finish the repairs in time.
W-what's this about repairs?!
You mean you were aware of everything and didn't say anything?!
Before he died, Seitaro said to me
that, if I told en Nozomi, he would have everything destroyed,
and asked me, until en Tsutomu inherited the family business.
I would take care of it.
But en Tsutomu has no intention of taking over the company.
And he has forgotten the words he said as a child.
(Tsutomu child) "If we were to open the amusement park inside the tunnel to the public.
inside the tunnel to the public, people would be very happy!"
"When I grow up I plan to show everyone this park full of dreams!"
I wanted him to remember those words,
so I went back into the Dark Tower,
to make the repairs that were there.
So that's why, isn't it, the other button?
The green one.
Yes, that's right.
It was the last treasure that Seitaro hid inside the Dark Tower.
May I press the green button?
Oooh!
Secret love.
Secret love.

It's amazing!
How beautiful!
It's a mind-blowing kaleidoscope!
I haven't seen anything like it!
It's too much!
When the oil inside is displaced, it creates millions and millions of different drawings!
it creates millions and millions of different drawings!
So, this is the dream that Grandpa created?
-What do you want?
-Father!
You would be able to destroy it?!
It's our family treasure!
-I won't let you!
-Shut up!
As the heir of the third generation, I won't let you!
I promised Grandpa Seitaro
that I would turn Kyodo into a dream factory.

Ah... I'll be glad to see if you can do it.
(snoring)
Last night's mail you sent me from a different address
from the address you wrote me from before.
How did you do that?
- (mobile: message)
-Hm?
Goita!
It's the customer's answer.
What?
Don't make noise, please.
