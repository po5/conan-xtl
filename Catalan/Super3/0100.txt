DETECTIVE CONAN
The memory of first love, part one
I'm sorry, Ran.
But it wasn't necessary for you to go clean Shinichi's house.
And now!
We had nothing to do.
We?
(Think) "Because you say so, pretty girl.
But we must clean it, otherwise it will look like the house of horrors."
Shinichi must be very happy, having such a thoughtful girlfriend.
Oops, don't say that.
You think the same as me, don't you?
Yes, he's right.
(Thinking) The mother who...
See you later, doctor.
Yes, thanks for everything.
You're welcome!
(You'll remember.
I don't suppose you're not planning to leave this mansion like a sponge.
We'll get as far as we can and then...
As far as we can, you mean?
You plan to spend the whole day?
Hmm... That's what I thought.
Ah!
I'm stunned.
Wow...
What a drag, today we've got a Saturday with a radiant weather
and me, Queen Sonoko, cleaning Shinichi's house.
It would be better to leave it as it is.
I'm sorry about that.
I thought I wouldn't have enough hands on my own.
Yes, I know...
Sonoko, before you sweep the dust off the shelves.
When you clean, you should clean from top to bottom, right?
And keep an eye on the tiles.
You sound like a withered old woman!
Today's modern girls should go out and fish for boys
and fall head over heels in love with what will be their first love.
Instead, they have to get all dusty.
I'm ashamed of myself.
(Thinking) I'm sorry, beautiful...
Hey, this first love thing...
What?
What kind of girl was she supposed to be, Shinichi's first love?
He must have fallen in love once or twice.
Who knows... He looks simple and goofy, in this respect.
At most, she must have been a cutie like his mother.
Or not, wait...
You've always been by his side since you were kids, haven't you?
Yes...
Besides, you're kind and you're very strong.
Who knows if it's not you, Shinichi's first love.
(Thinking) "What's he saying!
What t'empatolles, when we were little we just played together.
But in your case it would make sense...
If I'm not mistaken, your first love was Shinichi.
Do not t'embalis!
Don't jump to stupid conclusions!
You've turned red, that means I'm right!
You're a pain, Sonoko!
Shut up or I'll get angry!
"Really?!
(Ringing)
Who could it be?
Surely it must be Shinichi.
Believe it.
But I wouldn't call, to get into his house.
I'm sure the doctor told him about us.
"He didn't...
But... but Shinichi didn't tell me that he'd be back...
Why are you so embarrassed?
Welcome him.
He's your first love! You're so wrong, Sonoko.
Eh?
Hello.
You Shinichi's friends?
Y... yes.
"Eh? I could swear it's her.
You're the Asami, right?
You were a few grades ahead.
Yes.
Sonoko, you know her?
She was the head of the Student Council when we went to Teitan's school.
That's Asami Uchida.
Wow, Shinichi is busy with a case and he's not at home?
Now I understand why I always got the answering machine.
I'm sorry about that.
Looks like we forced you to help us.
It's just as well.
I had the day off.
By the way, Asami, what did you want, from Shinichi?
The fellows from the enigma research club
have rented a house in the mountains for this weekend
to celebrate my birthday party.
I was really looking forward to inviting Shinichi.
He is a detective and was from the Teitan soccer club.
I thought I had sent him the invitation well in advance.
That's strange.
He hasn't spoken to you? Not at all.
"Oh, mother! I forgot all about it!
I thought that if I asked him I would come without thinking.

But perhaps you have forgotten that statement 4 years ago.
A statement?
Well, I wouldn't put it past him.
"One day or another he ends up paling his colors."
That's what first love is like.
First love ?!
(Think) A... this girl is Shinichi's first love.
Of course she is!
Now I'm starting to connect the dots!
In the first year of junior high school, there was a rumor.
It was said that a boy in first grade was flirting with Asami.
And it turned out to be Shinichi Kudo?!
It's not true that they flirted.
He formally proposed to me.
Help!"
That was...
Stop... excuse me!
You can invite someone else, can't you? I guess so...
So, you're okay with us coming?
Believe it or not, we have solved riddles.
But what's wrong?
What's wrong with it?
Maybe I can catch a good guy!
If two high school girls come, the boys will be happy.
The one you know will not be able to be with us!
What?
The one? Don't you mean...?
That's right, that famous detective who needs no introduction.
A meeting of the university's enigma research club?
No!
Although I'm bringing girls and I don't want her to stay out all night!
That's why we want you to come.
I don't have time to waste going to stupid meetings!
Ah!
Actually, I understand you.
Since you're a famous detective, you can't go out and have fun.
But for all those people from the enigma research club,
Kogoro Mouri's existence must be like that of a creator god.
They all strive
to feel the cases of this universally known detective.
In addition to Asami Uchida, Miss Toht, there will be many women!
Miss... Miss Toht?
But if you're so busy, we'll have to resign ourselves and not go.
Well, I'll do something about work to find time for you.
I'll go with you as a bodyguard.
And I can't disappoint these youngsters from the enigma club either.
If the narration of some of the cases I have solved can be of any use to them,
this famous detective will have no objection to collaborate with them.
(Thinking) He-he-he-he-he.... What a predictable character.
(Thinks) Miss Toht...
Well done!
Here we are at last!
Daughter, where is it, the house?
The bus stop is here, so we have to go to the right.
It's over there!
Oh!
One more step and I'm with Miss Toht!
Come on, let's go!
I'll catch a hot guy from Tohti!
(Kogoro) Oysters!
(Kogoro) It's an honor!
It's great, having a drink with the young brains of Tohti!
Besides, you're all such beautiful boys and girls!
He's coming back!
You are an exceptional detective.
You know the art of controlling people's hearts.
But this was your specialty.
Oi, playboy Sawai?
A little birdie told us.
Not long ago, you made a girl cry.
Was it true?
We're here to celebrate the Asami's anniversary, right?
What's in it for you guys, sticking me with a scandal?
We're also celebrating the fact that you've been awarded
the Honorary Newcomer Award for your novel.
Too bad, Morimoto.
You were also a finalist.
You were just short.
It was inevitable.
When the Asami came, they forgot the promises.
I'm a good example of a loser.
In the tennis final, she beat me.
And she's already Miss Toht!
I was immediately discarded.
What I wouldn't give to be like her.
She can do anything she sets her mind to.
And she's also an ace in the kitchen!
And her lemon cake?
Now she's making it with the Ran.
I had understood that the Asami would take it to him.
He's already here!
We were impatiently waiting for him!
What a mess.
Did you prepare it, Asami?
No, I made it myself.
It's the first time...
Asami, what about your cake?
It's just that I ran away from the head I was supposed to bring.
So I asked her to make one.
If you're not used to making it, that's it.
It is that...
First mengeu's-in a piece and then you'll complain.
Wow!
This cake...
It's a little charred but...
It's great!
-I'll have some too. -Let's see...
It's finger-licking good!
Yes!
It doesn't look very good, but it's great!
It's not bad at all!
It's good!
So good!
The important thing is what's inside.

If we only eat by sight, we will not know the taste of what we eat.
(revelry)
Yes, guys, my deductions are infallible!
So, you solved the riddle?!
(Think) All the riddles have been solved by me.
Blow!
It's a splendid cake!
I bought it from Ginza.
I'll get the matches.
It's not necessary.
I ordered the lighter from Sawai.
It's so old.
Every time you light the candles on a cake, you get excited.
When you're 20 years old, I'll...
You mean...?
When you pass 20,
you gradually end up detesting this whole adding years thing.
Go....
Ah!
You've arrived!
"Congratulations. Professor Masao Takamura."
Just as promised.
At 12 o'clock.
I told you it was a good idea, the fax!
It's already arrived, Asami!
It's from Professor Takamura!
Eh?
Xxxxxxxt!
She's fallen asleep.
Apa here.
What are we going to do, about the cake?
We had to go to the karaoke at the station.
Yes, the reservation is made.
We'll leave the cake for tomorrow.
And if we go to distract us at the karaoke?!
(Boy) Yes, you're right, let's go?
Aaa!
The mystery is unraveling!
The mystery is unraveling!
Do you want to sing the next one with me?
It's from the Two Mix. #
No, I'd better not sing it. #
Something bothering you, Ran?
You look like a soul in pain.
I'm fine.
I'm not worried about anything.
You want me to guess what you were thinking, now?
Wit and beauty, skilled with pen and sword.
She cares for others and is loved and respected by all.
Let's talk about the Asami, of course.
What?
How do you know it?
Maca, it's written all over your face.
"I can never be like her."
I'm not surprised Shinichi fell in love either.
She was in charge of the soccer club.
Don't worry, woman!
She thinks Shinichi dumped her.
Besides, you two have been friends since you were little!
Did you know Shinichi likes lemon cake?
Today, I found out.
Asami told me.
He likes lemon cake?
Yes, it's his favorite!
Since I thought he'd come, I told everyone I'd make one.
Well, Shinichi... Wow, she likes it...
Do you want me to teach you?
I'll tell you how to make it.
I'll never come out on top.
She knows a lot of things about Shinichi that I don't know about.
Ran...
Cheer up!
You have a lot of qualities, too!
What do I have, anyway?
Sturdy arms shaped by karate,
a beefy body that's all muscle...
Flights collapse me?
(Think) My goodness!
Hello.
Where are you, the others?
Because you've spent quite a while in the bathroom...
We had to go to the station toilets.
I'm very sorry.
And my tobacco?
Here you are.
I bought it at the supermarket next door.
Ah, it's back!
And Noguchi?
He's got a big horn.
He's making squats in front of the station.
Caram.
It's already after 3 o'clock?
Shall we go back?
We've left everything a mess.
They'll make a mess of it.
Eh?
Oh!
-It's a fire.
-Yes, it's true!
-Mustn't be passing... -Our mountain house?
Our house?
It can't be!
There... there's still there...
The Asami is there!
Let's go back there!
Maybe we'll get there in time!
-What about the car key?
-It's in Noguchi.
What's wrong with it?
We don't have time to explain!
The house is burning!
(Thinking) "Asami... Asami...
"Please don't let anything happen to you.
Please, Asami!"
Shit, it looks so black!
-Asami! -Asami, can you feel me?!
It doesn't look like she's taken shelter outside.
Don't tell me she must still be sleeping.
She can't be!
Did we wake her up with the phone?
She was sleeping in the living room!
No.
It looks like she's already burned.
-I won't allow it!
-Who... -Still!
You can't go in!
You can't go in!
-Noooo!
-Enrere, it's dangerous!
Asami, answer!
Remove that motorcycle!
If the gasoline ignites, we'll be lost!
-Yes! The firemen aren't coming yet?!
Eh?
Where's the helmet?
Wait for me, I'm coming to save you, Asami!
-Ran and Conan have entered?! - And Sawai has followed them!
They're unconscious!
Asami!
Asami?!
Asami.
Where are you?!
Raaaaaaaan!

-You can't do it, Mr. Mouri! -My daughter is inside!
-You'll put yourself in danger too! -Raaaaaaaan!
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan!
Ran... Ran... You have to be strong, Ran...
Sonoko... Ran!
What's happened?
Where am I?
In a hospital.
After the fire they took you.
Yeah...
And the Asami?!
Where is he, the Asami?
Xxxxt.
Look, he's sleeping next door.
He only has a slight intoxication from inhaling carbon monoxide,
but he's in no danger.
Thank God, thank God he's all right.
But you saved his life! What?
Don't you remember?
I don't remember anything.
I remember that I was so engrossed that I went in without thinking.
And that after I found the Asami, Sawai showed me how to get out.
Outside, I breathed easy and lost consciousness.
You put on your helmet and went inside!
The firemen agreed with you!
They said that putting on the helmet was the right idea!
Ah... Yes.
It was Conan's idea!
When I wanted to get into Conan he gave it to me.
He said it would protect my face and hair.
In Conan?
Caram.
That nano will never cease to amaze us.
You're right.
The fire started about 10 minutes before 3 o'clock?
Yes, some people who were in a house saw a column of smoke.
It looked like an open fire to them.
Hey, was it arson?
No, the fire originated in the living room.
It was caused by the candles on the cake.
The candles?
They probably forgot to blow out this candle,
set fire to the gift wrappings
and then it started spreading through the curtains.
-Why didn't you put them out?! - Of course I put them out!
Since we all went out without paying attention....
I put them out!
The candle was very close to the place where it all started.
If they were extinguished, although we have another possibility...
There is a possibility that the Asami lit the fire.
I don't believe it!
It's ridiculous!
Why would she want to do that?

DETECTIVE CONAN
A... Asami!
What's missing?
I went out to buy a soda and when I came back she was gone.
(Kogoro voice) The Asami has suffered an assassination attempt.
Whoever wanted to see her burned is here!
It's one of you!
And next chapter...
