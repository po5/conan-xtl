- (people) Oh!
- (crystals: brittle)
-Let me go!
-That's enough, you bastard!
Somebody call the police, please!
-Hey, what are you doing?!
You idiot...!
What?
Yeah, it's all right.
Hey, are you all right?
-No, it's nothing.
-Hey, are you all right?
Did you do something wrong?
-Nothing, an unimportant fight.
-But can you tell me what happened?
(Shinichi voice) "We solve mysteries with sharp deductions."
"Love and cases have the same origin."
"A police inspector who runs away in handcuffs?"
"In Wataru Takagi will have a very long day."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

(Conan voice) "Inspector Takagi flees in handcuffs."
Hey, you're hurting me.
I wasn't throwing myself out of handcuffs, you idiot!
You'd better calm down, Someya.
No matter how much you ruminate, I'll take you to headquarters anyway.
Shit!
Inspector, I'll leave it to you.
I'll see you later.
Thanks for everything.
Wow, what a shock!
What would happen, if we fell discalabro?
Watch!
-If you want, we can try.
What are you doing?
Stop it, Someya!
We'll soon see what happens!
- (horn: continuous pip)
- (crystals: brittle)
It went pretty well.
Oh, my...
Too bad you don't have a gun!
I don't need to carry a gun to move... in the central
a detainee for a simple fight.
Wow, you, how strong, this reminds me of that...
-Nothing, nothing.
It's not important.
-What does it remind you of, you say?
-Yes, just a moment.
-Come on, come down.
-More or less.
-Hey, Kishida, you're all right, aren't you? -You're all right, aren't you?
Notify headquarters to send us reinforcements, please.
-Right away.
-We'll wait here.
-Ah!
-You're carrying a gun. -You're carrying a gun.
Hey, what are you doing?!
-Take the key and unlock the handcuffs. -How dare you?!
-How dare you?!
What have you done?
Now, even if you shoot me, you won't be able to escape!
-Hey, freeze!
-Who says so, this?
We'll see about that.
-Aaah!
-Ah!
- (both: call out)
-Inspector Takagi!
Excuse me, what are you saying?!
That Inspector Takagi has fallen into the river with the detainee?
What?
Inspector Takagi?
Issue an APB and set up checkpoints.
(All) Understood!
- (man: breathing heavily)
- (rhythmic metallic knocking)
(Rhythmic metallic knocks)
The puzzles at once!
You should know
that handcuffs are made so they don't break easily.
Let it run.
-Just now... -I've already tried it myself.
-Huh?
-Oh!
Fuck!
-There's no reception.
-Eh... Oh, oh, oh, oh!
-Oh, you... I can't take it anymore.
What are you doing?
You can't give up so fast!
-What?
-Get up and try to run away, man!
-A good reason?
-Have a good reason.
To run away.
I guess that's why you tried to run away.
I guess you're from the city we came from, right?
Since you weren't supposed to know where to run, you went instinctively,
but according to the local police,
you seem to have deliberately committed a crime
to be sent to Tokyo right away.
-I wasn't planning to go anywhere.
-Where were you planning to go, now, huh?
I just wanted to get away, that's all.
Don't mess around.
Don't make a fool of me!
Look, man, take a good look!
We're chained to each other.
Doesn't that remind you of anything, right now?
Does it?
No.
What would it remind me of?
What do you think?
It's very disturbing.
Yes.
I just hope... he doesn't get carried away with his obsession.
Wh-what obsession?
-Yes, a movie.
-A movie? -A movie?
"Fugitives in Handcuffs," it's called.
-Well, no, it doesn't ring a bell. -I'm sure you've seen it.
-I'm sure you've seen it.
I'm sure you've seen it. What?

But how is it possible that you don't know anything about it?
It is a masterpiece that is already part... of the history of cinema!
Okay, I get it... And what the hell does it have to do with us?
It's about two men chained to each other.
At first they don't see eye to eye, but little by little they open up.
And, despite being from different social classes, they eventually become friends.
It's a classic about the human condition!
And I love it.
I've seen it 12 times on DVD very well.
So, if you're hiding something from me,
given that we're bound together by these handcuffs,
you should tell me and...
Will you shut up, you pain in the ass?
Stop it!
So, very well, it represents that first you have to fight.
-I told you to shut up, man!
-I recognize that you do it very well. -You do it very well.
Come on, let's go.
You see, as you do know, where you want to go?
I was right!
-Ouch, ouch, ouch! -Ouch!
Ouch!
-Will you shut up?!
(TV: man) "We move on to other news."
Eh?
Father, Conan, look!
"A detainee has disappeared, with the policeman who accompanied him."
"This is Ryuta Someya, 28 years old,
arrested for an alleged assault and battery offense."
But-but it's in Takagi!
What happened?
Yes.
Conan, doesn't this man look familiar to you?
We saw him at that restaurant.
(Kogoro) What nonsense you make me do!
It is Sunday.
I don't know what we're doing here.
Surely the police have already come to investigate.
Surely, but there's something that intrigues me and I want to check it out.
Yes, the police have already come and asked me about Someya.
But I already told them
that I had no idea where he could have gone.
Yes, something.
If I can be of any further help...
That girl the other day was a customer?
Don't you remember?
What girl do you mean?
When you two fought there was a girl sitting there.
Oh, yes, there was.
Now I don't know if I should say it...
It turns out that in Someya... he had been harassing Miss Konak for a while.
He was harassing her?
Was he?
Exactly, that's why I tried to stop him.
And you see what I got, in the end.
-Well, I didn't.
-Did you explain it to the police, this?
She doesn't want me to say anything, because she's very afraid of him.
He's a dangerous man.
Yes.
Do you know where I live, Miss Konak?
She asked me for help and we trust each other a lot.
Yes, that's probably why she ran away.
Gee... Maybe she's going to look for you!
It's Miss Chie Konak, isn't it?
My name is Kogoro Mouri and I'm a private detective.
Private detective?
If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to you.
I'll just be a moment.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm chilled and I'm not feeling very well.
You're chilled?
Or are you scared... because of that man?
In case you don't know, my father is a very renowned detective.
Hey, wait!
I'm sorry about that.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
What's up?
They're here!
(Chiba) Thank you for contacting us.
-(Chiba) Not at the moment.
-Any news?
They haven't been intercepted at the roadblocks.
I just hope Takagi is okay.
What?
Ah, we hope so!
Thank you.
At least now we know why he has fled in Someya,
which is already a lot of cattle.
If he wants to harm Miss Konak,
I'm sure he'll come all the way to her house.
Yes.
That's most likely, indeed.
(Shinichi, thinks) "I don't understand."
"There's something that doesn't add up, but I don't know what it is..."
You're flying to break the chain by putting it under the wheels of the train?
-Surely.
-You're not sure?
In that movie I told you before there is a similar scene,
but... you mean?
-It's coming.
- (train: tuuut)
(Train: tuuut)
But... why did you stretch me?!
Because there wasn't enough room under the train.
I would have crushed you!
Can't you see, man?
-It's true, I'm not fooling you!
-I don't want to hear any more!
I'm telling you to shut up!
-Aaah!
-Aaah!
Someya...
Come on..., here, take the key..., hurry!
Do you have the key?
The key you threw before agent Kishida...
was the one on my handle,
and this is the one that you open.
You bastard..., you're a bastard!
Hurry up.
If we don't do something, we'll both go down.
This way, at least, you'll be saved.
-Aaah!
-Come on, hurry up.
No... you'll be saved too!
-Come on, and now... give me the key. -Come on... give me the key.

-Sound-Someya, you saved me!
No... it can't be... Gee, I must have dropped it!
-Forgive me.
-How-how do you say?
Oh... You're such an asshole!
Why are you asking me for forgiveness?
Man, you saved my life.
And I thank you.
But how do you understand?!
A cop thanking a detainee!
I-It's not very usual.
But, if you hadn't saved me, I wouldn't be in this world anymore.
I did it... because I had no choice.
We're in chains, didn't you know that?!
-Ah...
-Yes, of course.
Sato!
-Where are they? -Where are they?
-At last we have news.
And Takagi?
Is he all right, or what?
They stopped by a restaurant on the outskirts.
We have the images recorded
from the security cameras in the parking lot.
(Kogoro) How strange!
They look pretty well matched, don't they?
(Kogoro) -What?
-Yes, it's her obsession.
N-nothing, she was talking to herself.
What?
And where is, now, this truck they've got on?
Let's assume that, by now, they must have already arrived in the city,
but the roadblocks haven't intercepted them yet.
Then we'll have to wait here.
By the way, you haven't told me if you have a girlfriend.
-Well..., we could say more or less.
-And you, do you have one?
-Of course.
Now I understand.
-You could say I do too. -You could say I do too.
Hey, can I borrow your cell phone?
I have to make a call.
-Be cool. -I'll be right back.
I'll turn myself in later.
-Hey?
Rather, I'll accompany you to the police station.
-Of course you will.
-Ah!
Do you really mean it?
-All right, then.
-I don't have any other choice.
- (woman) You'd be wrong.
- (man) Can I go to the bathroom?
Hey, look!
Looks like I talked to someone on the phone, Chie.
-Mm...
-She's probably talking to Someya.
(Kogoro) Oh, he hung up!
(Chiba) Someya must have told her to meet somewhere.
He must have threatened her not to tell the police.
Well, we've got to stop her.
Who knows what her intentions are at the door.
Now we've lost her!
Chiba, notify the chief inspector and call for backup.
Right away.
(Shinichi, thinks) "I have a feeling."
Where are you going, Conan?
Inspector, this is Chiba.
Hey, hey!
Where's the waiter who got punched by Mr. Someya?
Who, Yashuo Nashimoto?
Well, he was called just a moment ago and went to the locker room.
Yashuo... Isn't he?
I don't know where he went.
(Shinichi, think) "These pictures..." Now I'm starting to connect the dots."
"It can't be!"
Eh?
Hey, handsome.
If you look up Yashuo Nashimoto,
I think it's at the abandoned factory in Haido-cho.
At least that's what it says... this note I found on the board.
What do we do now?
I don't understand anything.
Tell me what's going on.
Didn't you tell me before that he's handing you over?
And I'll deliver me.
As soon as I have spent accounts with him.
- (shot)
-With whom?
Tell me what's going on.
-Oh!
-(Takagi, thinks)
- (Takagi, thinks) "I don't understand anything."
- (shot)
I won't tell you again, it's mine, you feel?
It's mine and only mine, is it clear to you?!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Alright, let's go!
Ah!
(Weapon: chimes)
Co-Conan!
What are you doing here?
Oh! (gunshot)
And who is this man?
Turns out he's the stalker we were looking for.
Huh?
The stalker?
Actually it was him, which scared the girl.
Mr. Someya just wanted to protect her.
What?
Sound... Someya?
He... ran away.
It can't be!
I don't think so, that he ran away, quiet.
What's that?
Isn't it true that he made two phone calls before?
Well... now that you say it, it's true that he made two.
I get it.
First he must have called this man,
and then the girl he was harassing.
Yes, that's right.
Because you've trusted him so far, you can trust her to the end, can't you?
Of course I can.
Look, I've had enough, waiting for me.
I want to go home.
No, no, just a little longer, come on.
It'll only take 10 minutes.
What am I saying?
5 minutes and that's enough, really.
Get your feet on the ground for once!
We're not in an action movie.
- (footsteps: approaching)
-Yeah, you're right, but, still....
-Eh?

-Huh?
Ah...
Sound... Someya...
Did you see his dumb face?
Look at him, the big cop.
Come on, shut up.
That's not what you have to say.
-What?
-Say the other thing.
Ah...
I guess I have no choice, do I?
Ahem!
I can't run away because you and I... we have too strong a bond.
So, perfect!
That's so cool!
Ha-ha!
You did great, Someya, just like the movie!
It's so cool!
I think you could dedicate yourself.

What a face!
Look at him pretending to be good, that stalker!
He has fooled us all.
It turns out that in Someya he had escaped to protect the Chie,
even though he was handcuffed.
Yes.
I think that's commendable.
In the end, the Chie has freed himself from a stalker
and Someya has freed himself from the chains.
Yes, and so much so that in the end she has been proven innocent.
She has freed herself from the stalker and he has freed himself from the chains.
Father, you have already said that.
Why do you repeat it?
Ah...
Because I said that she has finally freed herself from a stalker.
And, at the same time, he has also freed himself, but from the chains.
Wow, I'm a poet!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Anyway, for today it looks like that's enough."
Aaaah...!
(Shinichi, thinks) "This means that inside the coin purse
there must be money that he had just withdrawn."
"There's just a detailed statement from an ATM."
Yes.
An alibi?
Yasue was supposed to deposit the money at two o'clock,
but when I went to check the ATM,
I saw that I still hadn't made the deposit.
(Conan's voice) What?
(Conan voice) Don't miss the next episode:
"The first three to arrive (Part One)."
