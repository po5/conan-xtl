(Sliders)
Shit!
Where is it?
(metallic clang)
It's over there!
(Shinichi voice) Why don't you let this game run, you thief?
Maybe I am.
It's already too dark to play hide-and-seek with you....,
...detective.
DETECTIVE CONAN
THE WIZARD OF THE SILVER SKY
My name is Shinichi Kudo and I'm a teenage detective.
One day, I went to the amusement park with Ran Mouri,
my best friend and classmate,
and I witnessed a suspicious exchange
between two men dressed in black.
I was so focused on watching those two men,
that I didn't notice another one behind me.
He made me swallow a poison
and, when I woke up... my body had shrunk!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive, they would want to kill me, and the life of Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
they would want to kill me and the lives of those around me would be in danger.
That's why Dr. Agasa
recommended that I hide my identity.
When the Ran asked me what my name was,
I thought to tell her that I called myself Conan Edogawa.
Since Ran's father is a detective, I went to live with them to get information about the men in black.
to get information about the men in black.
The culprit... is you!
This is Kogoro Mouri.
He is Ran's father, a very famous private detective...
who most people know by the name of "Sleeping Kogoro".
Want to know why?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.... Aaaaaaaaah...
I guess I don't need to tell you because you have already understood.
These two devices are Dr. Agasa's inventions.
When he shrunk me,
the doctor made me many unique inventions.
One of the most spectacular is this, the ball belt,
which inflates and ejects a soccer ball when you press the button.
By the way, apart from Dr. Agasa...
there are more people who know my identity.
My parents,
in Heiji Hattori, the teenage detective from the west,
and also Ai Haibara, a girl in my class.
She and her older sister, the Akemi Miyano,
belonged to the Men in Black organization.
When the organization killed the Akemi,
Haibara rebelled and, in order to escape,
he drank the same poison that they made me swallow myself
and shrunk his body.
And there is still another person: the Kaito Kid!
Our particular duel is not over yet.
But this time I intend to capture him,
I stake my reputation as a detective!
I'm small but I have the brains of an adult.
A detective who solves all mysteries!
There is only one truth!
(Kogoro) I get it.
This note is a threat from the Kaito Kid, isn't it?
Yes.
I found it this morning on the balcony of my house,
next to a huge bouquet of roses.
(Thinking) "He-he.... She's always liked to draw attention to herself."
"Romeo, Juliet, Victor, Bravo."
"As 26 letters fly in all directions.
"I'll come to fetch the fortune jewel."
"Kaito Kid."
There is also the drawing of a letter cut in half.
Tinguin.
Thank you.
So, what do you think, Mr. Mouri?
Let's see... what is this "jewel of fortune"?
(Juri) I suppose you mean this ring.
Oooh!
It's beautiful!
(Juri) Excuse me!
It's a star sapphire, if I'm not mistaken.
Yes.
The 3 lines that intersect on the surface of the ring
symbolize confidence, hope and luck.
That's why they call it the "jewel of fortune".
I get it.
It's an extraordinary ring.
Josephine loves blue sapphires,
that's why I have to wear this ring...
during the performances of the play.
The play?
I know what it's about!
It's a play called "Josefina"...
and it's being performed at the Sora Theater in Shiodome Tower,
which opened very recently.
Josephine?
She was Napoleon's first wife.
She has gone down in history as a collector of roses.
"Now I understand the reason for the bouquet of roses."
Very good, my boy!
I see you are well informed.
The nano has an amazing ability to remember useless things!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Romeo, Juliet, Victor, Bravo... Romeo, Juliet, Victor...
-Huh?
Miss Juri! -Yes?
Do you know if by any chance the theater where you are performing
has ever performed the play "Romeo and Juliet"?
Yes.
I didn't perform it,
but it was the first play ever performed.
Why do you ask?
Yes, I got it!
This is fantastic!

The note sent to you in Kaito Kid is?
an answer to the 4 basic questions,
that is to say..., it gives us information...
about who, when, where and how he intends to steal the jewel.
Of course!
"He's screwed up again!"
We start with the "who".
The perpetrator of the theft will be himself.
We move on to the "on."
It is clear that he will do it in the Sora theater,
which was the setting for the play "Romeo and Juliet".
When will he do it?
As he has written the word "bravo" in the note,
I suppose he will try to steal the jewel during the applause.
And to finish, the "how".
"Victor" is a French name.
This means that in Kaito Kid he will disguise himself as Napoleon
and will act in the play.
As for the drawing of the letter cut in half,
it is a very clear representation of the "V" for "victory".
Therefore, in Kaito Kid intends to steal the jewel from you....
while you are playing the role of Josephine,
more specifically, when you are on stage...
receiving the applause of the audience.
You will disguise yourself as Napoleon
and try to find the moment to steal her ring.
Bravo!
Bravo, Mr. Mouri!
You are an extraordinary detective!
And now!
I do what I can!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Mr. Kogoro.
How do you interpret the phrase "while 26 letters fly in all directions"?
Bobo!
Count the letters of the 4 English words.
Romeo, Juliet, Victor, Bravo!
That's 26 letters in total, right?
Yes, you're right.
By the way, Miss Juri.
How long will you play the role of Josephine?
Today is the last day.
This means that in Kaito Kid you'll be playing...
How strange!
You brat!
What's wrong with you now?!
I don't understand!
Look, there are only 22 letters here.
No.
I don't believe it.
Mm... I counted them too.
Even if you add the exclamation mark, there are 3 letters missing.
It's probably because the Kaito Kid made a mistake
when counting the letters.
(Think) "What a professional..."
Ahem...
Anyway, I'm convinced...
that the Kaito Kid will try to commit the robbery tonight.
Okay, thank you.
I would like to ask you one last thing.
I'll go to the police right away, of course,
but... but I'd like to ask you
to do me the favor of coming to the theater this evening
and try to prevent the theft of the ring.
You can count on it!
I, at Kogoro Mouri....,
have never refused a request from a beautiful damsel.
You don't know how grateful I am!
-Give me that, Masayo. -Ah, yes.
Here are the tickets for tonight's performance.
If you prefer to be accompanied, don't be.
Thank you very much.
"As 26 letters fly in all directions..."
"The alphabet has 26 letters,
"But... what does this letter mean?"
"I don't think it represents the symbol for victory."
Ah!
I'm excited! So am I!
I've wanted to see this play for a long time.
Conan.
What? Where are you going with your school bag?
Where are you going with your school bag?
It doesn't bother you?
No, on the contrary.
What you carry inside?
Don't tell me you've taken treats just for yourself alone
and that you don't plan to invite us!
I'm not like you!
(Kogoro) Hey, kids!
I have made an exception and I have let you accompany me,
that is to say, please behave.
(At the same time) Yes!
Thank you very much for inviting us.
You are welcome... Ha-ha-ha...
(Masayo) Mr. Mouri!
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.
Hello, Masayo.
Hello.
(Door: knock)
(Masayo) It's me.
Mr. Mouri has come to see you.
(Juri) Come in!
-Come in, sisplau. Thank you.
-Welcome, Mr. Mouri. Hello.
Forgive me for greeting you looking like this.
Natsuki, meet the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
I'm sure you've heard of him.
I'm Natsuki.
Nice to meet you.
- (Genta) Ooooh! How great!
-Have you seen what a bunch of flowers? -How cool!
I'm sorry...
I have taken the liberty of inviting my daughter,
some friends and these children friends of mine.
And now!
I don't mind.
Do you scuba dive, Miss Juri?
Yes, but I've just started.
That you would like to come with me? -I'd love to!
I'd love to.
But you've never been scuba diving once!
(Kogoro) I thought you were saying something, Ran...
No, I didn't!

Oh!
So many makeup products!
Of course!
This must be foundation pots.
Yes.
There are 1, 2, 3, 4..., 5 different kinds of foundation.
-5 kinds? -Kids!
Sorry, ladies.
You guys are still too young to think about these things.
Kids have to play kids.
Okay? (Laughs)
Ah... Yes...
(Door: knock)
(Juri) Ya!
-Hello, Masayo. -Mr. Narusawa!
(Flow) I heard that Mr. Mouri was here.
Uh... Hello, Mr. Mouri!
Are you the famous detective Kogoro Mouri?
My name is Bunjiro Narusawa.
I'm a great admirer of yours!
It's a pleasure to meet you.
You play the role of Napoleon, right?
Do I?
Yes, of course.
Excuse me for greeting you like this.
May I introduce the rest?
This girl is Tenko Tajima,
she plays the role of Teresa Tallien,
Josephine's best friend.
How do you do?
Isao Shinjo plays the role of Hippolyte Charles,
Josephine's lover.
Hello.
And that's our director and at the same time he plays the role of Paul Barras,
Josephine's protector.
Toru Ban.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
(Man) You're not ready yet, gentlemen?
(Kogoro) Inspector Nakamori!
Hello, Mr. Mouri.
Long time no see!
Ayyy!
Yes, long time no see...!
Ouch... I-it's a real pleasure!
You mean they're real?
I mean the actors.
You're right, you're right.
In Kaito Kid has the ability to disguise himself
and impersonate someone on the inside.
(Thinks) "He may even have already infiltrated."
Come to think of it, I've come accompanied by a person...
who will help me solve this case.
I told him I didn't need any help, but this Megure end...
Ah!
Sorry, Inspector Megure especially recommended you to me.
Au, you can go in now.
Hello, I'm Shinichi Kudo.
Shinichi! Kudo!
What... what...?
We've got him here...
Shinichi Kudo!
If it isn't the famous teenage detective!
What... what... what... what...?
Who is he?
-You really don't know?
-Shinichi is Ran's boyfriend!
He's not! He's her husband.
Sonoko! It's the Kaito Kid!
This kid isn't Shinichi Kudo!
He's the thief in disguise!
-Is it true? -And now!
And how do you know that?
Because I'm the real thing.
You're the real what?
No nothing...
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
In fact, we can't rule out this possibility.
Inspector Nakamori, stop!
You're doing me wrong!
What's the meaning of all this? I don't know...
The Kid and I have always bonded a bit physically.
Maybe...
...it's you, the impostor who's fooling us all.
Yeah, man!
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!
Oooh!
Check!
I have no doubt, it's the real thing.
But I'd like to pinch the cheeks of you all
to check that you're not wearing masks.
(All) What?
Well..., I don't think we should be so strict.
My sixth sense tells me that the Kid is not among us.
Of course he is!
Besides, I've prepared a strategy to capture the Kaito Kid.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Gee!
Why don't you tell us about this plan you've made up?
Miss Maki, if you don't mind,
I'd like everyone to leave this room.
Don't worry, Inspector.
I've finished getting ready.
Excuse me, Inspector.
I'll do things my way, if that's all right with you.
-Your way? -Perfect! -I don't need a peeping Tom like you.
I don't need a peeping tom like you.
We should get going.
(Agasa) I can't wait to see the play.
Shinichi!
I asked you to call me if you came back to town.
I know, but I like to surprise you because you look so pretty.
What?
You should have told her this before, man!
And now, I'd like to go inspect the terrace upstairs.
You want to accompany me, Ran?
Do I?
From the top there's a fantastic view.
Go, Ran!
I'm coming too! No way.
I'm coming too, I want to go with you!
What's wrong with you? I want to come, I want to come, I want to come!
I want to come, I want to come, I want to come, I want to come!
We'll all go together, then.
Hurray!
This Conan... Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-He behaves very strangely when he's near the Ran.
It must be his age.
He wants them to be for him.
-Of course! -How childish!

(Thinks) "Just like you."
"I'm not leaving you alone with the Kaito Kid!"
Too bad, it's locked.
How'd it go?
It turns out that all the doors leading to the rooftop
are locked.
Wow...
This means, if my deductions are correct,
the Kaito Kid won't get in through the roof.
Maybe he will...
"Because he's already here."
Ran!
I'll take care of distracting Conan,
you go with him somewhere where he can be alone.
There's no need for that.
Besides, it seems to me that there's something wrong.
What?
He doesn't usually tell me things like what he told me before.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, the... about... "pretty."
If he said it, it's because he really means it.
You should be honest with him too.
If you're in love, tell him!
Don't be a fool!
I'm not in love!
(Genta) Oysters, oysters, oysters!
Genta, it's been a while since you've said anything but "oysters".
Because it's the only word I can think of!
(Kid) You're right!
"Oysters" is the most appropriate word.
(Kid) You see?
Yes, they are fantastic views!
I'd like to know how you can have the bar
impersonate Shinichi.
Yes.
He must have thought that if he impersonated me.
he could get in everywhere without any trouble.
But he's saved us the trouble of looking for him.
Yes.
By the way, boys, have you heard of Napoleon?
A little bit.
We know he was a French general who proclaimed himself emperor
and conquered all of Europe.
Yes!
I will propose you a little riddle about Napoleon
to whet your appetite before the play begins.
What is it?
A riddle?
It's just like Dr. Agasa.
I hope it's not a play on words.
It's a riddle based on historical facts,
so they can learn a little.
You think about it too, man!
"Go fuck yourself!"
Ready?
There were two Japanese
who built their houses on Napoleon's property.
You must guess the names of these two Japanese.
One: Fuyun.
Two: Furuno.
Three: Fukano.
Fuyun, Furuno or Fukano?
-All 3 begin with "fu" and end with "no".
I think I know!
Xxxt!
Let them think!
The only difference between the 3 names is the middle syllable.
I got it!
They were called Fuyun and Furuno!
Fukano is the only one with the "ka" syllable in the middle.
It could be the "ka" of "Chuka", which means "Chinese".
Therefore, Mr. Fukano was Chinese!
What?
Wasn't that the right answer?
The answer is correct, but the reasoning is not.
Have you ever felt Napoleon's famous phrase that says.
"The word 'impossible' does not exist in my dictionary"?
Yes, this phrase rings a bell!
The riddle refers to this phrase.
"Jisho" means "land" or "property" and "dictionary".
It is a play on words between "fukano", meaning "impossible",
and "jisho", property.
In other words, "the word 'fukano' does not exist on my property".
I get it.
Napoleon's real words were....
"The word 'impossible'
"' exists only in the dictionaries of stupid men."
This is what he said.
How clever you are!
-In the end, it was a play on words. -And besides...
...it hasn't helped us learn anything useful.
Really?
He-he-he-he-he-he-he!
(People: murmur of voices)
I can't wait!
I can't wait to see the play!
(People: hush)
(Vales)

Josephine!
Therese!
What do you want, Mr. de Barras?
I want to introduce you to the general.
Miss Teresa Tallien and Miss Josephine de Beauharnais,
this is...
I know who he is.
General Napoleon Bonaparte.
I hear they say you're very brave, General.
They say too good things about me.
General, would you do me the honor of granting me this dance?
It would be a pleasure.

(Music covers the voice)
It's been so long since all that..., all those happy days...
Bonaparte, the island of Elba, the emperor of Rome...
Hey, Ran.
Isn't that your father, the one standing next to the pope?
What?
"This was your brilliant plan to trap the Kaito Kid?"
Haibara, I have to go.
Go well.
(Man) In the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit,

(Man, from afar)... I offer you this crown as a symbol...
(Man, far away)... I offer you this crown as a symbol... Wait!
I will do it myself.
I am the Emperor of France, Napoleon!
What have you hurt yourself, boy?
You shouldn't run.
I haven't hurt myself.
By the way...
(Man) What happened?
Nothing, this kid came down the stairs in a hurry,
we bumped into each other and he got a big bump on his head.
Oh, my gosh!
Are you all right, man?
Yeah, I'm fine.
By the way, that baton you're carrying is awesome!
It's a little longer than your partner's, isn't it?
It's true, it's quite a bit longer.
Yeah, there are different types of batons.
60 centimeters long,
3 centimeters in diameter and a maximum weight of 320 grams.
These are the regulatory measures for batons
approved by the Public Safety Agency.
You mean your baton is not a little longer than allowed?
How so?
I guess it's too long
because... it's not a baton.
You will not escape!
Stop it!
Shit! (Elevator: nobody-nong) (Elevator: nobody-nong)
(Ning-nong)
All there is in this world!
Glory!
The victory!
The future belongs to me!
And to me too!
The future is ours!
(Audience: applauds)
(Applause)
We will approach when they bring down the curtain.
Understood.
(applause) Now!
Capture on Kaito Kid!
He's disguised himself as Napoleon!
(At the same time) Yes!
(At the same time) Hey!
But... what on earth...?
Let me go!
You're so innocent, Kid.
Your code is so simple,
the great Kogoro Mouri cracked it in a jiffy.
You're wrong, I'm not the Kaito Kid!
The time has come for you to show us your real face, Kaito Kid!
(groans)
It's the real thing.
-So..., where is it, the Kaito Kid?
(Shinichi voice) Why don't you let this game run, you thief?
Maybe I am.
It's already too dark to play hide-and-seek with you...,
...detective.
You won't have much time for a joke.
It's time to settle what's pending.
Yes.
But I believe your girlfriend is waiting for you for dinner.
Conan!
You can come to dinner now!
(Ran voice) If you don't come right away, I'll eat it all myself!
Looks like it's finally time, detective.
Yes.
This looks like it.
Wow!
What's he doing?
I get it!
I get it!
A paraglider against a hang glider.
I'm impressed!
This paraglider is also an invention of your friend, Dr. Agasa?
You won't escape!
Even if you're the Kaito Kid,
if you can't fly, you're just a petty thief.
Then I'd better get back to...
my usual way of getting around.
(Rrit)
(Thinks) "What's that noise?"
Oops!
Goodbye! (CLEC)
(CLEC)
(CLEC) Shit!
(TV: woman) "To Hakodate, the weather forecast for this afternoon...
"It's rainy, with isolated showers that may become heavy."
"As for the weather in Muroran,
"The night will be cloudy..."
So it's going to rain in Hakodate? What dreadful weather!
What will we do if lightning strikes the plane?
Don't worry!
Planes fly above the clouds.
Yes, but the runways are below the clouds, aren't they?
Well...
(Sighs) I don't feel like getting wet at all,
now that I've dressed up especially for the occasion.
My grandmother always said that if you dress like that,
the god of lightning will come and grab your belly button.
Really?
If he wants to grab me, let him try!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Thank you so much!
I thank you for inviting us
to celebrate the success of the play with the whole team.
Thanks to you, the thief was not able to take the jewel.
It's a just reward.
That's right!
Don't give it another thought and enjoy your stay in Hakodate.
-By the way, you're late, Juri! -So late!
I'm sorry about that.
She'll be here soon, it's just that Natsuki is giving her a little make-up.
They are in the car, in the airport parking lot.
He's doing her make-up?
What a hard life famous actresses have!
Poor Natsuki really has a hard life!
Yes, Juri doesn't even let her breathe...
and treats her like she's his errand girl.
Ah..., I get it.
(Juri) Hello!
Sorry I'm late.
You look more charming every day, Miss Maki!
Thank you, Mr. Mouri.

I think we are all here.
No, Shinjo has not arrived.
In fact, Shinjo called me this morning...
and said he couldn't come because he wasn't feeling well.
Are you serious?
That's too bad, Juri.
-Huh?
What's the matter? -And now, not at all.
Excuse me, aren't the other actors coming with us?
Of course they won't!
What fun would it be to invite groups of amateur extras?
(He thinks) "I have a feeling."
If my intuition serves me right, I'm sure he'll show up very soon.
Inspector Nakamori, the men are here.
Good.
Group A will guard the front gate.
Group B, the back door.
Group C, the surrounding area.
(At the same time) Yes!
-Inspector Nakamori: What's going on?
-There's light in the house.
Wh-What?
Oh!
Why, it's...!
(Megaphone: woman) "Attention, please."
"Sky Japan Flight 865 to Hakodate.
"is ready for boarding."
"Estimated time of departure is 6:15 p.m."
"Passengers for flight 865 bound for Hakodate,
"please board at gate 8."
Ha-ha-ha!
How cool!
It's very soft!
They're pretty comfortable seats.
I feel like a businessman!
Sky Japan is the only domestic airline that has such comfortable seats upstairs.
that has such comfortable seats on the upper deck.
Hey, Ran!
What? What's wrong with you?
Why do you keep looking backwards?
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with me.
(Woman) Welcome aboard.
He's come!
Who has come? Xt!
(woman) Shut up!
Excuse me, I have the seat next to me.
Mm?
Yes, come in.
Eh?
-Eris! -Oh! -Oh!
Oh, my goodness!
Mrs. Mouri!
Hello, mother!
Gee, you're going to Hakodate too?
What a coincidence!
I was telling you, you and the father were linked by destiny!
What on earth are you talking about?
You told me that the Juri Maki had invited him to her house,
but the father wasn't coming, and you told me to come instead!
-Ran!
It's always the same...
This is an unimportant detail, you can now sit down and....
(At the same time) No way!
I'm not going to sit next to this...
Please behave yourself.
Oh.
Father!
Excuse me, Miss Maki.
Is that seat free?
What seat?
Yes, come in.
Mother, where are you going?
Sorry to bother you, are you Miss Juri Maki?
-Yes. My name is Eri Kisaki.
I would like to thank you
for inviting me to your country house.
Ah.
You are welcome.
Oh, by the way.
If this rude man sitting next to you...
should it occur to him to bother you, come and see me anytime.
Wow!
I didn't know you were a lawyer.
-See you later, miss.
Goodbye, Miss.
AAAI...
Why shouldn't it have worked? It was predictable.
Yes, it was.
Sorry for the delay, my friends!
(Juri) Shinjo!
I thought you couldn't come because you were feeling sick!
Yes..., but it turns out that I'm feeling much better now...
and I didn't have any plans for this weekend.
That's why I decided to join the expedition.
Sorry for the delay, Josephine.
Why didn't you do what I told you?
Don't worry.
We'll have time to do it when we get there.
-Good trip. -Thank you very much.
(Megaphone: woman) "Cabin crew, block the exit doors."
(Ouch) What are you thinking about?
I'm sure you're still thinking about the Kaito Kid.
Yes.
I'd like to know if his real intention was to steal the jewel.
It's already too dark to play hide-and-seek with you..., detective.
Besides... being the Kid..,
I'm surprised he was carrying a truncheon
that didn't meet the regulation measurements.
Guys!
I got seat 4K, like Kaito Kid's "K"!
Well, I got the 4J seat, it's the "J" of "jumbo"!
I got the 4B, so.... 4B, 4B...
(Think) "Oh! Now I'm falling!"
The 4 English words
that the Kaito Kid wrote in his threatening note
belonged to the international phonetic code!
The phonetic code? Yes.
It is a code that is used
to avoid confusion during radio communications.
The "R" stands for "Romeo", the "J" stands for "Juliet",
the "V" stands for "Victor" and the letter "B" is "Bravo".
It is also used by airlines

to talk to the control tower.
Sky J 865, runway 16 left, stand by.
Juliet 10,
(Radio: male) "Eko 10, Charlie 10."
Sky J 865, Juliet 10, Eko 10, Charlie 10.
Therefore, the phrase "while 26 letters fly in all directions"
means that in Kaito Kid plans to commit the robbery inside the plane,
where the phonetic code is commonly used.
In addition, he was referring to this plane flying from Tokyo to Hakodate.
How do you know?
It could be the plane back...
Oh!
The drawing on the letter!
Yes.
The card drawn was a 2 of spades cut in half.
This indicates that it is an odd number
that cannot be divided by 2.
Flights taking off from Tokyo
have odd numbers like this one, which is 865.
On the other hand, those landing in Tokyo have even numbers.
Now I'm beginning to understand what happened last night.
The Kaito Kid wanted to draw attention to himself
and to make it look like we had crippled his plans
to make us lower our guard so that he could surprise us later.
According to your theory...
...the Kaito Kid is camouflaged in this plane,
ready to swoop down on the ring.
(Megaphone: woman) "Gentlemen passengers, welcome aboard..."
(Megaphone: woman) -Jury, what's wrong? -Actually, I'm not feeling very well.
You must be tired.
Here, Juri.
For your hand.
It's vitamins.
"Commander Okoshi and the entire crew...
"We wish you a good flight and hope to see you again soon."
(Radio: male) "Sky J 865, wind 160, at 10,

Sky J 865, clear for takeoff,
runway 16 left, stand by.
We're off.
-80! -Check.

V2.

Train in.
Oh, man!
My ears are popped.
-Yeah, me too.
It's-it's the pressure change.
If you swallow saliva, it'll pass.
I don't.
It doesn't happen to me either.
Then try holding your nose and blowing with your mouth closed.
Yes, but don't do it too fast, think it might make you dizzy.
That's it!
And look how much snot I have come out!
Don't you look, Conan!
Eh?
Wow.
It's all a senyoreta.
What?
Expelling air with a stuffy nose and a closed mouth
is not a very seductive image.
She doesn't like to be seen grimacing,
if she's got the boy she likes in front of her.
Ah.
-Excuse me, Miss Juri. -Yes?
Would you mind signing my autograph?
And now, with pleasure.
Oh!
What a mess, I forgot my pen at home!
Miss Maki.
Use my pen.
Thank you.
That's why this girl is so indispensable.
What should she do, the father, now?
Don't worry, he must be flirting.
By the way, why don't you tell me who everyone is?
Sure, sure, sure.
Eh?
Aaah!
I'm sorry.
-You hurt yourself? -No.
-Tingui. Thank you very much!
Thank you very much.
Do you prefer the Japanese or the Western menu?
I'm not hungry, thank you.
Japanese or Western menu?
I won't eat anything, thank you.
I don't want anything to drink either.
I'll have a beer and a snack.
Wait a moment, please.
There's nothing like a beer...
It's raining cats and dogs.
Yes..., I hope we won't have any problems.
(Radio: male) "Sky J 865, contact Tokyo control tower,
"Frequency 118.90."
(Man) Sky J 865.
118.90.
Tokyo control.
Sky J 865, flight level 390.
"Sky J 865, Tokyo control. Receiving."
You're not feeling well, Commander?
Yes, it's just that my little boy had a fever last night...
and I've hardly been able to sleep.
Would you like me to order you a strong coffee?
Yes, thank you, that would be nice.
They haven't taken your ring yet?
No, but I'd better not get distracted.
(Thinking) "It sure went fast!"
What in flights, Masayo?
They're chocolates.
"Do they carry coffees in the cabin?"
"They don't usually do, on domestic flights."
Hello.
I'm Chiaki, I'm carrying the coffees.
"Come in."
(Pip, pip)
-Disculpin. Hello!
(Pip, pip) Mm?
You can't get into the cockpit.
-It's all right, Chiaki. What?
The lady had been a stewardess.
Long time no see, Commander!
I haven't seen you since you quit.
-What must it be, 5 years? -It's been 7.
How time flies!

Good to see you too, Nakaya.
Nice to see you too.
I went to see "Josephine".
Yes?
How nice!
-She played an extraordinary role. -You're serious?
Thank you very much!
I wish you luck... go ahead.
Oh!
I'll leave you alone.
See you soon, commander.
Miss Maki.
Would you like a bonbon? -Thank you.
Agafi'n one, you too, Mr. Mouri.
Yes, thank you.
Delicious!
Oh!
Oh!
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaah...
Oh, my God!
Mr. Kogoro, it smells like almonds.
Yes.
She's been poisoned with cyanide.
The chocolates!
The chocolates were poisoned!
The chocolates?
Father!
Don't worry.
If the bonbon you ate had been poisoned too,
I'm sure you'd be dead by now.
(Thinking) "But... why her?"
I bring you a message from the commander.
He asks you to try to take charge of the situation
until we land at the airport
to prevent the passengers from getting nervous
and things get complicated.
Sure, I'll do that.
How did the assassin do it
to give him the poison in the Juri without anyone noticing?
This is obvious.
It was the chocolates.
She died right after eating a bonbon.
I agree.
And now!
I didn't know anything!
I bought the chocolates this afternoon
at the pastry shop in Ginza where I always go
and I just opened the box a moment ago!
-Right, Natsuki? -What?
-Sorry, I didn't notice. Natsuki!
But you ate one and nothing happened to you!
that means there were only a few poisoned ones, right?
In this case,
How did the murderer
to get Juri to take the poisoned bonbon?
Being her manager, I'm sure she knew which candy she would choose.
I didn't do anything!
Besides, whenever she was offered chocolates, she always chose them at random!
In fact, Juri thought long and hard before taking the candy.
Shut up!
You stay out of this, kid!
Just in case, I'll keep this box of chocolates.
Yes.
When we've landed,
we'll notify the local police and they'll take care of the case.
Yes.
Please, I'd appreciate it if you'd move to the back of the plane...
to preserve the crime scene as it has been left.
The front lavatory will be taken out of service, so please use another one.
"Apart from the chocolates,
"The only thing Juri has eaten since she boarded the plane...
"has been the vitamin pills."
"But that doesn't mean she's only taken the pills..."
I've got it!
I know who the murderer is!
Father! Who is it, who is the culprit?
Ahem, ahem...
The victim, Miss Juri,
has only eaten two things since she has boarded the plane.
One of these things is the chocolate bonbon that we all know about,
and the other is some vitamins.
Was it you?
There is nothing more to say.
The person who murdered Juri Maki on board this plane...
...was you, Tenko Tajima!
I hope this is a joke!
How can you say such an outrageous thing?!
I have no motive to kill her!
-Are you sure?
I would say that there is no one here
who didn't have a motive to kill Miss Juri.
I... may I know what you're talking about?
You're Natsuki Sakai, her hairdresser, right?
Explain yourself, we're listening.
Yes.
Look, I spent many hours with Miss Juri,
and I know for a fact what kind of relationship she had with the people around her,
starting with Mr. Ban.
In fact, even though he was the director of the play,
"It was Miss Juri who gave us almost all the orders and instructions."
Some time ago, Mr. Ban gave Juri...
a chance to make a name for herself,
but they switched roles,
and lately he didn't dare to contradict her.
"I saw many times
"As Miss Tenko would get angry with him on this account.
"And he would scold her loudly."
Three years ago, Juri asked Mr. Bunjiro Narusawa for a divorce.
As he was still in love,
"He asked her several times for a second chance,
"but she always gave him a hard time."
Lately, the Juri had begun to tire of Isao Shinjo,
her young lover.

I know because he asked me to introduce him to other young boys.
As for Masayo, his manager...
Juri always told her in front of everyone
that she was a stupid girl with no style at all,
and used to make a fool of her.
As for me,
Juri was selfish and treated me like a dog.
I wanted to work for other actors,
but she always prevented me from doing so.
On the one hand I felt proud, but on the other hand it was frustrating.
Wasn't it?
We all had good reasons to kill Juri.
(Mitsuhiko) Wow, Genta!
I don't understand how you can be hungry at a time like this.
It's just that these things are worthless when they get cold.
That's so good!
(Mitsuhiko) "What if his fingers had been smeared with poison?"
"The first thing that touched the Juri's hand was Mr. Shinjo."
"He could have done it then!"
"But he wasn't the only one."
"Maybe the pen was poisoned!"
"Or maybe he got his fingers dirty when he pressed the switch."
"Although it's also possible
that the murderer spread the poison around the sink.
"in a place he knew the Juri would touch later."
"Come to think of it, the Juri has been very little time in the bathroom."
"Wait a minute! Just before..."
"Sure! It was that!"
"That's why you weren't feeling well!"
In fact, I'm not feeling very well.
"I know what the trick is....
"And who's to blame for pulling it off."
Wow, Mr. Kogoro!
What's that?
What is it?
I don't see anything.
What is it?
What is it?
"Perfect, now!"
Ooooh!
"Ow! Oysters!"
What do you see, up there?
Must have been my imagination.
I have to go to the bathroom.
What's going to happen to him?
(thinks) "What are we going to do!"
"There always has to be a first time."
(Sonoko voice) Beloved, stop making people suffer!
What?
"Oops! I've got the wrong voice!"
Sonoko! What did I say?
(Eri voice) Don't beg anymore and tell us the truth at once!
What?
This case will seem too easy for you
because I intervened in Sleeping Kogoro, right?
Very well, I'll take care of it myself.
What?!
No way!
Hurray!
Today we'll see your mother in action!
To begin with, I'll tell you...
how the murderer got the cyanide into the Juri.
He used a very ingenious method.
I'll tell you four.
It has to do with the covered ears.
The plugged ears?
The killer knew that the Juri had to uncover her ears
every time she took a plane.
She did it this way:
she pried her nose with the thumb and forefinger of her right hand
and blew with her mouth closed.
(Eri voice) As some of you may already know,
it is the first technique they teach you when you start diving.
Professionals are able to do it without holding their nose,
but Juri was just a beginner,
so she had to do it with the help of her fingers.
Isn't that right, dear?
Yes...
Wait a minute!
How do you know that?
In fact, Ayumi made me think when she did the same thing.
I did?
You were embarrassed to uncover your ears like that in front of everyone.
Miss Juri was a famous actress,
and you, Kogoro, were sitting next to her.
No matter how much of an idiot he is, a man is always a man.
Did you say "idiot" to me?
That's why Miss Juri went to the washroom to unclog her ears.
Then she went back to her seat...
and picked up a bonbon with the thumb and forefinger of her right hand.
"Then, as he used to do, he licked his fingers."
He did so without being aware that this gesture
"It would be the way for the poison to enter..."
...into his body.
What the fuck did he lick his fingers?
How come he had poison in the fingers of his hand?
Hey, do you also have trouble breathing?
Ah... Yes, it's very strange.
(Voice: Eri) But I'm sure that, before she died,
Miss Juri had already been feeling the effects of the poison for a while.
Juri was not feeling well because her body...
had begun to absorb the poison through her skin.
The skin?
You don't mean...?
Yes.
Inside the car parked in the Haneda airport parking lot,

"Ms. Juri has smeared both sides of her nose
"with makeup base mixed with cyanide."
And the person responsible for her death,
Natsuki Sakai..., is you!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
What nonsense!
It's a very interesting theory, but...
In Conan explained to me that you're going to scold the girls
"When they were stirring the foundation pots."
"You probably just wanted to scare them just in case.
"to make sure they didn't go near the pots."
the day they add the poison, right?
If you're so convinced,
why don't you prove it with hard evidence?
Proof?
If the police found the thumb and index fingers of the victim's right hand
a mixture of makeup base and cyanide,
everything would be proven,
but since Miss Juri has licked the fingers,
she has made the main evidence of the crime disappear.
But there is still another proof.
What is it?
It's the bottle of foundation
mixed with the poison and the sponge to apply it.
You're very clever,
and I doubt you got on the plane with the bottle on you.
I also don't think you would have risked
throwing it in the airport trash.
In fact, if I were you,
I would have disposed of the evidence by mailing it to my home.
We'll just need to call the post office at the airport
and ask them to check all the packages they have.
Maybe they will find one with your home address....
That woman... shattered my life's dream.
Your dream?
Actually, I had hoped to work in Hollywood...
doing makeup for the big actors.
To make my dream come true,
I studied at a makeup academy in Los Angeles..,
and I even ended up mastering English.
Later, I went back to Tokyo,
and, while working for Juri,
I kept sending resumes to some Hollywood studios.
A month ago, an American actress came to Japan.
Her manager liked my work very much,
and made me an offer to work with her team.
It was the opportunity... I had been waiting for all my life!
But... then, that woman came and ruined everything!
I would do it because I didn't want to lose.
If she had needed me as a make-up artist,
maybe I could have forgiven her!
But that was not the case.
That conceited woman only wanted me by her side
so that I could be her errand girl.
When I realized this, I had no choice but to kill her.
I did it because she shattered my pride as a make-up artist!
Your makeup artist pride?
Don't make me laugh!
If it were like that, you wouldn't have used your profession...
to commit murder.
In your situation, you have no right to utter the word "pride"!
It's just that... it's just that I...
You are still very young.
Pay for the crime you have committed and you can rebuild your life.
(Thinking) "What's wrong?"
"I have a bad feeling,
"as if something is gnawing at my conscience..."
"Oysters!"
Hey, tell the commander and the co-pilot...
not to eat the cookies you brought them earlier!
If you don't hurry, their lives will be in danger!
What's wrong with you?
The cookies are not poisoned.
Of course they're not.
Not the cookies, but they may have poison on their hands!
What?!
What do you mean by that?!
Explain at once!
Yes, right away.
Excuse me, excuse me!
"I knew it!"
Commander!
Commander, you're not feeling well?
What happened, commander?
But... but what's going on?
-Mr. Nakaya, are you all right? -Mr. Nakaya, are you all right?
Commander!
(Alarm)
(Alarm) Oysters!
The autopilot has been disabled!
(Alarm)
(Shouting)
Commander, react, please!
Commander! (Alarm)
Hurry, get him out of here and leave the seat free! (Alarm)
(Alarm)
(Alarm) Commander!
(Think) "That's it! I have to turn the autopilot back on."
Mr. Shinjo!
Congratulations, nano!
It's fixed.
Get a doctor!
Understood.
(Megaphone: woman) "Attention, please. We have a medical emergency."
"If there is a doctor on board the plane,
"Please contact the crew members."

They are intoxicated by a poison with immediate effects.
I will try to administer first aid there,
but we should get them out of the cabin.
Yes.
Mr. Ban, Mr. Narusawa!
We need help!
Yes!
- (Reiko) First aid kit door! Yes!
Hey, Conan!
How did the commander get poisoned?
Earlier, Miss Juri entered the cabin.
As it turns out they were old acquaintances,
the commander and co-pilot kissed her hand goodbye.
I understand.
They came into contact with the poison through the girl's hand.
How unfortunate.
If they had just shaken hands,
the poison would have stayed in the hand instead of going into the mouth.
Up you go.
How are they, doctor?
They were lucky,
they have ingested a small amount of poison and there is no danger of death.
But they are in a semi-conscious state
and are in no condition to continue flying the plane.
No way!
That the commander and co-pilot are unconscious?
Excuse me, what is your name?
"My name is Shinjo, I am a passenger."
Mr. Shinjo,
could you tell us what condition the plane is in right now?
"We are at 3,600 meters above sea level and we are aiming for 280 knots of speed."
"Fortunately, the instrument landing system is activated."
"I have a little bit of experience.
"About the operation of the flaps and landing gear."
"I just need instructions on when to do it."
Understood.
Cancel all inbound and outbound flights
and bring me a pilot to the control tower.
(Megaphone: female) "Attention, passengers."
"Please be advised that....,
"Due to adverse weather conditions in Hakodate..,
"All inbound and outbound flights are cancelled."
"We apologize for the inconvenience." Ladies and..."
We'll do it like this.
I will occupy the commander's seat,
and the co-pilot's seat will sit... yes, yourself.
Me?
I liked the way you took charge of the situation just now.
Yay!
I've flown a lot of airplanes to arcade simulators!
Hey, boy!
What a face, Conan!
-I want to try it too! -Me, too!
This is no game!
Besides..., the plane works on autopilot.
But even if the landing system is activated,
we'll have to do some things manually.
That's why I need your help.
But why do you want me to help the boy?
You trust me and everything will be fine.
Gentlemen, we'll be landing in a quarter of an hour.
Everyone back to your seats, please.
In Shinjo... he said he had a little experience, but...
-I imagine he must have a license to fly small planes.
Well, well, well!
Father, it seems to me that mother has fallen asleep.
And now!
Gentlemen passengers, return to your seats...
"And fasten your seat belts."
Father, why don't you sit next to the mother?
All right, if there's no other choice...
Hey, wake up!
Come on!
Nothing to do.
(Radio: woman) "This is control tower, we have an emergency."
"I repeat. This is control tower, we have an emergency."
You're in Kid, right? Mm?
What the hell?
Come on, don't run away from the studio.
Except for you, who else would have thought...
to put an elementary school kid like me in the passenger seat?
Ha-ha!
You've found me out!
Today, the real Isao Shinjo...
...is at the Juri's country house in Hakodate, disguised as the Kaito Kid.
Isn't he?
The Juri's Juri was sparkling when she saw you show up on the plane.
I'm sure she had asked you to dress up as the Kaito Kid
to entertain the party guests.
Good deduction.
The problem is that someone else must have gone to Hakodate
convinced that the Kaito Kid would not give up easily,
and I'll stick my neck out that he must now be about to catch the impostor.
So what, when you were planning to steal the "jewel of fortune"?
I let it run.
What?
Surely you must know by now
that, if you rub a real star sapphire with your lips,
it feels cold.
That one was fake.
"That's why she kissed his hand!"
"I was supposed to spread the word that the jewel was genuine!

to act as a lure for people to go and see the play "Josefina...".
What are you going to do?
Will you try to stop me, detective?
Yes, but first we have to lock this steel bird in its cage.
(Radio: male) "Sky J 865,
"Hakodate control tower will guide you."
"Please tune to frequency 118.35."
118.35, received.
Hakodate Control Tower.
My name is Uesugi, I am in charge.
I'll pass you Commander Shimaoka, okay?
Shimaoka here.
Do you know where the CCM, the control panel, is located?
(Kid) "Yes, I do."
Then, press the button marked APP...
and the plane will automatically taxi to the runway.
(Kid) "Got it.
APP...
That's the one!
(Conan voice) That's it!
(Conan voice) Eh?
Who are you?
"My name is Conan Edogawa, I'm Mr. Shinjo's assistant."
Assistant?
He's got a kid sitting next to him?
"Hey, uncle,
"Be quiet and please don't touch any buttons, okay?"
Hm.
(Shinichi voice) Now I can be quiet.
Hey, Uncle, do you know how to fly airplanes?
Of course I do!
When we were in Hawaii, my father taught me how to fly small planes.
Wow!
I see I've chosen the best helper of all.
It's just that he taught me from the ground.
In fact, I've never flown a plane before.
The weather's awful, but I hope they can land.
Yes.
-It's raining! -And it's so windy.
Don't let the plane crash!
Don't let it fall!
The airport!
They're coming!
He wants 865, flaps on number 1.
Flaps at 5.
(Radio: Shimaoka) "Flaps at 10."
"Deploy landing gear, flaps at 20."
Looks to me like we're about to land!
(Sirens)
(Alarm)
-What?! - (alarm)
Lightning!
We were struck by lightning! (Alarm)
We were struck by lightning (alarm)
and we do not work the navigation system! (alarm)
Calm down!
Turn the white knob next to the screen!
(alarm)
Finally! Not yet! (Alarm)
The autopilot has been deactivated! (Alarm)
(Alarm)
(Alarm) It can not be!
Abort landing!
Increase speed and try to gain altitude!
Now, hide the landing gear.
That's it. "Continue climbing."
Oysters!
You're losing your course!
Right!
Turn right!
-Xocaran against the terminal! -You must gain altitude!
We are lost!
-Alça! How strong!
The airport!
How is the control tower?
(Radio: Shimaoka) "Vol 865, can you feel me?"
(Conan voice) Yes, sorry!
Everything all right down there?
(Radio: Shimaoka) "At the control tower no one has taken bad,
"But it will take a while to reopen the runways."
- "What's your status?" - We've lost engine 2.
"It's all right. You'll be able to land with the 3 engines left."
(Kid) "Can they maintain balance?"
(Kid) "The plane is stable, yes. I've closed the third valve."
(Kid) "Good.
What speed and altitude do they want?
(Kid) "At 200 knots and 900 meters."
Set the ailerons to position 5 and keep the plane horizontal.
"Now, tilt the nose of the plane 180 degrees upward...
"And climb to 1,400 meters."
Roger that!
And then what do we do, keep circling?
Yes.
If we can get the autopilot working and they clear the runway,
we'll be able to re-engage the instrument landing system.
and we'll be cleared to land.
(Man) I told you!
We don't have enough trucks here! (Sirens)
Put out the runway fire!
Conan, we've got trouble!
(They speak at once)
We've lost one of the engines! I know, don't worry.
We'll be able to land safely with the 3 engines we have left.
We have enough fuel to... Eh?
What's going on? We're running out of fuel!
We're running out of fuel!
What?!
-What do you say, now! -We're out of fuel?!
We're out of fuel?! What does that mean?
It must have been when we lost the engine.
No.
Normally, each of the engines have their own fuel tank,
and they're independent.
The diffuser valves are open!
Conan!
What do you say is open? The diffuser valves!

When you press that button,
the valves separating the fuel tanks open and the fuel from the 4 tanks is mixed
and the fuel from the 4 tanks mixes.
Oh, shit!
What happened?
(They call)
It was that asshole!
We can't waste a minute more.
Yes.
Control tower... Boy!
There should be some map for here, take it to me, please!
Sit me down, control tower?
Come in!
(Radio: male) "Vol 865, this is control tower."
"We do not feel it, speak louder!"
There is interference, I feel nothing!
What's the problem? Doctor!
We've lost an engine and we're running out of fuel!
Are you serious?!
A map, a map, a map, a map...
-I've got it!
Oh, shit!
First the autopilot, then the track,
the fuel and now the radio is broken!
What's wrong?
Not the autopilot? You're flying the plane manually?
Here, Conan, here's a map! Thank you, Conan.
We have about 3,000 pounds of fuel left.
If we consume 300 every minute, we only have 10 minutes of margin!
We've got to find somewhere to make an emergency landing
before we run out of time.
An emergency landing?
-I don't think they'll have time to clear the runway in 10 minutes.
To Chitose!
We could fly to their airport.
It's too far.
We'd probably run out of fuel before we got there.
What about another airport?
Aren't there any near here?
No.
Maybe there's an airstrip for small planes...
or some military base..., but the runways are too short.
Then why don't we try to land in the middle of a road?
The Hokkaido region is full of wide, straight roads.
No way!
There are 11 meters between the wheels of this plane,
and any road more than 12 meters wide
has a median and must be marked by law.
There are houses and power poles.
-What if we land in a field? -Neither.
The surface is too soft.
I think it would be much wiser to soak the sea.
No!
The plane would capsize when it hits the waves.
(Thinking) "Where is...? Where is...?"
"There must be some place where we can land safely!"
It has to be a long, straight place with nothing around it.
Guys, what happens if we can't land anywhere?
Well... we'll crash, of course.
-What?
But I still don't want to die!
Hey, Conan.
I've got an idea!
I know a long, straight place with nothing around it!
Where?
I saw it on TV,
in a documentary called "Whale and Dolphin Watching".
"If it was a whale watching documentary,
"They must have filmed Muroran."
The piers!
Shin Nittetsu pier, Nakau pier,
Hotowa Nishi Pier, Muroran Pier, Nisseki Pier...
Here!
Sakimori Pier!
It will be... about 1,400 meters long and 30 meters wide, more or less.
But this plane is... Yes, it's over 60 meters wide.
But if we land and one of the wings is above the water...
It won't work, the runway is not long enough.
A plane like this
needs at least 2,000 meters of runway to land.
Besides, we don't know if the terrain will be strong enough.
Fortunately or unfortunately, we have very little fuel left,
and that means the plane weighs less.
Therefore, we won't need such a long runway to land.
And depending on the wind direction,
a few meters will be enough.
I've seen the weather forecast
and they said... that Muroran would be blowing strong winds from the west all night!
Are you sure about that? Yes!
This pier faces east to west.
If we enter the runway from the east side, upwind,
we could make it.
It won't work. What?
Earlier, when we hit the control tower,
I hit my left arm pretty hard.
In fact, I can only use my right arm to fly.
If we have to land manually,
I'll need both arms to grab the control stick.
What?
Do you have good eyesight?
Do I?
I'm a little nearsighted.
Do you have any diseases? No, I don't have any.
Bust, waist and hip measurements?

Well... chest I do...
What a face!
All right, you're approved.
You'll sit in my seat... and you'll fly the plane.
You can't ask me that, I've never flown a plane before!
It's okay, I'll stay behind you and I'll give you instructions,
you'll just have to hold the control stick tight.
No, I can't do that!
It's impossible!
The plane!
We're losing altitude!
-We crashed!
Hurry, Ran, its here!
Relax, just stay calm...
and pull the lever towards you.
There, that's good.
Isn't that easy?
And now!
Where does Muroran fall to? I'm looking for him.
Here!
The air route that goes from Hakodate to Sapporo
passes very close to Muroran.
The bearing is 23 degrees.
23 degrees?
We will fly at 5,000 meters to cross the mountains.
Understood.
Hey, you should tell the passengers...
that we'll be landing at Chitose airport.
Okay, okay, okay.
And have the passengers on the first floor transfer to the upper floor.
What?
If they find out that a young high school student
is sitting in the pilot's seat, they'll get cold feet.
Children, you should also return to your seat.
(At the same time) What?!
If you stay here, she won't be able to help and you'll be more of a nuisance than she is.
I'd rather you go back to your seat
and keep an eye on the other children so they don't make too much of a fuss.
It's a very important job.
If you don't have the heart, I'll let someone know.
What to say?
Will you be able to do it?
-Of course! -We'll try!
Trust us!
-All right, I trust you! - (time) Receipt!
I will not leave!
If anything should happen,
I am the only person who can help Ran!
As you wish.
I'll explain how the other instruments work
while we head for the runway.
There's no time.
Let's go, let's go!
Sky J 865, Hakodate control tower, do you read me?
Come in!
There's nothing to do, the emergency line is down too.
Look at this.
The plane is moving away.
Where should they go?
So this is the Shiratori Bridge!
It's really spectacular, Shiratori.
I'm sorry, Inspector, but it's Hakuchi Bridge.
I'm glad I listened to you
and went through Muroran after finishing the Sapporo case.
This Shiratori Bridge is a real wonder.
(Thinks) "I wish someday I could come here with the Miwako...."
(Thinks) "What a waste of time..."
(Sirens)
What a pile of patrol cars!
Wow.
Something very serious must have happened.
Guys, let's see what happened!
"Attention, passengers.
"Due to a minor technical problem,
"we have been forced to divert the plane to the new airport at Chitose,
"where we plan to land without further complications."
"The commander and the entire crew..."
-We are on our way to Muroran. -Xxxxxt!
We will soon arrive at Muroran.
We'll go down to 2,000 feet.
Yes.
Look, there's light!
That's Muroran harbor!
Sakimori Pier should be further to the left,
on the other side of the Hakuchi Bridge.
(Think) "Oysters!"
Wait a minute, it's too dark, you can't see anything at all!
Hey, are you really planning to land there?
(Thinking) "What can I do? It's too late to turn back!"
Conan, are you sure about what you're doing?
Can you tell me what...?
This is getting complicated, and I'm not sticking around to see how it ends.
Good luck!
Where are you going? Don't go!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ran, balance the plane!
What are you doing?
I advise you to fuck you hard!
What's wrong?
What went wrong?
Do not suffer, it's nothing.
Keep the plane horizontal!
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaah!
Eh?
Eeeeh?
Ka... Ka... Kaito Kid!
So long, beautiful.
I'm convinced that someday, sooner or later,
we'll meet again under the pale moonlight.
Ah, yes.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
He jumped?
Yes, he has become the Kaito Kid!
(thinks) "Now I get it!"
He pressed the button to decrease the air pressure.
She ran away because she doesn't want to get hurt when we crash!
And to think that I admired her, in this coward!
Sonoko, even if you don't take it for granted that we crash....

Conan.
How are we going to get out?
We have no choice but to try to land manually, Ran.
It'll be all right, Ran!
They say 6 eyes see more than 3,
we'll find... a way to get by!
"I'd say it wasn't fine just like that..."
(Ran: laugh)
You mean "4 eyes see more than 2", Sonoko.
Maybe so.
Anyway, we'll approach the dock and analyze the situation.
(Isao) Help!
Help!
I'm not the Kaito Kid, I've been taken for someone else!
Then why are you running away from us?
Well because... one day I stole a watch, and...
You see?
I knew you were in the Kaito Kid!
Inspector Nakamori.
What do you want?
What's that over there?
An unmistakable silhouette, it's in Kaito Kid.
The Kid?!
Who are you?
I've already told you that you have the wrong person!
What, Sonoko, how do you see it?
You can't see anything.
There are a few small lights,
but the dock is not illuminated and you can barely make it out.
(Thinking) "Damn!"
Is everything all right, Ran?
What's wrong, Ran?
I don't know.
Suddenly, I feel like....
I'm sorry, Conan.
I don't feel like I can go on.
Don't say that!
I'm sure you can!
(Thinking) "I don't like this. We won't make it this way."
Sonoko, can you... replace me for a moment?
I have to go to the washroom.
To the washroom?
I'll be right back.
Maybe the radio will be working again in a while,
so put on your headphones!
Wait a minute, I don't...
I can't believe it, what a bad time to go to the bathroom!
These children are irresponsible.
(Radio: pip)
Hello?
Anybody here?
"Ran, you feel me? Ran!"
Oh... Shinichi...!
I'm calling from the Sapporo control tower.
I'm told you're having trouble, up there.
"But that's it now."
"Try to calm down and do exactly as I tell you."
"I'll help you land this plane."
I won't let anything happen to you, trust me!
"Ran, can you hear me?"
Ran, say something to him!
What do you want?
Are you trying to impress me?
Do you have any idea that the lives of all these passengers depend on me?
Stop pretending that nothing is wrong!
You're never there when I need you, we only talk on the phone!
And when you come back,
"You disappear after a moment."
"Always."
"Always..."
"Stop it! I don't want to listen to you!"
"Shinichi told me."
"Wait for me, Ran."
"Don't go away. I'll be right back."
You always stand me up.
"Hey, Ran, she says she wants you to wait for her."
Who do you think I am?
"I'm...
in love with you..., Shinichi.
(Thinking) "Ran..."
"There's light! I see lights!"
There's a row of red lights moving in a row!
What are you saying!
(Think) "This is looking better already!"
Demon's Kaito Kid, you won't escape!
Look, the Kaito Kid is heading towards the dock!
I can see it.
The Kid's heading for the dock!
Units A and B, follow him...
and park the cars in line at the dock to cut off his retreat!
Unit C, come after me!
The harassment!
Avi, it's the police.
There must have been an accident.
Looks like they're coming this way.
(Shinichi voice) Ran, prepare to land!
(Shinichi's voice) What?
"These lamps are the patrol cars
"that are chasing the Kaito Kid."
You mean the Kid has jumped out of the plane...
...so that the patrol cars would light up the dock for us?
Now that's my real hero!
I knew he wasn't a coward!
Ran, turn left and make another full turn.
Roger that.
On Kid!
Look for the Kaito Kid!
She can't have gone far, open your eyes wide!
-Have we found her? -Not yet!
What about there?
(Think) "Now it's up to you..., detective."
(Isao's voice) Gentlemen passengers, next...
"We will make an emergency landing."
"Fasten your seat belts...
"And follow the instructions of the onboard personnel."
Remove your goggles
and put your high heels in the front seat pocket.
Tilt your body forward and hide your head between your legs.
(Shinichi voice) Listen to me, Ran, it's time to land.
What is the speed and altitude of the plane?
210 meters altitude, 140 knots speed.

"Good. Progressively descend with a 3-degree incline."
"Sonoko!"
"Lower the shift lever and raise the aileron lever!"
The shift lever?
The flaps?
This is the shift lever and this is the aileron lever.
Understood.
I lower the shift lever and raise the flaps.
Oh, what is this?
What's this? "What happened?"
Shinichi.
We're out of fuel.
Okay, we'll only get one chance, we can't make mistakes!
We'll only get one chance, we can't make any mistakes!
Inspector Megure!
-What's wrong with that plane? -It looks like it's coming this way!
-It looks to me like it's coming this way!
What does it mean?
(Computer) "50".
Tilt the nose up and lift the starter lever!
(Computer) "30."
"20."
Take cover!
"10."
Tilt the nose down!
"Brake!"
(Think) "Stop, stop, stop!"
(Think) "Stop, stop, stop!"
Shinichi!
The crane!
We'll crash!
"Shit!"
The rudder!
Press the pedal with your right foot!
We have stopped!
-The plane braked! -We are saved!
(Exclamations of joy)
(Thinks) "Kudo."
"Looks like the word 'impossible' doesn't exist in your dictionary either."
(Conan voice) Ran, you made it!
Ran?
Ran!
Ran, wake up!
Sonoko!
(Thinking) "They've only fainted."
"What are we going to do."
"They've carried themselves like two brave men.
"You've done very well, Ran."

(Sirens)
(Radio: male) "There were no serious injuries. I repeat: There have been no..."
We were flying and we were afraid.
And we did... brrr!
And then...
(Radio: female) "The situation is totally under control."
Pressure and pulse are normal.
I think you're safe,
but we'll take you to the hospital just in case.
Thank you.
And... how is Sonoko?
She has no visible injuries either,
but she lost consciousness from the impact.
What a break!
I need you to fill out this form
with your name and address.
Yes.
And also put your chest, waist and hip measurements...
What?
The landing was successful.
Ka... Ka...
We'll meet again some other time.
You'll give me your measurements later.
Ka... Ka... Ka...
(Mobile)
Hello? (Shinichi voice) "Ran, it's me."
Shinichi!
Yes, I wanted to...
"You're not the one who called me before, are you?"
I knew it!
I knew it had been the Kaito Kid!
What?
I suspected right away because he was talking to me as if he was looking at me.
Also, I suddenly felt in Conan calling.
"What a mess!"
Eh?
But... in fact, Sonoko said that the Kid had jumped out of the plane...
Yes, in fact it was me, I was hiding in...
I got it!
The thing that jumped out of the plane was an accomplice of the Kid!
A what?
"The Kid must have disguised himself and camouflaged himself among the passengers."
"Lucky it's not you, Shinichi!"
(Think) "Lucky? Why?"
Phew!
I'm saved!
"Why do you say you're saved?" It's a secret between me and Kid.
"I want to know too..." Yeah, man!

Why don't you try to find out, you being a detective?
"How do you want me to find out?"
Then try to catch on Kid and ask him.
"As if it's easy!"
