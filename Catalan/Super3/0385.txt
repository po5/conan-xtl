Today's setting is the mansion of a family of musicians.
A renowned instrument plays the melody of the crime.
He looks like a child but has the brain of an adult and is Detective Conan!

(Agasa) What?
The prefix of Tottori prefecture?
What's wrong?
(Shinichi voice) I already told you.
In the Okinawa murder case,
he was worried about the call he made in Motoyama.
He called a post in Tottori, Kurayoshi.
"Before the incident, investigator Yamamura called Tottori,
"where his grandmother lives."
"In both cases, the area code was 0858."
What does this mean?
It seems to me to be the same one that Vermut put in.
"When he sent a message to his people."
"What?"
"Besides, I don't think that was just any person."
"If I remember correctly, I felt him whisper:
"Okay, you're the boss."
Don't tell me that number is....
Yes, I'm sure...
"0858 is the prefix they use when they want to communicate with him."
But only the first 4 numbers are the same....
Also, although the numbers are also 0858,
I noticed a very small difference.
I am already at home.
(Conan voice) Welcome, Ran.
Tell me something, do you know what notes this melody has?
(Pip, pip, pip, pip)
What do you want to say?
Ah..., it's a... game that has become fashionable.
(Pip, pip, pip, pip, pip)
It was "fa, mi, re, mi", wasn't it?
Or maybe it was "solo, fa, mi, mi, hace"?
It's a "si, la, sol, la", although it sounds different.
Wow, you sure do.
So..., see if you can sing the whole staircase.
(Out of tune) Don..., re..., mi..., hace..., sol..., la..., si..., dooo!
(Radio: man) "2 horses go ahead, no, 3!"
No, it's...
I'm sure it's a "si, la, sol, la".
(Shouting) Stop it!
Stop making noise!
I'll ask those people, but shut up.
Ask... who?
The ones I have to go to see.
It's a family of musicians.
There's a composer who has a very fine ear.
A perfect ear for music?
A perfect ear for music.
The cacophony DEL STRADIVARIUS.
PRELUDIO
(Violin)
(Woman) Mr. Kogoro Mouri?
Mr. Shitara has no meeting scheduled with anyone by that name.
No, the one who asked me to come was his granddaughter, Hasuki Shitara....
Ah, now I understand.
Miss Hasuki is now in the annex rehearsing.
You feel how she plays, don't you?
Oh!
So the music we heard was live?
How wonderful!

I don't know what kind of meeting she had with you,
but I beg you not to interfere with the rehearsals.
He has a very important concert tonight.
-Oh!
Does this mean we have a special event tonight?
It's Mr. Shitara's 72nd birthday.
Oh...

Miss Hasuki...
Mr. Mouri is here to see you.
Oh.
How nice!
He finally came!
How nice!
Yes, of course...
I do what's necessary for a pretty young lady like you.
He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he...
Tell me, are you the composer who has a perfect musical ear?
Eh... No, it's not me.
Hasuki.
Are you sure you can skip the rehearsal like this?
You're the one performing the concert tonight, remember?
-Yes...
-Besides, you know...
...if you do well, my brother's treasure will be you.
Mr. Genzaburo,
I wish you had informed us that you would return with more time.
Ha-ha-ha!
Don't say that.
I've come all this way, leaving the meeting with the orchestra halfway...
Well, I'd like to sleep in my room for a while.
I'll wake up when the party starts, as usual.
Oh, and I hope you haven't touched anything in my room without permission.

-No, I wouldn't want him to call me like his late wife did.
Of course I would.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Hey, miss.
That gentleman is the composer who has a perfect musical ear?
Is he?
No.
Uncle Genzaburo is a very famous conductor,
but he says he doesn't have a perfect musical ear...
The one who has a perfect ear is...
-Yes, sol... Yes, sol... Yes, solo.
Oh, it was a B flat...
Sorry, it's just that an ambulance passed by here.
For yesterday's piece, you can do the BPM from 120-130.
I wish it had a little more life in it...
Yes... Yes, exactly...
You mean him?
Yes, he's the only one who has a perfect musical ear.
He's a genius;
he's composed the soundtrack for many plays.
It's in Kyosuke Haga... And he's my uncle, you know?
Are you talking about me?
Eh?
Yes..., excuse me, can you tell me what notes are these?
Uncle... What did you think of my performance?
It was good, but a quarter of the notes sounded out of tune.
-Ah.
Thank you very much!
-The rest I quite liked.
(Ring)
Excuse me...
Yes... hello...
Ah, you mean... that piece...
I'd like to break up the notes a bit more.
Can you do it?
Mmmm... What I mean is...
Furuta!
Where are you?
Furuta!
Oh!
Grandma!
I heard you playing the violin.
Furuta, don't hide, come out where you are.
Grandma, you're coming back again.
Father died last year, have you forgotten?
Last year, you say?
No!
In Furuta he's still here...
Stop it, Ayane!
You're embarrassing us!
Oh, Grandpa...
How long do you plan to chase the shadow of death?
Our son's already in his prime.
Haven't you understood after such a long time?
Avi, the doctor had told you not to move...
-Yes...
-Mr. Mouri!
Forgive me, but I have to take care of you both.
I'll meet you at the main house in a little while.
I have something I'd like you to see...
(Kogoro) It looks like this violin has been used for a long time!
Yes, because it was made 300 years ago.
So it's quite an antique.
- (notes off-key)
He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he!
It was made by an Italian called Antonio Stradivarius.
Strada... vari... No-no-no-no way!
(He thinks) "I thought so..."
A stradivarius?
This costs a lot of money!
It's... that... legendary... musical instrument!
Father, let him go, hurry!
I-I-I-I've got a stiffy in my body.
What?
Oh, Father!
I can't let go...
Well...
What happened to this legendary musical instrument?
Well...
This precious violin is what in Danjiro Shitara,
Uncle Kyosuke Haga's father gave to my grandfather Choichiro,
his older brother.
Eh?
Even though he's the brother's son, how come his last name is Haga?
Yes... The thing is that unfortunately, on his birthday....,
"A thief attacked in Danjiro..."
Grandfather Choichiro and the others surrendered and tied them up,
"So nothing happened to them."
"But Uncle Danjiro resisted,
"And he died after a few days from the blow he received."
"Uncle Kyosuke, who was left alone,
"He was adopted by his mother's family and took the surname Haga."
Yeah, but... it's surprising they didn't steal it....
I mean, surely they were after the stradivarius.
Looks like the thieves took the wrong... violin... violin.
"As in the Shitara family we've been musicians for generations,
"We have lots and lots of violins."
"All that happened 30 years ago."
Don't tell me... that you want me to find out
who broke in 30 years ago.
No...
What I want to ask you to do is to solve the terrifying incidents
that have been going on for the last two years.
"The first one took place 2 years ago."
"Uncle Genzaburo's wife, a sports figure,
"fell down the stairs and died."
The other is last year's incident.
"My father leaned on a bad railing."
"I can't understand how he..."
could fall like that and kill himself.
I want you... to investigate these frightening cases.
Well, well, well...
But couldn't these be accidents?
No!
All 2 died on Grandpa's birthday!

What's more, the 2 of them... played this stradivarius!
"It's as if they were cursed for what happened 30 years ago..."
And this year, I will play it.
Something bad will happen to me...
Yes, I'm convinced and I'm really scared!
Well, don't touch it, woman.
But I want to touch it!
Listen, but if you can freely dispose, such as,
you can touch it whenever you want, right?
I've asked grandfather for it especially for rehearsal.
to play it on this special occasion.
That's why, I... I have it.
Oh!
See?
I'm sure they were watching me now.
So, that I've been fooling around with the violin before...
This is a secret.
And what... what do you want me to do?
I want you to solve the curse on this stradivarius
before I start playing it.
Huh?
A-a curse is not something
a detective like me can solve.
I thought detectives could solve everything.
Huh? (chuckles)
Looks like something's glowing outside.
They're setting up fireworks for the anniversary?
No, we're not planning on it.
It's burning!
It's in the annex!
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
There's Uncle Genzaburo!
Fire!
Open the curtains and look!
What?
Where is your uncle's room?
-On the second floor, next to the stairs.
Hey, uncle!
You feel me?
Uncle!
Damn, it's locked.
We have no other solution.
-Don't come in!
We can't help you anymore!
-Uncle!
Ayane... Ayane...
Avi!
-What?
Grandma is upstairs?
-Ayane.
The Ayane is still upstairs!
Where is the room upstairs?
It's at the end of the third floor corridor.
It is impossible!
We can't get through without a fireproof suit!
We'll have to make do with this.
-Wait!
-Stay here with everyone!
Uncle!
Mr. Kogoro, please park the car under that window.
Hey, wait!
Do it, okay?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Avi, you have to resist.
Are you all right?
Hey, father, what the hell are you doing?
I don't know!
That little boy told me to park the car here!
How come I listened to that brat?
Grandma, please, you have to resist!
Madam!
Now I understand.
I wanted to use the car to break my fall.
What a thing this little boy thinks.
Lucky they gave us a familiar one because they didn't have anything else.
Hey, it's a rental car!
Do you know how much we'll pay for repairs?
(Sirens)
"Firefighters arrived on the scene,
"But the family's annex continued to burn for a while."
"As if lamenting over the coda of the director, Genzaburo Shitara..."
No!
I don't want to!
-But you have to come with us to the hospital.
No, no, no!
Excuse me..., but let's see if you can do what she tells you.
A year ago, our son was taken away in an ambulance...
and he never came back.
I guess he doesn't want to get into a vehicle of the same species.
Could you make an exception and do the cures at home?
(Fireman) Yes...
(Fireman) Thank you, my boy.
I'm sorry you had to go through that too, Kyosuke.
Don't worry...
Young Mr. Kyosuke, what's wrong?
I'm fine... and please stop calling me "young sir".
It's been 30 years since then.
Mrs. Tsumagari, the housekeeper,
at first worked at Uncle Kyosuke's house.
But 30 years ago, after the robbery,
the death of Danjiro and his wife,
and after Kyosuke was left alone and became part of the family,
she came to work with us.
So, Kyosuke's father was not the only person who died?
No...
"The Chinami, his mother, was in very fragile health,
"But she was looking after her husband with no sleep at all."
"And she had a bout of exhaustion and never recovered."
By the way, what happened to your mother?
She got divorced and moved back to her parents' house 2 years ago.
That's why Aunt Emi played at Grandpa's 70th birthday,
because she also wanted to cheer up my father a bit.
She had to play the stradivarius
"Which they had left sealed for 30 years."
They had sealed the stradivarius?!
Yes.
When grandfather received it from Danjiro, he was very happy.

"My father asked him... when he was 18 years old
"And he used it in a contest."
"But the strings broke twice and disqualified him."
"On another occasion,
"My aunt wanted to perform a piece on a TV show."
"And she got a high fever just before the program started."
"And Uncle Genzaburo, on his way to a concert,
"He caught acute tendonitis while rehearsing."
So, no wonder he had it sealed.
Listen..., you mean that violin must be fine?
We left it in that room we were in.
Wait, if this fire was arson,
they could have taken him away in this moment of confusion.
They didn't.
I took him back to the storage room right away.
Do I strike you as an incompetent housekeeper
who would leave a renowned instrument like that one in the middle of the house
when we have... strangers in the house?
Uh, no, I, no...
Besides, the fire was not arson.
It seems that the area next to the ashtray in that room
was the source of the fire and the door was locked.
Therefore, if the room was locked,
it's impossible that it was arson...
Yes, that is true.
Please be more vigilant when smoking.
It would be better not to smoke, but.
Yes, of course, you are right.
(Kogoro) Even if it's all a coincidence, it's terrifying.
To think that this has happened on the same day three years in a row...
Counting the death of Kyosuke's father,
who died in the robbery 30 years ago,
we have a total of 4 people dead.
If we take this into account, it would be wise to...
to stop celebrating Choichiro-san's birthday.
(Thinking) "He's just been told and he's already smoking..."
Well, be that as it may, he wouldn't have resisted long...
because the guy's lungs were all messed up...
and he had half a year to live.
He did?
Yes.
I wanted to celebrate today's party just to be with him.
We can't do it anymore, because the owner has gone to sleep.
And the doctors have already given the lady and he has gone to sleep.
-So, it doesn't look like this is a case.
We should go home...
Whose cigarette butt is this?
It's not Mr. Kogoro's;
whose is it, then?
Just a moment.
This is the brand Uncle Genzaburo smoked.
By the way, he passed by here before going to the annex.
"In your case... This is..."
Hey, Conan!
Hey, kid!
Where are you going?
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
"I thought so."
"This is not an accident, but a murder."
"What's more, if my deduction is correct,
"The next victim will be..."
(Clock: Ticking)
I'm sure it could be a serial killing.
How... how do you say?
"Wait a minute, D-E-F-G."
"Who has the initial H in her name is Miss Hasuki!"
Oh, no!
It's dangerous to leave her alone!
(Woman: called)
And the next Conan: "The cacophony of the stradivarius. Interlude".
