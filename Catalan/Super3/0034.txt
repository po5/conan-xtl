DETECTIVE CONAN
The mystery man of the mountain house murder
of the mountain house murder (I)
Eh?
That's strange...
I could have sworn the house was this way.
Ran, listen, I think... we've lost our way.
Of course we didn't... We've just done a little backtracking.
(Thinking) "We're lost."
Ah, here we are.
See, Conan?
Look at it, it's this house.
I see someone there.
Maybe in the house, this man.
I guess he must be going to the house too.
Well... no, I don't think so.
Geez, Ran, come on, I'm really late!
Sorry, Sonoko...
Even though I invited you, you're late!
Wow, and I see you ended up taking her with you in the end.
Conan, you should leave him alone.
(Think) "As if she wasn't heavy!"
How do you want to flirt, with this glued to the skirts?
Flirt?
Sure, we came here to meet handsome guys, it's our turn!
In this wonderful environment that nature offers us,
we'll have the romance we've always dreamed of.
(Think) "That's all this girl thinks about."
Sonoko, aren't they here yet, these "handsome boys" you were saying?
Yes.
My sister's friends have arrived a while ago.
They're upstairs in their rooms.
Are any of your sister's friends wearing bandages on their faces?
Blindfolded?
Of course they're not.
No one's been hurt in this house.
But we've seen... Ten living around here.
Stop saying strange things and go and leave the bags!
You have a room upstairs.
Wait a minute, you said upstairs, but look how many rooms!
Wow, what a lot of rooms!
Which one should it be, ours?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Sorry, we made a mistake.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Finally!
This is it, Conan!
(Adult voice) Why don't you knock on the doors before you open them?
So you were all from the same group.
Yes.
They were from the film workshop when they went to college.
The 5 who were closest friends met when they were 2 years old.
He is in Masaru, who always played the main character.
Hello!
Next to him, Hiroki, the cameraman!
Hello!
He is the decorator, in Ryuichi.
Nice to meet you.
Excuse me for entering your rooms.
Don't suffer.
What happened?
What happened? I made a mistake.
Mm... the one next door is my sister,
she was in charge of makeup and wardrobe.
and now she's looking for a boyfriend!
Hello, Ran!
Finally, the director, screenwriter and soul of the group, Chikako Ikeda!
Nice to meet you.
The screenwriter of "The Blue Kingdom," the movie they're making now?
That's right.
You wrote it when you were still in college, right?
Come on, let's not talk about the past!
I hear you'll be making your next film soon.
Come on, a word for your fans!
Hiroki, come on will you stop?
Hiroki is as obsessed as ever with the camera.
Yes, it's true, I can't help it.
By the way, Ryuichi, you got fat again, didn't you?
-Well... I weigh almost 100 kilos.
-I don't even have a head in the frame anymore.
What are you saying now?
Being with you brings back memories of college...
and of Atsuko.
If that hadn't happened to him, the Atsuko would be here.
The Atsuko?
Shut up?
Don't talk about Atsuko!
Chikako...
I came here to be together and to relax.
Don't talk to me about someone who's been dead for two years!
I'm sorry...
Your fame has gone to your head.
-Why do you say that?
-Come on, don't fight.
Dinner will be ready in no time.
Relax.
I'll take advantage of it to finish fixing the roof.
They say it's going to rain tonight.
Ah, yes.
I'm sorry, Ryuichi.
Please keep an eye out.
Don't worry.
These jobs can only be done by a handyman like him.
Shall we play cards, the others?
Yes, good idea!
Hey, hey, Chikako, where are you going?
I'm going for a walk.
Wait a minute, Chikako.

Haven't you heard?
Ryuichi said it would rain!
Hey, Chikako!
Oh, look, Conan, it's already starting to rain.
With this weather, we won't enjoy the autumn scenery.
Hey, hey, Ran... Eh?
Wouldn't it be a good match, this one?
He's so fashionable and so handsome... he's my ideal man!
Is he really?
Oh, right, I get it!
You have Shinichi, right?
Too bad you couldn't come with him!
I get it, Shinichi!
If I were here, I'd start it up!
(thinks) "But I'm here."
Hey, do you want to come for a walk with me?
I'd love to!
You came alone, didn't you?
But, but if it's raining, outside....
It's all right, walking in the rain.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
(Think) "What a conceited!"
(It's unforgivable!
This Ran!
To behave like that when he's got Shinichi....
(Thinks) "He's right!"
I'll take you Shinichi! (Thinks) "Not that!"
Do you have a boyfriend, Ran?
Well, I do...
But you don't even know when you'll see him, do you?
It's about time you moved on from him and found yourself another boyfriend.
What do you say, Ran?
Want me to show you what adult love is?
Aaa... Wait, wait, wait.
Aaaaah!
Lightning! Hey, come back!
You fool.
What a fright!
It has fallen very close, this lightning.
(Thinking) "Wow! Ran has disappeared!"
Conan!
Wait, wait, wait!
No...
How strong... I think I'm lost in the end.
Masaru, where are you?
If you feel me, please answer me!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Think) "Who is this man?"
Why did you call?
He's running away!
Who, who was it, this man?
(Ayako) A blindfolded man?
(Ayako) Yes, yes!
He attacked Ran in the forest a while ago!
-Are you serious? -He didn't see her, did you?
-You were the forest too, weren't you?
-I didn't see anyone.
And I went out after her.
Neither did we, right, Chikako?
Us?
You disappeared all of a sudden!
I came to get an umbrella.
You didn't leave because you're afraid of lightning?
-Chikako!
-What's the matter with you?
Come on, calm down, please...
This pair are like cat and dog.
Ayako, listen, you haven't seen the man either?
He ran away in the direction of the house.
Well, no, I haven't seen him.
Ryuichi, what about you?
I haven't moved from the roof, but I haven't seen this man.
No... but wait a minute.
I saw a strange person on the bridge when I got to the house.
I didn't see his face, but he had a mysterious look,
and he was wearing a black cloak.
The man on the bridge is the one who attacked me.
Oi, Conan?
I saw him too when I got to the house.
I saw him too.
But I thought he lived around here.
It can't be, this.
On the other side of the bridge, there are 3 more houses,
but on this side, there's only this one.
-Who could it be, that guy? -Well, who could it be? -We'll explain it to the police!
You're right, you're right.
What?!
The phone doesn't work?!
No, it was working fine this afternoon...
Maybe the line was cut because of that lightning.
It's... it's him!
That mummy cut the line!
It's him!
Hey, Ryuichi!
Wait for me!
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
Ha, the bridge is down!
What's the matter?
-The bridge is down.
-What?
It would be very old and has not endured.
It didn't fall alone!
Someone cut the ropes of the bridge.
Look at this pillar.
See this pillar, where the rope was tied?
What is it?
It is full of cuts.
Someone has cut the ropes of the bridge.
Who, who could have done it?
It's that man, you see?
Do you want to stop this story?!
Enough of this nonsense!
That if he has attacked a girl in the forest, that if he has cut the line,
that he made the bridge fall down...!
If I tell scary stories, some misfortune will happen!
Chikako...
It is already dark.
We'll have to wait until tomorrow morning and then we'll leave.
Hey, Ayako, this bandage man,
he's still out here in the forest, isn't he?
-Yes. Huh?
What's the matter?
No, nothing, I'm going to bed, I'm tired, I don't want to have dinner.
Chikako...
Hey, Ran, I'm sorry to make you work.
Don't worry, I'm used to it.

My God, it went badly, the meeting.
Everyone is on edge.
You shouldn't have talked about that story.
Sonoko, you mean the Atsuko?
What happened two years ago.
Conan, do me a favor.
The Atsuko, two years ago...
committed suicide.
She also belonged to the film workshop.
"And one fine day, she hung herself in her room."
"We stopped meeting, and we were all good friends."
And now I've decided to come back and see you here.
But I'd rather you didn't ask me any questions about it.
Gee, girls, I'm hungry.
-Where is she, Chikako? -She's gone to sleep.
Ryuichi!
Dinner's ready!
Ah, yes.
Just a moment.
And the roof?
Is it done?
Yes, almost.
Very good!
Come on girls, smile!
Ryuichi, come down, dinner will get cold!
Ah, I'll be right back.
-Who-who's here? -Who's here? -What's the matter with you?
There's someone at the window!
What's that?
At the window?
Chikako!
We don't know where they have gone, with this darkness!
Conan!
Come on, quick, we'll follow the child!
Stay here and close the door!
Ryuichi, hurry!
-Me too?
-Of course you do!
Hey!
Wait for me, guys!
One leg!
And if it was, from the Chikako?
Aaaah!
Here's an arm.
What a mess!
Let's separate selected and look for it!
Let's go!
Chikako!
Chikako!
Chikako!
Where are you?!
Chikako...
Chikako, what happened to you?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What?!
The Chikako?
Yes... she was killed.
She was already dead when we found her.
It can't be.
The corpse is the forest, I covered it with the jacket.
What a disgrace, poor Chikako.
It's my fault, for having planned this encounter...
It's my fault...
Don't talk nonsense, it's not your fault.
It's the fault of that blindfolded man.
He has taken the Chikako!
That diabolical assasssi!
What shall we do?
What if he comes back to attack us?
Nothing will happen to us, if we close everything well.
The Chikako has committed the imprudence of going out at this hour.
Anyway!
Let's let it go and let's go to sleep.
Masaru, how you are!
He's right, we can't do anything.
We'll check all the locks again before going to sleep.
Tomorrow morning we'll explain it to the police.
All right, we'll explain it to the police tomorrow morning.
The front door is locked.
Only the rooms are missing.
What is it, Conan?
They're not here, Chikako's slippers.
The slippers?
If the Chikako had gone out through the entrance,
her slippers would be over here.
Maybe she didn't go out this way.
What's the meaning of this?
What is the meaning of this?
That the man came in and took Chikako, who was sleeping.
Sonoko, it can't be, that.
After Conan and the others went after that man,
you, Ayako and I checked the windows.
In the Chikako's room everything was in order,
and the window was locked from the inside.
But...
Chikako went out of the forest alone.
What is obvious is that Chikako had her shoes on.
It's true!
Is there any other door in this house?
Ah, yes, the door behind.
The back door?
It's this, the back door.
Is that so?
Wow... they're here.
Your slippers!
They're Chikako's.
We only brought one pair of slippers for each person.
Chikako went out that door.
Surely.
(Thinking) "But why did she come through here and not the entrance?"
"It's as if she wanted to sneak out."
Look, it's muddy.
Has anyone else come out this way?
Probably my sister, because the gas tap is outside.
We've already found the slippers, let's go to sleep.
Now we are safe, in our room.
Conan?
You don't need to suffer, don't worry!
If that mummy attacked us, I'd give him a good karate chop.
Yes, thank you.
(thinks) "Yeah, but when she attacked him in the forest, she was petrified."
Hey, why did he attack you, that man?
I guess these crazy people have no preference.
Listen Ran... Is there anyone who has a grudge against you?
Someone who's been hit with one of your karate keys?
Of course not!
You're out of line!
Come on, go to sleep! Yes.

(Thinking) "I'm not at peace."
"That murderer..."
"If he took the Chikako out the back door,
why did he turn around and come to the front?"
"Because we saw him and to make us afraid?"
Listen...
Can I sleep with you?
What?
What's the reason?
Ah, it's the same... it's the same.
You're afraid, maybe?
No, easy, easy.
Apa, good night, Conan.
(Thinking) "My God, these women..."
"What was I thinking?"
"If my memory serves me correctly, that guy..."
"That guy..."
"I was going... so..."
"What a stick, I can't think!"
"Anyway, he's an unknown killer and the police must solve it."
"So...... calm down."

(Thinks) "What if I wanted to kill Ran?"
Ran!
Wake up!
Ran!
Ran!
Shit!
(thinks) "I've sprained my ankle!"
"Ran's in a very deep sleep. What could I do?"
"I've got it! The voice transformer!"
"With the volume at maximum she'll wake up."
Awakenaaaaaaa't!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ran!
Conan!
What's wrong with him?
Come on!
Open the door!
Conan!
Ran!
Murderer!
What's wrong with you?
(Thinks) "Why? Why is he going after the Ran?"
(Thinks) "He's going after the Ran! But why the Ran?"
Something's dancing in my head.
It's an effort!
(Sonoko voice) Now I can tell you.
I know who it is, what Chikako has killed!
In the next episode...
The mysterious man in the case
of the mountain house murder (II)
