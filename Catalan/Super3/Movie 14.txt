(Door, open)
(Alarm)
(Man) Today, when it was a few minutes to 10 o'clock,
a group of 7 armed men
attacked the Tokyo National Microbiology Center,
in the Nishitama district.
They captured two security guards,
took a researcher hostage
and headed for the high-security laboratory.
After a moment,
they detonated the plastic explosive they had prepared and fled.
-Hey.
Just one question.
-Commissioner, Commissioner.
In the laboratory where the explosion took place,
it is seen that they kept some very, very dangerous bacteria
and it seems that the criminals have managed to take them.
-Dangerous bacteria?
-How?
According to what we have been told, if you get infected with these bacteria,
there's an 80% chance you'll die,
and no antidote has been found yet.
Could it be that, with the explosion, the bacteria have spread?
This has been ruled out.
According to the director of the center,
since the explosion was of such a large magnitude,
even if there had been some left,
they would have turned to ashes immediately.
-Is it known what was the target of the group?
- (murmurs)
Not yet.
But we do not rule out the possibility of some bioterrorist action.
(murmurs)
(Odagiri) That's why we want to ask you a favor.
So as not to panic unnecessarily,
we would be grateful if you would limit yourselves to report the explosion...
and that you do not comment on the bacteria
or the possibility that it is an act of bioterrorism.
(Murmurs)
(Man) Are you censoring the press?
- (murmurs)
- (mobiles)
- (Man) And now what are we going to do?
- (mobiles)
-Commissioner.
(man) - Eh?
The assailant group
just issued a statement online claiming responsibility for the attack.
-The Red Siamese Cats.
-They present themselves as a group called... -We...
"We, the Red Siamese Cats,
"have attacked the National Microbiology Center in Tokyo...
and have stolen some deadly bacteria.
Over the next week we will carry out a series of actions.
You can get ready now.
(Murmurs)
So they have managed to steal the bacteria?
But the Red Siamese Cats disappeared more than 10 years ago.
Commissioner.
They won't censor us and we'll be able to report, won't we?
-Let's go.
-It's inevitable.
(TV: woman) "Today we are joined on the set by Mrs. Chiaki Ota,
professor of bacteriology."
"People who get infected with these bacteria will get rashes and itching.
will get rashes and itching."
Did you see that?
You can see that the thing is very serious.
They've been repeating the same news since morning.
(Shinichi voice) "Yeah."
"Unfortunately, the most common form of contagion is through the air."
"Young children are especially vulnerable and get infected quickly."
What now?
You feel it, don't you?
And you just turned into a small child.
Let me be.
More than that, what worries me is...
Why the terrorist group blew up the lab, right?
"Exactly."
"If the goal was to steal the bacteria,
they didn't need to blow it up."
That's true.
By the way, one thing:
you know them, these Red Siamese Cats, do you know who they are?
No, but I remember about 10 years ago or so....
they were attacking big companies and doing terrorist actions.
"Oops, we were both still kids then."
Oops!
Sorry, sorry.
I didn't think you still are now.
Ha-ha!
By the way, Kudo.
What an ass you are!
Now it's come to my mind: you told me...
you'd go up in a blimp, right?
Yes, the one that will fly from Tokyo to Osaka,
because that man has once again sent
a letter of challenge to the Kaito Kid.
And it seems to me that he has also sent you a reply of acceptance.
(He thinks) "He must be climbing the walls."
How dare these Red Siamese Cats!
How dare they steal my front page headlines
now that I was introducing the best blimp in the world
and that I was the protagonist of the project!
Because of them, the letter of defiance ?
I sent to my archenemy, the Kaito Kid!
has also been put on the back burner!
Eh?
"Hey, Kudo."
You could sleep at my place, when you come.

I'll take you to the okonomiyaki restaurant I promised you, remember?
Yes.
All right, well... I'll see you later.

THE LOST SHIP IN THE SKY
DETECTIVE CONAN.
THE LOST SHIP IN THE SKY
"I am Detective Shinichi Kudo."
"One day, I went to the amusement park with Ran Mouri,
"my best friend and classmate,
"And I witnessed a suspicious exchange
between two men dressed in black."
"I was so focused on watching those two men,
that I didn't realize there was another one behind me."
"He made me swallow a poison and, when I woke up.........,
(Conan voice)... my body had shrunk."
"If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
they would want to kill me and the lives of those around me would be in danger."
"That's why Dr. Agasa
recommended that I hide my identity."
"When the Ran asked me what my name was,
I randomly told him I called myself Conan Edogawa."
"Since Ran's father is a detective,
"I decided to live with them
to get information about the Men in Black."
One-two-three-four, one-two-three-four.
"Jirokichi Suzuki, 72 years old."
(Child) Excuse me.
Thank you very much.
"He's the uncle of Sonoko, Ran's best friend."
"And he's also the advisor to the Suzuki Financial Group."
"He has received all the awards he wanted
and made all his dreams come true."
"Or so this proud old man always says."
"And now he devotes himself body and soul to his fight against the Kaito Kid."
But what I'm really worried about are those men,
"The terrorists who attacked the laboratory
and fled with the bacteria."
"What target must they have?"
Soc small, but I have the brain of an adult.
A detective who solves all mysteries.
The truth... you always end up knowing!
-It's Tropical Land.
-Oops!
Everything looks like a toy.
-And the castle looks small.
Oh, wow, it's amazing!
Wow, it's amazing!
Look how beautiful it looks, father.
Come on, come and see it.
Shut up!
I'm concentrating on thinking!
Ouch.
Come to think of it, Mr. Mouri is afraid of heights, right?
That's not true!
Hey, I bet he always has a view like this at the Kaito Kid.
Yeah, I'm jealous, huh?
But is it safe?
Will he really come to the Kaito Kid?
Of course he will.
Because Uncle Jirokichi has received a letter of reply from you.
Look at it.
"Thank you very much... How do you do... years..."
Eh?
Mm...
But what are you doing?
Just reading the words you know, don't you?
Wow.
"Thank you for inviting me to your blimp, I gladly accept.
Now, considering you're already 72 years old,
I'm sorry to put you through 6 hours of nerves.
Therefore, I will come to the....
(Kaito)... at sunset,
when the blimp passes over Osaka City."
(Sonoko) Until then, I wish you a good flight.
Kaito Kid.
Ah...!
I wish he'd come looking for me, too, in Kaito Kid.
Actually, I've been thinking about it for a long time.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
She's something special, this girl.
By the way, we are the only passengers on this flight, we?
Are we?
No, there's also a reporter named Takamichi Fujioka.
Ah, that's him.
He's going to do a report
about the confrontation between Kaito and Uncle Jirokichi.
That's why he asked us if he could come.
- (Sonoko) The others are...
- (man) Ah, excuse me...
-The others are... 29.
You are Mr. Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?
Hello, how are you?
My name is Masaki Mizukawa, I'm the director of Nichiuri TV.
Ah.
I'd like you to meet reporter Kasumi Nishitani
and cameraman Junpei Ishimoto.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Mouri.
You too.
We've been given the exclusive opportunity to broadcast live
the confrontation between Mr. Suzuki and the Kaito Kid.
Ah, you will broadcast a special program in the evening?
Yes, we wanted to devote all our resources to broadcasting the program,
just like we did when we broadcast that aerial walk,
but now is a bad time.
Why?
Ah, the Red Siamese Cats.
Yes.
From the moment they announced
that after 7 days they would take action,
the network has been on the lookout for any emergency.
"Because, if they go according to plan, today is the deadline."

Because of him, I have not been granted permission to fly the helicopter...
to film my autobiography.
I can't stand them, these half-witted cats.
Oi, Lupin?
-Hello, Mr. Suzuki.
-Welcome, Uncle.
I can't wait for today's event.
I've already seen it and I must confess it's a magnificent airship.
You wish to broadcast the flight of this wonderful blimp
and you are only a team of 3 people?
Ah, it's just that... because of that incident you know,
the network's hands are tied.
That's pretty tough, huh?
And what do they want to do, these terrorists,
with all these bacteria they've stolen?
Who gets infected has little chance of survival.
They say that you get infected if they spread them in the air or spray you.
-They say them spraying people?
-Oh, how scary!
We do not know, that, man.
The point is that they are very contagious.
And we children are especially vulnerable, you have to watch out.
What?
Calm down.
I don't know if it's a killer bacteria or what,
but I've traveled to some places
that were completely infested with all kinds of germs,
and look, I'm fresh as a daisy.
We humans are so much stronger than bacteria.
That's true.
But of course, kids like you, you usually drop like flies.
But what are you doing?
Don't say these things, it scares the children.
And so much.
You're so insensitive.
-Calm down.
-Don't worry, nothing will happen.
We don't have to worry about anything where they spread the bacteria.
As long as we're in the blimp, nothing at all will happen to us.
Don't worry.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"He-he-he-he... That is if we don't stop flying anymore, of course."
Hey, don't we have to get ready to serve tea?
Yes, but let me make a cigarette first.
I'll be right back.
"So we don't know who the terrorists are..."
No.
And the leaders of the Red Siamese Cats, who are serving time,
say they don't know what's going on.
So far, the only clue we have obtained is this vial,
but it's not made by any manufacturer in Japan or abroad.
It was probably made by the Red Siamese Cats themselves.
Since the vial was found in
the parking lot of the microbiology center, this means that...
This means that there is a good chance
that the terrorists were carrying empty vials when they raided the center.
Therefore, they put the bacteria that were stored in the lab...
into the vials they were carrying and took them.
And we figured that one must have been dropped on them unintentionally,
which is this one that we found.
And introducing the bacteria into another container
is considered very difficult and dangerous.
Apparently, these terrorists have a lot of scientific knowledge.
And why... didn't they take them as they were, the bacteria?
instead of doing that very dangerous thing?
And to begin with,
why have they suddenly reappeared like ghosts after 10 years?
What the fuck do they want now?
Hey, there are windows here too.
(They laugh)
I see they're having a great time, these kids.
How lucky they are, to be able to go up in a blimp at such a young age.
They must be grateful to the Sonoko.
And it's a great experience for them,
it's like flying in a huge cloud floating in the sky.
Mmm...
Mm?
(Shinichi voice) Ah, nothing.
It's just that I remembered things from when I was little.
When the Ran saw a blimp flying through the sky for the first time.
Shinichi!
Oops, oops!
I saw a UFO.
I just saw a UFO!
Mm-hm.
Yeah, look, look.
A UFO?
"She saw a monstrous balloon flying across the sky,
she must have stood still and thought these things, but..."
Are you starting to talk about your little princess?
I-I don't know what t'empatolles, now.
Whenever you talk about her you drool.
I'd like to fly in a magic ship through the sky too
and go to a dream world above the clouds.
I knew that.
Just kidding.
Attention everyone.
Uncle Jirokichi says he will show us the panoramic viewpoint.
And from there you will see the great jewel.
How nice!
How nice!
A treasure, a treasure!
-Yes!
-What?
Do you want to see the treasure?
-Yes!
-Well, come on, let's go.
(Conan voice) Yes.
Conan, do you want to come too?
Anyway, I'm just saying that you should keep a close eye on her...

because some Peter Pan doesn't come along, take it from you and...
take her away to a fantasy world.
(Shinichi voice) What are you saying?
Hey, the UFO story from before, don't tell Ran.
Be quiet.
- (children) Yes!
-Aviam, are we all here?
Alright, I call myself Mitsuhiro,
I'm the chief steward of this airship.
and now I will accompany you to the lookout.
Wow.
It's all glass!
So we can see the inside of the blimp.
Let's go.
And don't anybody get scared.
Mm-hm!
How exciting!
-Ooh!
-(Mitsuhiro) Oysters!
(Mitsuhiro) The Bell Tree 1 airship is 246 meters long
and a maximum diameter of 42.2 meters.
Both in length and diameter,
this airship is one meter longer than the famous Hindenburg.
-Yes, of course, it's very interesting.
-What?
Do you like the visit, Kasumi?
Casum.
Why should there be so much glass?
It is the first airship in Japan that has accommodations
and has a computerized control system
in the cockpit.
Oh.
Wow.
But there are like giant balloons up here!
(Mitsuhiro) These balloons are air sacs filled with helium gas.
(Mitsuhiko) They're like the lungs of whales.
(Ayumi) It's as if the blimp is alive.
(Agasa) Yes, it looks very nice that we are inside the belly of a whale.
(Ayumi) Ah!
AAAAAAAAA!
Wow, so much light!
(Mitsuhiko) But you can see the sky!
Wow!
It's the jewel!
How cool!
This place is Mr. Suzuki's pride and joy.
The panoramic viewpoint.
Part of the roof can be opened and closed.
It's good for sunbathing or stargazing.
It is a place that has many possibilities.
But today I've prepared a special little something
that will allow us to catch that criminal once and for all.
-That's not something for children.
-I want to see the jewel.
-What's the problem?
-What's the problem?
-Oysters.
Quiet!
What?
Hey, you!
-Inspector Nakamori.
-Just a moment.
-Come, I'll show you.
-Huh? -Mr. Mouri, you too...
Mr. Mouri, you too...?
Hey.
Just a moment.
It's the lapis lazuli that we'll use to lure the thief here.
It's the great jewel.
It's the Lady of Heaven.
What a beautiful blue!
It's incredible.
It's beautiful.
(Mitsuhiko) The golden particles are shining.
(Ayumi) They're like stars.
And of all the golden particles,
don't you find that the biggest one looks like something?
(Mitsuhiko) The biggest particle?
(Ayumi) Eh, it looks like a woman's face!
(Mitsuhiko) That's right.
And it is precisely for this reason that it is called the Lady of Heaven.
A naturalist of ancient Rome who called himself Pliny said that this jewel was "a stone of the sky.
that this jewel was "a piece of heaven that shines like the stars".
Undoubtedly,
it is a jewel worthy of being exhibited in this viewpoint.
What is difficult to understand is how such a valuable jewel can be exhibited by protecting it
by protecting it with such a simple display case.
Oh, inspector, you leave me speechless,
because I see you don't know what armored glass is...
bulletproof glass.
And, besides, there is only one way to open it,
and that's by combining my fingerprint with a password.
What?
Is that an effective system or not?
All this you're telling me is useless, believe me.
In the microbiology center where the bacteria were stolen...
-If it does, we'll know. -If it does, we'll know.
-What happens if you press this here? -What happens if you press this here?
- (alarm)
-It's just a matter of testing it.
(alarm) -Oh!
But...
- (alarm)
(alarm)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Father!
This system that I was talking about also did this?
No, of course not.
What did you think?
Let him get ready, this little boy!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Wow, father...
"Of course..., there is a sensor."
"And there are those who fall into all the traps."
It is true that all these artifacts were not there,
but what if it turns out that the thief does this?
If he points a gun at her like this,
he will have no choice but to open the case, right?
Man, I don't think he will do it, something like that, but if he does... then....
What?
Aaaaaaaaaah!
-Ostras.
Inspector.
-Oh!
But what happened?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
If that were the case, I would do that.
It can't have happened.
Don't tell me it fell into the sea.
No, woman, no.
Gee, boy, what a trap!
Although you think that the showcase is not safe?
"I think it was 4, 7..."
"Yes, that's right. That's it."

Besides, he won't show up until sunset.
There is no need to stand guard here until then.
Let's rethink the strategy.
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
-Let's go.
Gee, I think it's very interesting, that.
Thanks to you, I'll be able to write a good report.
Excuse me, sir.
If you want to smoke, you'll have to go to the smoking room on B Deck.
-No, I'm going to rest in the room.
-Mr. Mouri, will you come with me?
I'm a little dazed.
"I'm not surprised at all."
Oh.
What a rest!
Your father is a disaster, when he wants to be.
By the way, have you seen the band-aids, or what?
Have you?
The band-aids, the band-aids.
You haven't seen them yet?
Don't tell me you've done something to the band-aids.
But what's this?
Ha-ha... Do you like it?
What's wrong with you?
I really don't understand you.
Come to think of it..,
when we were going up the blimp I gave one to a guy.
Wow!
Come on, hurry up!
-Stop.
-Ouch!
-Thank you.
-Take it easy, pretty girl, it's dangerous.
You're welcome.
Thank you very much.
You've got blood.
At the elbow.
Oh... I must have gotten a scratch.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Here, put this on.
Thank you very much, thank you very much.
What will I do, now, if that boy thinks I wrote it?
He won't see it, woman.
The handwriting's too small.
Oh...
Oh, sir.
What?
I'm going to see the jewel, okay?
I couldn't see it properly before, because there were too many people.
Well, I'm going to the room.
I have to send an email to Makoto.
But I won't tell him about the Kaito Kid.
I'll see you later.
Yes.
What's that?
Who's this?
Hello.
Hello.
From this...
Soc... I'm a waiter at the blimp.
I snuck out of work for a little while to see the famous jewel.
Gee, I've got to get back to work.
Ah, thank you.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Have a good one.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What? What?
What's the matter?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Ah, it's just that I got burned a moment ago.
This band-aid...
No, and now!
What's the matter?
You're kidding, right?
Please take a good look at the band-aid you're wearing.
Wow!
How is it possible that you are wearing
the band-aid I gave to someone else?
Ah!
You're on the Kaito Kid!
"He's found me out."
Come on, sing!
"What do I do now? There's no point in continuing to insist that I'm a waiter."
"But escaping me using force I don't think either..."
Iah!
Iaaaaaah!
Iaaaah!
He-he-he-he-he...
What's so funny?!
Confess, come on.
Eh?
And what are you going to do if I confess?
I suppose you'll want to turn me in to Inspector Nakamori, won't you?
Man, that's not a bad idea.
But if you do, you'll be the one in trouble.
Eh?
I guess you still can't figure out who I am.
Haven't you?
Because... it turns out that, in reality, the Kaito Kid is me.
(Mitsuhiko) Hey!
Atxim!
Sorry, sorry.
Take it all apart, man.
Are you okay, Conan?
Have you cooled down again?
(Shinichi voice) What's wrong?
It's been so long since we've seen each other that you don't remember what face I make anymore?
The Kaito Kid is actually Shinichi?
Yeah, man!
I'm sure it's another one of your famous disguises.
Of course it isn't.
I'm not wearing anything.
It's not a costume?
No.
Now I remember that time when the plane crashed
and the inspector pulled your cheek and you weren't wearing a mask either.
But, maybe you look so much alike?
(Nakamori) Wow, you.
Sometimes I'm a mess.
That thief always inspects the place before committing a crime.
Inspector Nakamori!
I have to keep an eye on the jewel... Mm?
You've made a mistake, coming here to the blimp,
because you have no escape.
Give it up, go on.
It's not a blimp, it's a UFO.
Isn't it?
That's what you told me one day when we were little, don't you remember?
Maybe because of you I look like an extraterrestrial
who suddenly appears with a UFO,
but you have to understand that in reality
I'm playing the role of Kaito Kid
because I have no choice, it's the only way to solve a case.
And the proof that I'm telling you the truth
is that afterwards I return the things I steal to the owners.
But... But... But... But what?
Look, listen to me, woman,
there's no way Shinichi Kudo would let such an indiscreet...
such an indiscreet thief,
and that's why I thought you'd understand.

But if you want to rat, go ahead, I give up.
Shi... Nichi?
(Nakamori) What's up?
No..., it's nothing.
What's wrong?
If you've seen anything strange, just say so.
No, I'm serious.
I made a mistake, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
"I don't understand anything. In Shinichi is it in Kaito Kid?"
"And when he said he was busy with the cases he had to solve,
what he was really doing was stealing?"
Hey, can you pass me those glasses, please?
-But... What's wrong with your arm?
-What's wrong?
Ah.
It's nothing.
I must have been bitten by a mosquito, I don't think it's nothing.
But it's strange, that there are mosquitoes here.
There you go.
Thank you, thank you.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Eh?
Hey, listen, uh...
You know what?
I don't believe you.
Anyway, if you'll excuse me...
Time, time!
Gee, sorry.
Mr. Fujioka...
Although I would have expected it from the karate champion of Kanto.
You've got some nice muscles.
(Boy) Hey, look.
A blimp!
-Looks like a whale.
(Boy) - Oysters.
A whale flying through the sky.
(Woman) Sorry to keep you waiting.
(Woman) Ah.
(Woman) Great!
Please, another one!
-I think it's revived in a hurry. -I think it's revived in a hurry.
-Hey, please, I'd like another one.
"Sure, as always."
I'm here.
The cake for dessert.
(Sonoko) Thank you.
(Sonoko) Oysters.
It was worth the wait.
Can't you see?
This cake looks delicious.
(Sonoko) Uh!
What do you say?
Doesn't it, Ran?
Hey, Ran.
Ran, you're over the moon.
I didn't know, that you liked this kind of guy.
What are you staring at, so focused?
No, woman, it's not that.
Maybe I should explain it to your boyfriend.
I'm telling you it's not that!
(Mitsuhiko) I've already told you.
If you work this door, you come out right in the middle of the hallway.
-We can go there, can't we?
-And if you go out this way...
Of course we can.
-Ah, no, and now!
-Kids.
Going somewhere?
We're not going anywhere.
We were just saying we'd go play cards in the room for a while.
"They're up to something again."
(Sonoko) Ah, I can't wait.
I can't wait to get to Osaka to see the Kaito Kid,
and if I could, if I could,
"I'd like to bring my delicate lips
on his adventurous lips and..."
No, no, no!
No way!
Eh?
Eh? (Laughs)
Eh?
Ah...
The Kaito Kid is a delinquent.
You're not even close.
No, I'm not.
Why are you so nervous?
I'm not.
What's that?
You were saying?
-Okay! -Okay!
-Come on, boys, hurry up and eat. -Okay.
Inspector Nakamori, eat quietly and without haste,
my men are already guarding the jewel.
No, the Kaito Kid must already be doing his thing.
(Children) We've finished!
Come on, boys, we can go back to the room to play cards.
-What's wrong with them?
-See you later.
(Kids) Thank you.
-Oh.
Oh, excuse me.
-Oh, ouch! -Oh!
You need to watch out a bit, girl.
Didn't your mother teach you to cover your mouth with your hands like that,
when you feel like sneezing?
-Come on. -Come on.
Come on, let's go.
-I'm sorry.
(Mobile)
(Mobile)
Who is it?
Yes, tell me?
(Man) "I've spread the deadly bacteria
in the smoking room of the blimp."
What what?
May I know what the hell s'empatolla?
"Take a look under the couch, to the left."
Hey, wait s.
Who was that, man?
What's the matter, man?
Nothing, nothing's wrong.
Just a joker who wanted to make a joke.
Inspector...
Oh, mother...
There's no doubt about it.
It's the same type of vial
that was lost by those who raided the microbiology center.
And we hadn't made any images public.
(Nakamori) "And that means..."
That everything the man on the phone said must be true.
That vial we found in the parking lot,
surely it was left expressly for him
because now we can verify
that the one they left here is authentic.
Wow!
"I will inform my superiors immediately.
Thank you very much.
Everything indicates that the man who called was telling the truth.
But how can that be?
Now, catching the Kaito Kid is not the most urgent problem.
Seal the smoking room.
And, for added security, we should also close the bar.
(Men) Yes, sir!
(Ran and Sonoko) What!?
You mean?

Are you sure?
It can't be.
-No, unfortunately, no.
-Maybe it's a joke.
The first thing I did was to confirm it with the head office.
Oh, my goodness.
In any case, as I said,
seal the smoking room on B deck.
- (man: groan)
- (door, open)
(continues moaning in pain)
A... help me.
But what's wrong with him?
Has he been infected... with the bacteria?
Maybe yes, a while ago he went to the smoking room.
I feel sick.
Help me.
Please help me.
I don't want to die.
Calm down, he calmed down.
I don't want to die.
I... I feel.
It's okay.
And now, you have to disinfect your hands right away, Ran.
Come on, now.
We have alcohol sanitizer in the utility room.
All right, we've got infected people in blimp.
We've got infected people in blimp.
What a mess!
Has anyone else gone to the smoking room?
(woman: shrieks)
Hey.
Are you all right?
(Woman: Oh!)
He's got a rash on his hand and left arm.
Oops!
Another case.
Do you know where we can quarantine them?
Behind the office is a hospital ward.
There's no doctor on board today,
but we can prevent the bacteria from spreading.
-I'll go with you.
-All right, we'll take you there. -Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
-Let's go.
And, for safety's sake, we should also close this dining room.
Well, everybody head for the cafeteria right now.
Can you feel me, father?
Wake up, come on.
It's a good thing there weren't any children here right now.
Yes, it is.
But, even so, I think we have to explain everything to them.
Yes, of course.
"In Genta!"
- (Genta) Yes, so much.
- (Ayumi) We had a good time, huh?
Now what we can do is to go to the whale's tail.
He-he-he-he!
-(Ayumi) What?
-Hey, Genta.
Whales don't have tails.
They have flukes.
Genta!
Wow.
Conan.
Sorry, we didn't know, that you couldn't come here.
Genta.
Are you all right?
"No rash."
"Maybe he hasn't been infected or is still in the incubation period."
Conan...
-Come on.
-What's the matter? -What's the matter?
Why don't we all go explore the blimp together?
Now is not the time, guys.
Something very serious has happened.
For now, we're going back to the cockpit.
Oh, yeah?
What's happened?
-Yeah, okay...
-Yes.
(Flow) get down.
Stand still here.
"Who is it? And what's he doing here?"
"He left it open."
"What if it's...
the person spreading the bacteria?"
-The Kaito Kid's accomplice?
-Who's that?
Oh, my lord.
I don't think so.
I don't think he has in Kaito Kid.
I'm sure it's the Red Siamese Cats.
It can't be!
This is serious.
(Helicopter: approaching)
Wow!
"But... it's a bomb!"
(Helicopter: "But... it's a bomb!")
Go over there.
Climb up the ladder on the side of the gas pipe.
Come on, hurry up.
(Inaudible)
Hold it!
(Jirokichi) Just a moment.
Who are you?
Have you found the vial, or what?
-The Red Siamese Cats.
(Jirokichi) -Huh?
We've planted some bombs on the blimp.
If you do exactly as we tell you, we won't blow them up.
Shut up, Lupin?
That's enough.
Now I don't want to hear anybody.
-F Cats, we've taken over the cockpit.
Everything under control?
Cat D, we've occupied the galley.
Cat C, we have occupied the veranda.
-All right.
-To the cabins there is no one.
I want the crew to assemble in the mess hall over the public address system.
What now?
What shall we do now?
(PA: Jirokichi) "Attention, attention."
"Notice to all crew."
"It is important that everyone proceed immediately to the mess hall."
We are the Red Siamese Cats and we have hijacked this airship.
Everyone turn in your cell phones right now.
Father, wake up.
I don't have a cell phone.
(intercom)
They've hijacked the blimp.
(intercom) It's me.
"I thought so. And what do they demand?"
What do they want?
Money?
Or do they want us to let the members of their prison group go?
We have unfinished business with the Suzuki Financial Group.
And specifically with this old man here.
That's right, about 10 years ago I helped the police...
to destroy their organization.
You can keep me as a hostage, but let the others go.
No way, no way.
Why not? Why not?

The blimp will go to Osaka as planned.
You can call the police,
but..., if they make any strange moves, we will blow up the blimp.
You can tell them now.
And here it is... the famous deadly bacteria.
Don't even think of trying to stop us.
Because, if you do, not only will you have the bacteria in the smoking room,
but you'll have it spread everywhere.
(Mitsuhiko) Conan, now what are we going to do?
We must save the Ai and the others.
But first I have to defuse the bombs.
Oh, watch out,
because maybe some of the hostages are accomplices of the terrorists.
"Receiving."
Be careful.
I hope he didn't get into the smoking room.
Has he gone in?
He did?
Yes, but...
"...I just peeked in, it was just for a moment."
"It smelled so much like cigarettes that I closed the door right away."
"Wow! They sneezed all over him and he came into the smoking room!"
Don't suffer, we haven't completely finished coming in.
And we don't have any rash.
This lightning.
But what about the bombs?
Yes.
In fact, in total there are 4.
Of these four, two are back down the hallway.
Probably near the fuel tank.
Guys...
Do you think you could find them, these?
Of course you could.
But, above all, don't even think about touching them when I locate them.
Understood.
Notify me right away, okay?
And if it starts to look bad, even a little bit, let me know.
Yes.
Okay?
"I think Ayumi and Mitsuhiko are fine. But at Genta..."
"Geez, you! We hope you haven't infected!"
Ei.
Where are the children?
Don't worry, in Conan is with them.
"Just as I thought, there's one behind the smoking room."
"If they blew this one up,
the bacteria would end up spreading all over the blimp."
And, besides, if they blow a hole in the blimp,
they'll also spread to the outside."
"But why are they threatening bombs and bacteria?"
"Why are they threatening two things?"
"Just one was enough to hijack the blimp."
(Odagiri) Why?
How come the terrorists threaten with bacteria and bombs?
Because they want to play it safe.
In any case, they have not yet demanded anything,
the only thing we have to do is to wait and see how everything evolves.
Let them follow the blimp.
But without them noticing.
In the meantime, I will contact the police stations...
of the prefectures they'll be passing through, as well as Osaka.
(Ayumi) Yes, sir.
(Ayumi) Conan, I found a bomb.
(Genta) I found one here, too.
(Ayumi) Ah... There's only one more to go.
Get down.
I'm going to look for the missing one, stay here and wait.
Open it.
Don't do anything strange, if you don't want us to kill any of the hostages.
Mm?
What's wrong, Mr. Mizukawa?
Oh, Mother, don't tell me...
No, it's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
A rash?
No!
It's... it's an allergy I have.
Come to think of it, a moment ago I smelled tobacco.
You went to the smoking room and got infected.
No.
I went, but I didn't get infected.
Besides, I don't have anything anywhere else.
"Now I could neutralize them."
"Now I'll take care of these two."
Take him to the smoking room.
"What if I've been infected too?"
"Look at her."
Now that I look, I don't see any children anywhere.
-Yes.
-The children?
It seems to me that there are 3 about your age.
And I'd say there was a girl too.
Look for them.
I could shut up!
Conan, they found out there's no salary.
They are looking for you.
(Intercom: Ai) "Conan. Conan."
Two men are out looking for you.
You're very clever, aren't you?
Ah!
Oh, did he hurt you?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Look what you're doing hitting a girl.
If he does something weird again, I'll kill you.
Well, that's it.
It was me alone.
Did you do this?
They had nothing to do with it.
Yes.
It takes courage.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Oh!
Conan!
Shinichi!
- (Mitsuhiko) Very good.
- (Genta) Fantastic!
-(Genta) Yes sir!
-The Kaito Kid?
-Despite being an enemy, bravo.
-It's at Kaito Kid, the best!
"Shinichi..."

In the end it has come in Kaito Kid.
We'll solve all the problems at once.
Go put a couple more bombs.
I didn't think about it, I'd throw you out the window.
What now, famous detective?
Do you want to let him run?
(Shinichi voice) Of course not!
Get back to the blimp right now!
Don't talk nonsense.
I don't need to explain that my hang glider doesn't have an engine.
Aaaaaaaa!
You're pretty lucky we're alive.
"They're heading straight west."
Indeed, they are heading for Osaka.
(Male) Right now, the blimp is flying over Tsu,
the capital of Mie Prefecture.
If they continue like this, they will surely reach Osaka here in an hour.
Nankin is the symbol of the Suzuki Financial Group, the Bell Tree Tower.
"And it's where the blimp test flight is headed."
What if the plan they have is to crash the blimp into the tower
and blow it up?
Could it be that they have set up this outcome, the terrorists,
to take revenge on the Suzuki Financial Group?
We must prepare for the worst.
Let's hope we are wrong, but, if so, the bacteria will spread.
And that would be dramatic,
because it would endanger the lives of more than 7 million people.
So we have to prevent it at all costs.
But what can we do?
-Mm?
- (Kazuha) Heiji!
Hey, what took you so long?
-Who is this kid?
(Kazuha) -Sorry, sorry.
(Kazuha) Good morning.
His name is Satoshi Kawaguchi.
He's a relative of mine.
They recently came to live here, they are from Yokohama.
He was at home, we were playing and he told me he wanted to come.
He told me he was really looking forward to meeting in Heiji.
And, of course, you kind of spend a lot of time with Conan,
I thought you liked children.
Yes, a little bit.
-Ya... Thank you.
You too, kid.
-I'm glad to meet you. -I'm glad to meet you.
Not that I want to put myself where I'm not wanted..,
but, uh, you guys hanging out together?
(They talk at the same time)
I don't know where you get that from.
So, if you don't go out together...
that means you don't mind me marrying Kazuha, right?
No, I don't mind.
If you're willing to marry her, I'll gift-wrap it for you and everything.
I agree.
Thank you very much, Mr. Heiji.
"Mister"?
What do you think you are!?
Come on, let him be, he's a child.
Satoshi, I'm very flattered by what you feel for me,
but it's something you have to think about very well.
-Of course.
-You're still too young to get married.
I know that.
People can't get married until they're 18.
That's right.
If by the time you're 18 how you feel about me hasn't changed,
we'll talk about it, okay?
Aw, enough of this, huh?
Oh... I hope it won't be long, this blimp.
Yes, I'm looking forward to the duel with the Kaito Kid.
The stage will be the sky above Osaka.
I'm sure we'll see everything from here.
This is like being in the front row of the ring.
-I'll take a picture of him.
-I like it so much, in Kaito Kid.
I'm so impatient.
(Mobile)
"In Kudo?"
Hello, where are you now?
"What? What are you doing here?"
To Sakushima, in Mikawa Bay.
I've come to stop, I've been dumped.
Look, Heiji, it's just that...
"They threw you out?"
(Heiji) The mother who threw me...!
(Heiji) "Yes."
(Heiji) Are you serious?
"An airship loaded with bombs,
deadly bacteria and hijackers are on their way here."
Wow, it's like a full menu!
"Like okonomiyaki, with pork, squid, octopus and fried noodles."
Three, maybe.
Two people have already been infected.
A man named Masaki
had a rash on the palm of his right hand.
You heard.
"I wanted to tell you all this."
"Yes."
But I guess you're okay?
At least for the moment, yeah.
Look, the police helicopter.
Maybe they're following the blimp.
Yes, the police!
Kudo, wait!
Sorry, I'll call you back.
Wow.
He's on his way, as usual.
I've made up my mind!
I want to go to a place that makes good food.
I'm really hungry.
Didn't you call someone I don't know about the okonomiyaki now?
Have you found out anything about his identity?
We've been tracking down
of the people closest to the former leaders of the organization,

but...
No name has appeared.
We haven't found anything.
(Mobile)
No progress.
"Inspector Megure, this is Kudo."
Hello?
Megure.
Ah, hello, Kudo!
I'm in Sakushima, Aichi Prefecture,
and I saw a helicopter following the blimp.
Yes, I know, they're going to Sato and Takagi.
The situation is serious, because...
"I know that the airship has been hijacked."
"Inspector, I have a favor to ask."
What is it?
I want to get on the helicopter that's following them, Inspector.
Mm?
I, Shinichi Kudo.
And how are you going to do it, to play Shinichi Kudo?
Because it doesn't work.
Come on, that's enough.
You know I want to ask you to dress up as me.
Oh, my lord... Now he wants me to dress up as him again.
Nothing, nothing.
Eh?
I don't mind helping you, but you don't interfere with my work.
I can't promise, but I'll do my best.
Okay.
Cat E, you can get ready now.
Roger that.
What's up?
What are they planning now?
So long.
Wow, Kudo, it's been a long time, huh?
And what a surprise that Conan is also here.
No big deal.
Why is that?
You had a job in Sakushima?
Now we have to catch the blimp.
Come on, we hasten selected.
It's there.
The airship.
Get as close to it as possible and stay at an altitude
that the hijackers can't detect us.
Wind direction and helicopter speed?
East, southeast, and we're at 200 per hour.
Please continue at this speed,
and when you catch the blimp, keep your speed.
Listen...
But now... what are you going to do?
Well, we'll see each other, because now we have to leave.
-Huh?
-In Kaito Kid!
Ah.
Ah!
Wings, wings, wings, wings.
Fold the wings, man.
It's going.
The wings.
Hurry up. Hurry up.
I can't press the button so you're in the way.
Oh, man.
May I know what you play?
Ha-ha!
Stop it, stop it.
Hold still, I'm trying to press the button.
Hold it.
Nano, it tickles.
Stop it.
Ah!
(Knock)
Watch out!
We're getting out of here!
-Is it in Kaito Kid?
-By the way, so in Kudo is...
Well, good luck to you, eh?
Aren't you coming, or what?
No, I'll stay here and rest.
After all, the jewel right now is in the possession of the terrorists.
Some of it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
He's got it.
What's this?
It's Jirokichi's fingerprint.
Thank you very much.
I thought I'd use a display case
that would only open with your fingerprints.
But I won't use it anymore, you can keep it.
What you do have to do is to keep an eye on your girlfriend.
That man called Fujioka...
"...has taken her by the arms."
"Despite the fact that she immediately threw him off."
And luckily she didn't sneeze or anything, I don't think she got infected.
But look, I wanted to tell you.
"She's not."
"I was convinced she was placed here, but..."
"It's not here either."
"Maybe they put it in a different place than before."
"I've only found two."
"And the ones they found before in Genta and Mitsuhiko I don't know where they were."
"Why haven't they turned them back on the most important place,
where the bacteria are located?"
"You'd better start by deactivating these."
(Mobile)
Hello, Kudo.
You said you'd call me earlier, but I'm still waiting for you, man.
-Oh, I mean..., Conan.
-Kudo?
Sorry, sorry, I didn't think about it.
To the blimp.
"Oh, sir. Where are you now?"
You're back already?
You went too fast, didn't you?
Hey, what did you want?
I'm really busy right now.
The terrorists have made public
the hijacking of the blimp on the Internet.
What are you talking about?
Panic has spread throughout Osaka.
"Trains are packed to overflowing with people fleeing from Osaka to the west."
(Man) I've already told them there are no more seats.
If you're going in the direction of Tokyo, you might as well....
How do you want us to go, if they have spread bacteria?
-There is still room for more people!
-Please don't push.
Wait for the next one, please.
(Heiji) The roads leading from Osaka to the west are crowded
and there are traffic jams everywhere.

They say that bank employees and security guards have evacuated them.
have evacuated them.
It is the best time to steal.
It's not a very good idea, because there are security systems everywhere.
Just kidding, man.
Don't get involved in the conversations of the elders.
"Security systems..."
Wow!
You scared me.
Wanna see something interesting?
What's up?
Sorry, I'll call you back.
Hey, man.
He hung up on me again.
What the hell must have happened?
-Mm?
What do you want? What do you want?
-Hey.
Hey, Kazuha.
One thing: who was Mr. Heiji talking to now?
-At Conan?
-At Conan.
Yes, he's a kid like you, he's about your age, and he's superllest,
the best in the class.
And it seems to me that Heiji and he are very close friends.
So it wasn't a grown-up conversation, was it?
Hey!
Do you want to stop talking so much!?
Yes, yes, sorry, it's true.
I'm sorry, Mr. Heiji.
Let's see, what's so interesting?
What's so interesting?
Smoke bombs?
What are they doing?
When we pass these mountains, we'll reach Nara.
The people of Nara will stand still when they see the airship billowing smoke
as it flies over the city.
They won't stand still, they'll panic to death.
Panic?
They've spread the whole bacteria and bomb thing all over the internet.
I'm sure they're evacuating everyone in the city by now.
Ah.
Well, if this happens to Nara, it's the ideal time for thieves.
What do you say!
Even if people go, there are the security systems.
The security systems...
Yes, it could be.
Of course it could be.
That's why they go to Nara?
"But... then,
why did they take over the bacteria just to do this?
Sure, I get it.
So you do.
I'll take care of it.
Where are you going now, Heiji?
-To Nara?
-To Nara, in Nara.
And you're going for something to do with the airship, if I may ask?
Yes, and it's dangerous, you can't come.
Please, let me come with you.
Au, man!
But I just told you that you can't come.
I know the streets of Nara, I could help you.
-But didn't you hear me?
-I'm coming too.
Besides, 3 people on a motorcycle is illegal.
This lightning.
I've come up with a great idea.
-Yeah, take it easy. -Yeah, take it easy.
-I hope you're strong.
Eh?
Yes, very good.
-Satoshi, are you all right?
We'll be right there, hold on a little longer.
"I don't know if I'm doing well."
"Wow! No way!"
Eh?
Ran.
Ran.
(Sonoko) Ran!
Ran!
(Man) Sit down!
"The Ran..."
"She has a rash."
Please help me, please.
-Ah!
Aaah!
-Let me go.
Come on, you go inside, too, and stay here.
Don't touch me.
Aaah!
Casum!
"But what's going on here?"
"Just as you said in Kaito Kid, it can't be that the Ran has infected,
because in Fujioka she only caught his arm."
"Besides, she has turned away immediately....
And he didn't have any rash or sneezed."
"On the other hand, in Genta he was sneezed on.
"And he probably breathed the air in the smoking room..,
and yet he didn't get infected."
"How can that be?"
In Mizukawa, the TV director, he had a rash here.
"Maybe it's that..."
(People: panicked screams)
(Man) Bacteria!
They will spread the bacteria!
(Woman) It's loaded with bombs.
(Man) Hurry, hurry.
We must evacuate everyone.
Everybody in the van, go.
But the Buddhas...
The Buddhas won't get infected with bacteria.
Come on, hurry up!
I hope we won't be punished for it.
-Come on, it's for today.
-No one will punish them.
-Poor Ran.
-Ran...
-Mm?
- (knock)
-Yes.
-Go to him.
Hey.
Ha!
Cat A.
Cat A, what's wrong?
Answer it.
(Walkie-talkie: interference)
(Walkie-talkie: interference) -Yes.
-Càsum.
Go see what's going on.
Hey, what's up?
Hey, hey, hey!
Oh... Have you fallen asleep?
Aaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(thump)
Cat B.
"What are you doing? What happened? Cat B."
Cat B is out of action, he has fallen discalabro.
It's strange, isn't it?
It's in Conan!
"Cats never fall on their backs."
-And in Kaito Kid it's with him.
Good, he's back!
No, it's not in Kaito Kid.
Stop it!

Cats C, D and E, catch this little guy!
Or not: he will be liquidated as soon as you find him.
-All right.
-All right, you're going to stand guard in the dining room.
You're going to stand guard in the dining room.
Cat F, you too.
Roger that.
I'm switching to autopilot and going.
But, uh...
Casum.
Damn it.
The little guy's the lookout.
Yes.
Un.
Seven...
The trap set for the Kaito Kid is very useful.
And that too.
"Just a moment."
"Perhaps he has expressly given it to me to use."
(Man) Quiet!
Throw this on the ground.
Hands up so I can get a good look at you.
You believe them all, don't you?
(Man) Come on.
Put your hand up.
Ah... Are you sure?
Understood.
Do as I say.
I'm not as useless as the others.
(gunshot)
Go.
I've already warned you.
Now you'll see!
IAAH!
(gunshot) Eh?
Eh!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Eh? (Kaito) Eh?
(Kaito) Hey, hey, what a scandal.
(Kaito) What's this?
All the traps
that Mr. Jirokichi had set up to capture you.
(Kaito) I get it.
If I had fled through the window after taking the jewel
and shot the wire...
Wow, that was a close call.
Grandpa there is the bomb.
But listen, you were up here the whole time?
Stop her!
Awesome.
He's got this.
A medal.
(PA) "Attention all those who remain."
"I've disposed of their leader, and three others as well."
What?
I don't believe this.
Catch me, Lupin!
Aaaaaaaaah!
All right, all right, all right!
You better... not play with it, girl.
Hey, Conan.
Both of you here, you're out.
Roger that.
"Boy, what a call history!"
"And all of them, too, the last two or three hours."
What?
Who was he talking to on his cell phone?
Because he's got a lot of calls.
Mmm... If you don't feel like explaining it to me...
But what are you going to do about it?
If he doesn't want to explain it to me, maybe I'll have to use it.
Do whatever you want.
All right, we put it down, all at the same time, little by little.
-(Heiji) Huh?
- (Heiji) Now I get it!
And there's no denying that it's a good plan, yes sir.
The strategy of biological terror with the blimp.
The real goal of this operation
was to steal all the treasures of the temple
after evacuating it so that not a soul was left.
We took advantage of the fact that it was not guarded and had no security systems.
So that people do not imagine it,
they will steal the statues of the Buddhas from the temples.
Heaven will punish you.
But what do you empatolleu?
If what we want is to protect them, the statues.
Well, say the name of an inspector of the police of Nara,
whoever you say will do me good.
-What's the matter?
You don't know any?
-Well...
Strange!
And you're a police officer?
Come on, I'll help you a little.
There's an inspector with a very fitting name for a man from Nara.
-Cójala los.
-Liquid-los, they're just kids.
What's that?
They said something?
They say they'll liquidate us, that we're just kids.
They must be short-sighted.
-They say that?
Yes, they do.
Do you really believe... that we're the only ones here, to catch thieves?
What's that?
Shit! (Loud speaker)
(Loudspeaker) "This is Inspector Shikatsuno,
from the 3rd Division of the Nara Police."
"Always remember this:
never despise the Nara Prefectural Police!"
(Phone: Heiji) "Hello, Kudo."
"We have already arrested the men who wanted to steal the Buddha statues,
and, evidently, the monks and everyone else are safe."
(Conan voice) Very well, understood.
Thank you, Heiji.
Gee, gee, gee.
I see that bearded detective from Osaka has pulled a few strings.
"A few strings, yes."
Oh, by the way.
Here, take this.
Ah, thank you very much, son.
We've got to hurry, we've got to get the Ran to the hospital.
Oh, yes, of course.
We still have this pending issue.
Ran.
(Door, open)
(door opens) Oh!
Conan!
No.
Don't come closer.
No, don't suffer, really.
Don't worry, there's no one infected by bacteria.
But I have the rash.
It must be some irritation.
You must have touched some solvent, right?
What's that?
The man who drove you here
is the same one who drove Mr. Mizukawa, isn't he?
He's right.
Yes.

I'm convinced that he was the only one
who knew how to use the solvent or whatever it was,
"...because he had black fingernails."
Surely he must have worked as a painter or something.
I mean, the kidnappers never at any time...
stole the famous bacteria.
"They only blew up the lab
because it looked like they were committing a biological terrorist attack."
To prove it, I have this vial.
I have threatened to open it in front of the terrorist leader
and he was so calm, he didn't care.
If it contained real bacteria, he would have stopped me no matter what, wouldn't he?
Just like you told me before not to come near me.
Conan...
Eh?
Yes.
Are you all right, Ran?
I'm right, aren't I, Kogoro?
Also, look.
Mm-hm.
Aside from the irritation at first,
now you also have it on your hands and the back of your arms and thighs.
I don't think it's caused by bacteria, this.
It can't be.
My guess is that the kidnappers have been throwing solvent
in every corner of this room.
On the walls, on the sofa, on the doorknob...
That's why Mr. Fujioka, who has smoked here,
when he came with the irritation from the solvent
and he grabbed your arms, you got marks on your arms too.
But on the rest of your body, you only got marks in the places
the places that have been in contact with things in this room.
But...
"Wait a minute. Then why did that person...? It can't be!"
Hey, what is it now?
Conan...
"Shit!"
"After talking to the Nara police..."
we've discovered the identities of the kidnappers.
It's a foreign group of experienced mercenaries.
A group of mercenaries?
So, about the Red Siamese Cats...
They have no connection.
They just used the name to hide their real objective,
which was to steal the Buddha statues.
And this time, the person who hired them is...
Where do you want to go?
Wanting to escape alone and leave the companions behind,
don't you find that a little scary?
There is the real boss of the kidnappers,
Mr. Takamichi Fujioka.
What a little boy!
I'm surprised you found out my identity.
It cost me.
Because I must admit
that he fooled me right off the bat by making it look like he was infected.
Probably just after takeoff,
"That subordinate of yours has sprayed the smoking room with solvent
and left the vial under the couch."
Evidently, following your orders.
You then went into the smoking room...
and you touched the solvent expressly
to get everyone to believe
that you were the first person infected.
At the observation deck, you tried to convince Mr. Kogoro...
to accompany her to the smoking room...
Mr. Mouri, will you accompany me?
"She also touched Ran's arms with her hands."
And all this was done to show
that all the people who posed a threat to him
were infected.
But since Kogoro did not want to accompany her,
he was forced to put a sleeping pill in his drink.
This has caused him to sleep until recently.
Mr. Mizukawa and the waitress,
the irritations have spread to their palms
and on the back of their arms.
Probably because they have touched something in the room.
Genta, on the other hand, did not get any marks?
because he only glanced at it,
but he didn't touch anything inside the room.
Therefore, it could only be you.
"He was the only one who had marks
in places that couldn't have been in contact with anything in the room."
"Also, the leader of the terrorists...
has spent the day calling one person."
That's how I understood everything.
He has used the solvent and rubbed it all over himself
so that he got marks all over his body.
He took advantage of the fear
that people were afraid of getting infected with the bacterium
so that he could be left alone to give orders to the terrorist group without being seen.
without being seen.
You are the head of the operation.
Caram, impressive deduction, kiddo, you must admit.
But you have neglected a very important detail.
How?
At no time did I have the intention of escaping here alone.
Well, I'm sorry to tell you that your subordinates are...
I didn't mean them.

I am not referring to mercenaries,
but my real subordinates.
Don't tell me there are more.
Nobody move!
-Aaaah!
Sonoko!
They told you not to move.
Conan, there are still two more.
"The cameraman and the reporter also with the kidnappers."
Wow.
Besides, don't think I came up here to escape,
just to get your attention.
What's that?
You want to know why we hijacked the blimp
to steal the Buddha statues and not for money?
"In this computerized society,
it's very easy to follow the money trail."
"On the other hand, to smuggle...
with priceless Buddha statues is much safer".
Buddha statues are much more highly valued outside Japan.
And I already had a pile of buyers related.
But now that you've spoiled my plans, I'll return the favor.
Ha-ha-ha!
Your time will soon come.
But first, I'll savor the moment.
-The credit goes to that little boy.
-Heiji, you've done very well.
Listen, could we approach the airship now?
I haven't been able to get in touch with Conan for a while.
-Okay.
Understood.
-Maybe something happened to him.
And you, Satoshi, now you have to stay here.
-Yes, I know.
-Huh? -Yeah.
But if...
I couldn't have saved the statues without you.
Heiji... I think the thieves' target is Kofuku Temple.
The one with so many national treasures.
Alright, let's go.
-It can't be.
-Then let me go.
It's dangerous.
You and Kazuha must go home.
Come on, pretty, let's go home.
Okay?
Your mother must be very worried.
Understood.
But, in return, one day you'll introduce me to this boy named Conan?
Because now you're going to rescue him, right, Heiji?
All right, okay, I promise.
Kazuha, take him home.
Don't suffer.
And you go very carefully.
Yes.
Come on, we can go now.
-Oh-oh...
-Oh. -Oh.
What do you know, you guys were in on it, too.
-Mm-hm.
-The others are in.
Hey.
Come untie us.
I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you.
I forgot to tell you
there's been a last-minute change of plans.
A change?
Yes, because it turns out that this is the only loot there is.
So you'll have to stay and die with them.
What the...?!?
Ah!
Since this is already over, I'll tell you something.
We plan to...
to flee in a ship that is anchored very close to that port.
And then we'll blow up the airship.
All the hostages will be blown to bits.
Right, that's why...
Maybe you've managed to defuse
the bombs in the fuel tanks,
"But there are still two more in the passenger cabin."
Wow!
But, of course, before that...
Ah!
...I'll see to it that I kill you
and throw you into the depths of the sea.
"Gee, what do I do now? What can I do?"
"What can I do to change this situation?"
We've got them, there's the blimp!
I see it flies quite low, doesn't it?
(Sato) Yes.
And if it goes on like this...
(Heiji) it will collide with the Akashi Strait Bridge.
(Heiji) Look!
You can see the Kobe harbor tower!
And the anchor lights of Mt. Rokko!
They're awesome!
Mm... What do you want with this, kid?
You want me to be distracted because I got my head bashed in on the bridge?
You think I'll let you fool me?
-What's the matter now?
-What the hell?!?
(Alarm)
Shit.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Shouting)
(Heiji) Unbelievable!
It looks like a whale jumping into the sea.
(Alarm)
(Mobile)
Hello, Kudo.
(Shinichi voice) Yes, hello?
Yes, thank you, Heiji.
What happened?
Are you all right?
You're just in time.
Notify the coast guard.
The coast guard?
In Fujioka, the leader of the hijackers, has fallen into the sea.
He what?
He has fallen into the sea, you say?
"Yes, and besides, the boat they want to use to escape...
must be anchored very close to the port."
All right, you understand.
"I leave it in your hands, that."
See you later.
Tomorrow we'll go for okonomiyaki.
I've been looking forward to it for a long time.
Hey, Heiji.
Who were you talking to?
Shinichi Kudo?
What?
Ah, yes, yes...
I want to ask you something.
In Kudo is... is it the Kaito Kid?

What?
What, guys?
Are you all right?
-I haven't recovered yet.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Where are those two?
If you mean the infiltrators, they've been knocked unconscious there.
When the blimp stood up, they must have hit their heads.
They are fine now.
We were saved because we were related.
(Kaito) Wow, what a scare!
I was hiding in a room
and suddenly the blimp tilted.
-Kaito...
-It's him!
What a face!
There's nothing wrong with that boy.
What about Conan?
I'm sure he'll show up here soon.
Au, now take care of untying all the others.
Hey.
Untie me.
Untie me too.
-Quiet. -Quiet.
-Quiet here, Kaito.
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave the inspector for last.
You won't get away with it!
Ladies and Gentlemen, as promised,
I'm taking this valuable treasure with me.
-You're a common thief.
-Wait. -You won't get away.
You won't get away.
I'm the phantom thief.
Mm-hm.
Yes.
And the kidnappers?
All right, you've done very well.
Understood.
The hostages are safe.
And we've apprehended all the kidnappers.
And with that, the case is solved, right?
Yes.
I'm starving.
Finally we can eat with a little peace of mind.
I'll have rice with eel.
Seems to me we got a little sloppy.
Now that you mention it...
(Agasa) Ha-ha-ha!
The time has come for the enigma I've been waiting for.
He-he-he-he...
-Nobody was waiting for the head of the enigma.
Ayumi, Genta and Mitsuhiko, all 3 of you are good children... and good friends.
But who can tell me why you can't play cards?
-Huh?
-Huh?
And... this is the riddle?
If you don't know, I'll give you a clue.
All 3 of you are good friends, right?
Well, if you're good guys,
it means there can't be any fighting between you.
Get it?
Decks of cards.
Do you understand?
-I understand.
-Ah, sure.
Ah, if only catching that thief...
were as easy as this riddle!
I'd have caught her by now, and she'd finally be on the front page of the newspapers.
Hey, Sonoko.
Eh?
Do you know where the Ran is?
Well, now that you mention it, no.
Earlier he told me to go ahead, that she was going to the washroom for a moment.
I saw him take the elevator up to the observation deck.
Maybe he was going to look for Kaito.
What?
It's impossible that the moonlight...
Shinichi.
Hey, Shinichi...
"Oops. I didn't remember that."
Hello, Ran.
It's been an exciting day today, hasn't it?
Shinichi.
Please turn yourself in.
A thief will always be a thief and that's not right.
Please, Shinichi...
I agree.
So...
Let's see, if you hand over the treasure I've been waiting for so long,
I'll turn myself in to the police.
Xxxxt.
Eh?
But I don't have any, of...
Of course you do.
Eh?
Ah.

You're not Shinichi, are you?
How dare you!?
Conan!
You're right.
I'm not a detective, but a thief.
And stealing is the best thing I know how to do,
even if it's the heart of a beautiful lady.
It's just unbelievable... Kaito...!
How can you say this, after seeing what just happened?
What just happened?
What just happened?
Oh.

It is the Lady from Heaven!
But, when did she put it on me?
Hey, what happened to Kaito?
Something happened that Shinichi would never do.
What?
What's that?
What is it that Shinichi would never do?
Why are you so clear about it?
Because...
Eh, it's not because I like it, eh?
Don't misunderstand me.
What's that?
W... wait a minute, Ran.
(At the same time) But what the hell is it that I would never do?
