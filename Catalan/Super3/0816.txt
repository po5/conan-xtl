Ha-ha-ha-ha!
-Oh!
Eh?
-(Both) Aaaah!
(Both) Aaaah!
Aaaah!
(Voice cracking) We are aliens who came from space.
As a souvenir of this encounter,
I would be very happy if you would take a picture with me
and difongu√©ssiu.
He speaks as if he were a robot and goes on tapping his chin.
And he refers to "us", but I don't see anyone else.
We want a picture!
-Like this, the three of us together.
-Oh, so much!
Ha-ha-ha!
That's great!
(Voice cracking) We're aliens who came from space.
Wow, I love it!
-(man) Huh?
- (man) A-a space alien!
(Man) An alien!
-(Man) Huh?
Somebody help me!
Ah!
(man) Oh!
Ah!
-He's down!
-What the...?
-Did it go wrong?
-Oh...! -Oh...!
An ambulance!
Hey, are you okay?
Contesti'm!
I can't sit down?
-It can't be! -It can't be!
-Are you all right?
Come on, come on!
My God...!
(Shinichi voice) "The feeling that we've always carried in our hearts
has made us take flight towards the twentieth anniversary."
"An alien suddenly appearing causes misfortune."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

(Conan voice) "An alien that doesn't look like one at all."
(Genta) What a lack of common sense!
Who would think of going out at night dressed as an alien?
(Genta) He is right.
What a despicable man!
(Child) You are wrong.
I don't know what would go through his head.
Don't criticize him, Hitsohi.
He didn't do it in bad faith.
It was my fault.
I am sure.
-My name is Kota Matsumoto.
-We don't know each other, do we?
I don't understand.
Why do you say that, that it was your fault?
In Takedera... he always comes to play with us at the toy library,
on weekends or when he has a party at work.
The aliens will not come to Earth to invade us.
When they arrive, it will be to befriend us!
Do you really think they will want to make friends with earthlings?
That's why we should be a little more...
He's back to making up stories!
Aliens don't exist.
-Oh, so much!
-Don't they?
My father told me before he died!
Bah!
-Now I understand.
-He did it for that.
He needed someone to see him
for rumors to start circulating.
I'm sorry I said he was a despicable man.
Do you forgive us for criticizing her?
-She's very kind and a very good person.
Anyway, it's true that he caused a fatal accident.
I'm sure she will regret it for the rest of her life.
And now what will happen to poor Hitoshi?
(Both) Oh...
Eh?
Hello, girls.
Excuse me.
You were with the alien when the accident happened, right?
-Who are you, you guys?
-Yes.
I'm in Kota, friend of Hitoshi Takedera.
Ah, right.
Can you explain us what happened, last night?
Yes, sure, but you'll understand better if you see it.
Eh?
-And I also made a video.
It depicts an alien, this?
-Eh?
- (man) An alien!
(Man) An alien!
Somebody help me!
(man) Ah!
(man) Ah!
(man) Oh!
Aaaah!
Can I see the picture again for a moment?
(Woman) Yes.
It's not so scary, this alien.
The truth is, it looks like a low-rent costume.
In fact, we didn't know what he was disguised as...
until he told us himself that he was an alien.
"We are aliens who came from space," he said.
No wonder.
However..., Mr. Hanzaki, the man who killed himself...,
was coming down the stairs and saw the street from that height.
When the alien appeared, he got scared.
He tried to run away and fell.
But if he saw it from the top of everything,
how did he know it was an alien?

He was saying it himself, wasn't he?
"We are extraterrestrials coming from space," he was saying.
And think he heard it?
It's impossible from here.
(Children) Yeah.
It is strange, yes.
And what was Mr. Hanzaki doing up here at that hour?
Maybe we should find out, right?
I don't think he would have come to pray at the temple.
It's been abandoned for a long time.
I'm beginning to think this case isn't as simple as it seemed.
Maybe it wasn't an accident.
All right, now it's our turn to step in.
Yes.
We should investigate the victim first, don't you think?
That we
-But... Who are you, you people?
-...the Junior Detective League!
-All five of us are...
Ah...
(Man) Eh?
Yes.
My neighbor, in Yasuo?
We talked to the neighbor downstairs
and he told us that you were quite agreeable to him.
He-he!
We were both out of work and had a lot of free time.
What kind of person was he, your neighbor?
A person with bad luck.
Six months ago he was fired from his job because of a restructuring,
and last night he went to collect some money and...
Mm...
Oops, I'll shut up.
It's the same thing.
What was he supposed to collect?
Just child wages.
In Yasuo he lived off the money from blackmailing an acquaintance of his.
-He was a blackmailer?
-What?
Yes...
Last night his victim called him to tell him he would pay.
That's why he had to go to Beimyo Temple.
Well, now that Mr. Hanzaki is dead,
his victim, let's call him "X", will have taken a load off his mind.
Could it be that X had died Mr. Hanzaki?
Do you know what it was called, Mr. Hanzaki's victim?
How do you want me to know this?
But you can look into it, if you wish.
Yasuo never locked the door.
-No...
-Huh?
Didn't he lock the door?
He said he didn't have anything that could be stolen.
There's no clue that could lead us to X.
My God, what a smell of tobacco in this apartment!
It's normal, he smoked like a cartwright.
Where did he get them from, so many dolls?
He had a lot of them.
They were karaoke prizes.
He went there quite often.
By the way, your victim could be a factory worker.
Last month, if I'm not mistaken...
I'd rather work than keep blackmailing you.
Pull some strings so I can get back to work.
If you give me a hand, I'll forget what I saw and be done with it.
So, what he wanted was to get his old job back...
at the factory he'd been fired from.
This seemed to me.
If X had the capacity to reinstate him...
...it had to be his old boss.
Eh?
Mm?
See.
Mr. Hanzaki worked at Sankojuko?
It's a very prestigious company!
Yeah man, don't go overboard, now!
In Yasuo he didn't work at Sankojuko.
It was a factory that was subcontracted by Sankojuko.
(All) Ah...
I'd like to know at once who the mysterious X. is,
but today is Sunday and the factory is closed.
We'll investigate elsewhere.
I want to talk to the alien, I have to check something.
He-he!
We know you did it with the intention of helping Kota,
but we'd like to know if it happened to you,
the idea to disguise yourself as an alien.
Well, no, the idea was not homegrown.
-It was a friend's.
- (all) Eh?
We were in the children's literature research group at the university.
at the university.
His name is Akira Omi.
He's a good kid, pure innocence.
Hey, how about dressing up as an alien?
Me?
Go out on the street and ask to have your picture taken, so he'll spread the rumor.
And your friend will think that aliens really exist.
Well, good thinking!
The sooner the better.
Tomorrow night, for example.
Of course, of course!
I'm glad I consulted you, Akira.
I just put into practice your proposal.
It's funny.
I find you have some very original ideas, your friend.
We had acted together in a children's theater play
in which I played an alien.
(Voice cracking) We are aliens who come from space.
We come from another galaxy.
"The costume is the same one I used."
Now I understand why she looked so homemade.
-The kids weren't supposed to be scared.
-It was made for a children's play.
Oh!

I'm sure poor Akira feels as bad as I do about yesterday.
He was also the one who told me that 8:00 p.m. would be a good time to go out in costume.
would be a good time to go out in costume.
And he also suggested that setting to me.
He assured me that there was the ideal atmosphere.
How could it go so wrong?
Just to confirm: was it your friend Akira,
who suggested to you that I show up in alien costume
at 8 p.m. at the foot of the steps of the Beimyo temple?
Yes, he knows that area much better than I do.
He lived there for a while,
until he went to the Sankojuko employee residence.
-Mm?
-He works at Sankojuko?
Mm...
Do you think we can talk, if we go to the residence?
It seems to me that he usually went to the gym on Sundays, but...
Wait a minute, why do you want to see him?
It seems that yesterday the Akira left the residence
at half past five, 8 o'clock in the afternoon.
It will be about a 20 minute walk to Beimyo Temple.
He would have arrived in time to see the alien at 8 o'clock.
He's from the Production Control Department of the headquarters.
And since he is the coordinator of the external suppliers,
he must also be able to decide which workers are hired.
It's already clear to me: our X is Akira Omi.
I wouldn't be surprised if he had a relationship with Yasuo Hanzaki.
Maybe Yasuo had found a weak spot in him and was blackmailing him.
(Genta) What do you mean?
But there's something I don't understand.
(Matsuhiko) But we've already solved all the doubts.
The Akira Omi summoned at Yasuo Hanzaki in front of the temple of Beimyo
at 8 p.m. with the false promise that he would pay him.
Somehow he convinced him to go downstairs together and....
-What?
-Look!
He's an alien!
"So he could teach him in Hitoshi's alien suit."
We touch the two or we die!
An alien!
Somebody help me!
Aaaah!
"He tried to run away scared to death and fell down the stairs."
This would explain why in Yasuo it was thought
that there was a real alien in the street.
So that the Akira, who was with him, tricked him.
And what does this mean?
That it is a premeditated murder and executed by the Akira
with the intention of getting rid of his blackmailer.
(All) What?
Anyway...
How did he know, that the other would be scared?
Do you know any adult who would be scared by such a ridiculous disguise?
-Now that you mention it...
-You're right.
Well, he did get scared, we know that for sure.
And that's what doesn't sit right with me.
And he even called.
He had no reason to be so scared.
What caused him to fall down the stairs?
(Children) Mmm...!
Mmm...
Gee, what a dilemma!
I let him run, eh.
Ouch!
(Children) - Too bad!
-People! -You hurt yourself, Genta?
Did you hurt yourself, Genta?
(Shinichi, thinks) "Yes, I might have."
Now we can corner the killer.
You got it right.
We have irrefutable proof of the crime.
Well... I don't understand why you haven't told us, your neighbor.
We should have figured out how he committed the crime hours ago.
If you were such good friends, surely he knew and should've been able to put the pieces together right away.
Maybe not, the news didn't say,
that he called before he fell down the stairs.
I told him when he let me go to the bathroom at his house.
(Genta) "An alien, somebody help me!" he called out loud,
he called aloud.
Then he must have noticed the incoherence.
(Conan's voice) Fuck!
Ha-ha-ha!
He-he-he-he!
I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about.
Never mind, the police will know right away.
Ah..., ah!
Ah...!
-Do you know what people will think? -Leave me alone!
-Leave me alone!
"He's come to see the accident site,
and the idiot also slipped and fell!"
-Ah!
-Ah!
We won't let him do it.
We don't want another crime.
He put his head together when I explained to him what had happened.
And he followed us all the time to find out who had killed his neighbor.
He-he-he-he!
-To blackmail him!
I just don't have a job, you know?
It's not worth risking your life for the money.
Yes, he's right...
Hi, guys.
Why did you want to see me?
-What are you doing here?
-Hey, Akira.
I got a call from these guys, the Junior Detectives.

Detectives?
Your friend, Akira Omi, knew the victim, Mr. Hanzaki.
Is that right?
From work.
Mr. Hanzaki was blackmailing him...
and he didn't know how to get him off his back for good.
-Ha-ha-ha!
What nonsense!
-Ha-ha-ha!
The proof is that he tried to kill me because I had found out.
What?
I wasn't trying to kill him, I just wanted to teach him a lesson...
because he was accusing me unjustly.
-Oh, of course he was serious!
-I wasn't serious, man.
-You'd better shut up. -You'd better shut up.
-Weren't you? -You were?
We saved her by the skin of our teeth, go call the police immediately.
Aaa... sure.
He-he-he-he-he...
Last night was an accident, wasn't it?
He got scared when he saw me in disguise.
That's what the two girls who were with me said.
You know what, with the costume you were wearing,
no one would have believed that you were a real alien.
Unless you were telling everyone yourself.
"We're aliens from outer space".
But it turns out that it is impossible
that Mr. Hanzaki could sense you from up here.
Only four people could know that you were an alien.
In Hitoshi, who had already put it on,...
the two girls passing by on the street, and Mr. Omi,
who had the idea and proposed the time and place.
Well, that Yasuo Hanzaki must have imagined it too, if he didn't know.
He didn't call.
That's why he got scared and called.
How did you come to this conclusion?
That was his way of reacting when he was afraid.
It's just that Mr. Hanzaki had a sore throat.
At first, both his neighbor, Mr. Tamai, and himself,
thought it was just a cold.
But he had an acute inflammation of the vocal chords
because he had strained his voice too much.
If he could not speak normally, he could not possibly shout.
So, from the one that came out, the scream we felt?
Only the only person who could call
who knew that Hitoshi was playing the role of an alien
and who, moreover, was with the victim at that time.
Mr. Akira Omi.
It could only be you.
Was it you, Akira?
Last night, Mr. Omi quoted Mr. Hanzaki here.
"He knocked him unconscious and waited
for Hitoshi to make his entrance on the scene."
(Girl) We want a picture!
An-an alien!
An alien!
-Ah!
Somebody help me!
"He killed it by throwing it off the stairs."
"Everyone would think he'd been frightened by the sight of the alien
and had slipped."
I couldn't push him down the stairs,
because it would have looked like a homicide
and there probably would have been an investigation.
"If I wanted to make the fall look like an accident,
I needed a witness who could corroborate."
I'm not wrong, am I, Mr. Omi?
Akira..., it's not true, is it?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
What an imagination!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Well, you know how easy it is for children to make up stories.
You can tell that he still doesn't know that we have proof that the accused.
One of the girls who were on the scene with Mr. Takedera
recorded a video of the fall with her cell phone.
When the police analyze the recorded voice....,
they'll soon be able to determine who it belongs to.
Wow.
So he had neck problems, huh?
I'm interested in the money, but I'm even more interested in...
to go back to work at the factory.
That unpleasant hoarse voice... Mm!
I thought he was doing it to sound more threatening!
So, is it true, Akira?
You the glass...?
I had a fit and stole from a supermarket.
Yasuo, who knew me, caught me.
For the prestigious company where I work,
a simple theft is an unforgivable offense.
When I had already decided that I was going to get rid of myself,
you came to talk to me and I figured out how to do it.
You're a silly fool who settles for a mediocre job
and who takes the childishness of small children seriously.
I used you.
"A silly fool"?
What a nerve!
And he says it was just a simple theft?
-Yes...
-Why don't you tell him, Mitsuhiko?
You know what, Mr. Omi?

You are a despicable man!

You don't really look like one at all, an alien.
Why not?
Real aliens must be cooler, man.
-Hmm...?
-Mm.
Huh? (chuckles)
-I'm sure they do.
-If-if they exist, sure.
And they must be a lot cooler than this one.
-Mm.
Sure they are.
It doesn't cost much.
-Of course it does.
(Children) Ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha!
An alien would present himself as such?
He told me he'd send a moving truck to pick up the stuff.
And he took absolutely everything, I see.
He emptied the apartment.
My name is Kogoro Mouri and I'm a private detective.
Detective?
I'd like to ask you about Motoko Kawaguchi, if you don't mind.
That girl has been a headache for poor Mrs. Terakado for a long time now.
for poor Mrs. Terakado.
I've already found it.
I have solved the case!
