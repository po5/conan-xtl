"The cases he investigates at Conan get more complicated every day."
"Today it's been two years since he shrunk and he'll have to solve a difficult case."
"But he will discover the truth."
"His brain of an adult and he is... Detective Conan!"

DETECTIVE CONAN
The kidnapping of Conan Edogawa
Conan, did you hear what I said?
Your parents left you here because they had to go abroad.
And we still don't know anything.
Don't you miss them?
No, not much.
As you are...
What irresponsible parents!
They have never even contacted us.
(Thinking) "Oh, oh, oh, oh... they're already starting to think badly."
"But my parents live abroad,
I haven't fooled them that much either."
Professor Agasa, he brought it to us, didn't he?
Yes.
Well, you will be asked for your parents' phone number, right?
Better not! (ringing)
Who's there?
Why don't you want us to call them, eh, boy?
(Thinking) "Geez! I have to find an excuse, and fast!"
"If not, they'll find out I'm Shinichi Kudo!"
This is it!
It's here, Conan!
It's your mother!
My love, I'm so sorry... You kicked us out, didn't you?
It's all settled.
The mother will take you home, reietó.Però who are you?
It's not your mother?
He just wants to make you pray;
he's a fool.
It's logical, we've left him alone for so long...
My name is Fumiko Edogawa.
His mother.
My husband and I have decided to come looking.
(Thinking) "It can't be!"
"Conan Edogawa is a fictitious name. Conan has no parents!"
Thank you very much for everything, sir.
I'll be right over to pay l'hi.
-All right.
Come in anytime!
-Goodbye, Mr. Mouri.
Goodbye, Conan!
Above all, write to us when you get home.
Don't forget to pay me what you owe me!
(Think) Goodbye, Conan...
Who are you, madam?
Ha-ha!
Don't talk nonsense, Conan.
I'm your mother.
No!
My mother is... Yukiko Kudo.
That's right.
When she was young, your mother had all the men captivated.
"At 19, she'd won many awards,
and was considered the most beautiful actress in the country."
"But she fell in love with Yusaku Kudo, an up-and-coming writer,
and they married when she was 20."
"She retired."
They left and their only son stayed here.
Now they live abroad, and he is a very famous writer.
You are his son... Shinichi Kudo.
(Thinking) "It's impossible!"
"He can't be an accomplice of those men who made me shrink."
Don't move, pretty boy.
Look kid, if you behave yourself, I'll take you to a fun place.
You'll have a great time.
What a ?!
-You idiot!
What are you doing? -What's the matter?
Please step aside!
You want us to kill each other?!
Hey!
Somebody stop this kid!
(Man) Hey, kid!
(Thinking) "How can it be? How can it be that he tracked me down?"
"And if it were because I used Shinichi Kudo's name
to solve the karaoke murder?"
"What if they've deduced that the boy they poisoned is still alive?"
"And look I told the inspector, they don't call me."
"What an ass I am! It's my fault."
"What are you going to do, now, Shinichi Kudo?"
"Will you go to see the Ran and tell him the truth?"
"No, I can't go back now...it would put them in danger."
"Shit."
"What shall I do now?"
"What could I do?"
(Man) What?
Did he run away?
Yes, I got overconfident.
And it's true, that child is Shinichi Kudo.
(Man) So it's true that he shrunk.
Look for him!
If he reports us to the police, we'll be in trouble.
(Woman) But where should I look for him?
Don't suffer, surely, he'll go to the place where we imagined.
(Think) "Professor Agasa is the only one who knows who I am."
"I'll ask him for advice.
"He does take a long time to arrive."
"Now that I need him, he goes and disappears."

"He's back!"
Professor Agasa!
Sleep well, my son.
(Thinking) "Where am I? It looks like a kitchen."
"Oysters, though my head is spinning."
"I'm upstairs?"
"I get it."
"They must have brought me here while I was unconscious."
(Man) You didn't get it though?
(Woman) No.
The head gave me specific orders.
"It's that woman! And there's another person."
"A man?"
We can't kill him yet.
They want us to take him away to study the effects of those pills!
"I get it, that's why they haven't killed me."
"But who is this man?"
"Oysters!"
"Who is he, this masked man? How scary, he's coming this way!"
Is he awake, the nano?
No, he's still under the effects of chloroform.
Fumiko, are you sure it's Detective Shinichi Kudo?
I didn't quite believe it myself.
But the day that Shinichi Kudo disappeared coincides
with the day the boy arrived at that detective's agency.
And from that day on, Kogoro has solved all the cases.
The only explanation is that the organization's pill shrunk him.
Ha-ha!
Maybe I'll do an experiment too.
An experiment?
I have some of this organization's poison.
If I can get someone else to take it,
I'll see if it's true that it makes people shrink.
But... to whom will you give it?
The man we're supposed to see tomorrow.
The organization wanted me to take him
when we'd closed the deal.
He's the ideal person.
And what do you plan to do, if it's true that they make people shrink?
First, I'm going to kill this man we're supposed to see tomorrow,
and then I'll kill the child!
I've already told you, Baron!
Didn't I make it clear to you?
I have orders to take him to study the effects of the poison!
No one must discover the secret of the organization!
-But... -Enough!
We'll do it my way!
If you don't stop nagging me, they'll find another corpse!
Yes..., all right, you understand...
(Baron) You've already told him where we should meet tomorrow?
Yes, I have communicated with him through the usual channel.
The meeting is at one o'clock.
Now we can sleep for a few hours.
(Thinking) "How fortunate, they both sleep."
"Ecs, he sleeps with his mask on. What a sinister guy."
"I've got to get untied and I've got to run away from here."
"Oh!"
"A bottle of wine."
"I'll bag the bottle with this mat..."
"Oysters! Let's see if they heard that noise."
"I don't think so."
"With the broken glass, I'll cut the rope."
"I've been able to untie myself...
but how will I get out of this room?"
"It's a second floor."
"There's snow on the floor, but it would be dangerous to jump from here."
"I'll have to hide in the refrigerator."
(Dripping)
"Eh? What is it, this noise?"
"Wow, the wine is going somewhere..."
(Adult voice) Eh?
If this is...!
(Baron) What, the child has disappeared?!
Yes!
He wasn't there when I woke up!
He must have jumped over here!
Damn nano!
He must have jumped and the snow must have stopped the blow.
We'll get her though!
What the hell are you doing, Baron?
We've got to find it!
Come on, let's go!
No, Fumiko.
The kid's still here.
-What are you saying?
-He's made him see, he ran away.
It's here, waiting for us to leave.
Ha-ha-ha!
I've got you!
You'll die!
Well, well, I think you're wrong.
You won't be able to leave the house.
When we've done the meeting, I'll come back and the liquid.
Gee, I could see myself on the other side of the street.
I'm sure I would have peeled my hair off,
if I hadn't found this hiding place under the carpet.
March!
I have to find the pills by all means.
Oh dear, I can't find them.
Professor Agasa told me that if I analyzed the composition,
maybe I could find an antidote.
And that's the only hope I have.
He must have taken them all to the meeting.
What's this?
What's this?
Wow!
This journal is full of holes.
They've cut out letters from the diary to make an anonymous message.
Surely it would be a message from your contact!
Of course it was!
That masked guy said he would kill the contact!

Gee, no!
I have to guess where the meeting is being held.
I have to keep them from killing him and I have to find the pills!
If I had to make a sentence with the cut-out characters....
"Y, tel, lo, well, k, a"....
If we combine them, these characters form the word.... Hotel Beika.
The Beika Hotel!
But where?
The Beika is very big!
Is there nothing else they could have used?
No, in this calendar they haven't cut anything.
What?
Cutter marks!
I get it!
Of course you do!
The August numbers!
They've cut out the page above!
The day of August above the 27th of September is...
...the 30th!
Beika Hotel, 30th!
I know where they have the meeting!
(Think) "What do you mean," Hotel Beika, 30"?
"This hotel has 19 floors,
and there is no room number 30."
Number 19?
Just a moment, please.
"Sure!"
"It could be the number of the checkroom stub!"
Excuse me.
Yes?
My father has lost the ticket stub.
He told me it's number 30.
Number 30?
Strange, I know that we have reached number 26.
Hey, kid!
(Thinking) "Gee, where is it?"
"Wow, it's after 12. The meeting is at one o'clock."
Gee, I left my wallet in the car!
-What are you talking about? -Where did we park it?
At number 42. It's got the keys.
I'm sorry, I'll be right back. I'll be right back.
Of course, the parking lot!
(Think) "The car in the square number 30."
"Will they make the meeting the car?"
"There's no one, inside."
Hey!
What are you doing?
What were you doing, in our car?!
Father, this child is a thief!
No.
It's just that it's such a nice car that...
(thinks) "I don't think these people have anything to do with it."
"He shouldn't be here either."
"Wow, what a sturdy man!"
"Eh? What are you looking at?"
"The number of the square."
"Hey! There's a very small 1 written in chalk next to the 30!"
"I've got it. It's 301!"
"It must be the number of the room where they have the meeting!"
"And this man must be what's meeting them!"
"It's the masked man!"
"I've got it right, they will meet here!"
(Dong!)
(Adult voice) That woman!
(Think) "Shit! I'm trapped!"
"Geez, no! If they hit me, the masked man will kill me!"
"What can I do? What can I do? What can I do? What can I do?"
Masao, listen, this door closes automatically.
You just adjust it.
Au, wait for me here.
All right, mother.
See you later.
(Baron) You're late, Fumiko.
Mother, a thief!
Xxxxt!
I'm no thief!
I'm on Earth chasing some bad aliens!
I'm Conan, the space detective!
You're cheating me!
Come on, you're just a kid!
I'm disguised as a child so I won't be recognized.
This profession is perillós.
Teach me what you're really like!
Is that... You're a thief!
Hey, wait!
I'm going to call the police!
(Mother's voice) Quiet, Masao!
Don't call! Mother's voice!
Ha-ha-ha!
I'm from the planet Ranpo!
I change my voice when I feel like it!
How cool!
So it's true, you're a space detective!
(Think) "I've convinced her with the voice transformer."
Hey, couldn't I help you, me?
Of course you could!
But first, I have to make a phone call.
And you have a chewing gum?
Yes, I do.
Why do you want it?
-Yes? -I'll bring them food and wine.
What? -What?
We didn't order anything.
-They ordered it for the phone.
W-What a strange...
Ha-ha-ha!
Anyway, I'm hungry, tell him to leave it.
But...
Shut up!
Tell him to stop!
Okay, okay, come on in.
Yes.
Quick, don't dawdle, boy!
Go away, if you're already!
Ah!
Chewing gum stuck in the lock!
What do you think, Baron, shall we make a toast?
First, I'd like to introduce another guest.
Another guest?
That damn nano is here?
He's not here!
He ran away again!
Ha-ha-ha!
The cart was a diversion.
In fact, now it's inside... the closet!
Now what?!
-Get out! -Of course!
But how did he get in?
He ordered the food,

and while we were talking to the waiter,
he put chewing gum in the lock so that the door wouldn't close.
While we were distracted looking at the cart, he came in.
Ha-ha-ha!
Maybe you thought I wouldn't notice?
(Thinks) "Gee, I'll have to use the tranquilizer in the watch."
"Don't shoot!"
Ah, it's that interesting watch.
I tweaked it when we kidnapped you.
It doesn't fire anymore.
In the other world, regret not respecting me.
You're an amateur detective, Shinitchi Kudo!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Is it a toy?
(laughs)
What?
You still don't get it?
It's me,
the famous mystery novel writer Yusaku Kudo!
Eh?
Father!
So, this woman, she must be...
I'm sorry... Shinichi.
Mother!
To think that I've cheated my own son.
I'd make a good actress, though.
So, this burly man must be...
It's me! Professor Agasa!
Don't be angry, Shinichi, you've made us suffer a lot, too.
Father is right, when we arrived, we couldn't find you anywhere.
And the professor explained to him that I had been made to shrink,
and hatched this elaborate plot, didn't he?!
We wanted to test your private detective skills.
I have to congratulate you, son.
You've made it this far by deciphering the clues we've left you.
Everything went as planned.
You already knew he was hiding in that hole under the kitchen!
Of course you did!
For a professional detective, you could have done better.
Besides, I disguised myself as a character from one of my novels.
I'm sorry I didn't notice!
In fact, I already looked dead.
What are you saying now?
Precisely because of that, why don't you go away from here
and live with us abroad?
He's right, Shinichi.
We wanted to show you that you are very vulnerable now
and it's not good for you to be alone.
I feel exactly the same way, and that's why I helped them do it.
A friend of mine works for Interpol.
I will tell him to look into this organization you are looking for.
And soon we'll have the pills
and we'll find the antidote to get you back to your old self.
I don't want you to take dangerous risks now by playing detective.
No!
Eh?
This case is mine!
I'll solve it myself!
Stay out of it!
Shinichi...
Besides, I have another reason important enough not to leave.
Shinichi!
All right... Anyway, leave it for the time being, Yukiko.
Oh, Yusaku...
But if things get complicated, you'll come with us.
Besides, I think I already know that you don't want to leave Japan.
(Kogoro) What?!
He want to leave here again?!
Yes, he doesn't want to come with us.
He wants to stay here.
Look, this has gone too far.
Here... This is for the child's expenses.
You can take money out of this account whenever you want.
Caram.
10 million yen!
Yes!
We're so excited to have you stay with us!
Don't worry about anything.
Oh, and Ran... Please, my dear, take good care of me.
It seems to me that you are very, very, of you, my son.
Gee... Really, Conan?
Aaa... yes...
(Think) "As you are!"
("Step by step")

DETECTIVE CONAN
What a great time I had.
It was worth it to leave the work half done and sneak in!
Yusaku, will you come out?
Don't worry, one of these days he'll come looking for us crying.
Shall we go around the world?
Oh, I'd like that very much!
-Hey, look at him! -Kudo!
It's him!
It's the editors of the foreign magazines!
How did you find me?
Your son told us!
He still has 308 pages left to finish the novel!
-Come on, he's already screwed you.
-Little-loose.
What happened?!
It's obvious that someone has put a bomb in this room.
A crime of passion?
This knife is...
It was Ryoji!
(Kogoro voice) Oh!
(Kogoro voice) It's you, the murderer!
In the next episode...
The murder of the head of the Hotta family
