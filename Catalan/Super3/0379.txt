THE DARKNESS OF THE SNOWY TERMS, (PART 1)
(Kogoro) Geez, my back is killing me lately.
Our hot springs will make your back as good as new.
How nice!
Oh!
Excuse me, sir, are those tonight's desserts?
I'm so sorry, but that's for another client.
She's crazy about cakes.
I understand she's a very famous writer, I'm told.
Conan, you wanted to eat it, didn't you?
Well...
(laughs)
(laughs) What?
Apa!
Welcome, gentlemen.
We've been expecting you.
You must be cold.
Please, come in.
Oh!
What beautiful kimonos!
And the garden is huge too.
Look at it!
Isn't that Eri Akechi, the romance writer?
Ooooh!
Ooooh!
Oh, what a pain!
The foot!
(All) Ooooh!
(all) Oh... Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me if I'm wrong...
You're the famous detective, Kogoro Mouri?
-You're Mr. Mouri, right?
-Mo... Mouri?
Well... Yes, it's me...
Virgin!
I never imagined
I'd see a famous person like you in a place like this.
My name is Kyoichi Bando, I'm a producer at Nichiuri TV station.
Ah, I see...
Why don't we sit down for a moment and talk?
Oh...
Tell me, why have you gathered here?
We were planning to make a TV series
co-produced by Daigakukan Publishing and Nichiuri Television.
So I've asked Miss Eri Akechi...
to write the story for us.
Look, detective, the story is about 3 young women...
who are trying to make their dream come true.
We interviewed women with very different careers to document ourselves.
I asked Yoriko to gather women who have graduated.
She is Asuka Shibasaki, and she is a model.
She's making a name for herself in the fashion world in Paris and New York.
-Ha-ha-ha!
Beautiful!
-Nice to meet you.
This is Ema Anzai.
She is a painter of oil paintings,
the winner of the new painter's award.
-Ha-ha-ha!
Charming!
-Nice to meet you!
And this one is causing quite a stir in the music world.
The Harumi Fukatsu, singer and songwriter, right?
I'm a big fan of yours!
Eh?
Ah, thank you very much...
Gee, nowadays everything gets famous, even if it only has one song.
-It won't last long.
There's a lot of people who only have one song.
Oh! Oh, it's very, very interesting!
It's very, very interesting!
All 3 of them have unique virtues and they are also beautiful!
(Woman) It's here.
(Woman) Oh!
Here is also a beautiful kimono!
About it..., may I ask you something?
How come there are kimonos hanging on the walls?
We worship the spirit of the kimono as a protective divinity.
You will see them hanging not only in the guesthouse,
but also to mansions and in homes.
The spirit of the kimono...
I am very excited about your new work, Miss Akechi.
No, please, call me "you".
It happens that my mother has the same name and it seems strange to call you Eri....
It is written with different ideograms, but.
Me too.
But if you call me Miss Akechi
you sound like you're talking to a detective.
You make me feel ashamed...
I'm told that the locals worship the spirit of the kimono.
Yes, he is a protective deity, but he also has a dark side.
People call him "the kimono demon."
The kimono demon?
It's a legend that goes back... generations ago.
There was a kind and hard-working young woman in this village.

"One day, the Ohana found a samurai who had slipped....
"And he had taken the wrong leg and helped him."
"As a token of his gratitude,
"the samurai gave him a pile of precious kimonos and obis."
"Envious, the mayor's daughters...
"made all sorts of false accusations against her."
"They arrested the Ohana and the daughters took her kimonos."
"On the night they executed the Ohana,
"The daughters were enjoying the beauty of the kimonos."
"But suddenly the light went out and..."
"When they heard the screams, the people in the house went running,
"But they found the lifeless body of the little daughter
"Lying on top of the kimonos.
"And the sister drowned in a pond amidst a tangle of obis."
When they realized how terrible the Ohana's resentment was,
the villagers built a small temple
and there they venerated her as the deity protector of the village.
Since then, people have venerated her as the "spirit of the kimono."
You must have studied this site in depth.
No, the truth is that I spend a lot of time in this hotel when I write.
Look, isn't that Harumi?
That's right... Harumi!
This tree is called the kimono cherry tree.
It is 500 years old.
When spring comes, its branches are covered with flowers.
It's like a beautiful kimono.
Hey, you know this village well, too?
Do you?
No!
A friend of mine from college had delight for this cherry tree.
She explained this to me a long time ago.
I remembered and came here... to see it.
Hey, listen, Ran... What's this little temple?
Hey, kid!
Don't run.
-It's the temple of the kimono tour.
(Think) "The kimono visitor?"
The spirit of the kimono is also the divinity of revenge.
Revenge?
It's said that if you wear a kimono...
and visit this small temple at midnight,
the spirit of the kimono will fulfill the vengeance
that you are not able to fulfill.
And as an offering for the kimono's visit,
people leave a paper doll.
Look!
There are new ones!
And there are 2 of them, too.
What?
But...!
Someone has come to visit the kimono temple not long ago.
This means that this visitor wants to take revenge on 2 people.
(Kogoro) It must just be a joke.
Ran, child, don't worry, you feel?
Yes.
Excuse me... Is that a temple too?
Heavy.
It must only be a guesthouse!
This is a temple for the spirit of the kimono.
Please don't tell me there are paper dolls in there too!
This is impossible, woman.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
But something is troubling me... Please, Father, go check it out.
What...?
Me, you say?
I don't understand... Why are you so scared?
There are no paper dolls here.
You see, Conan?
Yes, it's true.
There aren't any!
Yes?
What a break!
Unbelievable!
Ooooh!
It's just like the one we saw in the brochure!
(Kogoro) Aiiiiiii.... This is paradise!
Yes, this is paradise.
(Kogoro) Oh!
How beautiful it is!
(All) Cheers!
Girls, thank you very much to all of you...
for having collaborated with us during these 4 days of interviews.
Eri, please make the character I'm modeling for...
be the one that stands out the most, please.
Wow, I'm still not sure what kind of story it's going to be...
Wow, that's why I'm giving you ideas?
Mr. Bando, how would you like it if the Harumi sang...
the mask from the TV series?
Yes!
That's a good idea!
Harumi, please do it.
That's if it's still popular when it's done.
Yes!
It's all great, isn't it, Conan?
(Drunk) Come on!
This jug was already empty...?
How strange!
(thinks) "And a black lamb!"
Ran... Another bottle...
(Thinking) "And a black lamb!" Ran... Another bottle...
Just one more... It'll be the last jug I'll drink.
Please, Ran, please, come on...
Well... no!
Give me this one.
Apa, Conan!
No fair!
Hey... Excuse me, can I come in for a moment?
Go ahead, come in.
Oh!
Hello, Harumi!
I'd like to talk to Mr. Mouri about something.
Hey, Father.
Father!
Yes... What do you want?
"Talk about something?"
Mmmm?
Harumi... Are you the Harumi, you?
(Harumi) This happened 5 years ago.
I was a junior in college.
An illegal drug had become fashionable

and there were lots and lots of students taking.
For some reason, people began to suspect...
that a student was distributing it.
"Even though she denied that she was the dealer,
"They found the drugs in her locker."
"She committed suicide by jumping from the university building."
Suzuka Sakurako said.
I have already told you...
She was a very good person and cherished cherry trees very much.
It is impossible that she was selling drugs.
It simply couldn't be her.
Please, Mr. Mouri!
Could you look into this case again?
Please! Please!
Please!
Aaaah... But it happened 5 years ago...
In fact, there was a rumor going around that said...
it said that the drug dealers were other students.
But those students were from a family... that had a lot of power.
No one could stand up to them on campus...
Some students?
They were Asuka Shibasaki and Ema Anzai.
The Asuka is the daughter of a vice-president of the parliament.
And Ema is the eldest daughter
of the president of the construction firm Anzai Global.
Those 2 girls were often had with her
because Sakurako had a great sense of justice.
-Very well.
Okay, okay, okay!
-Please, Mr. Mouri!
I'll do my best, okay?
Oh, thank you so much!
You must have been very fond of this companion.
I lost my parents when I was very young,
and my uncles raised me.
As Sakurako also lost her parents to a fire,
she was always very kind to me.
Oh!
Now come and take a bath?
Yes.
Have you already bathed, Miss Eri?
Yes.
I had caught a little cold.
So, shall we... have a drink together?
I'm sorry, I still have some work to do.
I still have some work to do.
Bye, see you later!
It's true...
What?
It's booked, look.
Well, what can we do now?
We're closed.
It's half an hour before it's over.
Good thinking.
Shall we play a little ping-pong?
There seems to be quite a lot going on next door...
"What should you do, la Ran?"
Oh, what a start!
It has!
Yes!
You guys have already left?
It is very strange.
No.
No, we haven't gone in yet.
The bathroom was booked.
Well... Ah.
Harumi, doors glasses.
Yes.
I usually wear contact lenses.
I took them out to take a bath.
It's now over 2/4 of 12. He was busy until 11, right?
Yes.
Come on, let's go!
In the girls' toilets!
Eh?
Where are you all going?
What?
Oh.
It's occupied, though.
It's closed... Mmm?
What's that?
There was nothing when we came here before.
It's cold as ice.
How disgusting.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What's that?!
What happened?
"The kimono demon..."
Mr. Kogoro, open this door!
Yes!
I'll open it now!
Ouch!
Oops, it's falling!
Ay, ay, AAAA!
Oh!
Apa, my drunkenness has passed.
Father!
Hey, Conan!
Is anyone inside?
Yes, he's inside, but...
(Harumi: calling)
Asuka!
Asuka!
Asuka!
Are you alright?
My God, he's been stabbed in the chest!
"The demon in the kimono of legend... It can't be!"
Conan!
Where are you going now?
"In the legend they killed 2 sisters."
Eh?
What happened?
The Asuka is...
What's the problem?
Someone has murdered her!
We found Asuka dead in the bathroom.
-What did you say?
-What?
My God...
Where is Ema?
It seems to me that she went there an hour ago...
"Are those Ema's boot prints?"
She's there?
Try not to step on her footprints.
Yes, I know that!
I forget I'm a detective?
"I knew it. It was the demon in the kimono."
She was stabbed in the chest too!
"Outside there were only Ema's footprints."
"In other words, this place was closed off by the surrounding snow."
(Man) Excuse me, sir.
I suppose you are the famous detective Mouri.
(man) Yes, sir!
(Man) Very well.
My name is Ogura and I am the police officer of this town!
-Yes, I have spoken.
-And the prefectural police?
But the roads are not in good condition because of the snow.
"Tomorrow?"
They won't get here until tomorrow.

"We'll have to do the field investigation on our own."
Hey, lady, bring us 10 bath towels, please.
Yes!
Please wait for reception, I'll be right back.
(Kogoro) Go slowly, Mr. Ogura.
Like this, right here.
We must cover the footprints carefully.
Like this, little by little.
"If you go under the overhang of the roof...
"You get to the back door."
"But there's not a single footprint."
"Mmmm? Wait a second."
"What's this?"
"Something doesn't fit."
(Kogoro) Quiet, don't move them!
I don't want the snow to cover the footprints!
Ah, they were all here.
Excuse me, we'd rather sit down than stand up straight.
Have you found anything, Inspector?
Let's see, Yoriko...
You said that Ema passed through this hall about 2/4 of 11.
Yes, that's right.
-No, no one, no.
-Tell me.
Have you seen anyone else?
Now things will be more complicated.
What do you mean by that?
Just a moment.
First of all, around the temple where Ema was killed...
there were no footprints, except for hers.
-So... she committed suicide?
-There's no doubt about it.
No.
We didn't find any kind of weapon there.
No weapon.
Don't say...
And secondly, to go to the baths where Asuka has been murdered,
you have to go through the game room, of course.
We were in the game room after 2/4 of 10,
but we didn't see anyone go through.
Couldn't they have climbed the ravine from the valley?
I've already checked.
There is no trace of suspicious ravine.
So, Asuka was killed before 2/4 of 11?
We found a dagger and a device to stun the bathtub.
It's possible the killer knocked the victim unconscious with the device,
and then... killed her in the open air baths.
The dagger had a mother-of-pearl inlay on the handle.
I asked the owner about it,
and she said it was a votive dagger from the temple.
A votive dagger?
We also found Ema's handkerchief from the open-air baths.
There was blood on that handkerchief.
Blood?
And what else?
I do not understand...
Considering that they have killed all 2 with the same dagger,
we can think that they killed Ema just before Asuka.
And even more: the Ema was alive until 2/4 of 11.
Therefore, theoretically, if Asuka has been killed after this hour....
How did the murderer get into the bathrooms?
And they haven't found any footprints or traces in the temple?
Surely it's not a ghost.
He couldn't do anything like that.
It's the curse!
Yes, it's the curse of the kimono demon!
Oh, please!
Come on, come on!
I've seen them!
I've seen 2 paper dolls just offered
the temple of the kimono's visit!
The curse of the kimono demon has killed Asuka and Ema!
It can't be...
"It's impossible for a curse to have killed them."
"But..., what is the set-up that the killer used?"
It was the kimono's visit!
Sakurako took revenge on them with the kimono visit!
"So that was it?"
Yes, yes!
Of course!
That's why she...
Doors the spring pants!
We'll put them near the fireplace to dry.
Wait for it!
And the next Conan:
"The case of the kimono demon.
"In the darkness of the snowy hot springs, (part 2)"
