(Off) "He's bright as a spark and has a precise wit.
"Today, the Junior Detective League is going to the colonies.
"The Ayumi and Genta are missing.
He has the brain of an adult and is... Detective Conan!"

The Disappearance of the Junior Detective League
(Kogoro) "Continuous looting in rural villas"?
"Caretakers and guests are the victims."
This is appalling.
But then again, they haven't had a head at all, when it comes to committing the robberies.
Maybe it's that a famous detective like me appears...
Father, you are incorrigible.
By the way, I don't see Conan, he hasn't come home yet?
Apa!
If he has gone to summer camp.
To the children's dramatic association.
The association of what?
Yes, they must prepare a puppet play.
A puppet play?
Have you ever been to a summer camp?
(Off) "I was going to a chalet on the Kiroge-oka plateau.
He will stay a few days to rehearse with the other children."
So, those from the Junior Detective League must be with him.
But I don't know if it's a good idea.
Why?
Because of the raids on the chalets.
That's what it says in the paper.
Don't worry, daughter!
They will be somewhere else!
(Off) "But the Kirige-oka plateau is famous
because at night a very thick fog rises.
If the children were to get lost..."
(Kogoro) In ten take care of some older person.
"Yes. A young man from the third district, in Kaibu.
When he was a student he did puppet plays..."
and he'll direct the script and the staging of the play they'll do.
What a nerve you have, father.
(Genta) Let's see... "I don't understand, someone else has disappeared."
(Genta) Wait a minute!
But Genta, you didn't put any sentiment in the sentence.
-Oh, really?
What do you mean? -Yes, Genta, go back to him!
"I don't understand... someone else has disappeared!"
(Mitsuhiko) Well, next, Ayumi.
Yes, this... "Gee, but what will happen now?"
Just think about the play, about Mitsuhiko....
Next.
Now you, Conan, please.
Ah, yes... yes...
"I'm sure, one of us is the perpetrator of the murders."
(Think) "A high school student at a puppet show.
"I wish I hadn't come, like Haibara.
(Imitates Haibara) "These things don't interest me.
Coi.
Your character makes me envious..."
Not like that, Conan!
You play a detective, you have to impose more, man,
you have to look more dignified, right, Professor Kaibu?
Don't call me Professor, Mitsuhiko.
This is also the first play I've performed.
But Conan's performance...
Actually, you're right.
Conan, let's try again.
Yes.
"I'm sure, one of us is the author of the murders!"
Mm... He doesn't coordinate with the puppet's movements.
He's a pain in the ass.
A in Mitsuhiko's temper has gone up.
Mr. Kaibu lives near en Mitsuhiko and they like each other.
He made this story with Mitsuhiko's help.
But this sounds very familiar.
This is "The Ten Little Indians".
It's modeled on a work by Agatha Christie, "The Queen of Mystery."
People invited to an island disappear and are murdered.
I don't care, I'm very hungry.
Genta, you never listen.
All right, children.
We'll leave it here, okay?
We'll come back after lunch.
(All) Yes!
-Leave the puppets in place. (All) Yes!
(Genta) Viva!
Lunch!
Eels with rice!
How good!
On Genta and the eels.
You've done very well, Conan!
Do not exaggerate.
Excuse me, I'll pass.
Mm... Guys, we still have a lot of room for improvement.
We need to do extra rehearsals!
Extra rehearsals, yes, sir!
What a drag...
(Ayumi) What a fog!
That's nothing.
No wonder they call it Kirige-oka, the foggy plateau.

Ah, what a feast, what a feast!
I can't take it anymore!
I can't move!
Guys!
We'll rest for half an hour and then we'll rehearse again!
Back to rehearsal?!
Mitsuhiko!
Come on, let it go!
Genta, did you know that I've already prepared dinner?!
Yes ?!
I'll do it!
I'll do it!
Of course I will!
(Everybody laughs)
Guys, haven't you seen the teacher?
Why do you say so?
It's just that it's very strange.
Suddenly he has disappeared.
And it's rehearsal time.
Now that you mention it, the kids from the third district aren't here either.
-Where should they be? -Where should they be? -That's not going well.
Listen, guys, you haven't seen them?
Ah... I thought so.
These children's puppets are gone.
That's right.
And the teacher's either!
(Thinking) Ep, alert, this is very well how...
I'm sure the kids from the third district have taken them.
-Endur-les?
Where? -Maybe they've gone home.
At this hour?
In the middle of this thick fog?
There's someone outside!
(He thinks) "It's no use! I can't see anything, with the fog!
The thing is clear!
It's obvious that there was someone here."
Those children have also disappeared!
(Genta) The... the puppets have also disappeared!
In this box there are only ours left!
(Thinking) Damn... What a bad joke.
This is exactly like "The Ten Little Indians"!
This means that the story from which this puppet show comes...
Yes.
In the novel on which the play is based,
there are as many figures as characters.
The murderer, every time he murders a person,
makes one of the figures disappear.
Every time they murdered one?
Don't talk nonsense!
So, the children who have disappeared are all...?
No, they can't be.
Go back to your session!
It is not safe! (A door creaks and closes)
The back door!
It's foggy here too...
Look, guys!
Those are the footprints of those children.
There's another set of adult footprints.
-Whose are they? -The man at the window.
No.
They're footprints of a different size and shoe size.
But what's going on here?
The villa manager told us we'd be the only ones around here.
This means...
I don't understand anything.
But in this chalet in the middle of the fog, something's going on.
Something's going on.
I've got it!
What's that?
What's gotten into you, Mitsuhiko?
Maybe it's that guy who ransacks the chalets!
He's looting villas?!
What's on the news?
Yes, right!
There's no doubt about it!
Surely that evil guy must want to raid the villas in the area
while he locks us up somewhere!
Ah, right...
Very well!
The Junior Detective League will catch this thief!
Agreed?
I agree!
The Junior Detective League will get going!
Good idea!
Let's do it, guys!
What's wrong, Conan?
Eh?!
Ah... It's all right.
(thinks) "If it was the villa raider,
they would give him so much, the children.
"Why did he take the puppets?
There are many things I don't understand!"
Of it, we'd better call the police anyway.
The Junior Detective League will act later.
Besides, it's not too late to call them.
What's the matter, Conan?
Aren't they on?
No.
The phone doesn't make any signal.
This means that we are well isolated, with this fog.
What are we going to do, Conan?
There must be someone in the manager's office at the bottom of the hill.
You want to go? Yes.
I could have sworn there were flashlights or candles for emergencies.
Yes.
When we got there and checked the emergency exits, there were.
They weren't there?
No, someone must have taken them.
Someone?
But who did it?
Who do you want it to be?
The thief who loots villas.
(Thinking) No, it's still too early to say...
But with this fog, we'll get lost going to the nearest villa.
For the time being we'll look for clues in this very chalet.
(Think) We can't expect to find much, but...
Come on, let's go, Conan!
Ayumi, stay with Genta down here...
(Thinks) What a remedy.
Genta!
You keep an eye on Ayumi!
-Yeah, sure! -Keep a close eye on her, Conan, Mitsuhiko...
Trust us.
This is our room and Kaibu's room.
Let's go in.

What is this?
Wow!
It's a map of the region!
There is a cross marked on the chalets in the area.
What does it mean, this map?
What is this?
What... what is this? This is...
No, it can't be!
Professor Kaibu is...
(Screams)
Genta! Ayumi!
Genta!
Ayumi!
Where do I get paid?!
Ah!
That damn... What do you mean, Conan?
No!
It can't be...
In the end, we're the only ones left.
Now I get it!
I understand everything!
He proposed that we come to rehearse more seriously the play
in this Kirige-Oka's chalet because he wanted to raid it!
Professor Kaibu is the villa raider!
That toolbox is the proof.
He cheated us!
This is unforgivable!
Wait, Mitsuhiko.
The puppets are missing too.
We can't take it for granted that he wants to loot the villa.
There's too much going on.
He's the only one who could take the puppets without making a mistake.
Yes, that's true, but...
Now we can only go look at Genta and Ayumi.
You are right!
Then we'll catch the kidnapper!
With our own hands!
The chalet next door was in this direction, right?
Yes.
And that one?
For another villa, it's too close.
Let's take a look.
Eh?!
The boys!
Let's run away!
It was... it was true, it's him...
Eh?
Where are the kids?
Let's go in, hurry!
There's nobody...
No one here either.
I'm going upstairs! Conan!
Stay here!
A... hurry, please.
(Opens a door)
(Mitsuhiko) Conan!
I'm coming!
(Thinking) What's this?!
(Mitsuhiko) Conan!
What the fuck is it?!
What the fuck is he doing?!
Conan!
Conaaan!
Run away, Mitsuhiko!
(Cries) Conan.
Conan...
It can't be.
Conan too...
(Man) Ow... "And then you were the last one left."
don't you remember, Mitsuhiko?
It can't be!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Please help me!
Sisplaaaau!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
Help meeeeeeeee!
Help me!
(Man) It's useless to try to run away, Mitsuhiko!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Au, you're coming with me, Mitsuhiko!
Don't come near me!
Don't come near me!
It's no good, being selfish, Mitsuhiko.
Come on.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Hurry up! (Genta) It will fall!
It will fall!
(Ayumi) Aw, help-lo, help-lo, help-lo, help-lo, help-lo!
Oh, wow.
Thanks, guys.
Conan... You guys...
(Mitsuhiko) So, this was...
I'm sorry, Mitsuhiko.
We were doing an extraordinary rehearsal.
They came one by one in the house separated from the villa.
What a face.
We didn't know anything!
Forgive me, I forgot to tell the four of you.
Why were they, the pliers and screwdrivers in the room?
Ah.
I was thinking of setting up a theater for the puppets.
I wanted you to find yourselves in the situation, as if I were in their performance.
So what was it, then, that map?
Naturally, I had it with me so we wouldn't get lost.
It's very foggy in this area.
So this was it?
The puppets that had disappeared, they had taken them to rehearse.
We really scared you, didn't we, Mitsuhiko?
Oops.
You were scared to death too, Genta.
Eh?!
I wasn't scared.
But when we were doing pronunciation practice exercises,
to think that we were related...
It's true, it seemed so.
Oi, Conan?
Forgive me, Mitsuhiko.
Even I lost my temper.
At that moment...
Run away, Mitsuhiko!
Run away!
Easy, Conan.
Guys... I was rehearsing?
We're just missing Mitsuhiko.
Come, join us in the rehearsal.
(Genta) Just a moment!
That heavy has been playing us on the selvage all day, we scared him off.
Come on, guys, don't make him suffer.
But maybe we can use him to rehearse the play!
(Thinking) Au... What's on their minds, these guys?
No, it can't be.
You too, Ayumi?
No way!
Mr. Kaibu, why did you cut the phone line?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Didn't you do it, Professor?
If you didn't do it, who could have done something like that?
(Shouting)
Mitsuhiko!
Let's go, let's go!

(Children) Mitsuhikoooo!
Are you, are you the thief of the chalets?
Help!
Mitsuhikooooo!
Help meeee!
Mi... Mitsuhiko! Conan!
Guys!
Guys!
So, the phone and the lanterns... Who did it?
Yes, this thief is the real author of the looting of the villas.
Don't come closer!
So much is given to you, what happens to you?!
It's all the same, whatever happens to me, take it!
My... Mitsuhiko!
Shut up, brat!
If you don't ca...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Demon child!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
-Cójala el!
(All) Yes!
-We made it! -You've gone too far! -You've gone too far!
(Think) Too dangerous...
I'm saved.
Conan, close your eyes for a moment.
Keep them tightly closed, okay?
Mitsuhiko, I'm sorry about before.
You are very brave!
-Eeeeh?
Hurray, I'm happy! Poor Mitsuhiko.
My... Mitsuhiko!
I won't forgive you, you feel me?!
Come on, don't hurt me, friend Genta.

DETECTIVE CONAN
(Off) "After 3 days, we performed the puppet play.
The result, as expected, a great success!"
The spider mansion....
From the Karakuri Gorge?
(Think) "A thumbtack.
The head is rusty, but the nail is new".
Father told us not to leave the room.
Kogoro, wake up, please!
The Ran is in danger!
In the next chapter...
The monster of the spider mansion
