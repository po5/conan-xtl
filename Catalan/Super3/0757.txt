(Think) "What a rage!"
Look at him!
The little boy with the glasses.
Have you already been caught doing something naughty?
It's not what you think, Mr. Mouri.
He came to take me a wallet he found in the street.
Is that so?
Understood.
And you, who didn't go to the arcade?
I overslept a bit and they took the good machines.
They are... two quarters of 12.
And you say you only fell asleep a little?
-Ah!
Excuse me.
-Insolent!
Alza!
Isn't it...?
Wait a minute, aren't you the comedian who...?
Yes, Rokusuke Dodompa.
Ah, yes.
In Dodompa, the humorist liar.
I swear it's true.
Ah!
At Dodompa... in Dodompa he never lies.
How can I help you?
Tell me.
I come from the artists' agency that represents me,
which is right here, at the end of the street.
I have come to confess... that I have died... I have killed the director of the agency!
-What?
-What?
"The lines of the hand are wicks,
the line of the heart lights the fire of deduction."
"The murderous humorist wins public opinion."
"What does laughter hide? The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The humorist who confessed (part one)"
Mm?
(Chiba) Inspector Megure.
I've asked the doorman, Mr. Ueki,
to let us have a spare room.
He will do us a great favor.
We've been short-handed at headquarters lately.
I agree.
Now he'll explain to me what happened.
You can go now.
I'm staying too.
Why should you?
I can be of great use to you sooner or later, Inspector.
You're a world-famous detective.
It seems to me that you have too much time on your hands...
Rokusuke Dodompa's real name is Rokusuke Tanigaki.
He lives in Akebono Ward 3.
And the victim in question, Hideki Tendo..,
was the director of an artists' agency
and lived in an apartment on the same street,
where he also had an office.
It is seen that Mr. Dodompa was the only artist he represented.
He was my partner and representative, we worked together from day one.
He was a very important person for me.
And you have come to plead guilty
for the murder of this very important person?
Yes.
This week I have dedicated myself to preparing a new show
and today I had arranged to meet him at mid-morning to introduce myself to him.
I arrived at his office at... at about 10 minutes past 11.

Hop!
I swear it's true.
In Dodompa... in Dodompa never lies.
Your shows are worthless, they're superficial.
What... what do you mean by that?
You can't even say "art" about what you do.
You have no idea.
The public demands that.
We had different points of view about my style and we argued.
It got on my nerves.
I picked up a baseball bat I found,
"...I lifted it up and..."
Hideki...
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
It seems to me that your regret is sincere.
I don't think it's a false confession.
(Man) Where is it?
Is it in here?
But...
Is it true that in Rokusuke Dodompa has killed his manager
and turned himself in to the police?
(Man) Get out of here.
You can't go in.
The investigation has just begun, we can't make any statements.
(Man) Go, please!
What, let's go home?
This is solved, let's not waste time.
But if the victim was so important to him,
I don't understand why he died in such a brutal way,
no matter how angry he was.

That is exactly what I wanted to ask you, Mr. Dodompa.
Look for evidence to confirm it.
What?
Yes, sir!
Of it... Shall we stay until they confirm their version?
Maybe after that you'll need the services of a great detective.
Of course we will.
(Takagi) He left Beika Station at 11 o'clock.
(Chiba) From the station to the crime scene it's about a 10 minute walk,
so he must have arrived at the office around 11:10.
Soon after, they had an argument and he killed her.
When he entered the Beika police station and handed himself in
it was half past five at 12 o'clock, so....
With God, then, it seems that the times match.
Yes.
I'll talk to some of his fellow artists.
I'll ask them if the suspect had any problems with the victim.
"Okay, go ahead."
In the meantime, I'll go check on the autopsy.
Okay. (chuckles)
Okay, thank you.
The scientist.
They've confirmed that the blood
and the hair they found on the metal bat
match the victim's DNA to Hideki Tendo.
In addition, they also found this man's fingerprints on the bat.
This proves that it is the murder weapon.
Of course.
I have already told you, I, that he was killed with a pair of blows.
Therefore, Mr. Dodompa had reason...
to resent Mr. Tendo...
Of course I resented him!
He had received an offer
to collaborate regularly with a television network
and he turned it down without consulting me
because he didn't like the program!
So, since then, we could say...
you and Mr. Tendo had some disagreements, didn't you?
Yes, I guess that's why I got that way.
Otherwise, it would never have occurred to me to attack him with the bat.
Now that we know the details, I think it's clear.
Maybe you're right.
I would say that there is no doubt.
"Hiding something..."
What happened, Mr. Ueki?
What happened, Mr. Ueki?
(Ueki) When I swept the back entrance this morning,
this wasn't there.
An iron bar?
I'm sure it was.
It's like the ones used on construction sites.
Who must have taken it, all the way here?
What time did he go out to clean up this morning?
"In Takagi?"
Yes.
Mmm... Really? What's the problem, Inspector?
What's the problem, Inspector?
The murder weapon.
Turns out it's not the metal bat.
(Kogoro) What do you mean, it's not?
During the autopsy, it turned out...
that the wound opening on the victim's head...
does not match the shape of the bat in question.
The murder weapon must be a blunt, cylindrical object, but...
Takagi, can you come here for a moment?
Understood.
Congratulations, Conan.
Yes.
So, it was the bar?
And not just the shape.
The cement remnants we found embedded in Mr. Tendo's head
are also seen to match
with the cement that was in the iron bar.
In addition, the analysis of the iron bar...
has revealed traces of the victim's blood.
Therefore, the iron bar that has appeared at the back door...
is the real murder weapon of Mr. Tendo.
How strange!
And what does the metal bat have to do with this story?
I don't know.
If it's not the murder weapon,
I don't quite understand why Mr. Tendo's hair and traces of blood
and traces of Mr. Tendo's blood.
Please explain yourself, Mr. Dodompa.
Look, I... T-the thing is...
Soc guilty anyway1
I killed her with my own hands.
It's me.
I'm the killer you're looking for.
Looks like it's finally getting interesting.
"I don't understand."
"Why are you so insistent on pleading guilty
to plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit?"
"Maybe he knows the real killer and he wants to protect."
Mr. Ueki,
Inspector Megure asked me to come here.
He wants to know if anyone came in or out this morning
at the same time Mr. Dodompa arrived.
It would be around 11 o'clock, wouldn't it?
I would say no.
There's not a lot of movement of people on holidays.
I'm sure I would remember.
"So, Mr. Dodompa didn't get to see the killer."
In fact, this morning I only saw Mr. and Mrs. Mori leaving this morning,
who were going on a trip,
and Mr. Tendo, who went to buy breakfast.
Could you tell me what time it was?

When Mr. Tendo went out to buy breakfast,
did he check what time it was?
It was 07:58.
Is there a problem with the time?
He asked you to heat up his food.
Do you remember what it was?
Let's see...
Yes, look.
It was a hamburger.
-Of course.
-Did you add hot water to the noodles? -You did?
Mr. Tendo always prepares the noodles before he leaves.
Okay, thank you very much.
What is it now?
What's new?
What's new?
Let's see, Mr. Dodompa.
Where were you and what were you doing today at 9 o'clock in the morning?
For reference.
At 9 o'clock?
Why do you want to know?
Mmm..., well... Ah, yes.
At 9 o'clock in the morning I went to see Mrs. Suda
at her paint shop.
At 9 o'clock?
That can't be right.
Yes, it's just as you felt.
The autopsy has revealed
that, due to the state of digestion of the food in his stomach,
Mr. Tendo died
about an hour after he had eaten breakfast.
He had eaten a hamburger and instant noodles.
He had bought it at the store next door a little before 8 o'clock.
Taking into account that he had the hamburger heated up
and prepared the noodles before leaving the store, he must have had breakfast right away,
he must have had breakfast right away.
Yes.
Indeed, Mr. Tendo ate the hamburger...
and the noodles at around 8:00 a.m.
How can that be?
If she died within an hour after breakfast!
That's right.
Mr. Dodompa.
This proves that she didn't die after 11 o'clock,
but around 9 o'clock, two hours before...
of the time you claim to have committed the murder.
But at 9 o'clock, Mr. Dodompa...
Who is this Mrs. Suda that you went to see?
We'll find out eventually, even if she won't tell us.
She's a painter who lives near my house in the Akebono neighborhood.
Takagi, meet her in Chiba and go together.
Yes.
In the end they didn't need it.
Mrs. Suda.
What is it?
(Woman) Yes.
(Woman) Ah...
(Woman) Mm?
Who are they and what do they want?
Well, I see you were asleep.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I met him about six months ago.
He told me he was a comedian, but I didn't know him at all.
How was I supposed to know if I don't have a TV, radio or cell phone?
You see, I live very isolated from the world.
We would like to know if it is true
that Mr. Dodompa came to see you this morning.
Yes, it's true.
He came to return some collections of paintings
that he asked me to get ideas for his new show.
Last night he called me to tell me that he would come today at 9:00,
and he came.
Are you sure it was 9:00 a.m.?
Yes.
I looked at the clock.
I'm sure it was.
I brought her books and her favorite cake for breakfast.
Oh, boy.
Come to think of it, maybe I got the time mixed up...
You're what?
On the contrary, you're very punctual.
Please come in.
Yes, Dodompa came at 9 o'clock.
(Chiba) It's impossible.
Mr. Tendo can't have died.
(Chiba) You are right.
Mrs. Suda's wall clock is on the hour,
and it's more than an hour's drive to the crime scene.
He has a solid alibi.
I wish it had been me, the murderer.
What do you mean by this?
That you know the culprit and you've decided to incriminate yourself
to protect him and keep us from finding out?
Oh, no.
No, that's not it.
Mm?
What does it mean, then?
What I wanted to protect...
What I wanted to protect... is Mr. Tendo's honor.
What do you mean?
Honor?
Mr. Tendo was my benefactor
and I owe him everything I am now.
But... he also had a dark side.
Well, in any case, think for yourself and decide what suits you best.
He knew the weak points of people in the show business world
and took advantage of them to blackmail them.
Blackmail?
What?
Today, when I arrived at his office at 11 o'clock after 11 o'clock,
I found Mr. Tendo dead, lying on the floor.
He must have died a victim of your blackmail.
I can't think of any other reason.
"That's why I couldn't tell them the truth from the beginning,
"Because, when they started investigating,
"all his shenanigans, of which there are many, would come to light."
"And I couldn't allow that."
"So I decided to tell them

that I had killed her myself after a fierce argument."
"I saw that she had been killed by a blow to the head..."
But I couldn't find the murder weapon anywhere.
I picked up the bat to make it look like it was the murder weapon
and leave my fingerprints.
And then I turned myself in to the police station.
I apologize... for the inconvenience I caused.
Do you know who he was blackmailing, Mr. Tendo, and in exchange for what?
I don't know.
I really have no idea.
I know I just wanted to save Mr. Tendo's reputation,
but this tainting a crime scene should never be done.
He's right.
It's a crime.
Wow!
That's too bad!
It's true.
However, our priority now is to get the facts straight.
When we have solved the case,
we will come back to you and take appropriate action.
What?
But... but...
For now, you can go.
We understand why you did that.
You'll have to leave us your phone number.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to have caused so much inconvenience.
Come on, guys.
Come on, it was nothing.
If it wasn't him, who was it?
Who is this man's killer?
The main suspects are the victims of his blackmail,
as Mr. Dodompa pointed out.
Yes, sir.
Yes, investigate this new lead.
As it turned out, they didn't need a detective.
There is one thing I don't understand.
How is it that the real killer
took the iron bar from the crime scene?
There would be prints.
Sus.
So, he would have taken the murder weapon into his house...
instead of leaving it by the front door, right?
Yes.
That's lucky, isn't it?
So the doorman could find him right away.
"He took the murder weapon from the crime scene."
"But then he left it at the back door of the same building."
"He didn't even try to hide it."
(Elevator: acoustic signal)
(Enraonadissa: from afar)
It has waited out here until now, the press?
Mr. Dodompa is cornered.
Gentlemen, I want to apologize publicly.
In order to protect the honor of Hideki Tendo,
the man to whom I owe everything I am now,
I have impersonated the person who killed her.
-That's why I turned myself in to the police.
- (people: exclamations of surprise)
I apologize from the bottom of my heart.
I hope you can forgive me.
The whole country has taken your side, Mr. Dodompa.
Everybody understands.
(Dodompa) I thank you for your words.
Take him to the network.
Listen, one question, please.
How did you know that Mr. Dodompa had turned himself in to the police?
Eh?
Ah, yes.
It's just that we received a leak.
Through an anonymous call.
"Who could have leaked the news? We just knew..."
I have come to confess that I have died...
I've died, the director of the agency.
What?
"There is no way it could have been the agent on duty,
nor Mr. Mouri or me."
"There is only..."
"Perhaps his real objective
"Is not to plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit,
but to make everyone think that he has done it."
(Music: cover the voice)
"Besides, at the time Mr. Tendo was murdered,
he went to see Mrs. Suda."
"And last night he told her on the phone
that he would come at 9:00 a.m."
"At the exact time the crime was committed."
"Nine o'clock in the morning."
"It's too perfect to be a coincidence."

Mr. Mouri also wants to know
if he has found out where the gun came from.
We found out that there is a construction site near Beika Station.
It seems that the killer took the iron bar from there.

That you received a call from the culprit?
I came to ask if they've found out anything else.
If not, Mr. Tendo won't be able to rest in peace.
