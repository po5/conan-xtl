The water that flows has no form.
The wind that blows is unseen.
Parents and children do not always look alike, Ran is an example.
The truth always ends up knowing!
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and is Detective Conan!

THE INVISIBLE WEAPON!
THE FIRST CASE OF THE RAN
(Sonoko) It's so hot!
The Akasaka Princess is a good hotel, but the little climb...
Oh, yes!
I wish I could change and go to the pool head first!
I swear I'll get a guy to look at me today.
Don't get involved, eh? Yes, woman, help yourself.
By the way, Ran, have you heard anything more from Shinichi?
Have you?
No, not a word.
Maybe he's got a new case.
I don't know what he sees, investigating one case after another.
(Wheels: squeaking)
Have you seen this car? Yes.
It gives me a bad feeling.
Watch it!
Excuse me!
Are you hurt?
No, we're fine.
Just a hair's breadth.
(Sonoko) So she's a teacher at a floral design school.
Yes... I go back and forth to Shizuoka 5 days a week.
From Shizuoka?
It's far away, that!
Not that far.
In fact, I was leaving this morning,
when I remembered it's a holiday and saved myself from making the trip.
So I called my husband,
who works for an insurance company,
and we arranged to meet here for lunch together.
That's great!
I feel terrible.
Suddenly I got dizzy and lost consciousness for a moment.
I've had a headache and dizziness for a few days now.
Oh, really? Are you sick, madam?
No, the doctor couldn't find anything.
It must be the weather that affects me, it's hot and it's cold?
It must also have something to do with the fatigue of coming and going every day.
The proof is that on days when it's cool or when I'm not working, I feel fine.
I look like someone else.
Another person?
(Boy) Chie!
(Boy) Hey!
Hello!
Girls, this is my husband, Akio Yoshino.
Ah, hello.
May I introduce Ran Mouri and Sonoko Suzuki...
I had another dizzy spell and almost ran them over, poor things.
Another...?
Did you guys get sick?
No, we are fine!
But it's been a little too short.
Your mistress insisted on inviting us.
Well...
I'm... I'm very sorry.
How about you?
How are you feeling, Chie?
I'm fine now.
I needed some rest.
Phew... What a rest.
He's attentive, huh? Hm.
Ah... Excuse me, we're moving on.
-You're right, you were going to the pool. -See you again.
Where do you live?
We live in Beika.
Look, it's near us!
We are at Haido.
We live next to the park.
Spend a day!
Thank you! Thank you!
A step?
Thank you very much.
-Ah!
-Oops!
What's this?
Hey, Ran, be careful, there's a step here!
Thank you, Ran.
And so?
Don't you find it strange?
He what?
He knew he'd had a dizzy spell;
why didn't you tell him about the step, then?
He could have hurt himself, if he fell!
It wouldn't be such a high step.
You mean you're not exaggerating a little?
But Sonoko told me "watch out".
And he would have done it too.
Who is he?
Who are you talking about?
No one, it doesn't matter.
The point is that this couple scolds me.
I'll pay a visit to Mrs. Chie.
And what will you tell her?
Nothing.
I just want to know why she has so many dizziness and headaches.
You're not a doctor, don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong, daughter!
I want to know and I'll try to find out.
Do what you want, sweetheart.
That's what I'll do!
(Thinking) "Eh? What's the matter with her? I've never seen her so determined..."
"But she's right... There's something wrong."
Hey, can I come with you, Ran? Do you want to go with me?
No problem.
I'll tell Sonoko and the three of us will go!
You go yourselves.

And my rice, where is it?
Yourself!
What?
What a mug!
(Sonoko) Wow, it's awesome!
It's beautiful!
And what a garden full of flowers!
You have a dream house, Mrs. Chie.
Thank you so much!
It's brand new, we've only been living here for a month and a half.
I thought it was brand new.
How I wish I had a house like this!
Surely you wouldn't like to have a mortgage of 40 million.
We both have to work, otherwise there would be no way to pay.
It has, nois.
Thank you.
I'm sorry to come and bother you on a holiday.
Don't let me know!
It's a pity that my husband is out.
It seems very nice, your man!
Yes, he is.
But he also likes cars,
and lately he complains that he can't go out driving as much as he'd like.
That's why he goes for a walk every morning, to distract himself.
And while he's out, I make breakfast.
Like this every day.
I... Mrs. Chie, I don't mean to butt in where I'm not wanted..,
but how come you work so far away?
To pay the mortgage.
Before I bought this wonderful house,
I taught school here,
but my husband found me a management job in Shizuoka.
I get paid much better there.
Almost double.
Yes, I understand...
But it must be very tiring, driving there every day.
Of course it is!
If I could go by train, I could take advantage of it to sleep.
In fact, I like to drive too.
And the entrance to the highway is not very far.
As I'm loaded with material, going by car is a help.
Of course it is.
By the way, do you already have insurance?
Oh, what am I saying!
-But I'm still going to school. -Huh?
What do you mean?
I'm sorry.
It's just that as my husband is an insurance agent,
I encourage people to get one.
It helps your husband, doesn't it?
Yes, well... Although the effort has to start with yourself.
That's why not long ago I raised the insurance to 100 million.
Eh?
100 million, you said?!? Eh?
It was my husband's idea...
We paid a lot,
but it's one of those that, after a certain period of time,
you get all the money back, even if you decide to cancel it.
-Besides, it looked good with the company. It's very, very much your husband's, isn't it?
Is it?
Why do you say that?
(laughs)
(thinks) "100 million? I guess... No way."
Ma'am, and these dizzy spells that you explained you get,
when did you start having them?
I don't know, maybe about a month ago.
(She thinks) "A month... 15 days after the house was built".
That's what they call the "sick building syndrome".
Eh?
What? The sick building, you say?
The sick building, you say?
What do you mean?
Who do you say is sick?
The sick building syndrome.
That's what they call the disorders
caused by the gas released by some types of wood and paint used in the construction of houses!
used in the construction of houses!
I'm sure you've heard of formaldehyde.
Lately, there has been a lot of talk about it.
I've heard of it!
Of course I've heard about it!
I don't know... I don't think that's it.
Why not?
So that the builder who made the house is a friend of my husband.
Surely he himself made sure
that no toxic materials were used in the construction.
But... but it is worth to have it analyzed, don't you think?
Maybe he cheated them, this man?
Sonoko, do you know any specialized center
detect pollutants from building materials?
My father in ten know any, we could ask him.
I'll ask him.
Then we'll ask him!
Mrs. Chie, you'd better have it analyzed, so you'll have peace of mind.
Yes... All right, then.
Ran, what's gotten into you in there?
Why did you insist so much that I have the house tested?
Uh... Because I did.
Ran's afraid that the husband is poisoning her
to collect the insurance money,
which, as she said, is exactly 100 million.
What?
Ran, is it true?
Mm.
Explain yourself right now!
Listen to me carefully.
First of all, the Akio talks to the builder...
to make the house out of hazardous materials
because she's starting to feel sick.
Then, he proposes to take the job in Shizuoka...
on the pretext that he gets paid twice as much.
He continues.

Mrs. Chie, she listens to him and every day in Shizuoka to work.
"Imagine her getting motion sickness while she's in the car."
Aw, shut up, woman!
You have too much imagination.
Besides, how come Akio doesn't feel sick?
He's very curious, isn't he?
He also lives in the house?
What if the contaminating material
was only put in her bedroom and in the kitchen?
Of course, at the moment we have no proof.
But as long as there's a chance,
it's worth checking.
Already.
(Thinking) "It's still too early to tell if the Ran is right, but....
"There's something that doesn't fit."
"I'd put my hands in the fire."
(Man) With this device we measure formaldehyde.
In some houses,
there are not the same materials in all the rooms.
That's why we always recommend to check all of them.
All right, well, see for yourselves.
All right, then.
Let's get started.
At first, when Chie told me about it, I didn't quite understand.
But who's to say that the builder doesn't use hazardous materials?
It's worth checking it out and we can rest assured.
Thank you very much for telling my wife about it.
(At the same time) Eh... Yes... Isn't that right?
Well, then, I'm going for a walk.
Buy some cake, the kind you like, right?
-Good idea.
So far.
Look how you like to walk!
I'm going too!
Eh... All right, but don't dawdle, eh?
No!
Have you decided to buy it, finally?
Yes, sir!
For months, he'd come to look at it every day...
(Thinking) "Eh?! 25 million yen?! That's nothing!"
(Technical) We already have the results!
The gas levels recorded in the rooms
are far lower than the 0.08 parts per million
set by the Ministry of Health as the limit.
Oh...!
Are you sure?
This means...
It means that this house is 100% safe!
What a break, my love!
It wasn't the "sick building syndrome" that made me dizzy.
It's probably fatigue.
-Today we'll go to sleep for an hour.
(Thinking) "I don't get it. Then what's wrong?"
I told you!
Here's what happens when an amateur wants to do the work of a professional!
You're right, Father.
Maybe it was all my imagination.
I hope you didn't tell them that you are the daughter of the great Kogoro Mouri, did you?
It would be bad for my reputation.
No.
Of course it wouldn't.
Thank goodness.
Let's see if this teaches you not to meddle in other people's lives.
What's that?
Yes, father.
(Thinking) "I guess I can't... be like him anymore."
Conan!
I don't think you're wrong, Ran.
I'd say you're right.
I followed Mrs. Chie's husband...
and felt what the salesmen at the car dealership were saying.
Akio wants to buy a sports car worth 25 million yen!
25 million yen!
And where will he get the money from?
Mrs. Chie's insurance!
Then it's clear, he plans to kill her!
Hm.
He'd collect the mortgage and still have 75 million yen left.
But the technicians said the air in the house was normal...
What if he poisons the food?
Of course, the food!
No, it can't be that, because Mrs. Chie cooks.
You're right, you're right.
What do you think?
How do you plan to do it?
While I'm wasting my time looking at pictures,
she could be in great danger!
Shinichi, tell me what I can do!
(Think) "Something's wrong."
"Ever since the Ran told me that I keep thinking about it."
"But what is it?"
"Wait. I could have sworn that Mrs. Chie said..."
"Sure! Now it fits!"
Let me repeat what Mrs. Chie told me?
Yes!
Why did she tell you that she gets dizzy?
Do you remember?
Mm... If I'm not mistaken...
It must be the weather, which affects me, it's hot and it's cold...
I guess it also has to do with the tiredness of coming and going every day.
On days when it's cool or when I'm not working, I feel pretty good.
I look like a different person.
This is what he told me.
You see?
If there was nothing in the house,
he'd feel worse on holidays than on days he works.
So we have to rule out anything like that.
Yes, you're right, Conan.
I think whatever is causing her headache and dizziness is not in the house.
Then where is it?

Maybe... at the school in Shizuoka?
Or somewhere between home and school.
Maybe it's that...!
(Akio) I'm going for a walk.
(Chie) All right.
Are you okay with bacon and eggs for breakfast?
(Akio) Perfect!
I'm going to make you hungry, do your best!
Until now, my love.
May I know... what are you doing here?!
What do you have in your pocket, Mr. Yoshino?
What are you hiding?
Ah, that... It's-it's a disinfectant for the air conditioner.
It gets rid of germs and bacteria.
Then it won't do you any good to take it to the police for testing, will it?
I just called them.
A friend of mine works.
The... police!?
Who would have thought to poor Mrs. Chie
that her husband, the man she trusted the most,
was spraying her car's air conditioner with an invisible gun.
That's why she didn't feel bad when she didn't have to go to work or when it wasn't hot enough to turn on the air conditioning.
or when it wasn't hot enough to turn on the air conditioner.
Mrs. Chie...!
Akio...
(Off) "The police investigation showed...
"That the spray contained a highly toxic diluted product."
"Akio Yoshino owed many millions to the company."
"He wanted to pay off the debt... And also to buy the car."
"That's why he wanted to murder his wife, he claimed."
Well, if it isn't his car!
What is he doing, this man?
Hey, isn't he carrying a cell phone, Mr. Teraizumi?
(shouting)
Ran!
Ran, listen!
Ran, where are you!?
Answer me!
And next episode: "The car trap (part one)".
