Aaah!
Aaah...
- (gunshot)
-Oh!
- (bodies: collapse)
- (gunshot)
Ah!
You, where did you think you were going?
No.... you had not told me, that we would kill them.
I warned them that if they didn't listen to me, they would pay dearly.
They've earned it.
Well... if that's the way it is, I'm out.
If you withdraw,
you'll be in breach of contract,
you'll bring us in and you'll have to pay for it.
(Man) Hey, you!
What are you doing here?
(Police: siren)
"The curtain rises and the protagonist appears."
"Solve the mysteries by doing a beautiful dance."
"The secret operation of some criminals behind the scenes."
"Will the Junior Detective League uncover them?"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a kid, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"In Conan falls off a cliff (part one)"
(Woman) The criminal called Zorro
has committed another violent robbery.
This time he has murdered
the three occupants of the mansion where he entered yesterday to rob.
He also seriously wounded a police officer.
"... who, when he heard gunshots, presented himself at the scene of the crime."
How can you be so petty?
He only breaks into celebrity homes.
That's already the fourth one.
"...with a crossbow."
"The Metropolitan Police has communicated
that they will devote all necessary manpower to locate him."
He does nothing to honor the name Zorro.
He is a cruel and ruthless killer.
Oh... Father, please.
Just because today is your day off
doesn't mean you have to start drinking early in the morning.
I know, it doesn't burden me.
Where to, now, that little boy?
That leech, when it's news like this,
one always has to tell his own.
Today in Conan he went out with Ay and the others.
Don't you remember?
Of course I do.
What envy!
They always do what they want.
You, you envy.
You always do what you want.
Oh... What a face.
(League: speaks at the same time) It goes, now...
Macedonia, pudding and eels.
Come on, Conan, say what you understood.
(Mitsuhiko) Right.
(Genta) How did you do, for guessing all three?
(Mitsuhiko) "It doesn't cost that much..."
Now our favorite subjects.
"I could guess them before you tell me."
Look, here we are, we've arrived.
(All) How nice!
(Ayumi) Ah!
(Ayumi) That's great!
(Mitsuhiko) And we'll be able to sleep over.
We'll look like celebrities.
(Genta) Yes, I'm sure they'll serve us top-notch eels.
I'm not so sure about that.
No, not at all, because we'll have to cook for ourselves.
I'm sorry, Genta.
He-he... Really?
What is clear
is that Dr. Agasa has contacts with very important people.
You have to be very rich to have a house like this.
(Genta) Well, I'm sure he also has some friend
who has a restaurant specializing in eels.
No.
Cap.
You don't need to be so forceful either...
Oooh...!
Ah!
Oooh!
Ayumi!
What's the matter?
Oooh.
Poor thing.
He's hurt.
Who is it?
He's still alive.
Yes.
He's badly wounded, but he's still breathing.
Okay, okay, okay.
Haibara, call an ambulance.
"(Ambulance: siren)"
(Siren)
What a scare, wasn't it, as soon as he arrived?
Who was it and where did it come from?
And what happened to him?
Maybe we could investigate.
Maybe he was just a thief who was walking around here
and, while he was running away, he tripped and hurt himself.
Yes, it's possible, but...
he should have shot himself with a crossbow.
A crossbow?
-Where did he go, Conan?
-Now that I think about it...
Mm?
But he was here a moment ago!

"You may have dropped it on him?"
"What are these?"
I'd say they're usernames or passwords.
They're very different, both.
(Shinichi voice) Haibara...
What do you plan to do?
Will you hand them over?
I don't know yet.
You make up some excuse for the others.
I make up an... excuse?
"This crossbow thing
must have something to do with yesterday's robbery."
"I wanted to ask, but I guess I can't yet."
"Military boots?"
What the...?
(knocking)
And now, to call the police.
(Police: siren)
"Oh. It's Inspector Megure."
"This means he does have a connection with yesterday's case."
(Sliding window, open)
"He just ran away!"
Conan.
What are you doing here?
(Conan voice) A suspect has fled through the window of this room.
(Conan voice) Huh?
(Conan) What?
(Conan) Nothing.
(Conan) Too late.
He had fled.
I found this in the trash.
Mm?
I guess that means the wounded man is a member of Zorro's gang, huh?
So far we've discovered
that Zorro hires different people for each heist in this regard.
The injured man's name is Yuji Isehara.
He is a professional hacker.
Our cyber-crime department
has been after him for some time.
He manipulates the security systems of potential targets.
The Kanagawa police informed us
that a person matching the description they had
matching their description of the suspect, and we came to check it out.
and we came to check it out.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
Is this information enough for you?
Now I can give a full report to Kogoro.
What?
You can't find Mr. Isehara anywhere?
He's disappeared, too?
That's all right.
Don't stop until you find him.
(Kogoro) Understood.
Thank you for informing me of everything, Inspector.
I'll see you later.
Has one of yesterday's thieves shown up
in the house where there's Conan and the others?
Yes, that's right.
It looks like he was found hiding in the garden.
He was badly wounded.
I hope that Conan... is well.
There is the inspector, woman.
You don't need to suffer.
Mm... Ah!
Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything.
Luckily, I took a picture and kept it.
Father, are you going to spend the whole day drinking, or what?
What's that?
Come on, let's go.
You mustn't think that Conan will just sit there and do nothing.
Knowing him, he must already be doing something dangerous.
But what do you say, now?
The inspector didn't ask me to take over the case.
Father, what do I tell you?
I'm not going.
The great detective Kogoro Mouri has no need to...
AAAA!
Get up!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaai!
Come on, let's go.
"There I am very close."
What a face he has!
It's not right.
If he found out something, he should have told us.
Yes.
The Junior Detective League is all of us, not just him.
Well, what I'm really hungry.
Oh, man.
I don't see him anymore.
Where is he now?
Yes.
Strange, isn't it?
Until a moment ago we could still see.
Wow, it's starting to get dark.
What if something happened to him?
We should think about us.
What's that?
What do you mean?
Yes.
It's true. It's true.
I think we've lost our way.
Don't tell me, that.
Don't tell me we'll run out of dinner.
I want dinner!
You see, if the sun sets over there,
the sea is that way.
At the moment, I would know how to find the way perfectly.
And we still have some time to go back.
-You're the best!
-Do you really mean it, Ai?
-No.
-So, we won't miss dinner?
But first we try to go a little further.
I'm not sure it's this way.
I don't know where I am anymore.
But... if the sun sets over there,
it means the sea is that way.
What's this?
I just entered a cave.
(Swell: noise)
Sea breeze.
This means... there must be a way out.
No, I can't get out this way.
This is awesome!
It's impressive.
But... I shouldn't dawdle any longer.
I'm finally out of the cave,
but now it's too dark.
I'm lost again?
I'd better go back.
What is that?
I found it.
- (brittle)
- (thump)
You're such an idiot.
What, Zorro, what do we do now?

I know you too well, Yuji.
I knew perfectly well you would come here.
"It's him."
Don't... don't kill me, please.
I beg you.
Don't kill me.
For your wife and for your son?
Don't be so melodramatic.
I suppose you've spoken.
No.
I haven't said anything.
I'll let you choose, then.
Either I get rid of your wife and child,
or you end your life yourself.
Which do you prefer?
Choose!
Who's in?
Yuji!
Who are you?
This way, hurry.
Conan Edogawa, a detective.
- Where is he?
-A... a detective?
Hurry up.
Was it a boy?
Damn.
Where the hell did they go?
XXT.
They... they want to kill me.
Be quiet.
At the moment they have no idea where we are.
Aah!
I don't want to die!
This way.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Oh, man.
What?
-What?
At Conan's?
-Oh... -Oh... Conan!
Conan!
(Kogoro) Another beer.
No, two...
I don't know why, but I have a bad feeling.
Can you run a little more, please?
Father, wake up at once, will you?
No.
Don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.
After all the trouble you've brought us,
you'll die a traitor.
Farewell.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(They call out)
-Aaah!
-Aaah!
Aaah!
Aaaaah!
Conan!
Aaaaaaah...
Ah, hello, Dr. Agasa.
Look how nice of him to come out to greet us.
Something happened to Conan and the kids, didn't it?
Yes, I just got a call from the kids telling me that Conan...
What?
That can't be right.
What did he say?
That... that at Conan...?
Ran!
Ran!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ran!

It can't be no way.
But... we've seen it, the eyes can't deceive.
Thank you, inspector.
There's no way I'm going to allow it.
What? The Ai has disappeared too?
The Ai has disappeared too?
I came alone, as you asked me to.
Let's go.
