Destiny is a clue to deductions.
It is a light that sheds light on mysterious cases.
Today we have a mysterious kidnapping.
Understanding English is very difficult.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is Detective Conan!
Something 's just not right!
Nani o motometeru no

The start of century!

You're in my heart!
You're in my heart!

(People: exclamations of joy)
(People: laughter)
(Audience: standing ovation)
It was fantastic!
I had a great time!
Oysters.
The animals were very cute.
Especially that white lion.
He did some fantastic things.
Of course, that lion is the star of the show, guys!
Look: they made a keychain, too, of the white lion!
-Yes, it's very nice.
(Ayumi) Isn't it?
Before the show started,
Ai and I saw it in the souvenir store and bought it.
Uh... yes...
Don't tell me... you like this kind of thing!
Well, it's healthier than the tastes of a certain person
who spends all day reading stories about blood and liver.
Do you know who I'm talking about? Leave me alone.
What?
Who is this gentleman who is surrounded by so many people?
Oh, that's Randy Hawk, the man who sponsors the animal show.
He's from Oklahoma, a state in the southern part of the United States.
He got very rich in oil and started collecting animals.
But his children Paul and Annie also became interested in the animals
and now... they tour all over the world with their beasts.
Ah.
Now you see?
Their photographs are on the last page of the brochure.
Their hobby is to travel around the world with their show
and visit the zoos of every country he passes through.
According to him, he is always surrounded by bodyguards...
because he is from a lineage of "cowboys" for generations,
and they think you have to protect yourself.
He said this in a program.
He speaks Japanese very fluently.
(All) eeeeh?
Mr. Hawk.
One comment, please.
(Man) Mr. Hawk.
One question!
(English accent) You're confused... My name is not Hawk, Miss journalist.
Please don't make a fool of us...
(Man) Have you given half of the proceeds from your show
to zoos around the world?
No... I don't know.
It's been 3 years since I've been here.
How are you feeling?
Please, Mr. Hawk, say something.
(Men) Please, Mr. Hawk!
Please respond.
THE MAN WHO CAME FROM CHICAGO, (PART ONE)
Gee, gee, gee.
Now he doesn't look like a cowboy, really.
(Ouch) Boy, you've got some nerve.
I'm hiding and watching my shoulders alone
because I can't afford bodyguards and look at him now.
It serves him right. (Shinichi voice) Calm down.
Let's help him, he's quite disoriented.
It seems that this man has grown up surrounded by cows
with a life of high-society luxury.
Listen... I'm trying to make you understand that...
(Conan voice) Ah!
Uncle Thomas!
You were here.
-Uncle Thomas? -(Man) Huh?
(Man) This man... isn't he Mr. Hawk?
No, he's an old friend of my grandfather's.
He's an English teacher at my neighborhood school.
Yeah, that's right.
Come on, man, let's go for a ride.
You promised us we'd go eat at a restaurant.
(Genta) Come on, let's go!
(Journalists: exclamations of surprise)
Thank you very much, guys.
Thanks to you I've been able to get off on the right foot.
They take me for Mr. Hawk very often,
but I haven't found myself in this situation.
Then you should disguise yourself, when you leave the house.
(He thinks) "This would make him even more suspicious."
He likes it so much, Paul and Annie's animal show?
I do.
Their show is wonderful!
And besides...
(All) eeeeh?
I really wanted to achieve this.
That's why I came to Japan.
We have also bought this keychain!
This keychain is very popular all over the world.

and it is readily available.
Why did I have to come to Japan to buy it?
No, no, look at the back of the keychain.
It says "made in Japan.
This is the only place I could buy it.
"I get it... It's a collector's item."
But what bad luck!
Look at meeting all the journalists!
After the show I was there, waiting for a friend of mine,
and I couldn't see him.
Have you seen a man with long hair?
I don't know... It was so crowded...
Ah.
You were very clever.
How did you know it wasn't Mr. Hawk?
By his speech.
-For... Speech? -Speech? -What?
Sir, you pronounced the word "can not"...
in a way... that sounds more English than American.
It didn't seem at all natural to me...
for a man who came from a family of cowboys...
would speak the English that is spoken in England.
Yes, I noticed that he spoke with a southern American accent.
And then I looked at the photo that was in the brochure
and I saw that he didn't look like that.
But I can't blame the journalists for getting confused.
It's hard for a Westerner to tell one Easterner from another,
and Orientals find it hard to distinguish one Westerner from another
if they have the same skin and hair color.
My name is James Black.
What's yours?
Who are you?
Conan Edogawa.
I'm a detective.
Conan Edogawa?
Detective?
Wow!
And you're not the only one in Conan, sir.
We're the Junior Detective League.
That's right, we are.
Look at that!
Oh, like Sherlock Holmes!
Caram.
So you're the Baker Street Irregulars.
It's-it's just that Holmes sometimes used Baker Street children
to get information for him.
(At the same time) Aaaaah....
I was born on Baker Street.
I got it!
Since I found you, I want to give you a little present.
I will invite you to eat a very good meal in a restaurant I know.
(At the same time) Viscaaaaaaaa!
Did you come by car?
Yes, but there are so many of us that we don't have enough room for you to fit.
(At the same time) Very well.
We'll go with the van I rented.
I-I'll bring it right away.
Wait-here, please.
Oh, but what I'm a good gourmet I'm a bad driver.
You drive, please.
Driving with the steering wheel on the right is very difficult.
If you're not used to driving right-hand-drive cars,
it means you haven't lived in England for a long time.
That's right.
I was born in London, but I've lived in Chicago for many years.
The windy city that Al Capone took by storm.
Listen.
You don't notice anything strange about this man?
(Shinichi voice) Eh?
No, I don't.
So... there's no problem.
Excuse me, sir.
We're police inspectors.
Is this your vehicle?
Yes, yes... It's the van I rented this morning.
Oh, I get it.
Turns out it's a stolen vehicle.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my goodness!
We were notified of the theft a week ago.
Can you give us the details of where and how you rented it?
We would also like you to give us your name
and the name of the hotel where you are staying.
We're going in the patrol car on the other side.
-It doesn't do anything to you, does it? -No...
We won't waste much of your time.
-Eeeh? -What's going on? -Sir, get in the car.
Sir, get in the car.
I just remembered there are some friends waiting for me.
Do you mind if I go tell them I'll be a little late?
Oooh...
Get in.
What?!
Shut up and get in the car!
-What's wrong? -What's wrong? -She dropped something.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
It's just a key ring.
-Come on, let's go. -Yeah.
AAAA!
I got a cut on my finger!
Coi, what a job he'll give us, this guy!
You... you're not from the police, are you?
Shut up, you little cowboy!
You're wrong.
I'm not rich!
You've made a lot of money flogging your helpless animals.
Now we want you to share them.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's strange, it's been about 40 minutes already.
It's already taking too long.
-I wonder what the hell he's supposed to do.
-I'm starting to get hungry.
Come on, let's go.
Dr. Agasa can wait here.
The others will go look in the parking lot.
That's a good idea.
There aren't many parking lots in this area, and I know where they all are.
-Oh, come with us, Ai. -Yeah, okay.

(Mitsuhiko) I wonder if it's here.
James!
James, where is it?
Hey! (Mitsuhiko)
Is it here?
Ah..., we're not looking for cats.
James, where eeee?
I've found it!
I'm sure it's this car.
Do you see it?
There's a lion next to the driver's seat.
But in here... there's no one in here.
(Think) "The door is open, and the keys are still inside."
(Boy) Hello.
What is someone looking for?
The foreigner with a moustache, when he was going to get in, two men with trench coats
who were wearing trench coats.
(Child) What?
-Oh.
Come, Conan. Eh?
Conan!
What's wrong?
That you found it?
Conan!
(Ai) It's a keychain with a lion on it, isn't it?
Maybe it's James's.
If it is, that means he's got into another car.
Earlier he said he had... met a friend of his.
Remember that, guys?
Don't tell me he forgot
and went to lunch with the friend and left us stranded here!
Huh?
He can't have.
No, I don't think he forgot.
Rather... he got involved in some very suspicious business.
Fixeu's to him.
See this key ring.
(At the same time) Eeeeeeh?
If you pay attention, you will see that the letters P and A are stained with blood.
"Maybe he's been trying to leave a message
"Because he thought we'd come looking for him."
Can't find?
- (all) What? -That's... a kidnapping!
-We have to call the police. -He's right.
-He's right.
(thinks) "But why? I don't get it. Why, the P and the A?"
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
It was so easy!
Now we have to think how much money
your son and daughter will cough up for this sack of money.
I had thought 500 million at least.
After all, he has so much money...
that he's giving them away to zoos that his mother doesn't even know about.
Well, you've done an incredible job.
You've modified this car
and you've got it amassed into a police car.
Look at that, with the "cowboy" look he's got,
he's going around the world without a bodyguard to protect him.
Lucky you.
No!
I'm telling you, you're making a mistake!
I'm not Hawk!
My name is James Black!
James?
First you're a "cowboy" and now you're a British secret agent?
(James) No, no!
Ah, that's James Bond!
So much is.
This is of no importance.
We just want you to keep your mouth shut...
until we get to our hideout.
In 007, huh?
You just wait and see how we get the ransom.
Our plan... it's a real masterpiece.
Ha-ha-ha...
(Thinks) "No, you're not... the actors... I'm interested in."
What?
You didn't feel us?
We are trying to explain it to him.
He is a foreigner, with glasses and a mustache.
And he's been involved in an accident or something.
-He must have been kidnapped, you don't understand?!
But he didn't happen to be kidnapped, did he?
Maybe this gentleman just got lost, and quite a bit.
Besides, there are a lot of foreigners with glasses and mustaches.
We don't know where to start.
It would be easier if I had a photograph.
(Ayumi) We have one, photograph.
If there is a photograph, look.
He is like this.
-Ah, this is Randy Hawk! -If you talk about him, he's safe and sound.
He's finished talking on the radio.
He doesn't understand us.
In James Black he looks a lot like Randy Hawk.
-It's someone else.
En-Eh?
Hey, this radio show, do you know if it was live?
Yeah, that's right... I think it's still going on, isn't it?
Yes, I think it is.
I don't like this at all.
If they've kidnapped James thinking he was Randy Hawk,
they'll probably listen to the radio show where he was supposed to speak
to see how things are going.
Hell, no.
When they find out the truth they will be very angry!
Yes..., when they find out that they have kidnapped the man who wasn't....,
"She will surely be murdered..."
Hey, wait a second!
(Radio: man) What is this?!
(Radio: male) "I'd like you to continue to support...
"Paul and Annie and me, at Randy Hawk."
How come Randy Hawk is on the live radio?
So... who the fuck are you?
That's what I was trying to tell you.
You've got the wrong guy.
Coi de...!
What do we do now?!
So what do we do.
What would you say we have to do?

He has seen our face, and this cannot be!
The only thing we have to do is to take it out of circulation.
Don't do it.
Fly, drive around town with a body bleeding to death inside the car?
We'll blow his head off like we planned
when we got to the Gunma Mountains,
and after digging a grave,
we'll come up with another plan, okay?
Coi.
What are we going to... We follow our plan.
We won't get caught.
The police have no idea who we are,
and besides, they have no clue...
that tells them they've kidnapped a foreigner.
(malicious laughter)
Hey, don't you find anything strange, Shinichi?
(Shinichi voice) Wait, what are you trying to tell me?
I have a feeling that... something is calling me.
Excuse me, we'd like to get to the point.
We should bring this man on the scene of the facts.
Well done, Ayumi!
I already know!
I know where they've got James!
And the next Conan:
