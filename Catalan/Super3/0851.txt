If you go to Beppu, you have to go to see the hells at all costs.
We will go to visit hells?
It must be a lot of fun.
"But there's something that worries me a little."
"In Kogoro, he has invited us to go on this trip.
but, I don't know why, he's very quiet."
(Takagi) Come in.
Come in, come in, please.
This voice sounds very...
-And now, you're welcome.
Eh?
-Thank you very much.
Xxxxt!
Hello, Taka...
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not dressed.
As if you haven't seen me.

"Visit to the hells of love (Episode of Beppu)."
"A long time ago,
"People were kind of afraid to go near the volcanic pits,
they called hells."
"In the Caldera of Hell there is a huge demon on top."
That's awesome.
Ooooh!
Oh!
This one's huge, huh?
Eh?
But... Aaaaah...
What-what happened?
I can't see.
"They say that the Sea Hell was formed
after an eruption of the Tsurumi volcano."
"In the Hell of Cape Shaven Monk
they make some very curious mud bubbles."
"In Mount Hell there are hippos and flamingos."
Oooh!
Aaaah!
How scary!
Oh, how cute!

"In Geyser Hell, hot water gushes with great force."
"In the Blood Lake Hell, even the steam is red."
"Doing the tour of the 8 hells
Is a must if you visit Beppu City."
Yes.
Are you ready?
You bet.
Do you want to see it?
Did it look good?
Why are you making this face now?
Ah.
What's the matter?
What a big backpack he's carrying, this man!
"This man..."
By the way, come to think of it, where is the father?
Mmmm... I don't see it at all clear.
It will be hard to find any clues from this photo, period.
What's the matter?
Father.
What are you doing here, alone?
No... Nothing, nothing...
What were you doing?
I wasn't doing anything, woman, relax.
Oh, I'm burning!
What's this?
A photo?
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let her be.
Give it to me.
Let's see...?
It's here.
Aaaah!
Let's see.
Ouch.
Father, who is this girl in the photo?
What do you mean?
The girl in this photo you have in your hands?
I don't know.
Mr. Mouri, you'd better tell us the truth, we've caught her.
What?
What?
All right, I'll tell you.
I'll tell you.
Yesterday, the president of the famous Nakadai electric company
the president of the famous Nakadai electric company.
-Yes.
-Has your daughter disappeared?
Her name is Manami.
This morning I found a note from her
that said she was going on a trip and I don't know anything more.
You must be worried sick, then.
You have no idea where she might have gone?
No, but I found this photo in his room.
Mm?
"Welcome to hell"?
It's a ticket to visit the Beppu hells,
in Oita Prefecture.
Understood.
You must know that my daughter just got engaged, it's very recent.
"Her fiancé is the president
of an information technology company
whose name is Kenichiro Ehari.
Then they announced their engagement,
my daughter received this photo.

-Hiroyuki?
-A Hiroyuki sent it to her.
It seems that they had been a couple a long time ago.
I didn't know it, but from what my secretary told me,
in Yozo Hosogai, they met in Beppu...
when she went on a school trip.
He is an artist who works with paper.
After they broke up, he still wrote her several letters.
I'm afraid that he might have intimate photos of my daughter
and that he wants to use them to blackmail her.
If he is capable of doing something like that, he is a despicable person.
I think my daughter must have been afraid
that her fiancé or I would find out,
and maybe that's why she went to see Hiroyuki by herself.
(Kogoro) It could be very dangerous.
She could end up involved in some kind of criminal activity.
But if we tell the police, there will be a big scandal....
and it will be very bad for the company's reputation.
I'm talking about the company's reputation!
I'm not just saying this because of the company.
I'm saying it because I think it could also hurt Manami a lot.
All right.
Let me, Kogoro Mouri, investigate this case.
And that is why I have been forced
to organize this family vacation.
"Forced, he says. Come on!"
Hey, why didn't you tell us before?
If I had known, we could have helped you.
Take a cupcake from paradise.
They're great, you'll see.
Where did you get them, these cupcakes?
Mm... I bought them when we were in Marine Hell.
You're hopeless, Father.
Aren't you?
Mmm!
Mmm!
They're good!
Mmmm!
(Takagi) Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I still can't believe
that we're walking around like an ordinary couple, Sato.
There's something strange to me.
How come you're having a party?
Weren't you working on that armed carjacking case?
If I'm not mistaken, it hasn't been solved yet, has it?
Since I've been doing a lot of surveillance all this time,
Inspector Megure told me to take a few days off.
-Yes.
-Oh, did he?
Ah, yes.
Come, let's go over here, I'll show you something.
-You will, won't you?
-Oooh!
It's beautiful!
And you know what?
It looks like the temple next door is available for weddings.
Is it really?
-Yes.
-They do weddings?
"Let's go well, show interest." If all goes well..."
("Wedding march")

"We can both start making memories together."
Oh.
It's beautiful!
Come, Conan.
There's an even prettier view from here.
Hey, since there's no one around,
why don't you come to this band with me?
"Yes, man! Like, there's nobody there? There's you."
Huh?
By the way, kiddo.
How come you wanted to sleep here?
Because in the photo of the Manami
there was a van of this hostel.
Eh?
You're the best, Conan.
Even the father hadn't noticed.
Don't talk nonsense.
Of course, I had noticed.
I'm the great detective Kogoro Mouri!
You are?
You mean?
Of course, of course I do.
(Woman) The father must have hired a detective.
He's looking for me.
I don't know what you had planned or what you were planning to do,
but we should let it go, it's over.
What a great outdoor pool, isn't it?
Ah, how good this bath has been for me!
What? What's wrong?
What's the matter? What's wrong?
Oh, man.
This girl that happened.
She looked like Manami.
- (woman: shrieks)
-Really?
-There's a demon.
Outside.
-What happened to him?
A demon?
It's gone!
What? He says he's already found my daughter?
He says he's already found my daughter?
Yes.
We explained to him that we were looking for her because you were very worried
and you promised to come home with us tomorrow.
As I am very worried, I prefer to come and look for her myself.
Mr. President, tomorrow you have a meeting and the day after another one.
I'll take any meetings you have.
"Tomorrow morning I'll take the first train. Keep a close watch until I arrive."
(Kogoro) Understood.
"How strange... There's no footprint."
Oh.
"What are these marks?"
Hiroyuki Hayami?
He's my ex-boyfriend.
We dated until about 6 months ago.
(Kogoro) And he's the one who sent you this photo?
Yes.
He had just promised me and I got really scared.
I called him right away
and he told me to come to Beppu immediately.

In other words, he sent her the photo to threaten her....
and try to blackmail you.
I'm sure he's got some pretty compromising photos of you with him
and he wants me to buy them, right?
What do you mean, compromising photos?
Do me a favor, Father.
For example, photos of you kissing?
How disrespectful!
Manami, could it be that the demon we saw yesterday was Hiroyuki?
I don't know, if it was him.
I only came here to prevent my father and my fiancé
from knowing that I went out with Hiroyuki.
Your fiancé, Kenichiro Ehari,
is the president of a company that makes two billion every year, right?
And he's also a fashion icon.
What elegance!
It's unbelievable.
Manami, do you have any photos of Hiroyuki?
Yes, I do.
But it's from six months ago.
Let's see... Look at it.
"It's not the man with the sunglasses."
It's so romantic, the fog.
"Oh! It's my chance."
"I have to ask her if she wants to marry me in that temple."
Hey, Sato.
That... About it... I wanted you...
(Phone) What?
(Phone)
-Who called you ten times, now?
-Tell me, it's Sato.
-What?
-Inspector Megure...
What?
That they found the car of the armed robbery?
It's in the parking lot of the Umitamago Aquarium in Oita City?
-O Oita?
-All right, you guys.
What do you mean?
Inspector Takagi is sick, you say?
-No, nothing's wrong.
-What?
I can take care of it myself.
I'm leaving for Oita right now.
Ouch... I-I'm sorry.
I wanted us to spend a couple of days together.
-I'm so sorry.
-I don't want to hear any excuses.
Aren't you a police inspector?
Well, let's see you prove it.
-Yes... -Yes... Okay, okay, okay.
-(Kogoro) Okay?
(Kogoro) We were expecting you, Mr. Nakadai.
Good job, Mr. Mouri.
I congratulate you.
May I introduce Mr. Ehari, Manami's fiancé.
Pleased to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
I came because I was very worried about Manami.
Have you told Mr. Ehari about Hiroyuki?
Yes, I explained everything to him,
and he says he's willing to accept the Manami's past.
-But... where is the Manami?
-Perfect, then.
She's in her room.
She wanted to change.
She must be about to come.
(Deep voice) Welcome to hell.
Boy, is she late... That's strange.
I'm going to tell her we're waiting for her.
Manami.
I enter the room.
Oh!
Father, come at once!
Manami is not here!
"Why have you disturbed her room?"
Father!
The emergency exit is open.
Yes, they look freshly made.
These ruts are very recent.
Mr. Mouri, where is the Manami?
Mr. Nakadai, she might have been kidnapped.
What do you mean, kidnapped?
(Mobile)
- (high-pitched voice) "Hidetora Nakadai?"
-Tell me.
- "I have your daughter, the Manami."
-Yes, who am I talking to?
How do you say?
"If you want to see her alive again,
prepare 100 million yen in cash."
100 million?
"If you talk to the police, you'll never see her again, I'm warning you."
Very well, I'll do whatever you tell me to do.
But above all, don't do anything to her.
"I'll call you back in an hour."
Could it be Hiroyuki, the kidnapper?
Yes, it's very likely that it's all his doing.
"There's something that doesn't fit."
"Behind this kidnapping is some other mystery."
Tokyo Metropolitan Police.
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you for your cooperation.
It doesn't look like she's been abandoned...
So, the suspect could be close.
Very close.
It is likely that the suspect is trying to attack us in some way.
If it's all right with you, I'll take care of delivering the money.
Hey, Ran.
Do you have a marker a little thick?
I think so, but why do you want it?
Mmm?
Hey, kid.
Can you tell me what you do with the money?
(mobile)
- (high-pitched voice) "Do you have the money ready?"
-I'm in Nakadai.
Yes.
"Put them to the yellow bag of the Manami
and come to the Mont Takasaki Zoological Park."
The Mont Takasaki Zoological Park?
"Let him take the money at Kenichiro Ehari."
- "There is to be here half an hour."
-Why in Kenichiro?
But... How do you know my name?
If the author of the kidnapping is in Hiroyuki Hayami,

it's not strange at all, that he knows.
It's normal for him to know what Manami's fiancé's name is.
I hope he doesn't want to hurt me.
He won't do anything to me, will he?
Don't suffer.
I'll be here all the time.
Kenichiro, we can't endanger Manami's life.
We must do what the kidnapper asked us to do.
I agree.
(People: exclamations of enthusiasm)
(PA: woman) "Welcome to the Umitamago Aquarium in Oita City.
in Oita City."
Takagi, I don't see anyone around here who looks like the culprit.
-Not around here either.
-Have you seen anyone, you?
On the other side of the road
is the Mont Takasaki Zoological Park.
I'll go take a look.
It looks like 1,500 wild monkeys live in this park.
Ah!
Really?
They say it's good luck to have a monkey pass between your legs.
Is that so?
Wow.
But how many monkeys there are!
It will cost a little to find someone here.
Eh?
Hey, this is mine.
What are you doing?
Come here, come here.
Come here. Come here.
I have to do it.
-What? -What?
What's the matter?
- (monkey: squeals)
Come back here!
Give it back to me!
He-he!
-Ouch...
-Hey, Takagi.
Mr. Mouri!
I'm investigating a kidnapping case.
I don't want you to get in the way.
Okay, you can relax, I'm investigating an armed robbery.
- (Kenichiro) Mr. Mouri.
-What armed robbery? -What armed robbery?
It's too much responsibility.
-You can't back out now.
-I can't, I'm sorry.
Can't you see that the Manami's life depends on us?
-Oysters.
And now what do I do?
- (mobile)
(Mobile)
Tell me?
"Leave the bag on top of the Rock of the Mona."
What is the Rock of the Mona?
It is a rock that resembles the profile of a monkey.
Couples who look at it together
are assured of happiness forever.
It's over there.
Look, it's up here.
(Takagi) You mean it's not dangerous to climb?
It's already done.
There's no time to think about it.
Which way should the kidnapper come?
Now we just have to wait for him to come and get her.
(Buzzing)
(buzzing) What?
(buzzing) Wait!
(buzzing) Oops.
No, Conan!
Conan!
Aaaaaaaaaah!

No, I don't see it.
I don't know where they went.
