Stars have a certain appeal.
Whether they are guilty or actors.
Yuka takes care of a blue bird.
He looks like he should bring happiness, but he makes a case appear.
He looks like a child but has the brain of an adult and is Detective Conan!

THE JUNIOR DETECTIVE LEAGUE BEHIND THE BLUE BIRD
(Genta) Oops!
It's freezing cold today too.
They say that these 3 days we will have the lowest temperatures in November.
(Ayumi) Yuka!
(Mitsuhiko) Ah, she's the Konno of class C. (Genta) She's always staring at me.
(Genta) She's always staring at the bird cage.
Yuka!
Ah, hi, Ayumi...
(Mitsuhiko) Do you like birds?
Yes, very much.
We have a parakeet at home too.
One with blue feathers.
-Xic-Xic.
-Oh, and how do you say it?
He's a 2 year old blue male.
He does say a few words.
-I want to see him!
-Does he really talk?
Yes, he does.
Do you want to come to my house?
-And so do I!
May I come over?
-Can I come too?
Hm.
You called each other Edogawa and Haibara, right?
(At the same time) Uh, yes...
You guys can come too.
But if there are too many of us...
That's all right.
Mother doesn't come home from work until the afternoon.
At your house both of you work?
At my house too.
In my house... it's not exactly the same.
Yuka's father died 2 years ago from an illness.
Are you serious?
Come on!
Conan, Ai, you too!
Yes, let's go see that parakeet all together!
-We've made it!
-Let's go!
Got what?
(Yuka) Do you know how you can tell...
if an adult blue parakeet is male or female?
-By feather pattern?
-By the size of the body, maybe?
No.
By the color of the appendage above the beak.
Males are blue and females are brown.
A prize!
But lately, although in Xic-Xic it is male,
the appendage on his beak is turning brown.
(gasps) We're not there yet?
Eh?
The door... The door is open.
-Doesn't there have to be a burglar?
-(gasps) Huh?
What?
(Knocking)
Everybody back!
All right! All right!
All right!
Perfect!
But, guys!
We're ready!
-Aaaaaaah!
-Aaaaaaaaah!
- (Genta) A thief?
- (Mitsuhiko) Who are you?
Ah..., hello, Yuka.
Welcome home!
(Mitsuhiko) -No..., I don't know him.
-Do you know him?
-He's a thief!
-She says she doesn't know him!
You're wrong.
I am Shinya Sakaguchi.
I work in the research laboratory
of the Engineering Department of Beika University, you know, kids?
Yuka's mother works in a garden store in Haido.
And since I'm late, she asked me to take Yuka out to dinner.
Your mother told me that she had already told you something this morning.
-Yuka...
-I... I don't know anything.
Wait a minute!
How did you get in?
It's that... It's just that your mother told me where the key was hidden.
Guys, guys!
Don't listen to this gentleman, come in!
-Sorry to bother you.
-Let's go!
That is to say...
That you and your mother have a relationship as intimate as this.
Stop pushing me, will you?
He-he-he-he!
Excuse me...
-What... bigger house! -And the garden is beautiful too!
-And the garden is beautiful too!
How come the windows are open?
I just wanted to air out the house a bit before Yuka came back.
Boy-Boy, I'm home!
-And it's a beautiful color!
-Oh!
It's so pretty!
-Oh...
What's wrong?
No... It's just that it seems to me that the Boy-Boy has become a little smaller.
Th-that's impossible.
It must be your imagination.
Chico-Chico!
Chico-Chico!
Chico-Chico!
You don't answer me?
You don't answer me?
Oh.
How strange.

Whenever I come back she says "Welcome home".
You've-you've come with a whole bunch of friends he doesn't know
and he must have been nervous.
-Yes, he said good morning, all happy.
-And this morning he spoke to you?
Yes.
It tickles me!
It's true, the appendix of the beak is brown.
(Man: coughs)
Yes.
-Yes, a little...
-(Man: He has a cold?
Is that why he's away from us all the time?
Yes, that's right.
Why doesn't he want to take care of us?
If he was constipated, why did he have all the windows open?
It's very strange.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Tell me, what happened is that the bird escaped, right?
And you went to the pet store...
looking for a bird that looked like it to buy it.
If he had all the windows open, it was because maybe the bird would come back.
And the bird you bought is smaller than the one you had!
-Confess what you have done!
-That's why he doesn't talk!
-You dropped the soy sauce, didn't you?
-It's not true!
What are you saying?
When I opened the fridge, it smelled like soy sauce!
Yes, it's true;
when I put away the cake I had bought for you,
I accidentally dropped it.
Don't open other people's refrigerator without permission!
Yuka, why are you calling me like this, huh?
Oh.
Mother!
-Welcome.
- (at once) We've come to visit!
Suddenly some customers have cancelled one of the orders.
Sakaguchi, let's all go out to dinner together.
Uh..., excuse me, but I have to go now.
Ah... but...
(Ayumi) Conan!
Oh, bye!
See you tomorrow!
Yes, it's late, go straight home.
Yeah... we know!
And you don't go anywhere else either.
Don't talk nonsense!
This wouldn't be a bad idea either...
Caram, Edogawa, and now... why do you undertake?
Conan is still as cunning as ever, isn't he?
But this is something we have to check.
Come on, let's go!
Let's go, let's go!
(Woman) Yes..., it's true.
A person like this has come to buy a blue parakeet.
-From... (Woman) Really?
I knew it!
-It was a couple of hours ago.
-The bird got away from him!
-What Ai said was true.
Ah!
But this man...
"He was holding a dead parakeet."
He asked me to give him a parakeet that looked like that one.
It seems he was nervous for some reason.
(Mitsuhiko) I didn't expect it.
(Ayumi) The Boy-Boy had died...
(Ayumi) But Yuka said that today she said "Good morning" to him happily.
Yes..., this means he didn't die of an illness.
But it's hard to believe that she had an accidental death inside the cage.
Don't tell me that this gentleman killed her?
If he went in a hurry to buy such a parakeet,
it means he wouldn't do it expressly.
(Ayumi) Then she would have died in mistake seamb something?
What does his work consist of?
In Sakaguchi said that he worked
the research laboratory of Beika University.
We were wondering what kind of research he was doing.
I don't know exactly, but I think it was drugs.
-Drugs?
-What?
I-It can't be!
But... it looks to me like it was a drug...
Ah!
Conan!
Don't do it, Ayumi!
You know, he always ends up taking all the credit.
This time the three of us will find out the truth on our own!
All right, you'll see.
-Yes...
-Come on, Ayumi...
Hello... Sorry to keep you waiting.
Sorry for calling you when you were busy.
Sorry!
Your research lab is here in the back, right?
Yes, it is.
Would you mind letting us see?
-Why is that?
-No, I can't do that.
Because there are dangerous drugs of all kinds in there.
-So it was true...
-Dangerous drugs?
Yesterday afternoon we went to the pet store.
The girl in the store explained everything to us.
Could you explain to us what happened?
Please forgive me, I told you a lie yesterday.
In fact, when I arrived at Yuka's house,
I found the Xic-Xic dead inside the cage.
Yuka was very much for Chico-Chico,
"So I thought that when he came back he would be very sad."
"So I went to the pet store to buy a parakeet."

And what happened to the Xic-Xic who had died?
I buried him in a nearby park after he left Yuka's house.
Can you take us to that place?
We want to pray for the bird, you know?
-Right now?
I don't think that...
-Yes...
Can't you do it?
I'm in the middle of an experiment right now.
I'm sorry, but it'll have to be some other time.
Excuse me!
-Wait!
-Mr. Sakaguchi!
It's very suspicious.
This man's Chico-Boy died!
But... why should he let the bird die?
Thank you very much!
Mmmm... And couldn't that be it?
"A poison that he would have brought from the laboratory....
"He must have dropped it by mistake....
"He mixed it with his water and the parakeet swallowed it."
But wouldn't that be too much of a coincidence?
Ah!
Perhaps it was a volatile type of poison.
What is this volatile you say?
I said "volatile," Genta.
They are things that are in a gaseous state.
For example, that this poison that would have fallen on him by mistake,
would take a gaseous state and that the parakeet would breathe it!
If we approach it this way, all the mysteries are solved.
"The reason why Sakaguchi had left the windows open
"It was because he thought there might be poison left in the air."
"Mr. Sakaguchi's eyes were red...
"And he had congestion because he must have mistakenly inhaled
"Some of the poison that was left in the air."
That's why he was the only one who stayed away from the place where we were,
from the place where the poison had fallen.
Now I understand.
So that he had a cold was a lie!
-(woman) Good morning?
- (woman) Good morning, children!
(at the same time) Yuka!
-Yesterday everything was great!
(woman) -Ah!
Good morning!
Exaggerated, it wasn't that bad either.
Did you go shopping?
Yes.
Tonight we're making makisushi for dinner!
Wow, what a coincidence!
We're having makisushi at the doctor's house tonight too!
The doctor?
He's Dr. Agasa, an inventor who lives in the second district.
He's an old geezer.
He's always talking about things from the year of the itch.
(Ayumi) Mr. Sakaguchi will also dine with you?
I invited him, but he refused my proposal...
because he was busy tonight.
Good bye!
I hope he will come to see us another day!
(At the same time) Yes... Goodbye! (At the same time)
Guys, shouldn't we have explained to you about that man?
I also doubt if we should have...
We'd better talk when we've cleared things up.
(At the same time) Here we are!
Oh, he's already here?
-Oh, what a scent!
-Doctor, where is Conan?
Are you asking for him again?
I haven't said anything...
I guess he'll be here soon.
Haibara!
Can we help you?
Maybe we can.
Can you stop the table, please?
Yes!
Okay, okay, okay!
The question is why Sakaguchi brought that poison to Yuka's house.
Wouldn't he want to kill Yuka or her mother?
I don't want to think about it, but we can't rule it out.
In this case, I should put somewhere... Ah...
To the cake!
He put the poison in the cake he bought!
Genta!
Yesterday, the cake was eaten by us, you know?
"Oh! I can't get enough!"
Oh, that's right.
Come to think of it, Yuka didn't eat any cake...
As we guessed, she must hate Mr. Sawaguchi.
But let's see, why does she hate him?
My instinct tells me that even if he carried poison, he didn't put it anywhere.
Ouch!
The soy sauce.
In will we have enough?
"I dropped the soy sauce by accident."
-Oh!
Did you put it in there?
-Oh, no!
That's why Sakaguchi refused to have makisushi dinner with them today!
It is terrible!
Hurry, it should be avoided!
-Hey, wait a moment!
-I'm coming too!
But what happened... here?
I don't know...
Now you'll see..., you'll regret it forever!
I wish we had... talked to Conan!
Back to Conan?
Oh, mother, what shall we do if we are not in time?
(At the same time) Genta, come on!
(Mitsuhiko) Ah, it's red!
"(Mitsuhiko) Hurry! Hurry up!
"Go green! Turn green!"
"Please, we have to be on time!"
We go around the garden!
-We're on time!
-SO... they're alive!
What a rest...

What's wrong with him?
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't drink this soy sauce!
It is poisoned!
Poisoned?
What are you saying?
It's not poisoned.
We've already taken it with dinner.
- (doorbell)
-What?
(Ding-dong)
(Mother) Coming!
-Ah.
Hello, Conan!
- (door, open)
Ah...
Sakaguchi...
I knew it... I expected this to happen.
Conan, what are you doing here?
From your behavior, I assumed that you had stumbled...
with a wild deduction.
(Mitsuhiko) Is it true that when Mr. Sakaguchi came...
the Boy-Boy was dead?
Very often, birds eat quite normally...
and hide their illnesses under a healthy appearance
just before they die.
Why is that?
When they live with a swarm of their own kind,
sometimes the weak ones are attacked by predators, right?
Although we are referring to a parakeet, it is a wild animal.
That's why yesterday morning he said "good morning" to her all happy.
But he had symptoms of his condition.
When male budgerigars get sick,
the blue appendage of the beak turns brown.
If Xic-Xic now had a brown beak appendage, it was because he was not well,
it was because he was not feeling well.
I didn't know...
So, if Sakaguchi had red eyes, it was....
It was because it had breathed in a poison?
No, it wasn't.
Mr. Sakaguchi was really constipated.
"And he hadn't bathed for 3 days and he was worried...
"because he might smell bad."
"He left the windows open so that no modesty would show,
"He stayed away from the Yuka when she came back."
Being a girl, I thought she would reject me with disgust more if she noticed modesty.
Forgive me, Yuka.
That boy came to see me
and told me I'd better tell you the truth.
So I wouldn't suffer so much.
When I felt it, I realized... I was a fool.
Life is a priceless thing.
Now you must be thinking "I wish I had realized earlier that I was sick".
But... I'm convinced that Chico-Chico was very happy
because you always took such good care of him.
Since yesterday Chico-Chico had a brown beak appendage, I bought a female by mistake.
I bought a female by mistake.
-And she has a blue appendage.
It's a male!
-It's a parakeet!
Oh, how cute!
After the Chico-Chico died,
I didn't know if you had to buy another bird to replace him...
Thank you very much...
How nice, now they will form a family.
(Agasa) They are late!
What are they doing?
(Agasa) -Yes, you're right!
-Start eating, if you want.
As much as I waited, the eel didn't arrive.
Maybe I put too much soy, but this must have sauce!
Mmmm!
How good!
Sushi and puns are the spice of life, perhaps?
"These are the days that these 5 events have taken place in this house."
"The first one happened on February 4, 2 years ago,
"The next, July 4th."
"And last year they also took place on February 4 and July 4."
"And this one, on April 4."
"The next day will be the nefarious date of Buddha's death?"
And the next Conan:
"The spirit that appears on the day of Buddha's death, (The case)."
