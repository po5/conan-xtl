(Male) First of all we'll give you a nickname.
How about Mustache?
It doesn't look bad on you.
(Kogoro: thinks) "Mustache? Really?"
And how do I call you?
Gang leader, I guess.
Everyone refers to me by the nickname Brain.
"Brain? You are what you think, huh?"
And listen to something, Brain: how do you see it?
Do you find that I have successfully passed the entrance exam?
I welcome you.
We have full confidence... in your abilities, Mustache.
(Kogoro) Hey?
Yes.
I have successfully infiltrated the gang.
Very soon we will be able to dismantle this gang of robbers...
thanks to the expertise of the great detective Kogoro Mouri.
Ah!
Ah...
"Hey... Hey! Mouri? What's up? Can you hear me?"
How bad it tastes to me, great detective.
"Hey!"
"Can you feel me?"
"The years we've spent together are a springboard."
"And we go full speed ahead without slowing down."
"Detective Mouri is behaving in a strange way."
"The infiltration mission takes a dangerous turn."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The great detective, between a rock and a hard place (part one)."
-Mm?
-I see you've woken up.
You have a beautiful daughter.
What?
Ran!
Why did you...?
What does this represent?
-From me?
And may I know what you want?
It's all up to you.
Straight to the point, just as I'd expect from a great detective.
Come on, speak up.
A little more and you manage to infiltrate our gang.
It doesn't matter that I've discovered you.
You'll pass yourself off as a safecracking expert,
just like you planned, and you'll work with my men.
Yes, because for some time now...
I suspect that among my men is the murderer of my son.
That's why I want you to put your detective skills to good use
and find out who he is before dawn the day after tomorrow.
What do you mean?
The day after tomorrow, you say?
I plan to leave here the day after tomorrow morning.
That's why that's the deadline I'm giving you to do what I just told you to do.
Why do I have to find out who the murderer is?
Are you flying to avenge your son's death, or what?
You don't have to do anything about that.
But if you refuse to do what I've ordered you to do...
you will never see your beloved daughter again.
If I do not give any order to the murderer
I do not give any order to the assassin I have hired,
instead of leaving your daughter alone,
he will do his job and kill her without mercy.
You had it all figured out from the beginning, didn't you?
You bastard.
-Eh?
-But I have full confidence...
...in the detective skills of the great Kogoro Mouri.
What?
"What do I do now, Conan?"
The father hasn't arrived yet
and, on top of that, he won't answer my cell phone.
I haven't heard anything for a whole day.
The first thing you have to do is calm down.
Besides, you said he told you he had a lot of work, right?
Yes.
And that he had to meet with a client.
And he didn't tell you the name of the client or the place of the meeting?
Well, look... I didn't ask her either.
What an ass!
But, come to think of it, there was something wrong with her yesterday,
she was behaving strangely.
Goodbye, father, see you this evening.
I suppose you'll come home for dinner.
Eh... Well, I really don't know for sure yet.
Oh, well...
You'll go for a drink when you get home from work, then?
Huh?
I promise I'll come home.
I promise I will.
I'll come home.
Don't suffer for me.
But...
Goodbye, Father.
Goodbye, Father.
I suppose you've already spoken to Inspector Megure, haven't you?
Of course, just a moment ago.
Listen, I'm very worried...
because I haven't heard from my father since yesterday.
That's right. That's right.
Well...

Since yesterday, you say?
Th-The truth is no, sorry.
Do you know anything, you?
But if you're so worried,
I'll tell my men to look for him.
Don't suffer, he'll come home, okay?
Au, bye, sweetie.
But, listen, it's just that...
Come to think of it,
Inspector Megure has been behaving strangely too.
"There's something going on here. I don't know what it is, but something's up."
"Eh? Maybe there is..."
"April 25 at 10 o'clock.
Terrace of the Hotel Mole cafeteria."
Hey, please.
Yesterday morning I passed by here
and I thought I saw the great detective Kogoro Mouri on the terrace.
Eh?
Of course it was.
Can you confirm if it was him?
Who are you?
Do you know if he was meeting someone?
It's just that I'd like to ask
if you wouldn't mind handling a very important case.
And I thought maybe he's staying at the hotel.
An important case?
Ha-ha-ha!
I'm sorry, my boy, but no, he's not staying at the hotel.
Yesterday he sat alone at that table for a while.
-Huh?
Ah, thank you very much.
-Sir, there's a call for you.
Yes, tell me?
What's that?
Don't take a cab right away?
Why do you say that?
Okay, we got it.
We got it.
Boy, do you know if there's a subway station around here?
"It's strange."
"Maybe he wanted to throw off someone who was following him."
"Or maybe someone instructed him to go somewhere."
"Oysters. What station was he supposed to go to?"
"Right now I don't have any clues that can help me."
(Man) Where would there be a cab stand?
-So much.
(Man) -You in your head, over here?
According to this sign, there is one at the exit.
(Kogoro) "Don't you take a cab right away?"
Why "right away"?
(Kogoro) Sure.
Now I understand what you did in Kogoro.
Ah.
You mean the great detective Kogoro Mouri?
Oh, you do?
I just brought him in yesterday.
Could you take me to the place where you told him to drop you off, please?
Yes, of course.
I'll be right there.
"He came here?"
Huh?
"Is that your cell phone?"
"Gee, that's unlucky! All the information's gone."
"There are footprints."
Ah!
But who do you think you are, you bastard?
-Huh?
-What are you doing? -What are you doing?
Quiet, man.
Don't look at me.
Put me down!
Come on, come on, Nose, put me down!
Enough shouting.
Let's get to work.
We've got work to do.
Welcome, Lips, as aggressive as ever, eh?
And your men, as useless as ever.
Some things never change.
-Hey, you, watch what you say!
-Penjats...
Ah!
Do you want me to smash it with one blow?
See if you're brave enough to touch me.
We have instructions from the Brain.
For this job we'll be one more person.
What, how are we doing?
I introduce myself: I'm the Mustache.
"It's obvious that Mr. Mouri has been here."
"What's he doing, this, on the floor? And the device looks new."
"What were they supposed to project?"
"It smells burnt."
"It looks... It looks like a sewer map."
Excuse me.
Can we stop at a gas station?
What's the matter? What's the matter?
Are you so nervous you have to go to the bathroom, or what?
No, it's not that.
I want to buy some gum.
Now you want gum?
If I don't chew gum,
I can't concentrate to crack a safe.
"I've got to stay alone for a while anyway.
to get in touch with the outside."
-Here, take it.
-Huh?
-Ah... Thank you.
-Now we don't need to borrow any parts.
"Shit."
-Oh, no!
-Ah!
I won!
(Shot)
(People: shouting)
Do not move.
Freeze or I'll shoot.
-Don't move from where you are, understood?
-If you move, I'll kill you.
I won't say it again: if I see someone move, I'll kill him.
(Shot)
(People: shouting)
Don't move.
Freeze or I'll shoot.
-Don't move from where you are, understood?
-If you move, I'll kill you.
I won't say it again: if I see someone move, I'll kill him.
(Mouth) If you want to live, put the wallets here.
-Come on, hurry.
-Put-in the bag.
Empty the pockets.
They carry guns and daggers.
How can that be?
Where did these come from?
(Kogoro) "Takagi, Sato, the situation has changed."
"Don't make any false moves, please."
(Eyes) Mustache, let the show begin.

With the money our customers have on them, we have nothing.
Come on.
They say there's no safe you can't open.
-Yes.
Yeah, sure, that's right.
-We're counting on you.
"But... what do I do now?"
What's wrong?
Well, it's just... it's the first box of this kind I've seen.
-What?
Ah.
-I see you don't chew your gum.
May I ask who you are?
(Let me go.
I'll kill you.
That's it!
(Man) Huh?
Stop!
Where are you going?
Inspector, hurry, please.
Come on, let's go!
Understood.
Go ahead, boys.
(Men) Come on, forward!
Come on!
Everybody freeze!
But what's going on here?
-Oh!
-Mr. Mouri?
(Man) In Mouri?
Is it really?
It's Kogoro?
-How is it possible?
-It's unbelievable.
(People: whispering)
No, no, what are you saying?
Everything has an explanation, do you hear me?
A detective?
Now I understand everything.
Police!
Freeze!
Nobody move, okay?
No!
Wait, inspector.
Please don't do this.
Go on.
Congratulations, Mouri.
Very well done.
- (man) Everybody freeze!
-Wait.
-Who are these?
-Abaixeu the weapons.
-Stop.
Don't do it!
-I'll kill them all.
Get down!
Come on, everybody on the ground!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Somebody help me stop this!
Aaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ow!
Oh!
Aah! Aah!
Ah! [Laughing]
Now, boys.
Take them all!
The robbers are getting away!
But... may I know where you're going?
The infiltration mission is over!
(Takagi) An infiltration?
You'll infiltrate the gang of robbers?
(Takagi) That's right.
Disguised like this, no one can deny that I look very much like
to this safecracking specialist who was recently arrested.
I'll convince them to book me and, once I'm in,
I'll collect all the evidence I can to incriminate them.
It's a unique opportunity.
If the mission is successful, we might be able to stop once and for all...
the members of this gang of robbers
that we've been chasing for years and we haven't been able to close the prison.
And if they find out who it is, what will happen?
To prevent this from happening,
you two, agent Takagi and agent Sato,
will enter the casino as customers.
-But there is one other thing.
-All right, you understand.
I don't want my daughter to know anything about this mission.
The last thing I want is for her to suffer for me.
Understood.
Why did you accept it, such a dangerous mission?
Because I guess, deep down, you still feel like a cop.
"Wow. I don't know why I reacted like that."
"If everything goes wrong, I won't be able to play detective again."
Inspector, there's no one on this side.
Damn.
Where did they run off to?
(Sato) There's no other way out, as far as we know.
"The ventilation grille."
"A rope ladder."
"They probably came in through here, too."
(Sato) Sure.
That burned map of the sewer.
Not to escape.
Yes!
Hey.
Look!
Let's go!
Chiba, get a map of the sewer.
If we can, we'll stop them at the exit.
Yes.
Not to escape.
But I still can't understand why the hell he has fled with them, in Mouri.
"I can't change strategy. I can't put the Ran in danger."
I'm sorry to hear that, Inspector.
"They were planning to flee through the sewers."
"I've discovered them."
"And I'll catch them."
"I'm sure she's a member of the gang, too."
That's the getaway car they've got ready for the getaway.
What a disaster of a safecracker!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is this one coming with us?
I think it's better to kill him right here.
Yes, but we can't.
The Brain has hired her, we can't get involved.
- (police: sirens)
-He's the one who'll decide what we do.
- (eyes) In the car!
- (sirens)
(sirens) - Hurry up.
Come on, get in.
-Bullshit!
We also have them ahead.
Let them put roadblocks on all the roads.
Yes, sir. (Nose) We've got the cops off our backs.
- (Nose) We've got the cops off our backs.
- (Mouth) We've done it.
(Eyes) Thanks to the Lips.
Bring us where you had planned.
- (Car: Hard braking)
- (Lips) First I have to do something.
What is it, Lips?
I noticed that the car was going a little backwards.
Like we had a stowaway in the trunk or something.

-What's wrong with you?
-Are you sure?
(Nose) What's wrong?
"No."
Everyone alert.
He-he-he-he!
-Okay.
(Phone)
(phone)
(Phone)
Mouri Detective Agency.
Ah, Inspector Megure.
What?
Father and Conan?
Both of them?
"I'm sorry, Ran."
"We didn't think it would go like this. But don't worry."
"All the troops we have available are looking for them."

(Brain) I want to know the truth of what happened.
And that's why I've asked the great detective Kogoro Mouri
to clarify once and for all who killed my son.
And it is impossible that he committed someone from the casino, this murder.
(Eyes) So you've come to the conclusion
that Boca and I killed him.
(Eyes) Run!
Do not go up!
Ran!
