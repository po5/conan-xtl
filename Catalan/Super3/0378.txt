Time capsules come out one after another.
Gathering secrets scattered here and there
I unearth the real culprit.
He looks like a child but has the brain of an adult and is Detective Conan!

"The doctor, the members of the Junior Detective League and me.
"We came together for a weekend trip to Kibiji and in Kurashiki,
"in Okayama Prefecture, to study ancient history."
"There, we find five people and one is killed."
"One member of the group ends up being investigated
"As a witness for the prosecution."
"Still, I had my doubts..."
"Sure, I know that."
"This way, the content of the message would change."
"The murderer is one of the four!"
"But... to make it more concrete who it is.
"We'll have to decipher the other two remaining codes...
"And we'll have to find the buried time capsules."
"The journey to solve the mystery of Momotaro. Part 2."
"I have no definitive proof,
"But if the motive for the murder has to do with the time capsules,
"Then..."
We continue to crack the codes!
I'm with you!
Let's finish what we started!
Even if it's no treasure,
there is something that prevents me from leaving it!
We will continue.
Sure, me too!
But how will we do it?
They've burned the codes, haven't they?
-Hm-hm!
-Ah, that's right.
I thought this might happen.
Surprise!
I, at Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya, took note!
Very good, very good, Mitsuhiko!
"Mitsuhiko, good job."
Let's go!
The Junior Detective League is back in action!
Yes!
This is... an umbrella.
And then... This is the sun, right?
You mean you copied it right?
Ah!
I know what it is!
"Yes, exactly!"
-What's he doing now?
-The doctor is taking a long time.
Oh, look, isn't it this car?
Doctor, he's late!
Ah, excuse me, children.
Where do you want me to take you?
In the city of Soja, also known as Kibiji!
Right away!
Kibiji?
To be more precise, we are going to Koumorizuka's tomb.
It's a very famous tomb in Kibiji.
Oh, right!
I see what you mean.
That's right!
It's an umbrella!
In Japanese it's called the same as the name of the site!
It's true!
(Agasa) Gee, a little more and I forget.
I have some news about the case.
It seems that right now they are questioning Mr. Saruwatari
as a witness for the prosecution, instead of Mr. Onitsura.
Eh?
Logically, he is denying all charges.
He can't be!
This is nonsense.
(Agasa) "They have found out that there was a change.
"A change?"
"In the casting of the play."
"Mr. Onitsura's memory wasn't very good at remembering the text.
"So he and Mr. Saruwatari switched roles."
"Therefore, there is a possibility that that" ONI ",
"The ogre that appears in the message,"
is referring to Mr. Saruwatari.
He has no alibi and was the one who had been arguing with the victim.
It looks like he will be arrested shortly.
It seems to me that monkeys and dogs... should not have much of a future.
I thought so!
But the legend of Momotaro collaborates to defeat the ogre.
But these are just fairy tales.
What a disappointment, by golly.
"Anyway, we have to hurry!"
"We have to check all the capsules."
(Ayumi) How nice!
(Genta) This place makes you nostalgic.
(Mitsuhiko) In ancient times,
they called this place the country of Kibiji.
and they said it was as powerful as the Yamato imperial court!
-(Ayumi) It's great!
- (Ayumi) Oh!
(Mitsuhiko) It's the elongated tomb in the shape of a key lock, isn't it?
I'm sure we'll be able to get in.
How scary!
(Agasa) They say that this tomb of Koumorizuka,
was built in the 6th century.

"And they've also found many more tombs in Kibiji."
I'm already starting to feel like we're looking for treasure!
(Ayumi) It's so vast that we'll have a hard time finding it.
(Mitsuhiko) We'll find it because we're the Junior Detective League.
"(Ayumi) Besides, I'm sure they've dug it up before....
"So it'll be easy to find."
I've already found it!
-Yes, again.
-A new one?
Someone has dug it up before.
(Genta) What's this?
This is all there is.
Is it another code?
We've been tricked, Mitsuhiko!
That code was a hoax.
-You mean it was a fake?
-What?
A hoax?
Yes, look carefully at that code.
There's a closed umbrella under the sun.
There's no need to use it.
(All) What?
In other words, it's useless.
The real one is this new code here.
Mm... The door of a temple.
And what's this?
A pan for cooking rice?
(Ayumi) And on top... there's a peach?
The door of a temple, a rice pan and a peach.
(Ayumi) It rings a bell.
-Kibitsu Temple?
-It's Kibitsu Temple!
(Mitsuhiko) Yes!
"Yes! It's the place where they worship at Kibitsuhiko-no-Mikoto,
"The hero of the legend, who exterminated the demon Ura!"
"The origin of Momotaro!"
You've studied it very well.
I'm in awe, really.
I see it now.
The peach is in reference to Momotaro
and the temple door refers to the temple.
-That's...
-What's the role of the pot?
I guess we'll find out when we get there.
I'll wait for you here.
(Children) It's not fair!
(Children) What?
Yes!
We do track, Junior Detective League!
-I'm so hungry.
-I'm exhausted.
Hey, Conan!
Wait, Conan!
All right, let's go!
-We don't need to run so much!
-Wait!
I'm starving!
-Now I get it!
-A rice casserole.
Yes.
According to the sound of the rice pot,
we can tell whether you'll be lucky or not.
Oh!
Looks interesting!
Eh?
That's great!
It must be somewhere around here!
I'm sure they've dug it up before too!
That'll be a good sign!
Of it...
(Genta) It's here!
(Mitsuhiko) Looks like this one wasn't fake.
(Genta) But there's no garbage inside.
(Ayumi) Poor thing.
Don't be like that.
That's right, it was her treasure 15 years ago.
"Shunyi, rest in peace."
(Genta) In Shunyi.
(Mitsuhiko) He's the boy who died in that accident, right?
(Mitsuhiko) Sure!
All the notes on the time capsules we've found so far,
they were talking about Shunyi!!
"Yes. It's very likely."
"This means that the remaining time capsule..."
We go back to Kurashiki again?
Is this the petal of a flower?
This is the pistil... and that's the stem.
But it's all scattered.
Oh, wait!
Maybe we should put it all together!
This should be... a water lily?
That's right!
A water lily!
What if you mean Kurashiki?
-Where is it?
-It's there!
- (Genta) The Ohara Museum?
- (Mitsuhiko) It's here!
(Mitsuhiko) They're water lilies.
How beautiful!
So, the capsule is here...
No... it wasn't long ago that they planted the water lilies here.
They did it in 2000
to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the foundation.
The water lily code refers to a painting by a famous artist named Monet.
whose name was Monet.
Surely it must be found somewhere near the main building.
Oh!
This is too big.
It's been so easy so far, but...
What's the matter?
Walk 25 more steps.
Look... the code words say to walk 25 more steps.
Could you be referring to this statue?
Got it!
That means it's 25 steps ahead!
Eh? (Ayumi) I've found it!
(Ayumi) I've found it!
Fantastic, Ayumi!
That's great!
You've figured it out!
But how strange...
There's no note inside here.
Isn't that strange?
"I thought so."
What's this?
It was taped to the bottom.
The envelope is different from the ones we've seen so far.
"This is...?"
(Tsuyama) Understood.
So you are acquaintances of Mr. Mouri,

that famous detective called the Sleeping Kogoro.
Mouri?
-That famous detective...
-Kogoro.
Mr. Mouri has contacted us
and told us to ask you for details, Mr. Agasa.
Agasa?
Dr. Agasa?
Dr. Agasa?
I heard that you are even better than Mr. Mouri.
Let's see, and what about this famous Mr. Kogoro?
At this point he still wants nothing from us?
"I'm counting on you, doctor!"
About that...
Well, it's true.
He-he!
Now let me begin my deduction.
As for Mr. Saruwatari, who we believe will be arrested shortly,
the fact is that he is innocent.
The real culprit is someone else!
I already told you!
What?
You mean the perpetrator is Mr. Onitsura?
I didn't do it!
Calm down, calm down.
Let me explain things in order.
15 years ago, everyone put things they considered valuable
into a time capsule, exchanged them...
took them somewhere else and buried them.
I would like to confirm something now.
"Mr. Momoi hid Miss Seiko's capsule.
"In the Hinom watchtower."
"Seiko hid Mr. Onitsura's capsule.
"In the garden of the Ohashi residence."
"Mr. Onitsura hid Mr. Saruwatari's capsule here."
"Mr. Saruwatari hid the Yayoi's capsule."
"Or rather a fake capsule," to Komorizuka,
"And the real capsule in Kibitsu Temple."
Mr. Momoi's capsule was hidden in the Ohara Art Museum.
And you hid it, Miss Yayoi.
Members of the Junior Detective League have unearthed the capsules.
The problem is that each capsule had been dug out
before the Detective League arrived at each of the locations.
The killer wanted to make it look like someone had snuck into the school.
There is something we have not been able to understand.
How is it that Mr. Momoi's capsule has not been found with a note
that, instead, is to the capsules of all... the others?
Eh?
Ha-ha!
Burying this kind of thing didn't do much for me.
(Agasa) That's all.
(Agasa) No.
I'll bet you anything it was inside...
You pulled it out and it fell apart...
But it looks like the Seiko saw it.
Isn't that right, Mr. Momoi?
As you say?
-Na... Naoto!
-Did you do it?
Don't be ridiculous!
What proof do you have?
Let me explain.
First, the victim's message.
The most important question is the position of his finger.
The position of her finger?
Miss Seiko, the victim, was left-handed.
"It would be more normal if she had written her message with her left hand."
"But the position of her finger was strange."
Her should be next to the last "and"...
and not next to the first letter, the "o."
True.
By the way, left-handed people often write letters backwards.
Don't you think this is the same case?
That is, given the position of the finger,
you have not written it from left to right, but from right to left.
And if the erased part is connected to a line...
I got it!
There I did not write "Oni", but I was trying to write "Momo"!
(Agasa) Exactly!
The word "Oni" was not referring to
neither to Mr. Onitsura nor to Mr. Saruwatari,
but pointed to Mr. Momoi as the murderer.
This is nonsense!
They're just imagining it!
I even have an alibi!
(Agasa) Yayoi.
You were walking with Mr. Momoi in the Bonavista district.
You said you only separated for 5 minutes to go to the bathroom, right?
Yes.
Once you see this, there's nothing to do...
Junior Detective League, can you guys continue?
Yes!
Ivy Square and the Bonavista district
are situated back to back.
"If you go in the front it looks like it's going to be far,
"But if you walk around the grounds inside, it's very close."
(Ayumi) It takes one minute and 50 seconds to make one lap.
He probably had the Seiko wait for her here beforehand.
It looks like he came and killed her afterwards!
-Naoto?
-And then he came back ordinary.
No...!
That's a lie!
(Agasa) "And after he murdered Seiko,

"It's been digging up the capsules from all over this region."
"Surely it must have taken him an hour to do it."
"The time he committed the crime would be two o'clock in the afternoon."
"On the other hand, wasn't Yayoi unreachable for an hour?"
Answer me, miss.
It's true.
She told me she wanted to check something
and that she wanted to go to some bookstores.
It's just an assumption!
You don't have a single proof of what you say!
There is proof... in your wallet!
What?
In my wallet?
You, the murderer, came into the school to make it look like
that Mr. Onitzura, the alleged murderer,
had taken what was in the victim's wallet.
Since you couldn't get rid of it, you put it... all in your wallet.
He has it all on him, though, doesn't he?
Prove-me!
I want to see proof that I have the Seiko's money in my wallet.
Hey, Investigator Tsuyama, did you bring what I asked for?
Yes, that's what Mr. Mouri told me to bring.
This is it, isn't it?
(Agasa) Investigator Tsuyama, please check it.
Don't you see a bill inside that has something strange on it?
A strange thing?
This is...
This is... This doesn't mean anything...!
Just because a bill is dirty, does that make me a murderer?
Mr. Momoi, how do you intend to explain this?
Answer.
The stamp on the ticket has stained it.
And in your wallet there is only one of the two parts of the seal
that was found in the brochure of the art museum...
Ms. Seiko probably put the entry upside down
when she put it in her wallet.
Nothing conscious of it, you, Mr. Momoi,
left the brochure at the scene and took the tickets with you.
Thanks to the museum's admission stamp,
we can see that you took the ticket that matched.
Yes, Mr. Momoi, everything I am saying is absolutely true.
Seiko stuck its nose into what happened 15 years ago.
It started to investigate what happened... after these 15 years.
"Fifteen years ago."
"It all started then."
"Then, at Momoi, who was a kid,
"Some hooligans forced him to steal something from a store...
"And en Shunyi saw him..."
Momoi!
I thought he would tell on me.
That I would run to tell... the teacher..,
my parents...
(Car: braked)
"Young Momoi didn't explain anything to anyone about the whole incident."
"But because of his remorse,
"He wrote the truth on a piece of paper
"and put it in the time capsule."
(Momoi) "I graduated."
"I also stopped associating with those boys."
"I had no intention of ever digging up the time capsules again."
But then...
I got a call from the Seiko, saying, as I was leaving,
"He'd like you to dig up the time capsules."
You got into the school just for that piece of paper...
You didn't have to murder her!
All you had to do was throw the paper somewhere.
Hey, do you know where I am now?
Do you know the capsule I buried?
Well, I came looking for it and it had already been dug up.
You're the only one who could have done it, right?
You're the only one who knew I was going to dig up the time capsules.
Why would you do something like that?
Don't tell me he's... hiding some big news?
He was just being clever, as usual!
He just asked you a sarcastic question!
I was scared.
I felt like she already knew everything.
Miss!
I found this inside the last time capsule.
Mr. Momoi, you already feel what you have to say at the police station.
(Yayoi) Wait!
Please, all together... for the last time.
There is a place where we have to go.
You were the one who put this code inside the time capsule, right?
(Yayoi) In Shunyi... he asked me before he died.
That she wanted to go with all of us to bury the capsule.
But after the accident she was too scared
to look at what was in it.
That code is an anagram, right?
Yes, you transcribe the hiragana syllabary and reverse the order.
"Presserers-avance"?
"Pressegano-what"?
(Onitsura) The League of Peach Tree Adventurers.
That was the name of our group!
(Onitsura) We used to meet here.

(Saruwatari) Yes, we rehearsed our Momotaro play,
even when we had to wait for someone to arrive.
This is the one in Shunyi.
(Shunyi) "The Momotaro of en Momoi turned out great."
"Next time I'll play Momotaro and go with en Momoi."
"I'll make him stop paying attention to those boys who bother him!"
"But I won't say anything to the teacher or his parents."
"Whatever it takes."
"No way."
It's likely that Shunyi crossed the street in a hurry
because he wanted to help you.
Stop bothering my friend!
(Claxon)
(Yayoi) Only that I would have remembered this before...
(Saruwatari) Somehow, even though I was a child,
I knew that that wasn't a normal traffic accident.
But I couldn't say or do anything.
I'm as guilty as he is.
(Onitsura) And so am I.
"I didn't even feel anything."
"This makes me even more guilty."
Wow... Surely... I was probably making the face of an ogre.
The ogre in your heart can only be exterminated by yourself.
"Yes, because you are Momotaro."
(Ayumi) You come and listen to me.
Eh?
From the lovers?
Very well!
Conan, you're my Momotaro now!
(Ayumi) What?
Don't smoke.
What's wrong with us?
-And at Mitsuhiko it's the water ogre!
-At Genta it's the pig...!
-What?
-What?
Of course it is!
I'm right.
"Hey, this is Son Goku!"
And I... I'm a frankfurter sausage?
A demon woman in a kimono?
"I mean, this chamber is insulated by snow."
"I wonder what the Ran and the others are doing."
"The legend of the demon woman in kimono."
"And the next Conan:
"The case of the demon in the kimono to the darkness of the snowy hot springs."
(Song in Japanese)
