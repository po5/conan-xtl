A giant wall blocks our way.
If we look at it with different eyes, it will be like a giant door!
A ball goes out of control
into a house where a case has been turned over.
There is something strange in this room!
It looks like a child, but it has the brain of an adult and it's Detective Conan!

(Door: knock)
(Knocks)
(Knocks)
Hey... Knock on the door.
(knocking) Hey... (knocking) Master!
(knocking) Oh!
What a surprise!
You're at Shimaki, the publisher!
Please... Don't say "what a surprise"!
Tell me, why did you come?
What is it?
But master, what are you asking me?
-I was joking, man!
I was joking. - You scared me...
-You came to look for the play? -Yes, I was.
That's right, Master Manda.
I beg you, don't make these jokes..,
or I'll get... a nervous breakdown.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Now...
There are only 2 hours left before the printing press opens
and they told me they can't wait.
Ah... 2 hours is more than enough.
Eh?
What do you mean 2 hours?
There's only the last mountain left to climb.
It happens that now I have to write the epilogue of the play.
You're serious?
Of course I am.
I beg you to have faith in me.
We've known each other for a long time.
Meee.
Hello, Nobel!
Watch out that the master doesn't escape, please!
I trust you!
If he tries to escape, I give you permission to sink your fangs into him.
Meee.
Very well, I'll be waiting in the lobby of that elevator.
When you've finished, please let me know.
Yes.
Okay. (chuckles)
He-he-he-he-he-he-he.
Mèèèèèèèèu.
A DISENGAGEMENT turned around, (FIRST PART)
Yes.
In a couple of hours.
Yes.
Looks like you'll be able to do it...
Uh, yeah.
He told me himself, so it'll be fine...
There's probably not going to be any problems, yeah...
Yeah, don't worry.
I'll have him write it down.
(Thinks) "On Genta Kojima, the prince of the towel....
"And the ace of First B of Teitan elementary school,
"Wants to go unbeaten."
(He thinks) "2 'out' and bases loaded!"
"Now, in Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya, he's in top form..."
"He throws out the first pitch!"
It's mine!
Hooray!
I've made it!
Take over, Edogawa!
What do you want me to do?
Change it!
The ball, boy!
Very good!
Very good!
Leave on my account!
Hurray!
Conan, you're great!
Yeah, if this were soccer...
Do me a favor and catch it with the glove!
This is not soccer.
Conan!
Let's see..., are you laughing at baseball?
That's right, Conan!
Let's see if you're serious!
Annoying!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Sorry, guys.
"What do you want me to do?"
"In soccer, I'm used to controlling the ball with my feet."
Master?
I was waiting for it.
I was so impatient to see it.
Master Manda, what are you doing like this?
Well, don't tell me you've disguised yourself again as a hotel bellboy
and that you've run away again.
You love to play the game.
Yes, because he was locked in there,
and this is the quickest and easiest way to get out of there.
(Cat: meows)
This way, nobody recognizes me.
Nobel, you came with him?
Nobel!
Nobel!
All right, good boy.
It's me, your friend.
If he doesn't have you or me around,
he starts making a fuss and ends up hurting himself.
Well...
That aside... Do you have the play?
Yes, I have it completely finished.
I finished it more than 6 hours ago.
How?
More than 6 hours ago?
But before I called you from the hotel
and he told me there was still a little bit more to go!
I was amused by the voice he used to make when he was desperate
and I lied to him with no bad intention.
Please don't take this the wrong way.
Haramoto, how could you think of that?
Man, it's not that bad either, Master,
it's very stressful for me too... to write in your place.

But, you know, obviously, I get a lot of money in return.
Here.
This is what I have done for this delivery.
As you asked me to do, I have done it with a happy ending.
Ah, thank you very much!
And another thing... you have spoken about me... to your publisher?
Yes...
After I deliver this to them,
we'll arrange a meeting at my house with the publishing house
to discuss what the next work will be like.
When we finish the meeting I plan to bring those publishers over here.
Oh!
Are you serious?
Thank you very much.
What a joy!
But come on, then let him make his debut,
I'll probably have to retire.
Don't worry!
I will continue to write for you from now on.
Besides, the ones I will write are detective novels,
a subject you don't touch!
And I will write it changing the style I use with you!
Mm?
Changing the style?
The truth is that I have almost finished it, the work of my debut!
If possible..., I'd like you to review it.
It's just like a play written by a different person.
But this way... I can finally belong to the circle of novelists.
Now that I realize it, you were a collector.
Yes, since I was a child I like to collect all kinds of things.
But now, what I'd most like to have...
is the Akutayama Prize for new women writers.
Because you are also a member of the jury,
I'll be able to take the prize, I guess.
If I don't start by taking this award,
I won't be able to start collecting
all the other awards there are!
Oh, that's right!
Speaking of collecting, today I got something I was missing.
Really?
It's wonderful to know... that you already have it all.
Well... bon appetit!
Au, Nobel, we're leaving.
Nobel!
Nobel!
Nobel!
Nobel!
Nobel!
Nobel, where have you been?
Where are you from!
Nobel?
Nobel?
Nobel.
Nobel!
Nobel!
Nobel!
Nobel!
Nobel!
Nobel!
Nobel, where have you gone?
(Thinking) "It's awful!"
"Hurry up, hurry up... I have to go back."
Master... Master Manda.
"I have to go back to the hotel right away!"
Maestro... Master Manda!
"My alibi!"
Master, it's been 2 hours already!
"I don't know what to do! Shit!"
Maestro!
Master Manda!
Answer!
"What do I do?"
Master ?!
Master Manda!
(Door: tricks)
Master!
Maestro Manda!
(CLEC, CLEC)
Maestro!
What a desire to scream!
A moment ago I finished writing it and now I was revising it!
Ah, it was that!
Excuse me.
You can rest assured.
Despite being my own work, I think it is very well written.
It has.
Excuse me.
Thank you very much!
You've done a good job!
Ah, come to think of it... what happened to the Nobel?
He always comes out to welcome me.
He's very quiet now.
Oh, yes... It's just that... He's fallen asleep in his box.
In his box?
Yes, it looks like it.
Good.
Now I'll go back to the publishing house and examine the work.
Wait...
If you have to examine, do it in this room,
and send all the data to print from here.
That way you'll go faster.
And then, while they're doing the first printing proof,
you can come to my house.
I'd like to talk about the concepts of the new novel.
Thank you,
but nothing is planned yet as far as a new novel of yours.
I am sure you will like the next one very much.
The next one will surely deal with a subject I have never touched yet.
Detectives?
His specialty was historical novels!
Are you kidding me?
No.
Aren't you surprised?
I've wanted to write one of these for a long time.
Yes?
I can see it now!
This is going to be very interesting!
I hope I can see it soon!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Maestro, please.
Please give me more details.
The truth is that I have already defined the character of the detective.
When we get home I'll start explaining it to you.
Au, that's not fair.
Tell me something, don't leave me in suspense.
Well... About it...
By the way, I think the Nobel is too quiet.
Nothing happened to him?
Oh.
Well... It just so happens that this morning has been very busy...
I guess he must be tired.
Don't worry about it.
Well...

Please wait here for a moment.
It's a bit messy;
I'll tidy up in a jiffy.
Yes, you understand.
I'll wait.
Nobel.
Nobel!
Nobel!
Oh!
Hello, Nobel!
You've come home!
You're a good boy!
Mèèèèèèèèu.
Now it's perfect.
Meee.
He-he-he-he-he!
I've been able to commit a perfect murder.
-Right, Nobel? -Mèèèèu.
(Cracking)
What happened?
What was this brittle?
Eh?
I do not know.
It looks like a window from the house across the street broke.
(Doorbell: ding-dong)
From what I can see, some kids who were playing baseball...
have thrown the ball unintentionally.
(Ding-dong)
What the heck!
Genta, you've bitten too hard!
What do you want me to do?
The ball flew away.
You should have told the ball where it could go!
No one seems to answer. (Ding-dong)
I thought they were at home. (Ding-dong)
Maybe, the ball hit the head of the man who lives here...
and he lost consciousness.
(Ding-dong) What?
Even if it really touched her,
we wouldn't be able to check unless we went into his house.
-Wait, maybe we shouldn't... -Haibara?
It looked open to me already.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
"It's not a very good excuse to go in, either, but..."
Let's see, the room where the ball came in must be...
Wait, wait, wait!
Conan, you mean you can come in?
Conan, this is breaking and entering!
Conan...
(Mitsuhiko) Haibara.
I guess in this case we have no choice but to go in.
(All) Sorry for the inconvenience!
(Mitsuhiko) Excuse me! Anybody here?
-Hello, is anyone there? -We are not dangerous!
Eh?
There's something strange about this room.
Yes, I notice something strange.
What is it?
You only have to look to see it.
It's that.
The toy cars, the dolls...
and the books on the shelf are all turned upside down.
Why is that?
What's upside down?
Don't... don't tell me!
Was it because of my ball?
Maybe there has been a shock to the space-time continuum
and a supernatural phenomenon occurred!
"Mitsuhiko, something's not right, but don't you dare."
The ball that has touched Genta.
"This time I don't plan to lose! Genta, now I'll throw!"
"Play it if you can!"
"I can give anything!"
-Edogawa! -Conan!
What?
Yes!
"Oops, no, this one's coming hard!"
"The fool in Genta has bitten him in the arm, what an animal!"
It just so happened that the ball came into the house
through one of the open windows.
But didn't she feel a crack?
It must have broken a vase
or something else that was inside.
What?
Are you serious?
No!
What am I going to do if it's an expensive vase?
And I've already spent all my pay for the week.
Well, I guess to find out how much the vase cost,
we'll have to ask the person in here.
Besides, I could have sworn the ball came into this room.
Of course..,
we can ask her as long as...
Oh...
...you can talk to the person in this room...
-Oh! -Oh!
Ah!
(At the same time: call out)
(Ayumi) How is she?
Unfortunately..., with the "post-mortem" stiffness that I notice,
it must have been an hour or two since he died.
And if we look at the fragments around his body, it looks like he's been hit with a knife,
it looks like he's been hit with a vase.
What?
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't say it's my fault?
My ball hit the vase on the shelf...
and then hit this poor gentleman in the head?
-Ge... Genta...- Ge... Genta...
I'm lost!
What shall I do?
What shall I do?
What shall I do?
You fool!
The ball, you threw it a moment ago!
This happened to him... an hour or two ago!
(Thinking) "What shall I do? What shall I do?"
Besides, it looks like your ball has touched that jug over there.
-People, what a break! How nice.
So, someone has hit you from behind, right, Conan?
Yes.
She got hit with the vase when he was looking at this drawer.
Eh?
How do you know... that he was looking at the drawer, Conan?
Have at it.
The shaft between the table and the edge of the drawer...

is slightly inclined, you see?
This shows that at the moment he has been stung from behind,
"He has fallen on top of the drawer with all his body weight!"
Normally, one opens a drawer when looking for something inside....
or to take out something you want to look at.
-Now I get it! -Conan, you are very clever!
But what doesn't fit is the one in the next room.
Yes, all the toy cars,
the dolls and the books on the shelves are upside down.
If it was the killer's doing, what was the point of him doing it?
(Teacher) Ep, children!
Children, let's see, what are you doing here?
Oh!
Haramoto!
The person on the floor over there is Haramoto!
Haramoto, please!
Haramoto!
Haramoto...
What the hell are you doing?
Call the police and get an ambulance!
Yes.
Right away..., Master.
Children, you must leave this room too!
Hurry up!
Understood.
(Cat: meows)
(cat meows) Oh!
It's a cat!
Mèèèèèèèèu.
Let's see, where did this one come from?
Hello, kitty!
Meow.
(Shouting) Children, don't touch my cat!
(screaming) Oh...
Au, come out, children.
When the police arrive, explain what happened.
(screaming) Okay?
-What's wrong with him? -You didn't have to talk to us like that. -You can say it now!
You can say it now!
-All right? -Yes, we got it! -Yes, we have understood!
Stop this and look at them at once!
That's right.
In this room there is something even stranger!
The shelves!
Look at them!
The dolls, the miniature cars and the books are all upside down!
Don't you see?
But why?
Oh!
Now I understand.
It wasn't Haramoto who turned them upside down, but the murderer.
And the next Conan: "A denouement turned upside down, (second part)"
