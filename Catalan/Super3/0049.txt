"The cases he investigates in Conan get more and more complicated."
"Today, at last, in Shinishi he reappears."
"Will he have time to talk to the Ran?"
"He has the brain of an adult,
and he's... Detective Conan!"

DETECTIVE CONAN
"In Heiji Hattori, a young detective from Kansai,
"He shows up at Kogoro Mouri's office
and seems to want to challenge Shinichi."
"Coinciding with this fact,
"Kimie Tsujimura, wife of a diplomat,
wants her son's girlfriend to be investigated."
"In the home study we found the diplomat dead of poisoning."
"The murder took place in a locked room."
"In Hattori begins to find evidence and unravels the mystery,
but appearances can be deceiving."
"I have a cold and drank the liquor given to me at Heiji."
"My fever rises and I faint."
"But this fever is not normal. Something is wrong."
"I'm hot! My heart will explode!"
(Heiji thinks) "What, Shinichi?!"
"Do you have anything to say about my deductions?"
"Show up or I'll solve the case alone."
The murder of a diplomat, part two
And the murderer?
This, Hattori, tell us who the murderer is.
Don't be impatient.
(Think) "What's wrong with you, Shinichi? You won't accept my challenge?"
"All right, we understand."
Quickly!
Hurry up!
The assassin must have taken 5 or 6 minutes
to kill the victim and set everything up.
The murder took place between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
The doctor is already here!
Conan!
Mrs. Tsujimura, who arrived at 4 o'clock and has been with us,
is ruled out as a suspect.
The butler is also ruled out,
because at that time, he was talking to a neighbor at the door.
Hey, where are you?
Conan!
Come on out!
And now we'll talk about Takayoshi and Yukiko.
Considering the time they've arrived,
and that we've talked to the butler,
it's been two minutes.
It can't be them.
Where did they go?
Gee, Conan!
Hey, Conan!
Where are you?
We are left with the person who has arrived at two o'clock
and who was watching TV in the next room.
Sir, this is for you!
I found the proof in the Japanese room.
It's a fishing line!
It is a special fishing line,
made of a very thin and very strong material.
You are a fishing enthusiast, you know what it is all about.
Besides, I remember when we were going up to the studio...
Please wait for me downstairs.
After committing the crime, you went to the Japanese room.
After committing a perfect crime.
This thread I found is the proof that you are the culprit!
Conan?!
Maybe I'm wrong?
Excuse me, have you passed this way, Conan?
No, Miss.
Speak up, sir!
It's true,
it was me.
(Think) "I won!"
It was me who...
murdered... my son...
No, this is not true.
(All) What?!
You're wrong, sir.
Oooooooh! Shinichi!
Shinichi... Shinichi...
(Think) "Is it him, Shinichi Kudo..."
(Thinks) "Is it him? Are you sure it's him? Shinichi... Shinichi!"
Where have you been?
You suddenly disappear and reappear like nothing!
I was so worried about you.
Donkey, why are you crying?
The Ran is right!
You show up here and tell me that I'm wrong?
And what have I been wrong about, according to you?
(Low) Ran, wait for me... Eh?
What's that?
No... I'll be long.
Shinichi...
Why aren't my deductions correct?!
Because the trick you just explained has no basis in fact,
it's totally impossible, Heiji.
What's wrong with you?
Hey, Shinichi, sorry to interrupt you,
but your explanation of the trick is very coherent.
We did the test with my pants.
First, we glued the head on the keychain, with tape.
We put the head with the needle on my pants.
And taking the two heads, he left the room.

Then he closed the door and pulled the thread with the needle.
The key automatically slipped into my pocket.
Then he pulled hard, and the thread came loose.
Then the thread is put away.
The test disappears, and the room is closed.
And you're sure that's where they say, the key, Inspector Megure?
Eh ?!
They said the key was in the victim's pants pocket.
Of course it is!
If you don't believe it, I'll prove it to you!
You see, in the inside pocket...
Wow!
How could it be?
I put it in the inside pocket, the fishing line!
Because when you put the key in it, the inspector was sitting down.
What do you mean?
The pocket folds up and it's more difficult to get the key in.
And before the key reaches the pocket,
the thread detaches from the tape.
If the victim was fat, it's even harder.
Now that you mention it, when I put my hand in the victim's pocket....
It's too tight, the pants.
But one attempt out of 10 might work, right?
No.
No matter how hard you tried.
Give it some thought.
What position was the key in the victim's pocket?
In what position?
Even if, by chance, the key was to end up,
there would only be the key ring.
It's impossible for the key and the key ring
fit in a pocket so small that it is folded.
If it was in that position, we can only deduce one thing.
That the killer has put the key in the inside pocket.
And the thread and needle I found in the Japanese room?
It's another trap the killer set for us.
He wanted us to suspect Grandpa.
I found 5 or 6 in different parts of the house.
The murderer has spread the fishing lines all over the house.
And he did it because we suspected Mr. Toshimitsu.
This man confessed that he killed her!
It was a lie.
He wanted to play along with the murderer and take the blame,
but I don't know why.
But listen, Sinichi, this room was locked.
You mean she committed suicide?
No, it wasn't suicide.
Although there is evidence of staging by the murderer.
But what set-up?
The murderer's.
Wasn't there an opera playing when they found the body?
And there were books in front of the dead body.
The opera was to avoid feeling the groaning that the victim could make
when he was pricked with the poisoned needle.
The books served to hide the victim's face.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
What nonsense!
And what eyes and what ears the murderer wanted to deceive, eh?
Well, Hattori...
Yours.
What do you mean?
Not only Hattori's, but those of everyone who came in.
So... this means...
The murderer is the first person to approach the victim.
That's right.
The murderer is...
It's you!
The murderer is...
...Mrs...
Mrs. Tsujimura!
-She's killed her husband? -But why?
Does this mean that...
when we entered, the victim was alive?
That's right.
His wife would have given him some sleeping pills to put him to sleep.
She made it look like she was waking him up,
but in reality, she was sticking him with the needle.
No one could have noticed.
She must have given him a sleeping pill and some poison.
The victim died instantly,
and gave us the impression that she was asleep.
He prepared the opera and the books to disguise everything.
But the sleeping pills would have given away his set-up,
if we had examined the corpse.
(Heiji) No.
We shouldn't have thought ill of her.
We were convinced that the victim was already dead when we found her.
We should have thought that she had been put to sleep so that she would not resist.
You had a detective come here to suppose
that we wouldn't imagine that she would commit the crime in front of everyone.
That way, she was ruled out as a suspect.
Isn't that what you mean?
You should show us some proof of what you say.
No one has seen that Mrs.
Tsujimura pulled out any needle.
Right, because when she entered the room,
she took out the poisoned needle without anyone seeing it.
Along with the key!
With... With the key?
Yes.
I'm sure your key ring is the same as the one the victim had.
Evidently, this key ring must also be opened, right, ma'am?

Would you mind showing us your key ring, Mrs. Tsujimura?
We would like to see what it looks like.
Madam, may I see it, please?
Eh?
What is it, this hole?
Probably, the poisoned needle was stuck in this hole
so we could pull it out in a moment.
You see, Inspector?
The key ring was ready.
This key ring is the definitive proof
that the murderer of the diplomat Tsujimura is his own wife!
But why would Mrs. Tsujimura kill her husband?
If my intuition serves me right, probably...
the motive...
is in this photograph!
A photograph from when she was young.
Oh!
Look closely, Inspector.
Mm?
Doesn't anyone remind you of her?
She looks a lot like Yukiko!
(Heiji) How can that be? Only the hair color is different.
Of course, we look a lot alike...,
me and Yukiko are...
We are mother and daughter!
Eh?!
But what are you saying now?
(Thinking) "No... I don't understand!"
Then, Mr. Tsujimura is...
No, the Yukiko is my first husband's daughter.
20 years ago, in Tsujimura,
used a man in Yamashiro as a scapegoat in a bribery case.
And he was forced out of office.
She is the daughter of Kenji Yamashiro.
Kenji Yamashiro!
He died in prison 15 years ago.
In Tsujimura he wanted to get rid of his rival and take over me,
who was Kenji Yamashiro's wife.
I didn't know what happened.
They arrested my husband,
and my daughter was taken away by his relatives,
and I couldn't get her back.
Kimie, I divorced my wife because of you.
I believed what she was telling me...
and I married that wicked man.
And then, one fine day,
in Takayoshi brought us a picture of Yukiko,
and I began to suspect it was her.
I thought it was a coincidence,
but in Tsujimura he had a strange reaction.
No, no, no!
Not this girl!
I can't allow you to marry that man's daughter!
"I stood still,
and forced him to tell me everything."
"And he explained to me how he had used Yamashiro."
And then, he told me that his father had also been involved.
Kimie, I'm sorry.
I've regretted it all my life.
I understand now.
You wanted to make up for your mistakes by falling into his trap.
You've accepted responsibility for the crime to purge your sins.
You don't need to play the saint, it won't do you any good!
That man died accused of a crime he did not commit.
And he will pay for it.
Takayoshi...
Yes, say.
I know I don't have the right to tell you this, but please...
Please take good care of Yukiko.
Yes.
(Heiji) Now I understand why he treated his daughter badly...
she did it so that no one would suspect that they were... mother and daughter.
(Coughs)
Hey, Shinichi!
Shinichi!
Shinichi!
Are you all right, Shinichi?
Ah, don't worry, it's just a cold.
Kudo, how could you know so much about this case?
You were spying on us, weren't you, Shinichi?
Don't be an ass.
That little boy explained it all to me.
At Conan?
Yes.
He told me there was an unknown detective from Osaka,
to come quickly.
That's why I solved a case and took the current train.
Liar!
You are absolutely right!
It's strange that you never ask me how I am when you call me.
You always wait for me, don't you?
You used to laugh at me, when you saw me worried!
You're so mean!
Come on, Ran!
Why are you doing this to me?
I was so... so...
Don't talk nonsense.
Aren't I a good detective?
I know how you are just by the tone of your voice.
Shinichi!
Wait, I'll go call the doctor!
I think you've beaten me to the punch on this one.
Shinichi, you're an investigative genius.
Your deductions have been smarter than mine.
Fool.
There are no winners and losers, no black and white...
in the investigation...
Because as always... there is only one truth.
You're right.
I was so obsessed with accounts that I've lost my way.
Shinichi!
You mean you just have a cold?
Shinichi!
Shinichi!
What's wrong with you?
Doctor!
Hurry up!
Geez, no... Hey!
Shinichi!
(Thinking) "The heart again..."
"It's so hot!"
"It feels like my bones are falling apart!"
Hey, Kudo...
(Thinks) "I'll be a little kid again?"

"Now that I had finally regained my real appearance."
"I'll go back to being a boy.... I'll be Conan again!"
Shinichi?
Ran!
You shouldn't move.
You're sick, Sinichi.
(thinks) "Gee, no."
"If I turn into Conan now, Ran will find out who I am."
"Ran!"
Shinichi!
Hey, there's only the jacket!
Where are you, Shinichi?
(Think) "Please don't turn around, yet."
"Please, just once..."
Shinichi?
"Let the Ran can feel... my real voice...
just... one more time!"
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Thinks) "Shinichi?"
"It must be in here."
Shinichiiiiii!
Conan!
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.
Where's this shirt?
Well, I was so sweaty, I put it on.
Ah... and have you seen Shinichi, over here?
Yes.
He had to solve another case and he left.
He changed and left.
He's such a jerk!
Hey, he also told me...
not to tell anyone that he had come...
solve... this case here....
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Come on, Conan!
Conan!
(Tune from "Step by step")
DETECTIVE CONAN
"After that fainting spell, I spent three days in bed."
"In Heiji Hattori went to Osaka."
"As I didn't want it to be known that I had solved the case,
the newspapers didn't say anything about Shinichi."
"That way, those men in black won't know I'm alive."
"Why had I regained my original appearance?"
"Wait a minute. That day..."
"In Heiji came to Kogoro's office...
and... and..."
"That liquor he brought..."
"I know! That must be it!"
"I drank that liquor and went back to the way I was before."
"There's still a lot left!"
"If with one drink I'm transformed for a while,
if I drink it all, I'll be like before for good."
Conan!
What are you drinking now?
I thought so, you're drinking liquor!
This is not done!
Little kids can't drink liquor!
"Donkey! I'm not a little kid!"
"But I'm still a minor."
Go change your clothes.
Your friends are here.
-Hello, Conan! -Conan!
Hey, Conan!
(Thinking) "These three again..."
(Ayumi) We were worried about you, so you didn't come to school.
Lucky you, you stayed at home.
I want to take a redredat too.
-People, you'll never get a redredat! Why?
-Because idiots don't redredat. -Shut up!
I'm glad you're well again.
(thinks) "Ah, everything's back to the way it was."
Why do we all have to go, in the library?
Man, because you've been sick,
and you haven't submitted your book review.
We'll help you do it.
Isn't that right, guys?
Yes! Yes!
"Let the Ayumi come even though I understand,
but the two of them are only coming because she's coming."
"Anyway, I'll have to make do."
"If I drink that liquor and go back to the way I was before,
I won't have to go with these creatures anymore."
"Maybe this will be the last time."
Mr. Tamada disappeared the night before last.
You idiot!
Don't turn on the lights!
I know where he's hiding the corpse!
In the next episode...
The library murder case
