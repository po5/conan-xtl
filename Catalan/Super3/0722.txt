I will not let you pass.
Oh!
You won't dodge me.
-Atura'l.
He's getting away!
Come here.
He's got it.
Goal!
Four to zero!
Yay!
You're the best, Conan!
How you like to make fools of us.
-The rules we have are unfair.
-Viva, viva!
Oh, are they?
We're playing three against two, you three and us two.
Besides, I'm forbidden to shoot with my right leg.
Well, we'll have to forbid you to shoot with your left, too.
And what do you want me to do?
Just play with my head?
No, no way, with your head on Conan it's even more dangerous.
Come on, let's go.
Then we'll ban you too.
Don't take it so hard, guys.
We've come out to distract ourselves
while we wait for the Christmas cake to be delivered to the doctor's house.
I figure we're good for a couple more hours.
Eh?
Mail!
Cheaters!
-Yeah.
-Teva.
Attention.
The special shot on Fig.
Oooh!
Ah!
-And now what catches you, Haibara?
-What luck!
Sorry, it's my fault, I didn't give you a good pass.
-What?
-No, it's not that.
I couldn't shoot because this little guy passed in front of me.
Come here, come here.
-A cat.
How cute!
Hastings?
But it's in Hastings!
-You know him, this kitten?
-Who?
Yes, he's a stray cat that hangs around district 5,
around the agency.
He's got a lot of confidence in Azusa,
the girl from the Poirot café,
and every night he goes to see her to get something to eat.
As he is often seen at the door of the Poirot,
they named him after Hercule Poirot's best friend.
Ah.
That's why it's called Hastings.
Are you sure he's an abandoned cat?
Because she's wearing a collar.
Before she was abandoned, she must have been a house cat.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Her claws are stuck to your dress and she's fraying it.
It's just that it's handmade.
Where does it have to go so fast anyway?
If he goes out into the street as scared as he is, he'll run over some car.
-Hurry up!
-We have to catch it.

"A cold and sweet delivery service (part one)"
- (Mitsuhiko) He's nowhere to be seen.
- (Genta) How strange!
Where has he gone?
Ah.
It's over there.
Behind the truck.
-What's he doing, hanging around the truck?
-Yes, that's right.
-Mail!
-You're kidding, he's gone inside.
He must have smelled fish
or whatever this truck's carrying.
I don't know, but we've got to get her out anyway.
There's no one out front, guys.
Well, we'll have to go in and look for it, I guess.
Come on, let's go!
-Of course, it's a refrigerated truck.
-Oh, man, it's cold! -Oh, man, it's cold!
Hastings.
Where are you? (Hastings: meows)
- (Hastings: meows)
-Hastings.
-Hastings.
-Mira'l.
-You can tell.
-He likes to be begged, this one.
Come on, Hastings.
Come on, Hastings. Let's go.
Oh, man.
You left your door open again?
Yeah, sorry.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-Go carefully.
U... one moment.
We're in here!
Wait, I thought I heard a child's voice.
We're next to a playground,
it must be full of children playing and screaming.
Yes, that must be it.
The truck started and we got stuck!
-We're freezing in here.
-We're in danger.
We're in danger.
Don't worry, guys.
Look at the pile of boxes left to be delivered throughout the day.

When they stop and reopen the door, we get out and that's it.
Hey... Hey, hey, hey!
Ah!
We've stopped.
- (truck: stops)
Those two are in for quite a surprise,
when they see us get out of here.
I hope they won't be angry.
If we explain to them why we came in, I imagine they'll understand.
Hold it right there!
I won't come out of here even if they kill me.
Haibara...
What's wrong with you?
Why are you wearing panties?
The thread that was hanging from my dress must have gotten stuck somewhere
and it's unraveled all over me.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Please turn off the light.
-Hurry up, we'll hide selected ones.
-Hey, they're coming.
Hey, where are you going now?
We have to deliver a package.
I thought I heard voices coming from inside.
-No, nobody.
-Let's go.
Who do you want there?
-Yes. -Yes.
-Let's get down to business.
Let's see, what we're talking about now is...
Mr. Sasagawa.
Beika Apartments, 205.
That's right, Mr. Sasagawa.
That's it, I got it.
This box.
An assortment of fruit.
Well, go make the delivery.
Take the package to the door
and make sure the recipient remembers the face you make.
It will be a very important testimony.
Yes, I know.
(thinks) "A witness?"
In the meantime,
I'll ask to go to the bathroom at the gas station next door.
Hey, shouldn't we make sure there's no one in here?
-I'm telling you, it's your imagination.
-I love the voices I've been hearing.
Yeah, but...
Don't be so afraid.
I assure you that he won't complain any more.
"He won't squeak anymore? Who?"
-Yes.
-Come on, go, go, heavy, go.
"It seems to me that this pair..."
If you want, you can wear my jacket.
-You're welcome.
-Thanks, it'll suit me just fine.
It's so cold!
If we stay here too long, we'll catch pneumonia.
Don't worry, now I dare to go out.
Of course you do.
Do you want to hold Hastings in your arms for warmth?
-Good thinking.
-It's warm.
Au, problem solved.
Next time they open the door, we can get out.
Yes!
No.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Huh? (Chuckles)
We're not the first
and we're not the only ones who got stuck in this truck.
(All) How?
(All) I don't know.
Who... who is this?
I have no idea who this is,
how she ended up in here or why she was killed,
but I think the culprits
are the two delivery guys driving the truck.
-What?
Really?
-What?
But... but why did they hide it in the truck?
Because it has a refrigeration system.
The cold will slow down the decomposition process of the corpse...
and delay the estimated time of death.
Even if it is later left somewhere else and someone finds it,
the delivery people will be able to claim
that they were working at the time of the murder.
That's why they bring the packages to the door,
so that the recipients will remember.
That way, later, when the police question the neighbors, they can all confirm the alibi of the murderer,
they will all be able to confirm the alibi of the culprits,
because they will have them very much in mind.
"And if one of them goes to the bathroom at every gas station,
it will show up on the CCTV footage."
"He'll be able to say he had a stomachache and no one will suspect anything."
And check this out.
Notice the box containing the body.
It has crushed corners and dirty sides.
This means that they come in to move the box every once in a while
to prevent the livor mortis from coming out.
Wait a minute.
Now, if the delivery people find out we're here...
Yes.
They'll leave us locked up in this refrigerated van
and we'll end up freezing to death.
That's tough!
-No.
We have to avoid it at all costs.
We hide behind the door, and when they open it, we jump out.
-What?
-It can't be.
Under normal conditions we could escape,
but with our legs stiff from the cold
I don't think we'd get very far.
Don't worry, don't worry.
Why don't we take
these two murderers in prison... between all of us?
And what, how are we going to do that?
Do you have a plan to capture these two men?
Yes, Conan, tell us.
We alone can do nothing.

How?
We will have to ask for help from outside.
With a cell phone.
We will use it to call Takagi and explain the situation.
We'll tell him that there are two deliverymen from the Cheetah company
who have hidden a dead body in a refrigerated truck
and that we are also trapped.
The police will set up roadblocks,
they will stop the truck and the search.
They will locate it right away because I have memorized the license plate.
-A cell phone?
-Wow...
I was hoping for a brighter idea, actually.
I guess under the circumstances it's the only option we have, isn't it?
That's right.
Come on, then.
Can someone lend me a cell phone?
I left it charging at the doctor's house.
I left it at the doctor's too.
I never carry it, when I go to play soccer.
I've taken it just in case,
but a while ago I felt the low battery warning go off.
There is very little left.
Right, you're leaving me?
Let's see if I can revive it.
-You'll revive the battery, you say?
-What?
Yes.
Can you do this?
First, you take the battery out of the cell phone.
You warm it up a bit
and the voltage goes up enough to make a call.
Wow!
I guess that will be enough
to call Takagi and explain that...
-Hey, it's the screeching of the brakes.
- (truck: brakes)
We have to hide.
-Now they'll open the door again.
Oysters.
We must be careful.
(Footsteps: approaching)
Let's see.
The only boxes in district 4 are Mr. Yamada and Mr. Nishino.
Yes.
But first we should move the box of the corpse.
Yes, already it touches.
It'll be two hours soon.
-Amunt.
-Come on. -Come on.
Come on, let's go.
That's it.
We've delayed the appearance of livor mortis for another couple of hours.
-Mm?
-What have you got now? -I don't know.
I don't know, it looks to me like the seal's been tampered with.
What's that?
What are you talking about?
Who do you want to have opened it, the box?
Oh, man.
I thought I heard a cat meowing.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Before you imagined you felt some children and now you thought it was a cat?
It's just...
Calm down, calm down.
You just killed a man, I understand you're upset.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's my fault we ended up like this.
You've been on the job.
You had to deliver a package
at the house of the husband of the woman you're getting involved with.
And when he came down on you
accusing you of being the cause of his divorce, it's understandable that...
Yeah, but I didn't want to kill him.
I just gave him a push to get him to let me go,
he fell backwards, hit his head and stayed still.
In any case, you were right to warn me instead of calling the police.
That way we could have stolen the money from his wallet.
Yeah, but... are you sure we won't get caught?
Don't worry.
In a while we'll go back home
and leave the body where it was.
After a reasonable time, we'll knock on the door,
pretend we've just found her and notify the police.
It can't go wrong.
I-I hope so.
It will only be necessary that we break some glass
for them to think she's been attacked by a burglar who's broken in.
Besides, she thinks there are plenty of witnesses...
who can confirm our alibi.
- (door closes)
(door: closes) -Yes.
In the end it turns out to have been an involuntary manslaughter, then.
We must notify Takagi as soon as possible.
(Woman) We are about to take off.
Please turn off cell phones, laptops and other electronic devices,
laptops and other electronic devices.
-(Woman) Excuse me.
-Please, sir.
I was looking at the map of Tokyo
to know exactly where we should pick up the suspect.
How the hell do you turn this thing off?
You have to press the power button for a few seconds.
(Think) "This is what he gets for buying a 'smartphone' to pimp himself out."
Yes, it's been a while.
And you've already turned it off, you?
"The phone you are calling is turned off or out of range."
"Please try again later."
Oops.
Nothing.
He's got it turned off.
What's the matter with him!
We'll have to call Dr. Agasa and fill him in on everything.
(Phone)
"Doctor. It's me."
Yes?
This is Dr. Agasa.
"Try to remember everything I'll tell you."

Yes, sorry.
Wait a second, I'm busy right now.
Oh, oh, oh.
I'm burning.
He-he...
Hey, hey, hey.
Okay, ready.
I'm done, sorry.
I didn't think we'd have enough cake.
and I was frying doughnuts.
I doubt they'll be as good as the exclusive Christmas cake
that should be coming soon, but...
(Phone: hang up)
"Oops. She hung up. Well, if it was something important he'll call back."
He/she returns to warm up a little, not?
Damn.
There's no battery left.
When it's all gone, you can't revive it by warming it up.
What are we going to do now?
Calm down.
Remove everything you have in your pockets.
Let's see if I can come up with an idea to escape.
-All right.
-(Ayumi) Okay.
(Ayumi) Let's see...
I have a handkerchief, a pack of Kleenex,
a candy and an ear stick.
The stick is left over
from when my mother cleaned my ears this morning.
Don't worry, I didn't use it.
I didn't use it.
And you, Genta?
Let's see, I've got a band-aid, a chocolate bar,
an ointment for mosquito bites...
Yes.
For bites?
I never get bitten by mosquitoes,
but mother insists I should always carry it.
And you, Mitsuhiko?
Look, I carry a notebook, a pen, a handkerchief,
my wallet and a cab receipt.
Yes.
A cab receipt?
I found it this morning, while I was washing my face,
next to the washing machine.
It must have fallen into the mother's lap yesterday
when she emptied the pockets of the father's pants
to put them in the washing machine,
and I forgot to give it to her before I left.
Other than that, he only had the jacket on him that I left for him at Ay,
but I don't think there's anything in the pockets,
because I put it on clean this morning.
What about you, Haibara?
Don't you have anything on you?
Oh, sure.
It's true that you're in your panties.
You idiot.
Well...
I don't think there's much we can do about all this.
Guys, what do you say we write a message asking for help...
in Mitsuhiko's notebook,
tear off the page and throw it in the street?
Yes, very good thinking.
The gap in the door is wide enough to get a piece of paper through.
But... assuming someone finds the note,
we have no assurance that he'll call the police right away.
Besides, what if the paper didn't get under the door?
Can you imagine it getting stuck there?
When the delivery people reopen the door to deliver,
they'll find our distress message stuck in there
and they will know immediately that someone is trapped in the van.
-Do you have any other ideas?
-You're right.
-So?
-No.
"I don't see you too worried, you."
"If you hadn't gotten in here, we wouldn't be like this now."
"Come to think of it, this cat... Ah! I've got it. There's a way."
"But... it's a bit of a risky move."
What?
If you have an idea, explain it.
Huh? (Laughs)
Yes.
The first stop we made was
the Beika Apartments in district 3, right?
And now we've stopped at 4. What's the next one?
Yes.
It must be district 5, right?
Hastings territory.
District 5 is where Poirot's cafe is,
where he goes every night to get food.
Right.
We can have him carry a note to come to our rescue.
If we tie the message to the necklace,
the Azusa is sure to find it.
Yes.
Well, let's try it.
What's that?
But...
If the delivery guys see the note attached to the necklace in Hastings
when I get off the truck...
How?
Don't worry, I've got it all worked out.
We'll use a secret code
so they don't realize it's a distress message.
A secret code, you say?
("Ima aitakute", Daigo)

Denw ga naru tabi Kono Mune ga zawamete.
Demo kikoetekuru Nowa kimi no koe jyanai.
Ima kimi wa Doko ni Iruña nani shiteruno.
Kami sama ni niega todokunara mueve ichido dake.
Ima aitakute kimi ni aitakute,
Ima mo Kono Mune wa kimi iro ni somaru.
Dakishimetakute!
Setsunakute nido to aenainara.
Nunca chiru yuki shiroku Kono kokoro somete.
-Oysters!
-A secret code, you say?
Hastings.
I didn't expect you at that hour.
It's been quite a while since we let the cat out of the bag
and still no one has come to our rescue.
Perhaps the secret code was too difficult to understand.

Perhaps in Hastings he has lost the paper before reaching the Poirot.
No!
