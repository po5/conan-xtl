Sorry..., Sato!
What did you want to talk to me about?
What have I done?
Takagi!
Get in the car!
Yes!
(Thinking) "What's wrong? What the hell has gotten into him?"
"Did I screw something up again?"
"Sato's anniversary is in April..."
"And I went with her to karaoke.... It can't be..."
"Oh! Do you want to break up? Ep, just a moment!"
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Sato: laugh)
Has fallen!
Has fallen!
What?
What did you think?
Did you see what a toy?
Isn't it funny?
Next time I'll try it with Yumi!
Sato...!
You made me come down to try this worm with me?!
That's right.
What's wrong with it?
Besides, I had already finished work and was going home.
Eh...?
Listen...
Or maybe...
I can only ask you to come for important things?
Police Corporal Takagi?
It's not that...
-No... it's still early for this...
-Gee, they're in love...
-No!
It's still early for this...
-They'll soon reach the finish line.
Sato, please stop!
-Mite'l!
Mite'ls!
THE LOVE STORY
METROPOLITAN POLICE INVESTIGATORS 6 (PART 1)
A request for reinforcements from the Tottori Prefectural Police?
(Man) Yes.
Megre, you know them, right?
The thieves who start over there and have spread throughout the country.
(Flow) Okay... See you...
Oh, no!
They've organized a joint investigation to Tottori
and asked us to send people from the metropolitan headquarters.
But, the robberies were handled by the third section, weren't they?
Megre, what have you forgotten?
Those people also committed an assassination attempt in Tokyo.
That's right...
They already send a person from the third platoon,
but you should also send them a person from the first section.
A single, bright person...
Who do you recommend?
And who has an iron health, to be able to withstand hard work.
And if they are familiar with the area, all the better.
Mmmm...
It's true...
Megre!
Wasn't the town where she was born supposed to be in the Tottori area?
Huh?
Wh-Who are you talking about?
Yeah, man... From in Takagi!
The researcher Takagi!
(Think) "In Takagi..."
Oh, no!
He could be a good candidate, don't you think?
Yes, he really would...
He's a very alert man, and he's also solved many cases...
Okay, sergeant.
I'll notify him tomorrow morning.
Thank you, I'll leave it in your hands.
(Mitsuhiko) Gee, how sad it is that he's going so far away...
In Hide is going abroad... Will he really go?
But we don't know for sure.
Let's see, England was the place where soccer was born.
If you're such a fan, you should be glad he's playing there.
-Yeah, I guess, but... -Yeah, I guess, but...
It's a good idea for him to go abroad,
and then he'll be better prepared for the World Cup.
-Oh, the World Cup... -World Cup...
-The World Cup...
-Oh, that's right...
-It seems to have stopped raining.
He meant?
That gentleman, he was having trouble breathing,
and he looked like he was very tired...
Naturally, because he's jogging.
Au, let's hurry him up or we'll be late for school.
-Let's go!
-He's right!
What?
This I understand.
It's what I felt.
Hey!
You hear what I say?
Miwako?
Miwako!
Yes...
Oh, no!
I'll be late!
Good morning, everyone!
What?
Excuse me... What's wrong with my face?
Yumi!
Takagi...
Yes?
What?
E... ei!
Good bye.
What's the matter?
What... what do you mean by this?
Uh...

(Takagi) What?!
Send me to do a joint investigation...
at the Tottori Metropolitan Headquarters?!
Don't get the wrong person?
-Tros of stock!
You're the only Takagi here!
-Don't play dumb!
According to Yumi, you should be getting a call from Inspector Megre.
Eh?
Come to think of it, I got a call from the inspector this morning.
I was half-conscious, so I don't really know what he said...
You see?
It's the call.
Eh?
But I'll be back when we've solved the case anyway, so...
-Huh? -You didn't get it, did you?
-You didn't get it, did you?
There they are chasing thieves who have committed robberies around the country.
In cases like this, there's no telling how far they'll go.
-And with as many agents as there are, who knows when the case will be solved?
If things are on the right track...
With their skill, they'll solve the case in three years.
Three years?
Three, three years?!
(laughs)
Three years...?
1,095 days... 26,780 hours!
(Think) "Heaven has not forsaken me."
I am very happy for you!
To Tottori the air is very clean
and you will eat as many Matsuba crabs as you want!
-I won't go, on a camel!
-And you can go by camel!
Sa-Sato...
-Takagi...
Bring me some "20th century" Japanese pears, okay?
They are the ones I like the most.
-They're the ones I like best!
-Now I know you!
-Matsuba crabs are our favorite food!
Hey!
What's this pot of crickets?!
We have a case!
The crime scene is the 23rd floor of a skyscraper
located in the fourth district of Beikacho!
A man has been stabbed and killed.
The person who found the body was a woman.
Sato and Takagi, go to the crime scene!
(At the same time) Yes, sir!
Megre, lead the investigation at the scene.
No..., look, Sergeant, let's leave it to Cho to do it.
Cho!
All right, let's...
Go flying!
(All) Yes, sir!
Mr. Cho!
This is the first time we work with you.
Yes, I hope we work well together.
Ah, yes, sir!
Takagi!
Cho is a veteran who is 2 years older than me.
Yes, naturally!
I hope you learn a lot from him!
And another thing...
It will probably be the last time you work with him.
What?
"Takagi... Goodbye!"
Are you serious?
The press conference at Hide, they were holding it this morning, weren't they?
No!
We have to hurry, otherwise we'll miss it!
You don't have to worry!
It'll make all the headlines!
They'll repeat it tonight...
Eh?
Something seems to have happened...
(Shinichi voice) Yes...
The man who was stabbed is called Hirotoshi Nakamoto,
he was 27 years old and an office worker.
The murder weapon is a 17-centimeter knife.
The time of death is between 7 a.m. and 2/4 of 8 a.m.
You, a co-worker,
came in at 1:00 noon and found him dead.
Yes, sir...
I had asked for the day off work today
and we wanted to make a reservation for the wedding reception.
How could this happen?
Do you know... if there was someone who had something against him?
It's possible that he could have enemies...
Looks like the killer was an acquaintance.
Yeah, and the door was locked.
Could you point us to his photo album
which people might have something on him?
We'll try to track him down.
Can you see anything?
Ah!
It's Investigator Takagi and Investigator Sato!
-Yes.
-Okay, I'll take care of it...
What happened, Sato?
-Of course...
I'm sure it was a homicide!
Eh, yes...
Excuse me, what happened, shortly after 7 am?
Sato...
How do you know that?
We saw a suspicious person on our way to school!
On a street near this blog!
Apa, Conan!
That man was just jogging...
Before we passed by that man it had stopped raining, right?
Yes.
It barely rained for 10 minutes...
But the man's clothes weren't wet...
Why do you think... it wasn't?
Maybe because he had to take shelter somewhere?
As it had started to rain when he was jogging...

And it started raining again, because it stopped raining!
If he had rested for 10 minutes he wouldn't have sweated so much!
In other words, he was short of breath, but not because it was drafty?
No, of course not.
He was probably hyperventilating
because he must have stabbed someone in a nearby apartment.
Yes.
This is what you were going to say, right?
It was one of these people?
Uh... (clears throat) (woman) This man.
- (woman) This man...
-I think it looked like him!
It's Mr. Kato, one of your co-workers!
I understand he used to live with a friend...
(woman) -Yes.
-Do you know where his house was?
(Boy) What?
Shortly after 7 o'clock this morning?
I've been here the whole time...
(Boy) Bullshit!
You're the one who stabbed Hirotoshi!
What?
Me, commit murder?
Where the fuck did you get that from, huh?
What's going on?
Stop shouting.
I'm sick of repeating that we don't want salesmen here.
-What's the problem? -What's the problem?
-Well... It just so happens that...
-Mmm... How is it...?
-What is it?
-Yes...
-Chiba!
Oh!
This is getting interesting...
What?
Suspect in a murder case?
In... in Kato?
Yes, that's right.
The victim is a co-worker of yours, Hirotoshi Nakamoto.
The murder weapon was a knife.
It was on the floor next to the body.
What's the... approximate time of death?
Between 7 and 2/4 of 8 this morning.
So, he couldn't have committed the crime.
No, and now I'll explain why.
He woke me up at 7:00 and we watched TV until 8:00.
-Is that true?
-Yes, that's right.
Yes, we were watching a new program they're doing live,
Nichiuri TV's "Mornings Live 7".
But, researcher Chiba, he woke you up, didn't he?
Maybe he put on a program he had previously recorded, right?
No way!
I also have proof...
By the way, why did they suspect me?
Because you are my ex!
Of course you are!
And there is a witness who saw you near the block of apartments!
Are you sure that guy wasn't asleep and that he didn't confuse me?
We weren't half asleep!
I saw it clearly!
It was him!
It was him!
You were wearing a hoodie!
And you were running around with a black backpack!
Yes, and as if you were jogging...
Let's let investigator Chiba show us!
Let's see what clues he has from when I watched TV with him,
from 7 o'clock to 8 o'clock.
Eh!
But... What's this?
What a mess!
Now I understand that you're always late for work...
I do the best I can!
Besides, I'm not as late lately as I used to be, am I?
Now that you mention it, it's true.
What's it like?
It gave me a good incentive to get up.
What are all those toys?!
Are you a fan of special effects?
What's the big deal?!
It's just a hobby I have.
You also have in Yaiba the Masked!
-Oh, it's in Gomera!
In Gomera!
It's a collector's item made of tin!
Stop it!
Don't be lumbering!
I told you to keep the car with Mr. Kato!
Wait a minute, say...
Where's the proof that the two of you were watching television?
Yes, sir!
It's this videotape.
"Hello! Welcome to 'Four Minutes in the Kitchen with Yoko Okino'!"
"Today is February 25, Friday."
I always record this "Mornings Live 7" slot.
Yesterday I was watching videos that we had rented with in Kato
and we fell asleep here.
I neglected to schedule the video,
so today I recorded it.
There's no way that was a program they had done before.
You can only use one player.
But here is another player.
I use this one from time to time to copy tapes!
If I had used this one,
I would have seen the connection in front of the TV
and I would have realized the deception.
I called the TV station and confirmed it.
Look, here's the section....
that comes on after the weather forecast on "Las Mañanas en directo 7."
-Wow!
You have others marked.
-Friday, February 25.
There are cable television programs...

There are a lot of programs I'm interested in watching....
That's why you have so many notes around the TV.
After you watched the program until 8 o'clock, what did you do?
I've been watching videos since 8.
- (children: laugh)
-Oh, yeah?
What videos?
Ah, well, they are...
Chiba!
Eh!
-X videos?
-Don't tell me what...?
No!
These!
It's these!
(At the same time) It's on Yaiba the Masked!
At last!
This is the first episode of the first Masked Yaiba!
The mask was more primitive, but it was one of the best things he had!
How late are you going to be watching this children's show?
I watched a tape that was 120 minutes long.
Did you watch it for 2 hours?
No, I recorded it at triple speed and took out commercials.
(At the same time) Yes... six hours?!
Inspector, have you recorded all these tapes?
No, Kato gave me the tapes he had recorded some time ago.
Have you been with him all the time?
No, after I watched half of the tape I went to take a shower.
It took me about half an hour.
Then I put it back on and watched it until episode 12.
And I stopped the video.
They were playing a professional baseball game,
the Falcons 2 o'clock game against the Jaguars!
It came on just as I was watching that game.
I get it.
From here to the block of apartments would be an hour's drive.
If after watching the show for an hour,
they've watched the video for 6 hours, he's got a solid alibi.
Just in case.
Look for the hoodie and the black backpack.
(Chiba) What?
Are you serious?
You've found nothing?
(Chiba) What?
What?
-It's nothing important...
-No, nothing.
You fools!
Then, don't start shouting!
I'm sorry...
Listen... How long will you be stationed in Tottori?
The guys in the first section say 3 years.
Bring him some pears from the area.
-And what did Sato say?
-Exactly...
-Just this?
(Chiba) Strange...
The most normal thing is that she was worried.
Well, even if they send me there,
every month I'll have a few days off and I'll also be able to call you...
I hope you don't end up like Kato.
He... was doing business trips until last month,
but when he came back, he called me and asked to live here.
The woman he was living with started going with another man.
And he...
Even though I called him every day,
he always complained that he didn't understand women...
If you really care about her, you should tell her, right?
You have to tell her how you feel about her.
What are your plans for the future.
You never know what might happen to you.
-Maybe if...
-Me?
Maybe he'll end up finding a girlfriend wherever he goes!
Won't you?
That's right.
-If that were to happen, he wouldn't come home for quite a while. -Yeah.
Yes.
They say the longer they stay away...
the more people's hearts grow apart.
There are exceptions sometimes, though, aren't there?
I will never leave with any other woman!
Never!
-Hey, but who are you talking about? -Me?
-Me?
Who's me?
What?
We were talking about in Hide, because he's going abroad.
Ah, Hide...
Ah, it looks like he's decided to stay in Japan...
What?
Is that so?
Did you see the press conference this noon?
No, when "Mornings Live 7" started,
there were signs on the screen announcing it.
It said, "Hide Akashiro the Spirits of Tokyo has announced that he is staying!"
In the news block, did it say anything about this?
No, actually, it didn't...
(Think) "Wait a second.... Could it be that..."
"Sure, it's about that!"
"But it's still impossible..."
"Even with this setup, there are things I don't know how to explain..."
"How did you do it? How did you manipulate time like this?"
It doesn't seem to be there.
No, I guess not.
Why don't you ask researcher Chiba?
I'm asking you to swear on the cherry blossom on this plaque!
I will go there
and become an even better researcher than I am now!
Before I leave, I want you and me to.....
And the next Conan:
