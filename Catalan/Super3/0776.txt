(Shinichi voice) "In Kogoro Mouri has disappeared."
"Actually, he has infiltrated a gang of robbers....".
"In collaboration with Inspector Megure
to try to frame them."
"El Cerebro, the boss of the gang,
"Whose face we haven't seen at any time,
"He knows the true identity of Kogoro Mouri...
and demands that you investigate some facts."
(Mechanized voice) "You have a very pretty daughter."
What?
Ran!
Why did you...?
What does all this represent?!
(Mechanized voice) "It all depends only on you."
On me?
And may I know what you want?
(Mechanized voice) "Straight to the point, as I would expect from a great detective."
Come on, speak up!
(Mechanized voice) "It's little that you don't infiltrate our gang."
"I might as well have discovered you."
"You're going to pass for an expert in safecracking, just as you planned,
as you had planned, and you'll work with my men."
"Yes, because it's been a while...
I suspect that among my men is the murderer of my son."
"That's why I want you to put your detective skills to good use
and find out who he is before dawn the day after tomorrow."
What do you mean?
The day after tomorrow, you say?
(Mechanized voice) "I want to leave here the day after tomorrow morning."
"That's why that's the deadline to do what I just told you to do."
"Is that clear to you, detective?"
Why do I have to find out who the killer is?
Are you flying to avenge your son's death, or what?
(Mechanized voice) "You don't have to do anything about that."
"But if you refuse to do what I have ordered you to do...,
you will never see your beloved daughter again."
"If before the fixed deadline
"I give no orders to the assassin I have hired,
"Instead of leaving your daughter alone,
he will do his job and kill her without mercy."
You had it all figured out from the beginning, didn't you?
You bastard...!
(Mechanized voice) "But I have full confidence...
...in the detective skills of the great Kogoro Mouri."
What?
(Shinichi voice) "The years we've spent together are a stepping stone,
and we're moving full speed ahead without slowing down."
"Detective Mouri and I find ourselves at a dead end."
"The robbers have a secret plan. The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

(Conan voice) "The great detective, between a rock and a hard place.
(Second part) ".
So we haven't found them yet, have we?
No, but I don't know how they did it, they didn't have enough time...
to skip all the police controls.
It is very likely that they have a hideout in the area.
And that they stay there until they can flee without any danger.
And where is this place?
Where are they hiding?
Shit!
We could only take people's dough.
If we'd have busted the box, we wouldn't be like this now, would we?
Eh?
(Kogoro: thinks) "By the way, what the hell are you doing here, boy?"
Don't hurt me, let me go!
Shut up at once, or I'll kill you right now!
Don't make such a fuss!
Ah, I'm so scared!
Do you want to stop?
He's a little boy.
Don't make more of a fuss!
Let him stop!
-What do you say?
Stop it all at once!
Let him be.
By the way, Brain, I want to ask you something.
Would you please tell me what's he doing on our side, in Kogoro Mouri?
You have foisted it on us and I don't know why.
I want you to give me a convincing answer right now.
What's the matter?
You don't feel me, or what?
Oh! (mechanized voice)
(mechanized voice) "You remember? It's the illegal casino."

"One of the premises I'm going to rob last year."
"This is where one of the gang members was murdered."
"I want to know the truth of what happened."
"And that's why I've asked the great detective Kogoro Mouri
to clear up once and for all who killed my son."
What are you saying?
Was it really your son?
-Well, I had no idea.
-Who do you mean?
That useless piece of shit?
I didn't know either, to tell you the truth.
(Mechanized voice) "These things are always best
left in the hands of specialists."
-All right, I'll find out.
- "I'm counting on you, great detective."
But keep in mind what you promised me.
Mm!
I don't know what you want to investigate.
Al Granitos, as everyone knows,
was killed by members of the illegal casino security.
A year ago you were convinced that it went like this.
-Yes, it's not worth it.
-Why should it be removed now?
I'll pass on this story, okay?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What's the matter?!
It won't open!
-What does all this represent?! -Iaaah!
-Iaaah!
Mm!
(mechanized voice) "When it's time,
the lock on the door will open automatically."
"If you attempt to flee prematurely....,
I assure you, you will not get out alive."
Hey, wait a minute!
I had nothing to do with all this.
I stayed in the car, as usual.
My mission is also to wait to escape.
I knew that Granitos had been killed when everything had already happened.
(Mechanized voice) "Let's see....,
let's go over the details of the events that took place a year ago."
"I have to admit that incorporating the Granitos to the casino hit
was a mistake of mine that I will not forgive myself."
Oysters!
I apologize.
-I'm sorry.
-Boy, keep an eye out. -Lucky I had to keep a low profile.
Lucky I had to keep a low profile.
This nano is useless.
Making him come to the casino was a big fuck-up.
If you want me to take him out, let me know.
It's time, let's go.
-Come on, do as you're told!
Everybody freeze!
Hands up!
If you don't, I'll kill you.
Okay? - All right?
Purses and wallets, in the bag!
Come on, you, hurry up!
-I'm scared!
-What's the matter?!
-I'm scared!
-Auxili!
- (gun: shot)
- (woman) Help!
(man) Eh?
The light is back!
- (man) What happened?!
- (alarm)
-Fugim from here!
- (woman) Fire!
- (people: call)
- (alarm)
(voice mechanized) "And then they found the corpse of the Granitos
"Completely burned
and they couldn't identify him."
"But the whole story is based on what you have explained to me."
- (mechanized voice) "Look carefully."
-And what do you mean by that?
"These are images from the security cameras
installed in the illegal casino."
"Detective, don't you have any questions, after seeing them?"
Eh?
Well... well, let's see...
On that day, you all disguised yourselves as customers to enter the casino, right?
Yes.
But Granitos had gone before us
to hide the guns and the dagger.
Granitos was different, he was disguised as a waiter, right?
That's right, he was disguised as a waiter, wasn't he?
But he gave himself away right away, poor guy.
-I think so too, frankly.
-They killed him because he asked for it.
-Aaa...
-So what?
There are just voices?
What a clean land, isn't it?
Not a single stain, not a mark...
Mm?
Yes, it's true.
But why do you say that, let's see?
(Shinichi, thinks) "Come on, man, wake up, it's for today!"
Eh?
Listen...
Is this mark on your finger from someone biting you?
What is it?
The-the scar?
Yeah, I was bitten by a dog.
It's been a while.
Huh?
And the dagger, too?
Because there's a mark on the handle, too,
as if the dog had also bitten the dagger.
Yes, it's that... he came at me.
It bit me and the dagger.
Strange... There's no dog in the casino footage.
What do you mean?
That if we look at the images of the boy lying on the floor...
-I'm scared!
-Auxili!
- (people: call)
- (gun: shot)
The light is back!
I get it!
The "dog" you're referring to happens to be Granitos, right?
Look, he's got blood in his mouth!
It's a... coincidence.

I was... I was bitten by a dog in my neighborhood.
Then show me the dagger.
For the mark we will know if they are human or dog teeth.
Shut up!
Everyone knows he was shot dead.
My dagger had nothing to do with it.
Wow, you, how cool!
You carry an automatic pistol, don't you?
When you shoot, the shells fall to the ground...
and they bounce, and they make a metallic noise.
(Shell: Cling-Cling)
Sure, it's true!
The noise!
Let me go back and look at the footage of when the boy is shot.
After he was shot during the blackout,
at no time can you hear the noise of the cap falling to the ground.
-I'm scared!
-Auxili.
- (people: call)
- (gun: shot)
The light is back!
-It is very likely.
-Then it would be... a revolver.
Well, I'm sorry, because, as you can see,
I always carry an automatic pistol.
Maybe someone found a way to sneak the revolver into the casino.
No, they couldn't have.
There were security officers with metal detectors at the entrance.
Yeah, it's...
That's impossible, Lips.
Maybe it was a gun... made of ceramic or some plastic material.
It could even be made of...
Mm?
Yeah, sure, resin.
If it was a resin weapon, with the metal detectors,
the security people wouldn't have been able to find it at all.
And, if so, we would be talking about premeditated murder.
And it is impossible for someone from the casino to have committed this murder,
because, obviously, they were not aware of the robbery.
It is an assumption, but I think that, during the blackout,
Boca used the dagger to immobilize the boy...
and then the Ojos shot him with the resin gun....,
so that it looked like it was someone from inside the casino.
So, you've come to the conclusion that Boca and I killed him?
Yes, exactly.
Well, look, why don't we do a reconstruction of the facts?
After all, that's why you had this big set built, right, Brain?
isn't it, Brain?
What's the matter?
Are you tired already, or have you run out of battery power?
- (both) Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-Very good, this one.
Let's try it, then.
We don't lose anything.
You see, if a year ago Granitos was here before the blackout...,
then I'd be more or less around here.
And I remember it was located in this area.
And I was... here.
The blackout lasted about 10 seconds,
and the gunshot must have been felt 5 seconds after the power went out.
-Yeah, right.
-Is that correct, Mouri?
- (Mouth) OK.
-Go ahead, then.
- "(recording: people call)"
-Mail!
We have run out of time.
Because we didn't get there on time.
-You can see we didn't go.
During the blackout, in the dark, it was chaos.
Well, then...
Eh?
It won't be daylight for a while yet.
-What a pity about that detective!
-What now, great detective?
One thing...
He should have killed, you see?
May I know why everyone will close their eyes just before the blackout?
On the other hand, neither Granitos nor any of the people...
who were in the casino at that time did not lock them up.
I know why!
It's funny, isn't it?
You knew in advance that the power was going to go off
because you had previously installed a timer on the electrical panel
and you had programmed it to switch off the lights at a certain time.
-Come on, do as you're told!
Everybody freeze!
Hands up!
If you don't, I'll kill you.
Okay? -We'll kill you.
Purses and wallets, in the bag!
Come on, you, hurry up!
(people: call)
- (woman) Help!
- (gun: shot)
(woman) Eh?
The light is back!
- (woman) Run, run!
- (alarm)
(people) Fire!
Evidently, that fire also pronounced it to provoke you...
in order to escape and destroy all the evidence.
(woman) Idiot!
I told you to throw this dagger right away.
Yes, man!
I never part for anything!
You want to shut up?!
I've already done my part!
Do you feel, Brain?
Tell the killer that he doesn't need to do the job.
Don't let him touch a hair on my daughter Ran's head, okay?
(Shinichi, think) "I knew it!"
-No nothing.
No need to worry.
-What's wrong, Lips?

Is the deduction that Detective Mouri has just made correct?
Yes... You've done a great job, Detective Mouri.
The nano had figured out that we had a plan to assassinate the Brain
and split the loot between the three of us.
We had no choice but to kill him so he wouldn't rat us out.
And look, we're even this time, aren't we?
On the attack!
-What?
Is that her?
-We finally see the Brain's face.
(Mobile)
(Mobile)
It's Conan!
"Ran, if you're all right,
contact Inspector Megure right away."
"Your father and I are fine. We're with the robbery gang."
"The hideout is in a ship at the loading dock. I'm sending you the location."
What?
I don't quite understand.
Why are you asking me if I'm okay?
It's all the same.
I'd better call Inspector Megure.
With this remote controlled
the motion detection system from the pocket.
And what will that be?
Let's see...
(Mechanized voice) "It's footage from the security cameras
installed in the illegal casino."
"And that's why I've asked the great detective Kogoro Mouri
to clarify once and for all who killed..."
You have recorded all the phrases with your voice,
processed the recordings and, with the remote control,
you played them so we couldn't see your face.
And all because you wanted to avenge the death of your son.
We were just puppets.
He was only 15 years old.
It was a mistake.
I gave him up for adoption so he could have a normal life,
but it didn't help, because he became a delinquent.
I recruited him without telling him who I was to protect him.
How ironic!
Atxum!
-Iaaah!
-Aaaah!
Aaaah!
Excuse me, Mouri, I apologize.
I'm sorry you got involved in all this, kid.
I'll let the assassin know right away to let the assignment run.
Thank you very much.
Oh... but what are you doing now?
Are you flying to die with them to avenge your son?
Before you do anything and rush in, look at the screen.
Your son was still alive.
Look at his mouth.
He was moving his lips, see?
He said something.
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it..., mother.
It seems the boy knew perfectly well... who you are.
He knew that the Lips was actually the Brain,
and also that it was his mother.
It could be that he made you file for the gang
to convince you to leave this life of crime.
It couldn't be...
If he were alive, I'm convinced he would tell you exactly the same thing
he told you that day.
(Cries)
(Man) More people here, more people!
Mouri!
(Man) Come on, hurry!
-Please, please, please, don't die.
-Conan!
(Shinichi, thinks) "No!"
You have to talk to the killer!
(Man) Please!
(Mobile)
(Mobile)
(Shinichi's voice) Don't pick up!
Hello.
You're Ran Mouri, right?
Eh?
Right.
I've come to pick you up.
Yes.
Please get in the car.
(Conan voice) Don't get in, Ran!
Fuck!
Run for it!
-(police siren)
- (police: siren)
Ran!
(siren wailing) You're all right!
(siren wailing) Oh!
Is that you, Father?
(cries)
But Father..., control yourself.
Don't squeeze me so tight.
(Kogoro: cries)
(Shinichi, thinks) "I've arrived in time."
"The Eyes have shot at the Lips."
"She was rushed to the hospital and survived."
"And the police were able to arrest
all the members of the gang of robbers."
