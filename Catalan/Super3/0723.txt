(Shinichi voice) "Today we went to play soccer to make time while waiting for the Christmas cake to arrive at the doctor's house.
while we waited for the Christmas cake to arrive at the doctor's house."
"Halfway through the game we had to go out to chase Hastings the cat,
"who's been hanging around the Poirot café,
"And we got stuck in the refrigerated van
of a delivery truck."
"To top it off,
"In the Haibara, his suit has come undone,
and she flatly refused to go out on the street half-naked."
"That's when we found the corpse of a man
in one of the boxes in the van."
"We tried to call the police on Mitsuhiko's cell phone, but the battery was dead,
but the battery was dead."
"So, I had to figure out a way to call for help....
using the things we had in our pockets."
I carry a handkerchief, a pack of Kleenex, a piece of candy and a cotton swab,
a piece of candy and an ear bud.
I've got it.
And you, Genta?
I've got... a band-aid, a chocolate bar,
an ointment for mosquito bites...
And you, Mitsuhiko?
Look, I'm carrying a notebook, a pen, a handkerchief,
my wallet and a receipt for a cab.
(Shinichi, think) "Mm?"
"Come to think of it, this cat..."
"Oh! I've got it! There's a way!"
(Conan voice) Eh?
Yes...
(Conan voice) What?
If you have an idea, explain it.
The first stop we made was
the Beika Apartments in district three, right?
And now we've stopped at four.
That must be district five, right?
What's the next one?
Yes.
Hastings territory.
District five is where Poirot's cafe is,
where he goes every night to get food.
Of course he does!
We can have him carry a note to come to our rescue.
If we tie the message to the necklace,
the Azusa is sure to find it.
Yes.
Well, let's try it.
What's that?
But...
If the delivery guys see the note attached to the necklace in Hastings
when I get off the truck...
How?
Don't worry, I've got it all worked out.
We'll use a secret code so that they won't realize
that it's a distress message.
Kage wo mau col no kodou ga seijaku no umi wo saite
Kasanariau koe ga ima yami wo furiharatta.
"The light of reason can pierce the shadows
and also the deepest darkness."
"Who will receive the encoded message that will decide the fate of
the members of the Junior Detective League?"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"A cold and sweet delivery service (Part two)"
Yes, look.
A secret code, you say?
The receipt for the cab I was carrying in Mitsuhiko is made of thermal paper.
It is not printed with ink:
the black letters appear by applying heat.
The surface of the thermal paper has a chemical on it,
the basis for the color black,
and an acid that is called "color developer".
This developer melts with heat,
reacts with the other substance and makes the black letters appear.
The ointment for mosquito bites that he carried in Genta
carries ammonia, an alkali that neutralizes the acid.
If we wet the stick and rub with the cotton tip
the upper tail of the letter "a" of the word "card"...
Wow!
You turned the "a" into an "o"!
-You're a cracker, Conan!
-That's right!
Let's continue.
We take the word "card purchases".
We delete the letter "de" from "card",
and the letters "u, yerra, ce, hache, a",
plus the last a of "purchases".
"Corpse."
(All three) Oysters!
Which means "corpse".
And, to finish, we will use the card number and the telephone number...
at the bottom of the page
to indicate the license plate of the truck.

That way we'll know there's a dead body in this refrigerated van.
You're a genius, Conan!
Now all that's left is to roll up the paper
and tie it to Hastings' collar.
That way, even if those two catch the cat...
and intercept the message,
it will look like a printing error
or they'll think the letters have been accidentally erased.
-It's a perfect strategy.
-I get it!
- (brakes: squeak)
-Good thinking.
Oh, Mother, we've stopped again!
Listen to me, Hastings.
We've left our fate in your paws.
It's a matter of life and death.
Don't fail us.
Meow-meow!
-Meow!
-Mm?
A-a cat!
We had a cat in the refrigerated van!
It must have snuck in when you left the door open.
Easy, easy.
Meow!
So what I felt was the meowing of a cat?
-Oh!
-Meow!
He's wearing a piece of paper on his collar.
-What?
-Well, it looks like a receipt...
Meow!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Alert!"
-Oh!
Hey, you.
-Meow!
-It's just as well, it was only a cat.
-Oh!
Wow, it got away!
Yes.
-Now we have to trust Hastings.
- (all) Phew!
-Mm.
-What a remedy!
(Shinichi voice) Eh?
Eh, something.
If the cat to the Poirot, it is very likely that he will see the code, right?
Yes.
I made it up in the hope that he'll end up seeing it.
If he's a member of the Men in Black,
I'm sure he'll crack it right away.
It could be in Bourbon.
Meow!
-Hastings!
- (door: bell)
-Meow!
-I wasn't expecting you at that hour.
Bon appetit, glutton.
(door: bell) Look!
What's this?
What door, the necklace?
This is not the receipt for a cab?
- (man) Azusa.
- (door: bell)
-I'll be right back.
-L'encarregat wants you to go.
By the way, aren't you a detective, Toru?
-Maybe you'll know how to decipher this, then.
-Me?
Well, yes...
Oh!
-What was that piece of paper? -What was it?
-Well...
-If you say so...
-Actually, it was nothing important.
(Door: bell)
Meow!
(Shinichi, thinks) "How cold!"
This is the last of Beika's district set.
See to it that they remember your name and the face you make.
E-understood.
Then we have to go to district two to deliver a package
that has a delivery time,
and then we can go back to district one
to leave the corpse in his house.
(All) Ugh!
Hey, Conan, it's been a while since we let the cat out of the bag...
and still no one has come to our rescue.
Maybe the secret code was too difficult to understand.
It could also be that in Hastings he had lost the paper
before reaching the Poirot...
-Mm?
- (Ai) We have another problem.
The more boxes they hand out,
the fewer hiding places we have left in the van.
-(Ai) I hadn't noticed.
(Ai) -What?
Hey, I thought of something.
Do you think we could get away from the delivery guys
with the anesthetic darts or the high-intensity slippers?
I thought of that, it's not a bad idea.
But my watch is running low on battery power
and the cold is lowering the voltage.
The slippers wouldn't have enough power.
-(Ayumi) What's wrong with you?
- (Ayumi) What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?
You haven't said anything for a long time.
(Ayumi) Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
I seem to have gotten used to the cold.
At least I'm not shaking like a leaf anymore.
E-ei!
That's not a good sign!
(Ayumi) Mitsuhiko!
Mitsuhiko!
(Genta) Hey, Mitsuhiko!
Altered consciousness due to hypothermia.
In addition, his fingertips are bluish...
and symptoms of frostbite.
No!
Mitsuhiko has left his jacket at the Ai and is wearing only his T-shirt.
Come on, Mitsuhiko!
Wake up!
Mitsuhiko!
Mitsuhiko!
Mitsuhiko!
(Toru) What?
A cab receipt with the letters erased?
Is this what you wanted to show me when the cat came?
Yes.
Only the letters ce, o, yerra, pe, ay e were read.
It was exactly as if it had been printed wrong.
(Thinks) "Ce, o, yerra, pe, pe, ay y?"
" 'Corpse', 'corpse'!"
How many people know it, that this cat comes every day to Poirot to beg for food?
In fact, he has been coming relatively recently.
At the moment, only the manager, you and I know.

-Ah... You mean Conan Edogawa?
-And Conan is also aware of it.
By the way, when I took the receipt,
I touched the cat's collar and it felt very cold.
(Toru, thinks) "Oh!"
If I remember correctly,
the wind blew it in that direction, didn't it?
How?
Are you... thinking of going to look for it?
Please tell the manager that I wasn't feeling well...
and I've gone home.
And that there's no need to pay me for today's hours.
Ahm... OK.
(Toru, think) "If I make a simulation by inputting the speed
and the wind direction,
"and the distribution of the buildings in the area,
I'll be able to guess the course of the current and calculate where the paper might be."
(Ayumi) Mitsuhiko!
Please, Mitsuhiko, wake up!
Mitsuhiko!
Ah...
-She's awake!
-Finally!
-I feel.
-Ah... W-where am I?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
You were about to stay because of me.
Hold still.
It's important that I help you warm up.
O-okay.
Appreciate it.
Anyway, as it is,
we couldn't run away even if we wanted to.
What a shame, at this hour we should be at the doctor's house...
doctor's eating that good cake.
Yes, the one from the bakery in Yokohama.
Yokohama?
The cake you're bringing to the doctor comes from Yokohama?
Yes.
He specified the delivery time to make sure we were all there.
The problem is that we got out of school earlier today
and arrived earlier.
(Shinichi, thinks) "They had to go back to district two
to take a package that had a delivery time."
Hey, Conan!
If you mess up the boxes, we'll get caught.
(Conan voice) Oh!
This is it.
The cake that's going to the doctor's house.
Don't be an ass.
How nice!
Are we going to eat it now?
What we'll do is leave another secret message.
-Oh!
-What?
With the pen that was in Mitsuhiko's pocket
and the Ayumi's ear stick.
-Eh?
-Mm?
I don't think it's a very good idea,
writing a message on the package with the pen.
If the delivery people find out...
Besides, we can't be sure...
that the doctor will see the message just by receiving it.
Don't worry, I assure you he'll see it right away.
How can he?
Because we won't send it to the doctor.
(Toru, thinks) "I knew I would find it here."
"The numbers under the word 'corpse'...
must be license plates."
"The cat's collar was very cold,
so it must be a refrigerated vehicle."
"The vans that are used for this purpose
have an eight-digit license plate starting with the number eight."
"But this one doesn't have eight digits."
"Therefore..., it must be a delivery truck."
"Mm! I already have enough information."
How?
This isn't the Kudo's house.
-What are you saying?
-What?
What Kudo?
The time-stamped package is for an Agasa.
Yes, but look at the address.
Before the recipient's name it says: "Deliver to Kudo".
That's very strange, this name doesn't appear on the list.
Look, I think it's this house.
- (intercom: male) "Who's there?"
- (doorbell: ding-dong)
Hello, I'm from the Cheetah delivery service.
Excuse me, does Mr. Hiroshi Agasa live in this house?
"No, Mr. Agasa lives in the house next door."
"Look, I'm carrying a package for Mr. Agasa that needs to be delivered here,
according to the label."
Ah, yes, I remember!
It's a cake, isn't it?
The doctor lives next door, but he's always very busy.
I'll pick it up, thank you.
(Mitsuhiko) What?!
Did you leave instructions for them to take the cake to the Kudo's house
and not at the doctor's house?
Yes ..
And did you write it with the pen?
So they won't deliver the package to him.
The idea is for his neighbor Subaru, who lives at Kudo's house, to pick it up.
-So what?
-Ah...
What difference does it make whether one or the other picks up the package,
if we can't explain to them that we're trapped and freezing to death?
Think about it.
I'm the only one who could have written this in front of the addressee.
If you look closely at the handwriting and the color of the handwriting,
in Subaru you'll quickly realize that it's an addendum

that has been written down with a ballpoint pen.
And since the package contains a cake, you will know that it could only have been written
from inside a refrigerated delivery truck.
-It's brutal.
-Of course!
Anyway, I've explained everything just in case.
I've written it down under the address paper.
What?!
Have you gone crazy?
They'll find out right away!
Don't worry, I wrote it down with this cotton swab.
Come on, come on!
It's impossible, write with it.
Mm!
Not as much as you think.
The delivery receipt has several sheets,
which include the recipient's copy
and the package label.
Whatever you write on the envelope sheet
is automatically traced to the ones below.
Therefore, you should tear off the delivery slip....
with the recipient's signature,
which is kept by the delivery person.
It is the sheet that we will find at the end of all of the receipt.
We write with the stick on the first sheet of paper
and put the receipt back by the deliveryman at the end of the receipt.
What we have written should be copied on the bottom sheet,
which is the copy for the recipient,
and nobody will see our message
until Subaru turns the first sheet.
So, by now,
at Subaru the ten will be giving a good thrashing.
No, and now!
It's not their style.
Eh?
(Door, open)
Hey, why are you opening the door again?
The last recipient has asked me to deliver this box.
It's very small, I guess there won't be any problem.
Grr!
I hope not.
-Conan...
-(Shinichi, thinks) "I knew it!
(Shinichi, thinks) "I knew it!"
- (Ai) I get it!
-A cell phone?
As it is, it's the best weapon he could have given us.
Yes.
If we want to capture these criminals safely,
we'd better inform the police of the situation we're in.
(Door, open)
Now you can get it out of your head.
We noticed that the boxes had moved a bit,
and we found it very strange.
And we discovered that, apart from the cat,
there were more gossipy critters in here.
I-I already told you.
I heard children's voices earlier.
I should have listened.
But you're not very smart, are you?
I should have called the police right away.
I-and now what do you plan to do, about these brats?
Ha!
We have only one choice.
We'll take their cell phones
and then we'll leave them locked up here to freeze to death.
When they find their bodies next to that guy's corpse,
the investigation will get a little more complicated.
And there's nothing to tie us to this scoundrel.
(Man 2) Maybe you're right.
- (all) Hey ?!
- (car: two honks)
Excuse me.
Could you move over a little bit to let me pass?
I don't want anyone to get hurt.
-Right now.
(car: two honks) -Yes.
-Auxiliii! -Auxiliii!
-It's... -It's the detective.
What are you guys doing in here, anyway?
Is this a game, or what?
No, no, no, no, they're coming with us.
Hey, you, do you know them, these kids?
Yes..., yes I know them.
Now that you've seen everything, it's too late.
If you don't want us to kill the children, get in right now to the...
Aaaah...!
Aaah!
Aaah...!
I've already told you: let me pass if you don't want to get hurt.
Do you also want to?
No!
No-no-no-no-no!
- (both) Hurray!
-No...
Go ahead, Conan.
You can call the police now.
Aaa... yes.
That was awesome!
You deciphered the message and came to our rescue, didn't you?
Mm?
What message?
Ah, if you're referring to that strange receipt the cat was carrying,
it was blown away by a gust of wind and I couldn't retrieve it.
(All) What?!
In fact, I was passing by here by chance.
Well...
Hey, you want to come to the doctor's house to eat cake?
Oh, boy.
Ouch...!
So this is where Dr. Agasa lives?
Ah..., ah...
Thanks, but it won't be possible today.
I have to go.
Give my regards to the doctor.

(Agasa) Oh, my goodness.
What anguish you have gone through...
I was so cold
I thought I would be petrified like a statue!
But that's nothing.
Mitsuhiko even fainted.
-Yes...
-Really?
But the Ai helped him warm up and luckily he recovered right away.
I was very lucky, yes.
The police finally caught the criminals, then?
Yes.
In Toru, the waiter of the Poirot,
has given them a beating that has left them KO!
- (Mitsuhiko) Yes.
-At Toru?
- (Genta) Oh, so much!
- (Ayumi) It was mind-blowing, wasn't it?
Let's move on to the important stuff.
Where's the cake?
Ah, that's right, the cake!
I forgot.
(All three) Cake, cake, cake!
It's an exclusive cake that's only sold at Christmastime
at a very famous bakery in Yokohama.
-Ah...
- (all three) Aaah!
You must savor it with all five senses.
- (all three) Ah-ha!
-Attention..., tatan!
(all three) Eh?
(all three) Oh...!
But what happened?
What happened to this cake?
I can't believe it!
(Shinichi, thinking) "Come to think of it, those two deliverymen were saying...
that they would drop the packages on purpose to draw attention to themselves."
"He! He-he-he-he-he!"
He wants the precious stone that this little turtle carries in its shell.
A diamond: the blushing Mermaid.
(Woman) It's true!
The diamond attached to a gold chain.
The security measures are impressive!
It can't be!
(Woman) Eh?
(Woman) Oh!
(Shinichi, thinks) "How did he do it?"
"Signed: Kaito Kid."
"How could he have taken him, the turtle?"
(Conan voice) "Don't miss the next episode:
"On Kaito Kid and the Blushing Mermaid (Part One)."
