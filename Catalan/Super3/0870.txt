(Shinichi voice) "We've gone to spend a weekend
at the mansion of a friend of Dr. Agasa's."
"Just arriving, we found an injured man, in Yuji Isehara."
"In Yugi he is a professional hacker who was a henchman
of a very violent thief called the Fox."
"I was able to save in Uigi Sehara the last moment
before Zorro's gang murdered her for betraying them."
"But they followed us, and..."
-Oh!
-Huh?
-What?
On Conan?
-Oh... Conan!
-Oh...!
-Oh, Conan!
(Ayumi) Oh...!
(Ayumi) Goodbye.
Oh..., AAAAH!
Ah..., MHM!
MHM...!
(Both) Aaaah!
-Aaaah!
-Eh ?!
Aaaah!
"The curtain rises and the protagonist appears."
"He solves the mysteries by doing a beautiful dance."
"Zorro is an incendiary thief."
"By the skin of our teeth, but we'll end up curling it."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"In Conan falls off a cliff (part two)."
Oh!
Hi, Ran!
Hey, guys!
In Conan...., in Conan...!
It can't be.
There's no way!
But we've seen it, the eyes can't deceive.
We have seen perfectly how Conan...
fell off that cliff.
(Both) Aaaah!
Yes we have seen it... It has happened before us.
We have all seen how Conan fell off the cliff.
No..., no!
AHU, Ahu...
Poor Conan...
Why? Why...?
Why did he...?
Can you explain to me what happened, inspector?
What happened?
Zorro?
It was all Zorro's doing.
From what the children have explained to us..,
we deduced that the man who fell off the cliff with Conan...
was Yuji Isehara.
And after the fall, Zorro and his men have disappeared.
So far we have been unable to locate them.
Let's assume that they have had it in for each other
and that Conan somehow got in the way.
I find it hard to understand what that little boy was doing with Yuji Isehara.
I don't know, I have no idea.
Can you explain it to me?
First thing tomorrow morning we'll ask the Kanagawa police
to activate the search device to look for...
Do it right now!
Tell them to start searching for him right now!
(Both) OK.
Ah..., yes, yes, sure.
(Both) Come on!
Fuck!
How can that be?!
(Both) Oh...!
How could this have happened?
(Thinking) "Pa... father..."
Come on, take it easy.
Don't worry.
I'm sure Conan will be fine, you'll see.
Of course, of course.
We must be confident that he'll come back.
-And me.
-I have.
Good!
What, inspector, what do you know?
It's been 3 hours since they activated the search device,
but so far they haven't found anything.
Oh... Very well, thank you.
From what we've been told by all the officers,
where they fell in the water is very deep
and there are usually very strong currents.
The most normal thing is that the current has taken them immediately
and dragged them out to sea.
We have also been told that the bodies are not usually recovered.
What a shame!
However, we have asked them not to stop the investigation.
If it becomes known, we will inform you immediately.
We'll let you know right away if it comes to light.
Mol-thank you very much.
Conan's safety is important, of course,
but depending on how they find Yuji Isehara,
the Fox case could get stuck.
And there's no way I'm going to let that happen!
Mm!
Thank you, Inspector.
I assure you.
(Oh, think.) "I saw it."
"I saw perfectly... as he fell off the cliff."
"But they haven't found him dead yet."
"I'm sure it was that way."
I'm inside a cave.
- (wind: fiiiu)
-Oh...!
Sea breeze.
This means that up ahead...
Oh!
If I'm not mistaken...
This means I'm just below the cliff where he fell.
Oh!
Oh...

Wait, don't go so fast!
Will you shut up and stop following me?
I can't waste any more time playing detective with a creature.
(Shinichi voice) What a nerve: I jumped off the cliff with him,
I saved his life, and he doesn't even thank me or anything.
No, don't kill me!
Please don't kill me!
After all the trouble you've brought us....,
you'll die a traitor.
Farewell.
Ah..., AAAAH!
Ah..., MHM!
MHM...!
(Both) Aaaah...!
(Shinichi, thinks) "If we're right over that cave!"
"I have to risk it, I have no choice."
"I have to calculate the height of the cliff
and the exact moment when the wave hits the rocks."
"Now!"
Ah!
Ah!
Yes, I know.
Swim, swim!
No, of course you don't.
You don't intend to turn yourself in, do you?
I know one who ratted out Zorro and fled abroad,
and after a while he tracked him down,
he went looking for him and bumped him off.
Even if they turn me in, he would find me.
But you can't run away all your life as if you were a criminal.
That's why I have to think about how I can do it!
Well, maybe the best thing I could do
would be to find Zorro before he finds you.
What nonsense...
It would be the best solution.
But of course, you would need someone to help you.
(Zorro) Mm... An exhibition selling jewelry for the nouveau riche.
It's once a month and every time it's in the same place.
How much would we get?
We'd save going house to house
and in one fell swoop we'd make a billion yen.
(Whistling in admiration)
-As usual.
-What about security?
With Yuji's program we won't have any problems.
It will be a piece of cake.
Ha-ha-ha!
Speaking of en Yuji, he was such an idiot, eh?
He was such a turd, he ended up falling off the cliff in the end.
This means we can split his share, right, Zorro?
Oh..., oh!
Are you sure?
If you wish, we can sign another contract.
He-he-he...
Very well, then.
We'll do it tonight.
You can get everything ready.
(Birds: peep-peep)
What?
The Ai has also disappeared?!
I have no idea.
But how can it be?
I didn't even notice, he was leaving.
-The Zorro gang?
-Can't it be that they kidnapped her?
I don't understand anything, I'm starting to get fed up!
How can it be that today everyone does what he wants to do?!
Now this is not important, father.
Do something about it!
Yes, I know!
Inspector...
(Both) All right!
Go get her.
(Birds: peep-peep)
I came alone, as you asked me to.
Ouch!
I thought it was ruined when it fell into the water.
But I was able to send you the message.
Shouldn't you have explained something else?
Oh!
That's right, I'm sorry.
I had to make them think we were dead.
So as not to endanger their family.
Don't... don't kill me, please!
I beg you!
Don't kill me!
For your wife and for your son?
Don't be so melodramatic.
I guess... you've spoken.
-I'll let you choose, then.
-No, I didn't say anything!
Either I get rid of your wife and child,
or you end your life yourself.
Which do you prefer?
Choose!
I was very calm.
But I don't know how you're going to explain it to the others.
Ah... Yeah, you're right.
Oh, by the way, did you bring me everything I asked for?
Yes, I have it here.
Ah...!
That's great!
What are you doing?
Keep an eye on it, it's very delicate!
It took me two months to do it.
God-hay-do, what a program...!
They're really smart, these kids these days.
Of course, I was the same in my day.
Mm... mm...
I thought so.
They've begun hacking into their next target's security system
using my program.
That means one of those two passwords was to verify this.
But the other one, why would it be?
Now, for starters, we should stop Zorro from committing the crime.
Where do you plan to attack?
Aaa... in the Exhibition Hall in Beika's neighborhood.
Right, we have to call the police!
We must call the police!
Mm...
(chattering)
Left door, installed.
Right door, installed.
All set.
Three, two, one..., go!
(People: shouting)
Let's go, let's go.
(People: shouting) Eh?
What the...?

We were expecting you, Mr. Zorro.
I'm sorry, but tonight your party is over.
We are here because we knew you were coming.
-We could hear voices!
-How can that be?
Shut up, both of you.
He says that... voices were heard?
These, for example?
(Cell phone: conversation commotion)
So it was you...
Now I remember.
It's the boy from the cliff.
-So, he's alive too!
-How is he still alive?
I'm sorry, kid, but I don't know what you're talking about.
We're just specialists.
We've been hired to perform at today's party.
No, you don't need to pretend.
You can come out now.
Ah..., I was thinking about it.
But we saw how he fell!
I don't get it!
What does this mean?!
All right, if you want to die again...!
Eh?!
Go Mizorogi, a.k.a. Zorro.
You're under arrest for armed robbery and murder.
And you two as well.
No need to resist.
Oh... I'm all right.
Come on, you too.
Come on, let's go.
Let's confirm it.
I thought so.
Mm?
(Phone: ring)
Inspector Megure, tell me?
Hello, Dr. Agasa.
Yes, yes, indeed.
This time it was magnificent!
What?
That there's more stuff?
Oh!
-Huh?
-He had it all tied up, right?
(Agasa voice) That these in the photo are not his wife and son.
He took this picture from the internet
and retouched it to make it look like it was his family.
You used it to make Zorro think he had a weak spot.
You knew he would trust you more.
To begin with, what he wanted was to keep all the money...
that he'd been stealing.
And when you discovered the number and password
to his secret bank account,
he decided to leave the gang and then take action.
Mm... I figured.
They've started hacking into the security system of their next target
using my program.
Where do they plan to attack?
Aaa... the Exhibition Hall in Beika's neighborhood.
Okay, we have to call the police!
We must call the police!
(Agasa voice) At Conan and the Ay found out
that it was the password to a foreign account.
He transferred all the money from Zorro's account
to another account in his name.
You did this because you assumed
that you would get out of prison sooner than Zorro.
Am I right or wrong?
Ah..., ah...
Congratulations, Dr. Agasa, you have been masterful this time.
We have contacted Interpol
and they have already frozen the account.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Isehara,
but you won't be able to withdraw a single yen.

Ah!
Aaa...
(All) You don't have to tell us anything?
About it..., sorry for making you suffer.
Come here, come here!
I'm very sorry!
-We'll make you pay for this one!
-You won't escape.
-Don't run, come here!
-Oops, when I caught you!
We thought you were dead!
Come here!
There's a place I'd very much like to go, Dr. Agasa.
(All) We are the Origami Squadron, the Nobuna Gaizers!
(All) Ah... A superhero show.
I guess they've been inspired a bit by Nobunaga Oda.
The members of the Nobuna Gaizers are...?
Eh?
Aaaah...!
(Conan voice) Don't miss the next episode:
"The Nobunaga Case, 450th Anniversary".
