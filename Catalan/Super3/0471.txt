Whatever happens, I will always be by your side!
In the car we have rented there is a bomb
that will explode when we slow down.
We must do something!
The only truth is always discovered.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

(Kogoro) I'm going rabbit hunting
in the mountain of Kano,
I'm going trout fishing in the river of Kano...
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ran!
How many kilometers to go, to get to the spa?
Well... it must be about 100 kilometers.
We've only gone 10 kilometers?
You're a pain in the ass, father!
You ask me the same question every 5 minutes!
I like to see you so happy,
but I don't want you to run and run too much!
Yes, woman, I know!
Today will be an extraordinary day!
He-he-he-he-he!
A good bath in the spa,
a good meal... and a good glass of sake!
And we'll have it all for half price!
He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he!
(Phone: ring tone)
(Telephone: pick up)
Get me Inspector Megure,
police criminal investigation department.
He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he! Phew...
(Cell phone)
Can you get the cell phone, Ran? Hm.
- (mobile) -Who is it?
Well... Inspector Megure.
"What does he want, the inspector?"
Tell me? "Mouri!"
"Let's see, where are you?"
Well... we're in Takaoka. "What?"
I'm Ran.
I'm in the car, with my father, and Conan.
"You're the Ran! You're in Takaoka? Current position, Takaoka!"
What did you want, Inspector Megure? I do not understand.
"Do you feel me, Ran?" Yes, say.
Listen to me and don't get nervous.
It turns out that the car...
"You've rented..."
there is, hidden an explosive device.
An explosive?
What do you mean?
May I know what you say?
Just a moment!
(Loud speaker) "When the car I'm driving has traveled 10 kilometers...,
"The bomb will be activated."
10 kilometers?!
Too late.
This means... it has already been activated?
Don't brake!
The car can't stop!
"You have to keep running!"
"If you drive at a speed of less than 20 kilometers per hour,"
the bomb will explode!
"The detonator will explode automatically."
"The rental car out of control!"
But, inspector, who would want to put a bomb in our car?
(Explosion)
"The criminal has warned us
"That he would first blow up the water tower,
"But we don't know if the information is reliable."
"Until we can prove otherwise,
"We must assume that he has a bomb in the car and that it will explode."
(He thinks) "A bomb! An explosive device!"
"It must be a bomb with a timer.
"Programmed to explode at a certain time..."
This has been a test
to show us that this is no lie and no threat.
The criminal who planted a bomb in our car has told the truth.
"Mouri."
Mouri!
Don't lose your cool and keep driving.
I have activated an emergency device.
Everything is ready to go.
We'll be there soon, Mouri!
Inspector Megure, do you have any more information about the suspect?
Yes, I'll explain everything point by point.
A while ago, I received a call from a man who called himself...
"... Sugiyama, although I imagine it's a fake name."
He told me that there was a bomb in the rented car
hired through a Beika agency.
Do you have any idea who this Sugiyama end up being?
Sugiyama?
The man who rented us the car was called Sugiyama.
He advertised a spa where they gave a 50% discount.
But why did he choose me?

He told us that, if he managed to bump off a well-known detective like you,
"Everyone would talk about him and he would become famous."
At first I thought it was a bad joke,
but he knows his moves very well.
"And he's blown up the tower, so I'd better..."
to follow his instructions to the letter.
What are they?
In Sugiyama he told me... to enter the highway.
On the expressway?
Why is that?
"I don't know,
"But I advise you to do as he says...
"Until we get the situation under control."
I agree.
"Has the criminal identified by name
"And told us to get on the highway?"
"And if he had chosen that day for some special reason?"
(Horns)
(Radio: male) "The access to the expressway from Takaoka
"It's cut off."
"We've cut off the highway from Gosho.
"Takaoka entrance, heading for Araimachi."
"Access to Takaoka from the expressway is also cut off."
"Access number 8 from Takaoka is cut off,
"We have diverted traffic to an alternate route."
"Sidewalks adjacent to the accesses are also cut off."
"Blockage of the accesses checked."
Alternate routes are also... secured.
Okay, Mouri!
Listen to me, Mouri!
We've located your car.
Stay calm.
"From now on, follow the white motorcycles."
Roger that.
Ran, Conan.
Inspector Megure is on his way.
The police will get us out of this trance.
Don't worry about it.
Yes.
(Man) Kogoro Mouri... Prepare to tremble with fear!
I won't miss the moment... of your death!
(Laughs)
No way! What is it, father?
The gasoline!
We only have half a tank left!
When we took the car, I filled the tank!
"Oysters!"
"He must have waited for us to check it.
"And he emptied the tank just before he left."
That's all right!
You two will be out of the car before the gas runs out.
"Mouri! We'll start by evacuating your daughter and Conan."
"Open the windows!"
It won't open! What?
The door won't open either!
Ran, can you open it?
It's locked too!
Damn it!
He sabotaged our car!
(laughs)
"We have less than half a tank of gas left."
"If it's running at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
"We have an hour's margin at the most."
"When the gas runs out, the car will stop and explode!"
"The doors and windows can't be opened from the inside."
"What can we do?"
I'm in Megure!
Takagi, where are you?
Answer!
"I'm about to arrive!"
Inspector Megure!
I'm already here!
(Think) "Don't fail me, Takagi!"
(Thinking) Perfect!
Stay at the height of his car!
(Thinking) Okay!
"Go ahead, Takagi!"
(Inaudible)
Conan, we must move away from the window.
"Even if I manage to break the window
"And rescue Ran and me..., what about Kogoro?"
"If he tries to run away and takes his foot off the accelerator,
"The car will lose speed and..."
"It won't get out!"
"There must be some way
"To stop the car without losing speed."
The wheels!
Mouri, try to keep the wheels aligned!
Don't run so fast!
Now!
"The wheels? The wheels... they turn."
"The wheels!"
"Stop without stopping..."
"I've got it!"
"I've got to try! I've got to get out of here."
Ran!
Conan!
Takagi, get me out of here!
I'm so scared!
Right now, Conan!
I've got you!
Now I'll pull you out!
Now!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Oh, boy!
Oh, Conan!
I got you, Conan!
Come on!
Let's go!
It'll be all right, easy.
Yes.
Have you rescued a passenger?
I got it!
In 10 minutes, the gas will run out.
And when that time comes, Mouri will die!
(Radio: Takagi) "Conan has already been rescued!"
"Now we'll try to rescue the Ran."
(Radio: Takagi) Alert!
Inspector Megure, we have a problem.
There's a traffic jam in a few kilometers.
There's enough room for one car to get through, but they can't both get through at once,
but they can't both pass at the same time.
We'll have to postpone the rescue operation!
"Give the appropriate order!"
Ran!
Hurry up!
Hurry up, Ran! Give me your hand!
I've got you!
Ran!

We cannot continue!
Oysters!
Takagi!
Will you split up!
"Hurry up!"
"Ran..."
Mouri...
Inspector!
Mr. Kogoro told me something.
Ran.
Cover your head with my coat and jump out of the car.
What?
Even if you get hurt, your life won't be in danger.
I'm sure you can do it now.
What are you going, Father?
The most important thing is that you save yourself.
Listen to your father.
"Mouri! Do you feel me, Mouri?"
It won't be long now.
It's getting closer, brother.
(Ichiro Matsumiya?
Do you remember?
It's that case you and I brought in.
(Megure voice) A man who lost his head and killed his partner.
We chased him while he was fleeing on a motorcycle on the freeway.
"At a detour, he crashed into a security fence and died,
"3 years ago today."
But it was... a suicide, lo!
(Megure voice) "In Matsumiya he had a brother
"Who was studying in America at the time."
"He didn't know what had happened,
"and it was thought that the chase had gone too far...
"And that we caused the accident."
My God!
It was a misunderstanding!
We are trying to locate Matsumiya's little brother.
We'll find him soon.
So, how's the fuel situation?
The needle indicates we're low.
I don't know how much time I have left.
Ran.
I'm sorry I got you... into this situation.
But you still have time to get out.
Hurry and jump!
Father...
(Horn)
Aaaah!
Useless!
Get out of my way!
Don't come near me!
(Sugiyama) Kogoro Mouri.
It's getting close to the time to say goodbye.
This tunnel will be your grave!
(Inaudible)
(Sugiyama: river)
(Continues laughing)
(Laughs)
At last!
I've done it!
I've taken revenge... on Kogoro Mouri, brother!
Where do you think you're going?
I'm Inspector Megure.
You must be Jiro Matsumiya.
Yes.
We've been investigating... a deadly highway accident
that was 3 years ago,
involving Kogoro Mouri, the famous inspector,
and your older brother, Ichiro Matsumiya, who died.
That is how we have come to you, Jiro.
And may I ask what you want from me?
We suspect that you have hacked, from your home computer,
the highway security system,
and we'd like to ask you some questions about it.
Would you care to accompany us to the police station?
(Car wheels: squealing)
Eh? (Car wheels: squeak)
Oh!
How are we doing, Sugiyama?
Or should I call you Matsumiya?
With this face, you'd think you'd seen a ghost.
No way!
I don't believe it!
You can't be alive!
(Half laughing)
Well, I feel more alive than ever.
The bomb had to explode.
We have filled the gas tank and the car is still running.
Defusing the pump is only a matter of time.
But how did it do it?
It was attached to the underside of the car.
You couldn't reach it!
It's just that the car hasn't stopped yet.
"They are defusing the bomb right now.
"And, at the same time, they're keeping the speed at 20 kilometers per hour."
But... when...?
I saw an explosion!
Yes, you did.
There's been an explosion in the tunnel.
"A team of technicians
"experts in the deactivation of explosive devices
"was hidden in the loading platform of a truck...
"that has stopped in the tunnel."
"They have prepared ramps and a net."
All set, guys!
"When I got to where the truck was, they signaled me to get in."
"The car climbed up onto the loading platform.
"And the net cushioned the crash,
"But the wheels continued to turn, thanks to the turntable bars."
"The technicians then removed the Ran from the car,
"They filled the gas tank,
"They opened my door and locked the accelerator."
"Thus, we managed to stop the car...
"without stopping the wheels from turning,
"And the technicians were able to calmly defuse the bomb."
"With the help of smoke bombs and fireworks...
Fire!
"...we simulated the explosion of the car."
You bastard...!
It can't be!
What a rage!
If I had stopped that chase in time,
my older brother wouldn't have died.
You don't know what you're saying!
Your brother committed suicide.

It's a lie!
You killed him!
My older brother was not weak enough to commit suicide!
At the place where your brother died there were no brake marks.
Besides, just before he crashed the bike into the security fence,
he took off his helmet.
He prepared to commit suicide.
No!
Matsumiya, I'm afraid you're wrong.
Besides, do you think your late brother would like what you've done?
Shut up!
Matsumiya.
You are very different from your brother.
You were lucky not to have caused any fatalities.
Because you know very well that you're not a murderer.
Mouri...
I'm glad I met someone like you.
You are a good boy.
Sir... Mouri...!
(Cries)
Wow, I got a good surprise,
when I saw that the driver of that huge truck
was our inspector Sato!
Hello!
You guys know me?
I don't know why you were so surprised.
It was you who gave us the instructions through Conan.
It was me?
Ah! What's the matter, Dad?
We have to get to the spa as soon as possible!
Why don't you go another day?
It's just that the special promotion ends today!
Father, you mean to tell me that Matsumiya hasn't invented it...
for renting us the car?
What's that?
Is that so?
It could also be that this promotion
was the only true thing you told us.
Inspector Megure, could you lend us the patrol car?
No way!
What do you think I've gone crazy?!
"I knew it..."
"In Kogoro he's quite a character."
Come on, let's go to the library!
Hey, don't run so fast!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
One makes... one makes... one makes... a fantas...!
Shinichi!
Oh, my gosh!
It won't open! What?
Don't miss the next episode!
