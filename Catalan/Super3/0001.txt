Inspector Megure, be gentle and don't keep the guests any longer.
Inspector, we've had enough of this absurd investigation.
I understand your impatience, but please don't be nervous.
The victim, Mr. Yamazaki, was one of your guests, wasn't he?
You're implying that the criminal is here?
Yes.
At the moment, we know that the room was locked from the inside.
The criminal entered and exited through the third floor window.
Since there are no prints under the window, it was someone from the house.
What nonsense!
There are 10 meters between the windows!
You can't jump over them!
But you can go over the roof overhang,
and then there are only two meters to the balcony of the room.
What an imagination you have!
And where did the murderer come from?
It is impossible to jump two meters from the balcony to an overhang.
I think the murderer, when he came out of the next room,
took a rope, tied it to the balcony.
and used it to escape.
And how did he untie the rope from the balcony?
It's very simple, Inspector Megure:
he has tied a stick to the head of the rope and passed it through the railing.
It is released when the rope is not taut.
On the balcony are the marks.
Why should he lock the door, Mr. Yamazaki?
Perhaps the murderer suggested that he lock the door,
considering he was an important man.
I don't want to hear any more nonsense!
I want to know who the murderer is!
There is only one person who knows the layout of this house well,
and who can move around without arousing suspicion.
This person is...
Yes?
Say!
It's you, sir!
It's you!
Wh-what nonsense.
I can't even walk!
The truth always prevails, sir.
S-sir, legs!
Damn it!
This man has been able to walk for 3 months.
Isn't that right, Inspector Megure? Rinde s, the doctor told us so.
And we have witnesses who claim that they had quarreled over money.
Don't move from here!
Oh, come on, Shinishi, you've given me a hand again!
Thanks a lot, kid!
They don't deserve it.
You know, Mr. Inspector, they can always ask me for help.
The most famous detective of this century
(explosion)
What happened?!
You could make less noise, Professor?
I wanted to wake you up,
and I thought maybe this would be better than an alarm clock.
I always freeze when I see that many books!
Your father must be a famous writer because he read so much.
Ow, don't move, sisplau.
Sorry, kid.
If it moves, I can't heal.
Promise me you won't explain and it will be our secret.
This is an individual rocket.
When it perfects it will solve all the traffic jams
and I'll become a millionaire!
Aaaaah!
What a cross!
Aaaaaaaah!
It has!
It has!
It has!
An annoying nano!
But, father, calm down a little.
He's a cocky little boy!
But he solves crimes and I lose customers!
In Shinishi he's very smart.
But it turns out he's hurting me.
I'm leaving.
Go wherever you want!
(TV) "The famous detective Shinishi Kudo, today's Sherlock Holmes,
is a hero, according to the police department."
-He's so handsome, Shinishi Kudo! Yes!
I'll write him a love letter!
Eh?
You look like a fool, with this laughter.
Why are you mad at me, Ran?
Why should I be angry?
Because you do the job so well done that the father will have to close down?
But it's not my fault, that.
If you don't do the job right...
I told you I'm not angry.
Wow, you can tell this girl does karate.
If you hadn't quit soccer, you'd be a national hero by now.
I only played soccer to build muscle so I could be a detective.
Sherlock Holmes fenced.
But he's a fictional character.
But he's a detective everybody knows.
He was the best, Ran.

He kept his cool in all situations.
"He was highly intelligent and very cultured."
"He had unsurpassed insight and reasoning ability."
"He was also a great violinist."
"The Sherlock Holmes that Conan Doyle created was..."
the greatest detective in the world.
If you are so impressed by this, why aren't you a writer?
I don't want to write the adventures of a detective, I want to be a detective.
I want to be the Sherlock Holmes of the modern era.
The thrill of chasing a criminal!
The satisfaction of the catch!
When you've tasted this work, you can't put it down.
Look, fan mail!
They love detectives!
It's all very well to have admirers.
But it's better to have a girlfriend, isn't it?
Eeeh?
A girlfriend, you say?
Shinishi, why are you looking at me like that?
Eeeh?
How was I looking at you?
I have to go to class.
Hey, wait!
You remember, don't you, about tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
You promised me you'd take me on the amusement park ride
if I won the karate tournament!
What a face!
Ah, now I remember.
It was so much fun!
-I had a fit of courage. Let's go in.
You're so big and it turns out you're a chicken.
Let's go to the roller coasters of terror.
No, we only have money left to go home.
Don't sweat it, man, I'll figure it out.
Look, there's not much of a line at the roller coasters.
-Vinga. Go on, hurry up.
Those kids want to ride for free.
This youth of today...
The most curious thing about Sherlock Holmes is that when he met Watson,
in shaking hands with him, he discovered that he had been a military doctor.
Thus.
Ooooh!
Gee, you do gymnastics, don't you?
-How do you know? -Is he a friend of yours, Itomi?
The hardness of the hand.
A girl often has parallel ones in her exercise.
But playing tennis, they also come out.
Yes.
But the wind has lifted her skirts,
and I've seen some bruises on her thighs,
that come out when you do exercises on the parallel bars.
Well, you're a liar, Shinishi.
Will you let her hand go?
Eh?
Oh!
I'm so sorry!
Hey, don't you want to hit on my friend!
Gee, do you want us to change your place to the wagon?
-And now, don't kick yourselves. The two of them are rather lonely.
(Think) "Ran, I've always liked you.
Shinishi, so have I."
Shinishi, the tail is wagging.
What shall we do now?
Let's just get in line.
-And where is the tail? -Now we're looking for it.
Besides, Sherlock Holmes...
Step aside, we were first.
Conan Doyle wanted to present Sherlock Holmes as the best...
Flights shut up ?!
I'm sick of Sherlock Holmes!
What an obsession with detectives.
You don't know how excited I was to come here with you.
Can't you see how I feel?
Ran... Gee, no.
It's just that I... I...
Ah, donkey, why are you getting nervous?
It was just a joke!
You're not much of a detective, if you've swallowed it all.
That's just it:
I was really looking forward to today.
(Shouting)
Water? (screams)
What-what was that?
Let's break up the field here, quick!
(screams) What's this?
Looks like a police car.
What are you doing here?
Hey, we paid admission.
Hey, aren't you that famous young detective?
Shinishi Kudo, at your service.
-Oh, an accident? -How awful.
-What do you say, now! -You put a rope on her head.
-Why has she been murdered? -It's terrible!
I don't want to know anything!
I want to leave, understand?
The murderer is one of the 7 people who were in the wagon.
So are you!
Are you sure, Shinishi?
Shinishi said?
-Ooooooh! -Oooooh!
-The famous detective! -He's gorgeous!
-Yes, he's very handsome! -I've never seen it before!
It's in Shinishi Kuda.
La Ran and you're not suspects.
So there are only 5 left.
The victim's friends in front, A and B.
In the third apartment is the victim,
and C, his friend.
And, behind him, the men dressed in black, D and E.
But everyone had their security bars down.
The only one who could have killed him is her, because he was sitting next to her.
There, we can't waste time playing detective, us.
(Thinks) "What cold eyes. And what a look!
"He looks like he murdered someone sometime.
Who is it?"

He has a knife with blood on it!
I don't know how it got there!
Aiko, I thought you were happy, but why did you do it?
Why did you do it?
I'm innocent!
She's the murderer.
The rest of us can go now.
Okay, we'll detain her for questioning.
Inspector, wait.
It's not her, the murderer.
Isn't it?
Then who is?
As they say: the truth always prevails.
The murderer is...
is you!
What nonsense.
The knife was in the Iko's bag!
With that knife it's impossible to cut off a man's head.
You put the knife in her bag just before she got on the ride.
But she was sitting in the first car.
She couldn't have done it.
It can be done by harnessing the power of roller coasters.
Oooooooh!
Check it out: I'll be the killer and the inspector will be the victim.
Before lowering the bar I put that on my back.
I lower the bar...
and, as there is space, I get out easily.
Then...
Then I remove the anchor and the rope I was hiding.
I put my leg on the bar, bend down like this...
and put the gauze around the victim's neck.
The tunnel is very dark.
Finally, I attach the anchor to the rail.
The speed and the force of the train make the tragic end.
If you are a gymnast, you hold your balance to be able to do it.
You are crazy!
You have no proof!
Tell me where you have the necklace.
The pearl necklace you had before you got on.
This is it, isn't it?
Oh, and another thing: your tears.
You knew I was going to die, that's why you cried before I did.
You have blind tear marks on the sides of your eyes.
If you don't go on roller coasters,
they don't go to the side, the tears.
He asked for it!
He left me!
Itomi, I didn't know you were dating him.
Yes!
Long before I met you and Iko!
That's why I killed him here, where we met for the first time,
with the necklace he gave me.
I wanted to die too...
Oh, my God!
Come on, stop crying, woman.
How can you be so calm?
Ah, you're used to seeing dismembered bodies.
You're on ice!
No, but something to forget.
It happens every now and then.
I can't! I can't!
It's impossible!
(thinks) "It's one of the roller coaster men."
Excuse me, Ran, go ahead, you.
Wait, wait!
I'll see you later.
(Think) "Don't go.
"I don't know why,
but then I had a bad feeling.
I had the impression that it was the last time I would see him."
Hey, sorry to keep you waiting.
I've been waiting for you for two hours.
I came alone, like I promised.
I know, I've been watching you from the roller coasters.
Quick, quick, give me.
Don't run so fast.
First, the money.
Voice?
They're all here.
There must be a million!
All right, very well.
Give me the reel!
The reel of your company's secret shipment of weapons?
Are you sure it's the only reel?
Of course it is.
"Who must those guys be?"
Let's not dawdle any longer.
You've been followed by this guy!
Isn't he a detective?
You want me to take him out?
Save it though, the police are around here.
We'll use the poison our group discovered.
It's not detectable at autopsy.
It's never been tested on any human being.
So long, detective.
(Think) "The body!
"I burn!
"The bones!
"They seem to melt!
I won't make it!"

I gotta go my own way.
-Is anyone here? -Of course there is!
"So I'm dead.
-Look, he's still alive! Somebody call an ambulance!
"Am I alive?
"The poison has no effect on humans.
Be calm.
Be calm.
Come on, come on.
Can you get up, creature?
Breed?"
My body has shrunk!
But how!
How?
My name is Shin... I mean... What?
Ah...
Conan!
My name is Conan Edogawa!
Conan, where are you going?
Ran!
