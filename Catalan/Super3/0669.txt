(Conan voice) Do you know what they are, urban legends?
(Mitsuhiko) Yes, they are rumors that spread gradually,
of things that seem possible,
but which, in reality, are impossible.
(Ayumi) Like the one about the woman with a mouth that goes all the way up to her ears,
or the dog with the face of a person, right?
(Conan voice) Exactly.
Or the one of the Dark Tower.
It's a tower without doors or windows surrounded by mysteries.
Yes!
It's the tower in Kyodo Gardens, which is all black!
-Huh?
-You, don't shout so much.
-Well...
-The tower at Kyodo Gardens?
The one talking to the Ran is... is the Kyodo Nanami!
Yes, they're friends from high school and at the same karate club.
And her father's company, they do things like this.
-Wasn't it a stationery store?
-Toy factories?
No, no, and now.
What they make are lenses, mirrors and all kinds of optical material.
See.
(All) Oh...!
I'm sorry, excuse me.
Please don't touch anything.
No, it's all right.
I brought it because I thought that Conan and his friends
would like to see it.
Ah!
Well, thank you very much!
- (Genta) How cool!
- (Ayumi) Oh!
How nice!
(Mitsuhiko) Let-me-see, let-me-see!
(Ayumi) -Yes, and how many figures you see!
(Ayumi) -Have you seen how many colors?
(Mitsuhiko) What?
Nanami.
What you told me, it must be quite uncomfortable, because of you.
You've also thought that the Kyodo's residence
must be full of treasures, right?
What?
Ah, well...
The Momoe also came here because she thought we were very rich.
Momoe is my stepmother.
And my relationship with my father hasn't been going well for a long time now.
Do you think rich families live like kings?
No, we also have money problems.
Ah, well, I hope that, at least, I can find the treasure.
The Momoe is convinced it exists.
-O-on is it, this treasure?
That he speaks of a treasure?
But who has come to talk...
of a hidden treasure, you two, or what?
No, no, what are you saying?
We came here so that she could let off some steam.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No need to apologize, really!
- (all) Eh?!
-But, speaking of treasure?
Wouldn't you guys like to go treasure hunting?
You can count on me!
Just think, if you involve them, you won't be able to back out anymore, eh?
It's worth a try.
And if in the end they were lucky enough to find it, my father would be able to pay my father's pension,
my father could pay the pension to the Momoe...
And, if you think about it, he would be doing them a favor.
What do you say, then?!
Are you sure?
Which one of you is up for the adventure?!
(Shinichi's voice) "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
(All) Jooo!
(Shinichi voice) "The memories of summer are so vivid
that they impose on the passage of time and solve mysteries."
"What is the secret of the dark tower in the suburbs
without doors or windows?"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult, and he's Detective Conan!"

"The Secret Treasure of the Dark Tower (Part 1)"
All this is the garden of the house?
-It looks exactly like a park.
Yes, we're at the Kyodo residence.
(Shinichi voice) Eh?
Have you seen it?
(All) Oh!
Yes.
It's the Dark Tower.
It has no doors or windows.
Sometimes you can feel a mysterious laughter
coming from the top of the tower.
This tower was built by my grandfather, in Seitaro Kyodo,
40 years ago.
He was an engineer who liked to do extravagant projects.
I heard that the mansion is full of surprises.
(Nanami) The Dark Tower is a good example.
But now the father wants to sell it, along with the land.
Yes.
The Tower and the land?!

And the treasure hunt would go down the drain, of course.
That's why your mother is so angry.
I don't want to sell!
Especially not knowing about the treasure!
Please, don't be selfish!
It's the last chance I have to save the family.
I can't let it slip away because of your obsessions.
This is no obsession.
Tsutomu remembers it perfectly, doesn't he?
Yes, it was shortly before grandfather's death.
It's a very old story and I'd rather not get involved.
But you heard about the treasure!
And now don't run away from studying!
Yes, yes, it's true.
Yes, I heard about it.
(Woman) You see?!
It has long since been discussed in this way.
I feel bad that I have to see this little number.
They are adults, they will have their reasons.
My mother always has them with my father, too,
for what it's worth.
The truth is that she does.
It's a consolation.
Come on, what do you say we go see the tower?
(All) Yes!
(Conan voice) God-hay-do, it's so tall!
How should it be, the top?
I don't know, but if there's no window it must be very dark.
And why would your grandfather have it built?
-Of course, it would be the most logical thing to do.
-To hide the treasure, for sure!
Well, there must be some place to get in.
- (Ayumi) Yes, yes, run!
- (Genta) Let's go look for it, come on!
And your father has never told you about the hidden treasure?
No, never.
Maybe it's because he was the son-in-law
and the mother took the secret to the grave.
Who is it, Mr. Nagase?
Mr. Nagase in ten know things!
He had been my grandfather's assistant, and he was also an engineer.
He lives in the house attached to our mansion.
-We'd have enough of a clue.
-I don't know anything.
Can't you make an effort to remember something?
No matter how much you insist, I told you I don't know anything about any treasure.
I'm sorry, but if you don't need me for anything else, I'll retire.
Mr. Nagase!
I'm convinced you know things.
He's not very nice, but he's not a liar either.
And you, you could get it out of your head.
But let's see, if the treasure doesn't exist,
how are you going to pay me alimony when we get divorced?
Because you want us to divorce, tell the truth.
We don't have to go to this extreme either.
I'll pass on it.
Wait, Tsutomu.
People laugh at me.
I've heard them in the village, and I've also heard them talking about the treasure.
Tra-tranquila, woman.
Don't listen to the rumors going around the village...
Although there is no door in the tower,
perhaps it could be accessed through a tunnel from the house.
But that would be very complicated to do.
For Grandpa, nothing was complicated.
He was a genius!
Have you noticed the lighting in the garden?
Well, now look at the tower through the archway.
(All: call out)
-What's wrong with me?
I can't see well?
-How can it be?
But how do you understand?
(Conan voice) Because in the middle there is a screen of glasses.
Yes?
Since when?
Very good!
You are very smart.
(All) Oooh!
It's another one of the tricks my grandfather built.
I wouldn't be surprised if there was a subway tunnel.
Hello, Nanami.
You're having a party?
Ah, hello, mother.
This is Ran Mouri from high school.
The Momoe, my stepmother.
How many times do I have to say I'm not called that?
Thank you for being friends with her.
I know there were a lot of us here in the end.
Excuse me.
I saw you were talking to my brother.
Did he remember anything that might be useful to us?
He remembered something about a blue button,
but he didn't even know what it had a head for.
And who are these people?
We are members of the Junior Detective League!
I've been told they'll help us look for the treasure.
-And so much!
You're very welcome.
-I did the right thing, didn't I, inviting you?
See you later.
(Thinking) "What do you want them to find, this bunch of kids?"
-No, nothing.
-I'd say he doesn't trust us.
What a strong perfume!
Did you notice?
She was wearing very long false nails.
This long corridor here, how far does it go, exactly?
Down there it makes a 90-degree turn
and goes all the way to the storage room of the annex house.
They used to store miso, soy sauce and sake, but not anymore.

(Thinking) "In Nagase. What's he coming to do, in the warehouse?"
I've already been told he's been treasure hunting.
What, no luck, so far?
No, but I think, if there is any treasure, it must be in that tower.
It's very suspicious that there's a tower with no door or windows.
Yes, but, as you can't get in, it can't be there, the treasure.
How would they do it, to build it?
It seems impossible, with no way in or out.
-If we search well, we will find the entrance.
-Yes, you're right, but...
Yes, they have come to this conclusion.
And now, Tsutomu, explain everything you know.
Okay, I'll do that.
When I was 7 years old I caught a very bad cold
and I had a fever of 104,
and I remember my mother came in to see me, accompanied by my grandfather.
"They started talking at the edge of the bed."
Taeko, I tell you the secret of my treasure, and only you will know.
"When I reacted, they were gone."
"I got nervous and got up to go look."
"I think I fainted while I was looking for them."
"When I woke up, the mother was there with me."
Tsutomu, king, you got out of bed to follow us?
I see you smelled that we were talking about the treasure.
And you didn't say anything else?
Is that all you remember?
Yes.
But after a while I remembered something else.
Grandpa pointed to 3 colored buttons and said:
"If you touch this button, you will get to the treasure".
And which button was it?
The one Grandpa pointed to was the blue one.
-It's flashing!
- (thunder)
Wait a minute!
I just remembered something else!
When I followed the mother, I disappeared.
That's right.
I do not know how to explain it better.
-Well...
-But what do you mean?
I mean that... that-that I don't remember anymore.
But I'm sure it would be the entrance to the treasure.
And another thing: while I was walking I was crying.
Then I got older,
and after a moment I became small
and I saw myself as if in split images...
Flights stop!
You had such a fever that you must have been delirious!
But at least the treasure exists!
The only thing we have to do is to split up and look for it.
-No, no.
-What, Tsutomu? -What, Tsutomu?
Will you help us?
-Huh?
-I don't want to know anything about that.
The only thing that interests me is to be able to prepare these vegetables
with this beautiful blue-green color.
It's a case.
The Kyodo Company will go bankrupt when I have to run it.
(Ayumi) Of course not!
It won't go bankrupt because we'll find the treasure!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I hope it's true.
-Yes!
-You guys are the best!
What's that?
Well, I can't see it from here.
From here you can see the tower better.
How can that be?
I don't understand anything!
What do you mean?
I can see it from here, the tower.
Perfectly.
Of course you can!
These crystals are not normal.
Inside they have 3D images.
The investigation begins!
The weather outside is different from each window.
-Here there are clouds.
-From here, outside, it's sunny.
But so, what will the weather really be like?
Ah!
This is for real!
-It's the mother's voice!
- (woman: called, far away)
Mother!
Mother!
(woman: stop!)
Don't let the children come closer!
Your brother!
Momoe!
Momoe!
-That's it!
I just called!
-Call an ambulance!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Everything makes you think...
he fell from the top of the tower."
How could he have fallen from up there?
Then, how did he get up there?
If you can't get into the tower.
(Genta) Just when we could go into action...!
And that one says not to go near the children!
We had the housekeeper's permission to investigate!
(Mouri) What, was it an accident or will there be a case?
Ah, Mouri!
Yes, you knew it in a hurry!
Yes, it's that... I was thinking that there would be for dinner,
I called Ran and he told me everything.
You mean, he could have fallen from the tower?
No, that seems impossible to me.
It's easier that someone carried the corpse here.
But we all heard the scream he made.
Yes, but maybe they had it recorded.
It's not a complicated trick.
What's that?
A recorded scream?
He could have been hit in the head anywhere else.

and then carried it all the way up here.
Whichever way you look at it, it looks like she jumped from up there.
Yeah, the only problem is that there's no way to get into the tower.
Of course there is!
And that makes it so that the culprit has to be someone
who knew that the tower has no entrance!
I remind you that this is a beginner's deduction.
All members of the Kyodo family know that there is no way in,
in the tower.
This means that our suspect must be someone
who has come here for the first time, like now...
Like now... myself?
No!
What are you saying?!
But in Takagi before he told me
that the people run that in the tower there is a hidden treasure,
and that everyone knows that it is impossible to access.
What do you have?
Of course I have it!
I've got it, then!
The murderer has taken the body here
because it looked like it had fallen from the tower,
because he knew that this way the police would search it from top to bottom,
and sooner or later they would end up finding the treasure.
I see what you mean.
That's why the body was found under the tower.
That's right!
This means that the culprit...
It could be any member of the Kyodo family.
We're back to where we started.
-Inspector.
-Others!
There might actually be more suspects.
Mmm... if both the family and the company are in financial trouble,
that means they could all be suspects in the crime.
All except the girl, of course.
But since, in fact,
neither the father nor the son believe in the existence of the treasure,
your deductions have no basis in fact.
There is only one person who believes in the treasure theory.
So there we have it! .. It is obvious that this person must be the murderer.
But, unfortunately, this person is the victim.
-Conan, what do you think happened? -Oh!
-Oh...!
Do you think it could have been an accident, or not?
It was a murder!
In fact, we can't be entirely sure.
Think that the victim was just found in the garden.
The murderer didn't have time to carry the body there.
No, that's true.
Therefore, it would be logical to think that he fell from the tower.
But that would mean that the victim would have had to find the entrance
just after he'd spoken to all of us.
Yes, that's right.
It could have gone that way.
The killer knew the entrance,
set her up to discover it, and pushed her in.
(All) Oh...!
The murderer may still be hiding in the tower.
(Matsuhiko) But-but the first thing we have to do is to find out how to get in.
Right, and if the killer is inside and we find the entrance,
it won't even be necessary to enter.
The lady walked away following the lampposts in the garden, didn't she?
If there is an entrance to the tower, it must be that way.
Do you have any clues?
Nanami's grandfather in Seitaro was an engineer.
He must have hidden the entrance with glasses
like the ones we've been seeing so far.
What's the matter?
Just a moment.
Oh, this is very suspicious!
I just disappeared, or at least I thought I did.
Could it be that it was a door?
Have you seen this here?
I found it!
It's the secret entrance!
Mmm!
Mmm!
No, it can't be.
It's rusted.
Ouch!
Ouch...!
If it has entered the tower,
he must have done it through a normal entrance.
-I think so too.
-You're right.
-Ah...
-Try somewhere else?
(Genta) First it got big, then it got small...
(Matsuhiko) It looked like in split pictures...
And then it disappeared.
Oh, how beautiful!
Ah! (Matsuhiko)
Oh, look!
The ground has turned into a kind of planetarium.
We don't know what can happen.
We'd better not split up.
-Huh? -Ayumi, come here!
-Ayumi, come here!
-But...
-Don't stay here alone.
-Yes.
-Shall we go in together?
-Enter the washbasin.
-You too, Haibara?! -You too, Haibara?!
Ah, okay.
-I'll be right back.
-I'll be right back.
Come out, if you want.
It can't be that he disappeared.
That's impossible.
And this wind?
Let's see if...
Ah!
Haibara, where are you?!
What are you saying?!
The Ai has disappeared!
(Genta) Ouch!
Haibara!
-Haibara!
-Haibara, where are you?!
From this mirror in the wind.
- (Ayumi) Haibara!
- (mirror: stinging)
Surely there must be some other entrance!

Next door is the liquor store!
Let's look there, then!
Let's go!
-I'm used to it, from my father.
-Oh, what a smell of alcohol!
Look!
There's a mirror here too!
I don't understand what it's doing here, leaning against the wall.
The mirror is not here by chance.
It doesn't move.
It is very well nailed.
And surely Haibara must have entered through this trap.
(Tsutomu voice) "I'm going to disappear. I don't know how to explain it better."
Look, here's another mirror!
But how could it disappear?
This smell...
Don't smell so much, you'll still get drunk.
No, it's the perfume that Mrs. Kyodo was wearing.
And all over this area here it feels much stronger.
Oh!
I disappear...
What's the matter?
Now you see the ceiling, in the mirror, instead of us.
Because it's become a screen.
Oh!
And it reflects a picture coming from up there!
It's not glass.
That's the way in.
Maybe that's where the treasure is.
Let's go in!
-Oh!
-No, maybe there's the murderer.
(Both) Aaaah!
What do we do now?!
Eeei!
What do we do, Conan?!
What do we do?!
(Haibara) Aaaah!
It's the Ay!
Haibara!
Now we come!
He never used to call this way!
No, I'm coming with you too!
No, I'm coming.
You stay here.
No, I won't!
All right, then, but give me your hand all the time.
All right, then.
(crows squawk)

-We continue to look for them, then.
That the children have disappeared?
Perhaps Mr. Nagase can think of some place that escapes me.
E-don Nagase... Mr. Nagase is missing too!
(Shinichi, think) "Getting nervous and calling won't help me find them."
"Think..."
I'm at...
(Think) "Conan..."
"Don't miss the next episode:
'The Secret Treasure of the Dark Tower (Part Two) '."
