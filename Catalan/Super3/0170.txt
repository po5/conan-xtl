(Off) "The water that flows has no form, the wind is not seen,

"Today, in Kogoro will have a good scare.

I feel so all in Secret Life!
(Adult voice) From it... I feel like I'll be late.
Oysters.
What are you doing?
You've got all the classmates worried!
What's up, girl.
I'm involved in an impossible case.
What do you think?
Don't be silly!
Ah, sorry, Shinichi!
It's just that I have to go somewhere urgently.
See you later!
Watch out, don't get cold.
But... (has gone up: tut-tut-tut...)
(Thinking) "Lately, Ran has been a little strange.
"Whenever I call her, she always ignores me, and she doesn't call me by name like she used to.
But the strangest thing of all is..."
Ah, hello, Conan!
I'm going out for a while.
I've left dinner on the table.
You'll poach it in the microwave, eh?
Ah, yes...
(He thinks) "He goes out every afternoon and doesn't come back until evening.
"She says karate training,
but how come she's so happy?"
A blind spot in the dark, part one
(Off) A good day...
Have you been to the doctor several times?
Yes.
Now I have to pick up the test results.
Are you not feeling well, father? I've been tired for days.
Maybe you drink too much!
That's right!
It's not to come to pick up the school and all!
I think you're exaggerating!
The doctor asked me to go to the next of kin.
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?
(Woman) Mr. Kogoro Mouri!
Mr. Mouri...
We are talking about 6 months...
Eeeeeeeeeeeh?! Eeeeeeeeeeh ?!
I understand your situation, but these 6 months are important.
What do you think you are doing?
How dare you tell me so suddenly that I only have 6 months left?
Such a serious illness must be communicated tactfully!
Eh?
A serious illness?
I tell you that you must be 6 months without drinking alcohol.
Eh?
Without drinking?
That's right.
According to the results, he suffers from the beginning of cirrhosis.
Although it is not serious, but you have to watch out.
(Thinking) Well...
Gee, Dr. Araide!
You scared me!
You've got to make the family come...
With patients like you, who like to drink,
the collaboration of the family is essential.
They must see to it that you drink less.
Don't let him drink a drop! Hey, hey!
Hey, you got a call from Mrs. Sugita.
-She says if you can go visit her. -Again?
What a tiresome patient!
And yet she only has a stomach ulcer.
A patient?
What a face... A mistress, that's it!
Ah, sorry.
She'll be right in.
If you'd be so kind as to wait...
Ah... Of course...
May I go to the bathroom, please?
The patients' is not working and...
Let's see... He told me to turn right at the end of the corridor...
This way?
Here's the consultation room.
What a big house!
Ah!
Ah, sorry!
I wasn't looking! No, no, it was my fault.
Ah!
Here, they're all here and I'm sorry.
Ah, thank you.
By the way, who are you?
I'm Mr. Mouri's daughter, Dr. Araide's patient.
Ah, yes, I know him.
I'm Dr. Araide's son.
My name is Tomoaki.
I help the father at the doctor's office.
But I'm leaving next month, I got a position in Aomori.
(Cracking)
Again?
When will you get used to this house?
Didn't you ask us to get used to being the maid?
I... I sit down.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
Don't get so excited, it's not good for the heart.
Next time you'll be out on the street!
Everything has a limit!
I've had enough!
Thank you very much, doctor!
Do not do excesses and you will live longer, okay?
Since you're named after that famous detective, at least...
Don't you know him?

He is a famous detective...
Ah, well, it's just that... well... I'm...
Eh?
Are you?
Are you?!
Yes.
Caram.
What a surprise!
At first I thought maybe it was.
But I let it go.
You got me all tangled up, making it look like I had no idea about medicine!
Why don't you come to dinner so we can talk about medicine?
No, we can't.
I have homework and Ran has to go to karate training, right?
That's all right.
Since we're invited...
Besides, if I miss a training session, it's fine.
(Thinking) Wow... She's been so strange lately.
You were first in your class in college?
That's impressive!
Yeah, isn't it, Tomoaki?
It's no big deal...
So, you could marry my daughter, right?
Father, please!
-We'll make a great couple. -Let's go for it, Mother, please.
Ouch!
Are you all right?
Watch out, the cream is very hot.
Yes, excuse me.
By the way, mother, aren't you organizing an alumni meeting?
Ah, yes!
I have to call the Masae!
Hey, kid, if you rethink, let me know.
If we worked together, we could be like Sherlock Holmes and Watson.
Detectives and doctors are not meant to work together.
Besides, doctors' mission is not to do autopsies to find the killer,
but to try to save the lives of the victims.
Ah... Gee nano, you just scored me a goal.
What you didn't say is who would be Sherlock Holmes, right, Ran?
(Thinking) Ran...
He's late, your father.
He should have folded long ago.
It's in the bathtub!
He has a habit of bathing before dinner.
He's the first one and leaves the dirty water for the rest of us.
Come on, Grandma!
Don't say such things!
It's normal, the master of the house bathes first, isn't it?
He's a stranger who came here when he married my daughter.
But Grandma!
In this house you are the only one left with blood of the family,
and it turns out that next month you won't be!
-For you, I could die already! -Grandma...
Ah... Grandma, no soup?
No!
I don't feel like eating surrounded by strangers!
Don't pay any attention.
Ever since Father changed the Japanese-style bathroom for a modern one,
he's in a bad mood.
A modern one?
He got angry because he changed the cypress wood bathtub
for a tall one, with a shower and a curtain.
Wow, she is a very energetic grandmother!
What's up?
The light's gone.
It's only gone here.
Next door they've got it.
(Cracking) Oh!
Are you all right?
I think the flashlight's in that drawer.
I've got it.
I'm going to the garage to check the leads.
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.
Watch out, don't fall, Hikaru.
(Woman) -Yes.
(Woman) - Hey!
(Woman) What's wrong? -The power's gone out.
Oh, man.
That it starts to rain? It seems so.
(Kogoro) What a mess.
Ah, it's already come.
(Kogoro) Ah!
(Kogoro) Ah!
(Kogoro) Sorry!
I thought it was my father!
But what's going on here?
Ah, grandmother what do we do?
(Woman) What do you think, the price?
30,000 yen is a bit too much.
(Woman) -Are the lights on? -Beneita!
Can't you see?
We should go see the father.
He must be angry about the light,
and the way his heart is...
-I'm coming. -I'm coming too.
Why did the light go out? I don't know.
It must have been a power outage.
(screams)
What's the matter?
It's... from the bathroom!
(screams) Father!
(screams) Father!
Do not touch it!
If you touch it, you'll be electrocuted too.
I'll be electrocuted?
Let's see, what has been...
See the extension cord of this razor.
Come on, I'll try to revive him.
Mother, take the pills for the heart!
Hikaru, call an ambulance!
-Hurry! Yes!
Hurry up!
Please, please.
Since you're calling, call the police, too.
(Thinking) "It seems that the extension cord has entered the water,
and has caused a deadly shock.
"To shave, he had to look in that mirror on the wall.
"But why was he shaving in the bathtub?
Wait a minute!
Let's see if..."
Gentlemen, I am sorry to inform you that Mr. Araide is dead.
He had been suffering from a heart condition for some time...
No... It can't be... It can't be!
Kogoro, how was he when you found him?

He was lying down, with his head in this band.
How is it, that he shaved inside the bathtub?
He had this habit.
He did it whenever we had guests.
He had this special mirror put in, that doesn't fog up...
It's a very strange habit, to bathe while the guests are waiting for him.
He liked to bathe very much.
He bathed in the morning and at night.
He said that cleanliness is the most important thing.
(Grandmother) He asked for it!
He's been punished for not following Chiaki's advice.
It must be a punishment that Chiaki sent him, may she be glorified.
Come on, Grandma!
Who is it, Chiaki?
It was my mother.
She left us 4 years ago, in a car accident.
I always told her not to shave with the razor while bathing.
That it was too dangerous.
Yoko, you, then, are the second one.
Yes.
I am the second woman.
I had been classmates with Chiaki,
and I had to put up with a lot of rumors.
Inspector!
Look at this!
To shave in front of the mirror,
the plug that connects the machine's cable to the extension cord
is right on the edge of the bathtub.
How dangerous.
Where were you when the power went out?
We were all in the kitchen.
The only one who wasn't there was grandma,
who was going upstairs, on the other side of the bathroom.
So, most probably, Mr. Yoshiteru
got the machine's cable into the bathtub
and was electrocuted to death.
It must have been an accident.
Ha I think so.
Aaaaah!
Oh, what a pain!
Listen to me!
What are you doing, man?
There's something I don't understand.
Eh?
What is it?
That the gentleman who died was shaving
in the same way as Inspector Takagi was doing now, right?
When he shaved, he should have fallen with his head here like him.
Why did he have his head on the other side of the bathtub?
It's strange.
You're right.
Well, it must have been because...
Ah... The explanation is quite easy.
While shaving,
you noticed that the cable was about to enter the bathtub
and turned to pull it out,
but ended up accidentally putting it in the water.
Then he must have touched the railing, the current passed to him.... Aaaaaaaah!
And he fell like that.
Isn't that very logical?
(Thinking) What an imagination...
Ah!
Don't play with it!
The razor is very important evidence, for the police!
I only have it in my hand!
Well, Inspector Takagi did... No, no, I've only been holding it!
Then it must have been you.
No.
I just took a picture.
That's strange.
Who did it, then?
Who must have...?
Who did what, marreeeeec?!
Look, the razor is off.
It wasn't working.
Eh?
How's that?
That's strange.
If she got electrocuted while shaving, it should be on.
When Takagi fell
she must have accidentally moved the switch and stopped it.
(Turns it on) Eh?
But we have unplugged it precisely because no one is shaving.
It's true.
Here I have the plug.
Wow!
But it works with batteries!
Well, how come it's stopped?
Nobody has touched it, right?
No...
It must not have been because of the noise?
Surely it must have been because the noise was not felt.
Because who didn't feel it?!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I just said that, Kogoro.
Maybe someone put the cable in the water with the machine stopped
because the victim didn't notice anything.
If someone had put the cable in, the victim would have noticed!
Besides, we know what everyone was doing when the power went out.
By the way, when the power came back on, it went out and then came back on.
Miss Hikaru, you went to check the wires, didn't you?
Yes.
Did you connect them twice, by any chance?
Ah, yes, sir.
The first time I made a mistake and they jumped again,
and then I lifted the ones that touched.
I'm very sorry.
Mr. Inspector, the second blow, the circuit breaker...
maybe it jumped and...
No.
It may have been set up with a timer
to cause the blackout,
then entered the bathroom to put the cable in the bathtub.
By doing so, it is possible that... The killer is one of them 4.

What are they, so many secrets?
What have you discovered?
Ah, nothing.
We would like to check the alibis you have told us.
That we haven't explained it to you?
Well, well, well!
Are you insinuating that there's a murderer among us, Inspector?
We just want to check the alibis.
As long as there was no light, it was the phone?
Yes.
From before he left until he didn't come back,
I've been talking on the phone from the kitchen door.
I was talking to a friend, the Masae, to arrange a meeting.
By the way, there was another call,
but when I got on they hung up right away.
Takagi!
Check it out, quick! OK.
After the power went out,
I went to get the flashlight and gave it to Hikaru.
After that I didn't move from the kitchen.
Can anyone confirm this?
I don't think so.
Tomoaki didn't move from here, Inspector!
When Hikaru went to look at the leads,
I was so scared that I grabbed Tomoaki's arm.
All the time? Mmm.
Is that so?
Yes.
All the time.
I thought it was the father!
And you, Mrs. Mitsu, where was it?
When we were in the dark, it was at the top of the stairs.
I groped my way to my room.
But when the light came back on, it was down here again, wasn't it?
I noticed a presence.
Before I entered the room I noticed a strange presence.
You... you mean someone from outside came in?
Explain yourself!
I thought so too, but when I went downstairs I saw that it was...
And what was it?
Well, it was starting to rain.
Ah, well...
Finally, Miss Hikaru.
Yes.
I've gone to look at the wiring,
but I don't know the house very well and I got lost and it took me a while.
And, listen, have you seen anyone suspicious?
No, no one.
I thought so.
I've been watching you touch your arm for a while now.
You've always had a lot of dough.
(Thinking) A burn?
Excuse me, inspector.
He should heal.
Can we go to the consultation room?
Let him accompany you to the inspector who is the corridor.
What should he watch?
Oh, by the way, Mr. Tomoaki...
You are the only one who has left the house, between 5 and 7.
Where did you go?
To coach a high school basketball team.
The coach of the team had been a teacher of mine,
but he's injured and asked if he could fill in for a while.
A doctor who coaches college basketball?
I asked Ran.
I go to the same high school as her, and she can confirm it.
You know Professor Taguchi, who coaches the basketball team, right?
Ah, yes.
(Thinking) "Now I understand why I go to karate training every day.
"That's something I didn't expect.
I didn't expect that."

I'm sorry, but can you look at the leads again?
Why did the light go out again?
Ah, that man said I don't know what to do an experiment in the bathroom?
Gee, no.
Father!
(Kogoro voice) You're the one who murdered her!
In the next chapter...

The clue to the next Conan is... A burn and a wound!

Were you here, Shinichi?
