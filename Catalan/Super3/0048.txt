"The cases he investigates at Conan get more complicated every day."
"A rival of Shinichi's appears today."
"Will he be able to win the battle, in Conan?"
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult...
And he's... Detective Conan!"

DETECTIVE CONAN
The assassination of a diplomat, part one
(Adult voice) aaaaaaaa-aaatxim!
After all the time you haven't called me,
and the first thing you do is sneeze!
Shinichi, come back right away!
I wish I could...
But I'm investigating a very complicated case.
(Ringing) Well, a visitor?
Someone's here.
Call me some other time.
And take care of this cold, Sinichi.
Hey, Ran?!
Ran?! (He's gone up: tut-tut)
Coi de Ran!
(Tut-tut)
She worries if I don't call her (tut-tut)
and when I call her, she pretends not to care and keeps on complaining.
(Tut-tut)
(Conan voice) Ay sir!
They make you go crazy, women!
(Boy) Come on, don't fool me!
I'm sure it has to be here.
Come on out, Shinichi Kudo!
Tell him to come out!
(Thinking) "Eh? Me?"
I want to talk to him!
Conan!
Conan, you've caught a cold too, you?
Come on, come on, be quiet.
In Conan, Shinichi... There must be a cooling step.
Shinichi is?
If you don't know where he is, how can you know he has a cold?
Because Shinichi called me and he had a very cold voice.
He called you here?
He calls from time to time!
You don't have to do anything!
You're Shinichi's girlfriend.
The rumors are true.
What's that?
The girlfriend?
Who says so? Who says so?
Your friend, that girl named Suzuki!
She told me that it was likely that you and ltinguessis hiding here.
(thinks) "That Sonoko..." (thinks) "I detest her!"
And what did she talk about, if I may ask?
Nothing important.
About an interesting novel he had read,
about soccer and sports,
about how her friends are doing, her studies...
And about you?
Eh?
If he talks about me?
Well, now that you mention it...
Shinichi always talks about him, he hasn't asked me how I'm doing.
Hey, hey!
What's the matter?
Hey, wait a minute!
What's the matter with you? Don't you find him strange?
If he calls you, it means he cares about you,
and the most logical thing would be for him to ask you how you are, right?
I'd say that if he never asks you how you are, it's because...
Shinichi Kudo is near here and he's keeping an eye on you!
What?
Ten hovers around here.
Shinichi's... worried about me?
You know what, Ran?
He's probably spying on you from somewhere.
He's a coward!
(thinks) "Who is he, this guy?"
By the way, who are you?
That's right, I haven't introduced myself yet.
My name is Heiji Hattori.
I'm a young detective, like Shinichi.
What?
You're a detective too?
Detective?!
(Thinking) "He's a detective."
Aaaaaaaaatxim!
Hey kid, if you have a cold, I have a medicine that will do you good.
Now that you mention it, I've heard of...
of a detective in the Kansai area who is very smart.
I'm told in Hattori from the west, and in him, Shinichi from the east.
They always compared us.
He has.
Ah, thank you...
It's been a long time since anyone heard from Shinichi Kudo.
He doesn't appear in the newspapers like he used to...
and by profession they say he's disappeared.
And I'm the famous detective Kogoro Mouri, from the east!
Why do you want to find him?
I'm not interested.
I just want to see him to check something.
And I'm Mouri from the east.
I want to know if Shinichi Kudo is worthy of being compared to me, or not.
Hey, Conan!
What's wrong with you?
Look, Ran, pretty... Hip!
Geez, Conan!
Hey, what did you give him?!
A Chinese liquor called "Paikaru".
I give it to you!
Because I'll stay with you until Shinichi shows up.
I'll talk to you later!
How many times do I have to ring the bell?
They really treat customers badly in this office.
I'm in a hurry.
How about it?
Could we get to the point, please?

(Kogoro) An inquiry about your son's girlfriend.
Here's her photo and personal data.
"Yukiko Katsuragi, 24 years old."
From what it says here, she studied at Mitsuba High School
and was at the top of her class.
She is studying medicine at Tokyo University and will soon graduate.
-She's not proud?
-It's not that... It's just that...
She's distrusted because she's too perfect.
How suspicious we humans become!
When we see something perfect, we want to find flaws.
I'm going to be right, aren't I, madam?
-Hey, who is this guy? -Ah, he's a friend of my daughter's.
Let's let him run.
We'll finish talking at my place.
Also... he'll be my husband.
Well... You want us to go right now?
Why didn't you come with your husband?
Because I told you he's a diplomat.
If anyone saw him come in here...
It would be a scandal, wouldn't it?
Very well!
I'll come to see him too!
What?!
It would be less suspicious to be visited by a man with his son.
Wouldn't it?
-You're right.
You can come too, noi. Eh?
Mrs. Tsujimura!
You come, too.
But why me? The more the merrier.
Besides, this way, Shinichi is able to introduce himself.
What's that?
Hey, Ran... Ran, listen!
Come on let's go to him!
Let's go to him!
But you have a cold, Conan.
The medicine's kicked in.
I'm fine!
What did I tell you?
(Think) "Asshole."
"I'm worse, and I don't feel like going."
"But if this guy goes alone, who knows what he'll say."
-Mrs. Tsujimura, welcome. -Mrs. Tsujimura, welcome.
-Where is he, my husband?
Well... he'll be in his study, though.
But who are they, these gentlemen?
Mr. Mouri and his sons.
Ah!
Mother!
Hello, mother!
The girl from the fo...!
What are you doing here?
I made her come.
The father didn't want to meet her, but I made her come home.
Father has locked himself in the study and won't come out.
Are they your friends, all these people, mother?
Shut up!
You don't have to hit anything!
And you have no right to call me mother!
Who do you think you are, you brat?!
I'm very sorry for you.
Come on, please.
This stepmother of mine is pretentious!
Hello, father, they're already here, but not now...
And now!
What do you want to say?
You told me you wanted to see the fish I caught.
What?
Isn't it nice, the fish?
Ah, yes, and so much... You'll explain later.
-Wait for me in the room downstairs.
-All right. -Okay.
(Opera)
King?
They're already here. #
King!
How strange.
Maybe he's gone out. #

Oh my gosh, you are. #
How could you have fallen asleep at the table with the music on?

An opera. #
King, king.
Wake up, please! #
Come, King!
King... King!
Ah! #
King!
Wake up, King!
It's no use, this man is already dead.
Ran!
Come on, call the police!
Yes!
Reeeei!
(Think) "The body is still warm."
"And her lips have started to turn purple."
"Eh? A red spot on the neck."
"What if it was...?"
AAAAAAAAA! Aiiiiiiii!
What's this damn nano doing here?
You should watch him a little more, Ran.
He's too small to look at a corpse!
The deceased is Tsutomu Tsujimura, 54, a diplomat.
Coincidentally, the detective at the scene of the crime was...
The famous Kogoro Mouri himself, Inspector Megure!
It's a murder case, too, this one, Kogoro?
Well, there's no definite proof.
It must be...
This corpse!
Take a good look!
Eh?
He'll be.... Poisoned!
Yes, he's been poisoned... eh?
It's obvious gentlemen, someone has poisoned this man!
Take a good look.
He has a red dot on his neck.
And the murder weapon, a needle, was next to the corpse.
We found him dead with his head resting on his hand,
but he was left in that position after he was poisoned.
But it could be a suicide.
Don't you understand yet?
Take a good look at the corpse.
His lips and the tips of his hands and feet have turned purple.
This proves that he has drowned.

But there is nothing to indicate that she has been strangled,
nor does she appear to have suffered.
She has been given the poison, which has affected her nervous system,
and she drowned very quickly.
It must be a poison that kills instantly.
Considering that the corpse was warm,
and rigor mortis was not yet very advanced...
the murder must have taken place 30 minutes before we went in.
And it must have been someone who was already in the house.
Kogoro!
May I ask who this guy is?
A brash young detective by the name of Heiji Hattori.
Heiji... Hattori?!
Ah, it's you?
You're the son of police chief Heizo Hattori, from Osaka headquarters?
The headquarters, the police chief...?
(Thinking) "I don't know why, but this Hatori...
He looks like Shinichi."
Aaatxim!
Are you okay, Conan?
(Thinking) "Wow! My cold has gotten worse."
Ah... Let's see, all the windows are locked from the inside.
No one can get in.
The only way in and out is through the door.
One of the people in the house has used the key to get in.
Mrs. Tsujimura, there must be more than one key to the study, right?
Well, there are only two.
I have one.
It's this key.
The other one, my husband had.
He what?
Your husband?
Yes, he had the key to the studio in his pants pocket.
Wait a minute, let-let me look.
Yes, he did.
But how can that be?
Hey... What's the matter with you?
Don't you understand?
When we came in, the door was locked!
This means that the murderer locked it after killing him.
One of the two keys is the one that Mrs. Tsujimura used,
and the other is the one the inspector found in his pocket.
Therefore, it is an impossible crime.
She was murdered in a locked room!
(At the same time) In a locked room?
How can this be?
(Thinking) "I thought as much."
"The deductions this guy attributed to himself in the newspapers are not his.
"It's Shinichi Kudo!"
"It's him, which has solved all the cases."
"And probably, he'll try this time too."
"Now we'll see who solves it first, this one."
"In Shinichi Kudo is a good opponent!"
(Thinks) "Ah, I feel bad. My ears are starting to whistle."
"I have to settle this case and go home to rest."
Hey, what are you doing, you?
The murder took place between 2/4 of 4 and 4 o'clock!
Don't you question the suspects to see if they have an alibi?
Yeah, sure, you're right.
Defend your honor!
It can not be that an outsider and gives us orders!
I trust you, as always, Kogoro Mouri!
Eh?
What... what...?
Well, you're Mr.
Koike, the butler,
and between 3 and 4 o'clock you've been talking to a neighbor.
Yes.
That's good.
And Takayoshi and Yukiko arrived before the lady?
Yes, that's true.
Where were you, while Mr. Koike opened the door to the lady?
I went upstairs to see the father,
but as the studio was closed and he didn't answer me, I went downstairs.
Then, I greeted the mother when she came in.
Mr. Toshimitsu, you arrived at two o'clock?
That's right, I also came to the studio,
but Tsutomu was locked inside and Kimie was outside.
I went to the next room to watch TV.
What time did you leave? Around one o'clock.
(Thinking) "Apart from Koike and Mrs. Tsujimura,
these 3 are the only ones who could have gotten close to the victim."
My goodness how many CDs they have!
Yes, Mr.
Tsujimura was very fond of classical music.
(Think) "Classical?"
"Wasn't an opera playing, when we found the body?"
Mrs.
Tsujimura... This picture...
"Eh? Oysters!"
Haven't you asked enough questions?
It's a photograph from 20 years ago.
"Oooh... I see wrong."
What do we do, the books on the table?
Let it be.
"Books?"
"There were several books stacked in front of the corpse,
as if they'd just been pulled off the shelf."
There's something strange, the victim's key.
What does it say?
The key ring opens and inside there's... A piece of zeal!
(thinks) "What is it, this mark in the middle?"
Let me see it, inspector.
Conan, what's wrong with you?
(Thinking) "My chest hurts."

"I have to solve the case and get this guy going."
Haven't you thought of anything, Kogoro?
Come on, man, make an effort!
-No, nothing at all.
W-Wait a minute!
Maybe...
(Thinks) "That pile of books in front of the corpse,
and the opera that was playing..."
(Thinks) "The zeal of the key, that mysterious mark in the middle...
And the space underneath the door..."
(Think) "Opera?!"
(Think again) "I've got it! The enigma of the locked room!"
"And the murderer..."
Help me...
Eh?
Conan!
Conan, come on, what's wrong with you?
Hurry up!
Send for a metge.
Yes.
He has a high fever!
What?
Isn't it here, in Hattori?
He asked me where the Japanese room was and it's gone.
(Thinks) "The Japanese room."
(Thinks) "It must be here."
"If my suspicions are true, it must be in this room."
"It must be!"
"I've already found it!"
"I've got it!"
"Shinichi, I've won the game!"
Excuse me, could we put it in some room?
Put it on my bed, if anything.
It's the last room, at the back! Thank you.
Just to let him rest for a while.
What do you want, Heiji?
I have the answer to the riddle of the locked room.
I know who the murderer is.
(All) What?! (All) What are you saying?!
(All) What?
You've already solved the case?
This is what you get for getting distracted, Kogoro!
I'll prove it to you right now, gentlemen.
(Think) "Fishing line?"
Inspector Megure, could you put it in the place where the corpse was found?
Well, all right...
(Think) "This kid... maybe he already knows everything."
At the time of the crime,
the windows of this room were locked from the inside.
You had to enter or exit through the door, which was locked.
It is impossible to commit the crime and escape from this locked room.
But even in a locked room, there is a space to flee.
A space?
Yes, that space under the door!
You must not mean
that the murderer has put the key in the victim's pocket through there.
That's exactly right.
It would be possible.
It would be enough zeal...
and this fishing line with a needle I found.
Eh?
Fishing line?
Are you all right?
Conan, don't worry.
The doctor will be here soon.
(thinks) "Shit!"
"It's bad luck already, catching a cold at a time like this!"
Conan!
What's wrong with you?
First of all,
when the killer has finished killing the victim,
by plunging a poisoned needle into his neck,
he stole the key from his pocket.
Then, he took some fishing line strung on a needle.
He stuck the head that did not have the needle on the key ring with adhesive tape.
Then, with the needle,
he put the thread through the victim's pocket.
He put the victim on the chair and put him in this position.
He took the two ends of the thread and went out the door.
He passed the thread under the door and closed it.
Afterwards, the murderer only had to put the key down on the floor
and carefully pull the head of the needle.
The key passes under the door.
And as you can see, it ends up in the victim's pocket.
Hey!
It's in!
And if you pull harder...
the thread comes loose from the thread.
Then the thread is put away, thus eliminating any evidence.
You see?
The room is closed again!
Hm... You're right, kid.
Conan, calm down!
Come on, Conan!
(Thinking) "It's so hot! My heart will explode!"
(Doorbell rings) It must be the doctor.
(Doorbell) Wait!
I'll be right back with the doctor!
(He thinks) "Will I die?"
"My time has come!"
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Heiji: thinks) "What, Shinichi?"
"Do you have anything to say about my deductions?"
"Hurry up, otherwise I'll solve the case alone."
(Tune of "Step by step")
DETECTIVE CONAN
No... it's not true!
You're wrong!
Shinichi!
(Thinking) "Shinichi!"
Shinichi!
Why do you say I'm wrong?
How can that be?
! It's absurd!
That's right!
The murderer...
...is you!
In the next episode...
The murder of a diplomat, part two
