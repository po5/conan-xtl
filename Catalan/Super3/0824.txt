What do we do now?
Do you have any bright ideas, little brother?
Can't you see I'm thinking?
Do me a favor and shut up, man!
(Door: itchy)
(Door: itchy)
(Door: itchy)
(Mitsuhiko) Excuse me.
Can you open up for us, please?
(Genta) If you don't let us in soon, my pee will run out.
Hang in there, Genta.
They'll open the door soon.
(Genta) Anybody here?
What luck!
Look, it's open.
Genta...
Can I go to the bathroom?
-Ooooh!
-Aviam, where will it be?
(Ayumi) How cool!
Have you seen how many toys?
(Mitsuhiko) Yes, it looks exactly like a toy museum.
(Ay...) Where should it be...?
Ah.
- (Genta) Look, there was someone.
(Mitsuhiko) -Huh?
(Genta) Please.
Can I go to the bathroom?
Yes, yes..., of course I can.

(Genta) Come on, hurry....
(Genta) See.
That one is in Gomera, isn't it?
(Mitsuhiko) Oops!
But it's huge!
And may I know why you let them in, little brother?
And what did you want me to do?
Don't suffer, we'll let them go to the toilet and we'll take them out.
Look, the toilet must be here.
Come on, let's go.
Oh.
Really? (Laughs)
-Huh? -You got the wrong door, guys.
-You've got the wrong door, guys. -You've got the wrong door.
You must be Mr. Masaki Amamiya, right?
That's the name that was on the door.
And therefore, you must be Mr. Sho, his older brother.
I heard you called him "little brother."
Yes, that's right.
I'm the older brother, Sho Amamiya.
And I'm the little brother, Masaki Amamiya.
And you live together in this supermansion?
Yes.
We are two brothers who are very close and very fond of toys.
Toys are the bomb!
Can we talk when I've gone to the toilet?
Oh, yes, it's true.
-Donkey!
-Tatan!
Can't you see it's the toilet, this?
Excuse me, guys.
It's just that we haven't lived here for long.
Now I don't remember where it was, the toilet.
Of course, now I understand why you're wearing gloves.
They were making the move when we arrived, weren't they?
Were you?
Ah.
Yes, they were.
He-he-he-he...
(Sho) Look, I've already found it.
It's here.
(Sho) Thank you.
(Toilet chain)
Ouch.
What a break!
Why don't we just ask them to let us stay
until it stops raining?
Good thinking.
Maybe we can help them settle in.
No way.
We might as well leave.
Why? Because if we get there any later than we should.
Because if we're any later than we should be, we'll make the doctor suffer.
All right, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
-No, and now!
Thank you very much for everything.
Be careful on the way, okay?
(Woman) Help!
Somebody help me!
(Woman) Shit.
That woman has already woken up.
(Woman) What?
(Woman) Alert.
Mail, guys!
Hold it!
But what's wrong?
I do not understand!
-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
-You will not leave.
Mail!
These men are thieves!
What!?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
"What a mess!"
"The doctor is checking my slippers and anesthetic darts."
Shit.
Let's let it go, it's all the same.
Let the kids be and we'll play the deuce.
Yeah, man!
The gold bars must be hidden somewhere in this house.
She still hasn't told us where the loot is, we can't leave.
Let's go!
E... understood, understood.
The initials on the sweatshirts were a K and an M?
Yes.
And there was also a woman's dress, so I think...
that the real residents of this house
are a man named Kakeru and a woman named Maki.
- (Genta: call)

Then, the scream we heard...
Let go of me!
Oh, shit.
What can we do?
Genta!
Genta, ajupe't!
I told you to leave me!
Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Hurry up, Genta.
Hurry up!
Yes, I'm coming.
-(woman) Huh?
- (woman) Somebody help me, please!
Soc here.
(woman) Here.
-(woman) Yes.
-(woman) Is he all right?
I had just lost consciousness.
You must be Maki Amamiya, right?
And what are you?
-No, we're much more than that.
-You're just a bunch of kids?
-What?
-We're the Junior Detective League.
Alert, they're selling!
Shit!
If you'd been quicker, they wouldn't have got away from us.
What are you doing now?
Help me look for them!
Yes, yes, I'm coming, man.
Fuck!
Where could they be hiding?
Anyway, the house is awesome.
Yeah, there's toys everywhere.
It's my husband,
who sometimes looks like a child trapped in a grown man's body.
And where is he now?
He's a toy collector.
Well, I don't know.
I thought he was at home, but he must have gone out while I was taking a shower.
By the way, does he have a landline?
Those two men said they'd cut the line.
And I don't have a cell phone either, because they took it.
We don't have our cell phones with us either, we left them all at the camp.
This means that we won't be able to call for help.
But it's very strange.
At this time of day, the police usually pass this way...
while they're on their patrol.
Yes, but it's pouring rain today.
Maybe they'll be a little later than usual..,
or maybe they won't even be able to come today because of the bad weather.
- (Sho) I heard voices over there.
-(Sho) And now!
(Sho) Hurry up.
Something to use as a weapon.
(Sho) I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you ended up involved in all this.
(Ayumi: call)
It wasn't your fault, don't suffer.
-We have no choice.
-What do we do now?
- (Maki) Don't move.
-We'll tie them tightly together and...
Is it for real?
(It's fake, man.
Don't be silly.
Yes.
At first, it was.
But it turns out my husband
is a big fan of remodeling toy guns.
Want to check it out?
Now.
Aaaah!
You touched me!
(All) Yes.
Is he okay, guys?
He shot me in the chest.
I'm not getting out of this alive.
(All) Nonsense!
Woe betide you if you die!
What's that?
But you're not bleeding or anything!
What?
Ah.
Ouch!
-I'm so sorry, excuse me.
-Punyeta.
(Sho) They've got us all tangled up.
(Sho) Come here!
Hurry up.
What's the matter?
When I catch them, I'll kill them.
Hey, we're here!
You brats!
I'll catch you!
Aaaah!
Ui.
He-he-he-he-he...
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-Come here!
Ouch.
Ouch...
Oh, boy, you!
What's this stuff?
It's a super strong glue for making plastic models.
It's your turn, Genta.
Ah!
Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-whatever, somebody help me!
It's the same.
Now they'll slip on the bullets they've thrown themselves.
Viscaaa!
-Avall!
-Avall!
Yes!
Devil's Marrecs!
-You shut up and follow me.
-It's too dangerous.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Watch out, little brother.
Behind you!
Eh?
I don't believe it.
Aaaaiiiiii!
Help!
Yes!
It's time.
Hurry up!
"This is... It can't be."
Go on, I'll catch up.
Conan, where are you going?
(Ayumi: shrieks)
This man must be...
Kakeru!
"This has been done... by those two?"
What is he going to do to us?
Will we end up like this poor man?
We'll see.
This only depends on you.
Isn't it?
We know from the words that God sent us.
We know that in this mansion there is a good pile of gold bullion.
God?
You came in to steal because God told you to?
Where did you escape from?
From an insane asylum?
Watch what you say!
Where are the ingots?
Tell me, if you don't want me to fight you right now.
We've finally found them.
With it we'll be able to pay off all the debts we owe.
Oh, of course we can.
We can finally get rid of all our debtors.
Yeah, but... what about the police?
Won't they be looking for us?
I'd rather have the police than the debtors.
And if, in addition, we make that woman and that scoundrel disappear,

there will be no one left alive who can identify us.
There are a lot of them.
Yes, maybe I would do the deed.
This one's a doozy.
Oh! (Laughs)
What do you think, this one, Conan?
You look more handsome with the mask.
Yeah, not bad.
-Joking, man.
-But what a bar!
I don't get it.
How can you laugh, under these circumstances?
Because we have Conan with us.
No matter how desperate we are, with him we always succeed.
About it, little brother... Are you sure, that you want to kill the children?
Shouldn't we consult God?
Don't come out with scruples, now.
They've seen our faces, we have to get rid of them.
Eh?
(Voices from beyond the grave)
U-one-one-one-one monstreee!
Aaaaah!
Where are you going now?
Catch, you donkey!
No way.
Don't stop ordering me around all day.
I'm sick of you!
But... Who do you think you are, you bastard?
Bravo!
Come on, guys, let's go.
What the...?
You've made a fool of us again.
I can't stand you anymore!
-Ayumi!
-Noooooo!
Ayumi, no!
-People!
-Ayumi!
Watch out, Conan!
There's no escape now, you brats.
Ew, gross!
But what a bad smell they make, this pair!
Man, just think, we haven't been able to bathe for days!
Poor things... I can't even imagine what they've been through.
It's been very hard.
I have good news.
The police say they'll be here soon.
Hey, this is an injustice.
We're thieves, no one died.
You think we'll fall for this?
It's true.
We just made it look like we killed her ourselves.
-Bah.
I don't want to hear any more lies.
-We wanted to scare you and make you go. -What?
-What?
-By the way.
Where's the other boy?
-I don't know, he was here a moment ago. -I don't know, he was here a moment ago.
-Meaning Conan?
(Ayumi) Where did he go?
(Door, open)
(Ayumi) Eh?
(Maki) What are you looking for?
(Ayumi) What are you doing here?
Eh, Conan?
I knew it.
If I'm not mistaken, your husband has murdered you.
Isn't that right?
And you also planned this whole robbery thing to cover up the crime.
You're God.
The code name made me suspicious.
But what do you say, now?
The two thieves, although they don't seem to be believers,
said they had spoken to God.
We know from the words God sent us.
We know that in this mansion there is a good pile of gold bullion.
Of this, little brother... Are you sure, that you want to take the children?
Shouldn't we consult God?
But could it be that the God they were talking about
was the code name of the person who had planned the crime.
From this point of view, it made more sense that they were talking about God.
The thieves have received instructions
from a leader who calls himself "God".
"God" in Japanese is called "kami", which, rearranged..., is Maki.
That is, his first name.
It is an anagram.
It consists of changing the order of the letters of a word.
It is a common resource to obtain code names.
It's a bit of a stretch, this theory.
Yes.
The point is, the only one who could have killed your husband is you.
I don't understand what you're getting at.
There are no other suspects.
Your husband has hemorrhaged heavily and lost a lot of blood.
"From the looks of the body,
the killer must also have splattered heavily."
So much so, that he could only have washed the blood off his body
by taking a shower after the crime.
But the two robbers don't have a single blood splatter on their skin.
You said it yourself.
They must have showered for.... Oops.
Yes.
They just admitted that they haven't showered for several days.
And before that it was very clear
that they hadn't showered in this house either.
They have confused the bathroom with the toilet.
"This shows that they didn't even know where the bathtub was."
Therefore, there is only one person here who has taken a shower: you.
Du... showering is not a crime, as far as I know.
Blood splatter doesn't just stain the skin.
Your clothes must have gotten dirty, too.
It struck me earlier
that the dress was the only piece that was wet.
It's because you washed it right away, isn't it?
No matter how much you wash it, there will always be traces that the police...
Eh?
Stop it!

You are right.
It's true, my husband died.
He was an irresponsible man who was spending all the money he should have left as an inheritance
he should have left as an inheritance on ridiculous toys.
The thieves didn't know anything,
I just instructed them
to come at a certain time.
"I wanted to pin it on them
after I had told them where the fake ingots were."
While they were doing their job,
I just had to wait for the police to come by and make the rounds.
"That way, I would have looked like a poor victim of some thieves..."
...who had broken in and killed my husband.
No one would have guessed the truth.
But now, because of this annoying rain, the situation has changed.
Well, it doesn't matter.
You will be the next victim of the burglars who have broken in.
-Conan!
-Hey, Conan.
What?
Go, hurry!
-What are you doing?
-But listen...
It's all the same, Conan is in danger.
What are you doing?
I told you to go.
Anyway, I'll take care of you first.
"Think of something."
Come on, let's go.
Come on, let's go!
Get out of the way!

Where do you want to go?
I think you should know one thing: Ryuji couldn't swim.
-Mr. Mouri?
-It's about a murder... Ah!
It's that, in fact, there is another suspect.
