Records!
I will always be your partner!
A stone that disappears along with the last page of a book.
Where will the deductions we will make together lead us?
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is Detective Conan!

(Think) "Oysters!"
"It's been many years since I've had to comment on a book!"
(Mitsuhiko) Ep, Conan!
Do you put enough interest?
Eh...?
I guess... What?
What do you mean "I guess"?
The Haibara went home hours ago...
and both the Ayumi and Genta are reading the book thoroughly!
Let the Ayumi do it, though... but at Genta?
What do you say?
Here the only one who is not really applying himself is you, Conan.
In Genta he does it too, you see?
Hey! (Genta)
(Genta) How good it looks!
Genta, may I?
(thinks) "I've missed it."
(Genta) Very good!
I've decided on this one!
(Laughs)
Genta, wait a minute!
You know what it means to comment on a book?
Oops, this one is hopeless. (Ayumi) Eh?
(Ayumi) Eh?
What's wrong with you?
It's a little strange.
Conan, look at this... (Ayumi) You see it?
See it?
Shouldn't this be a joke?
Why should he want to start?
Then choose another book and you're done.
I don't want to!
I don't want to!
I want to read this book!
But, girl...
Conan... Will you look for the last page with me?
We have clues!
If we ask this child they might guess something.
"Do I have to go too?"
This can't be!
Spoiling a school book is unforgivable!
"This will bring a tail..."
THE PAGE THAT HAD DISAPPEARED
But what's wrong with it?
They look so good...
Let's see, I've been telling you what it's all about for a long time now!
Genta, listen to me!
The commentary of a book consists of...
AIII!
Oh, what a pain.
(Genta) Sir!
Wait a moment!
Genta, you've taken wrong?
That's nothing, what a rude guy!
He throws you to the ground and doesn't even apologize!
-We've never seen him before at the school.
(People: uproar)
What happened?
-Let's go see him! -Yes, let's see him.
What child could it be?
Shouldn't he be back home by now?
Excuse me, in Tsukasa Naito is here?
If you apply to him, he hasn't come to class today.
What?
Let's go.
We should also go by.
Since he was absent and didn't notify the school,
the young lady was very worried.
-Didn't the people at home tell you? -I don't know very well.
Since Tsukasa came to school in autumn...
Now I understand...
Although, for some reason, he didn't look very happy either.
Did something happen to him?
"It must have something to do with this book?"
-Oh, it's that book! Do you know it?
Yes, yes, in Tsukasa he showed it to me.
In Tsukasa?
Classes were already over,
but he was alone reading the book.
I was curious so I spoke up.
"I asked him what kind of story it was."
Look, the Àlec... Mmm, the Àlec is the protagonist of this book here.
"One day he lost a harmonica that was very important to him."
"So, he consulted a wise tortoise...
"And she told him that if he found the stone of the second chance,
"it would tell him how he could get back what he had lost."
"To find that stone,
"it was essential to have a good heart and to be brave,"
and the Àlec strove, and at last he found that stone.
"Then, when he threw the stone upwards,
"the harmonica he had lost fell

"From the sky to the place where he stood."
"When I said to Tsubasa, 'I wish there was a stone like this,' he smiled and replied that I was right,
he smiled and replied, agreeing with me.
Oh, let's go check it out.
Where do you want us to go?
Well, it's quite clear.
Tsukasa's house.
Excuse me!
Let me pass!
Is it a case?
Is it a case?
Co-how do you want it to be?
(Genta) Hey, did anything happen?
They stole a very important stone that was inside the classroom.
Hey, Mitsuhiko.
The gentleman from before...
Don't you understand?
It's very clear that he was the thief of the stone!
Yes?
You mean, you're sure?
That's why he ran away possessed!
Yes!
All right, all right, all right!
The Junior Detective League is on the move!
-Hey!
Genta! -Let's go!
Genta, wait a minute!
They've made us a map.
We can get there without suffering too much.
Yes.
Miss Kobayashi, what's happened?
Ah, Conan!
Look, a big one happened.
A fat one? Yes.
In fact...
"It so happens that we've been robbed of a unique sample
"of a gem that the Beika Museum of History had left to us
"for a period of one week."
It was a very valuable stone
and we had promised them that we would return it to them today, but...
Miss, may I have a look in the chemistry classroom?
I'm sure we still had it in yesterday's class.
"I think it's very daring."
"It's hard to say that this is the work of a professional."
"The stone of reincarnation. It's true! It's just like the one from before!"
Ayumi, can you let me look at that book?
What is it?
Yes.
It's got it!
Thank you, Ayumi.
"I'm sure there's a stone here too."
"The stone of second chance and the stone of reincarnation."
"I've got it."
"It's possible that the suspect who has stolen this gemstone
"has read this book."
"In Tsukasa is going back yesterday, this book."
"And the stone would have disappeared
"Enter after yesterday's class and after today's class."
Conan, what's wrong?
Very well.
Come on, Ayumi.
Shall we look for the stone thief?
We'll go to Tsukasa's house!
We've lost sight of him.
Too bad, if it was before us until a moment ago!
-Look! -What's the matter?
It's him, the stone thief!
Come on, Mitsuhiko!
Yes.
What's up?
Gee, we've lost sight of him again.
No, I'll bet he's gotten in somewhere around here.
It could be that they're inside this restaurant.
-(man) Come on! - (man) Hey!
May I know who you are?
Excuse me, please!
Do not kill us!
This means that the one who has taken the stone has been in Tsukasa?
If the person who has torn the page of the book has been him,
there is a good chance that this is so.
If so, this Tsukasa is a bad boy!
Don't worry, we don't know that yet.
It is here.
Excuse me, can we come in?
What are you doing here?
Mm?
Conan!
(Man) If you wish, you can eat too.
Sir...
Listen, sir, the teachers have called you from school...
and you know that in Tsukasa you didn't go to school, right?
Can't you think of where he might have gone?
(Mitsuhiko) You're not worried about anything in Tsukasa?
I am worried, but it doesn't take away my hunger.
It's true that we have come here by mistake.
and that in the end we were invited to this banquet...
But now that we know the circumstances, things are different.
Now I have to open my restaurant and I'm busy.
And your wife, who doesn't help you?
You don't have to do anything!
Sir, could you show us Tsukasa's room?
Maybe we can find out something.
Why should I do that?
Because we are worried about Tsukasa!
Tsukasa, what are you doing?
I'm not doing anything...
Come on, if you're a boy, why don't you play soccer with your friends?
But, I don't have any friends.
I don't have any.
So, you are...
Friends of yours, you understand?
"If my deduction is correct, after having read the book,
"In Tsukasa he would have found that stone in the laboratory
"And it would have been thought to be the second chance stone
"that appeared in the book."
"Then, this morning he would have gone to school,

"He would have stolen the stone and disappeared."
"But what is his motive?"
"What in Tsukasa is he trying to recover?"
(Ayumi) Conan...
Look..., it could be....
Tsukasa's mother?
She had lost her mother?
She looks so sweet...
I can't believe she died.
"It could be..."
How did it go?
You can tell his father doesn't know what beach this is.
Looks like it was some kind of secret place of his mother's.
Understood.
And Tsukasa is located on this beach?
Although we are not sure. (Genta) Come, Conan.
Have you found something? There's everything here...
Ayumi, take the book, please.
Yes.
Open it by the torn page.
Yes.
It fits!
There's no doubt about it,
the one who tore the page out of the book was Tsukasa.
He took the page and cut out the unwanted piece with scissors.
This means that we can think that in Tsukasa he also stole the stone.
Yes... You did very well, Genta!
The flap of the frame is open.
Let's open it, let's see.
What kind of note is it?
There's something written.
What does it say?
"The crab scissors carve, carve,
"Orange is a paper-stone, green caterpillar, paper-scissors."
Can you think of anything?
It looks like... it looks like some kind of coded message.
It sure does.
Genta, come and think with us, please!
This could be a clue.
The crab scissors carve, carve?
What's this?
Mitsuhiko, you got anything? Eh?
Genta, please continue.
Come on, keep doing this, bird.
Keep doing this?
The crab scissors carve, carve...
I know what the message means!
I know what the message means!
I know what the message means!
This beach was Tsukasa and his mother's secret place, right?
And then there's this coded message behind the photo.
"These signs give us a map."
"And what it does is tell us which direction we need to go."
"Exactly, Mitsuhiko."
I mean... that's what it is.
From it...
They got on a crab to go?
Yes!
Crabs are red, right?
This refers to the Tohti line train.
"Excellent."
To make the 2 scissors, 4 fingers are needed.
This means...
The stations...
The number of stations they had to pass, you see?
Very good! What are you going to do now?
We'll go very fast before it gets dark.
From the Beika train station to the Tohti line
there are 4 stations.
Hey, there are transfers at the fourth station in both directions.
As the next sentence talks about oranges.....
The train is orange!
Both the Sakayamachi line and the harbor line are orange.
When he says Kani san, Mr. crab, the "san" will mean something.
What is an important crab? It is number 3.
Lines 1 and 2 are express lines, right?
As for number 3...
It's about pujada.
Yes.
At the next stop we have to transfer to the harbor line
and then we have "stone";
so there are 5 stations.
The problem will come later.
Yes.
Yes, yes, understood.
I leave it to you.
(Tsukasa) "We are home!"
Father, we've had a great time!
We did.
Mother does some very funny things.
When the wave came towards us...
I tell you, they always come in through the back door!
Stop-forgive me... This is a gift.
I hope next time you can come with us.
(Mitsuhiko) Conan, we have a problem.
There is no transfer line to this station.
The stone is a zero, but I don't see any zero platform.
That's right...
What must the green caterpillar be referring to?
"A bus station!"
There is for a zero line bus!
And if the green caterpillar refers to a bus?
Yes!
Let's go, let's go!
Come on, let's go.
(Genta) Wait!
And the stone and the caterpillar?
Where are we going now?
Right this is our caterpillar?
(Genta) Of course!
I'll go ask!
Wait here.
Hey, Conan, are you sure we're going well?
If Tsukasa wasn't there after all...
Don't worry.
What did they tell you? There is no doubt!
If we continue with paper and scissors on that bus,
we'll get to Ohama Beach by the seventh stop!
It's all said and done.
I'm sure it's that beach in Tsukasa.
-Oh! You can see the sea!
Come on, it won't be long now.

The sea!
It is the sea!
Don't forget, we didn't come here to play!
We'll split up to look for it.
When you find it, tell the others right away!
Come on, we, too.
"Please, we must find it!"
In Tsukasa...
We've finally reached the last page.
Come on, let's go.
Tsukasa!
You're in Tsukasa Naito of 1st A, aren't you?
Who are you?
My name is Conan Edogawa.
I'm also from Teitan Elementary School.
And I'm Ayumi Yoshida.
-In fact, we... (Genta) The sea!
It's the sea!
Tsukasa!
So, you were here?
Since we're here, let's play!
Yes, that's right!
Tsukasa, play with us!
Au, come, let's play sumo!
Let's play sumo!
(Genta) Hakke YOI!
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's fight!
(Tsukasa) YOI!
Come on, come on!
(Laughs)
Aw, attack me!
Attack me!
Looks like Tsukasa is having a great time.
So it seems.
But, tell me, do you know why he was here?
The beach in the photograph was nailed
the one that appeared in the illustrations of the book.
Just because of that?
I was sure he had some motive for tearing out that page
and for stealing that stone.
And, therefore, I wondered what he would ask for back?
even though he knew he was committing a crime...
And that was... The mother?
Yes...
In Tsukasa he wanted to be left the power of the stone a moment
to get back the mother he lost.
But, well, it was all thanks to Mitsuhiko's deduction.
Oh!
Hey, what are you doing? (Man) Tsukasa!
(Man) Father!
-What about the restaurant? -Never mind, that.
How is it?
How did you know, that it was here?
I saw it on the towel.
Father, forgive me..., please.
I thought if I came here I could see the mother...
I'm sorry.
Tsukasa.
Wow!
Coming here has made me hungry!
Sir, torni'ns give us chicken yakitori!
(Mitsuhiko) And now!
Genta, that's enough!
(Father) Hey.
Take good care of my son ahead.
(Genta) Yes!
Of course we will!
Naito, did you find him?
Miss, I... I'm...
Thank you very much.
The teachers have been looking for it, too, but we couldn't find it.
Miss, I'm the one who stole the stone!
I'm glad you were honest with me.
But, know that you never have to do anything like that again.
I am very sorry!
Miss, please, look at my homework!
Oh.
If you've finished them early.
Is this a comment?
Doesn't it make a good face?
(Mitsuhiko) Genta, you haven't done well!
You should make a commentary on the novel!
This is an illustrated diary you've made!
(Ayumi) Typical of you...
"Coi, this one only has food, in his head?"
"They found the corpse of a famous musician in the river."
"Then, all of a sudden,
"A father and son appear
"To Mr. Kogoro's detective agency."
"The boy says he's seen the killer."
"He says he's seen the drawing of a nail in the killer's arm, but..."
And the next Conan:
"The Shadow of the Black Organization. The Little Witness."
