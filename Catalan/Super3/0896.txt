(Female) You say you're going to live abroad?
This means that you have finally set out to win important titles.
Yes, it does.
You know that recently won the first tournament.
I have decided to settle in the United States
and train seriously for 3 or 4 years.
I have everything ready, I have even found accommodation.
-Yes.
-Yes?
I'm moving at the end of next month.
So, I'll have to leave the apartment.
Can I have the copy of the key I gave you back?
Wow.
Now I understand why you made me come so early.
Since we hadn't seen each other for a while,
I thought you wanted to leave me and I was worried.
Oh, by the way, when are we leaving?
I'm telling you this because my passport is about to expire and I have to renew it.
and I will have to renew it.
In fact..., I haven't bought your... plane ticket.
-I've given a lot of thought...
-What?
And I've decided that I want to start from scratch
so that I can set myself completely new challenges.
So... I can't go on with you.
-100 million, you say?
-You owe me 100 million yen.
Yes, for damages.
But I'm sure you can pay me back.
You're loaded lately.
If you force me to pay you this compensation,
I won't be able to go on tour.
I don't need to remind you that my father is a lawyer, do I?
You'd better get ready, because he'll take absolutely everything from you.
No t'esveris, Kurumi.
Why don't you come over to my house for dinner tonight
and we'll talk quietly?
I can prepare something for you, as usual, and we'll discuss it over dinner.
As you wish,
but I'm working tonight, I'll only be able to stay until 9.
Then come earlier.
Is 7 o'clock okay?
I'll have everything ready so we can have dinner right away.
All right, but I warn you that dinner won't be enough to soften me up.
It's better than at dinnertime we'll continue talking.
By the way.
Since you've offered to cook, I want you to make me a frying pan.
Although I have a feeling
it won't be the last time you cook for me.
Yes.
I assure you it will be... your last dinner.
-No-no, nothing.
-What? -What?
Did you say something?
You're sure?
Well, I'll see you at 5:30 on 7.
Yes, I'll have everything ready.
"A new day begins with a splendid sun."
"It's time for love and mysteries."
"Miss Wakasa has just discovered
that her neighbor is going through a relationship crisis."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a kid, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The woman with the white hands (part one)."
Mr. General.
The tiger is afraid of me and now he won't come out.
Night after night, he leaves the screen and does all sorts of misdeeds.
If you want me to capture it at all costs, you must make it come out.
Then I, Ikkyu,
I assure you that you capture this beast for you.
Oooh!
- (exclamations of enthusiasm) -Extraordinari, Conan.
But you have even improved the script I wrote!
Really? really?
You looked like the real Ikkyu priest.
You're the best.
Oh, really?
Yeah, you've got a super-engineered look.
You mean "witty," don't you?
-Lleganyós?
-Enginyós.
-Enginyós?
What does that mean?
-People, you know, what does it mean.
I didn't know how it would turn out because you didn't come to the rehearsals,
but I reckon you've lived up to it.
(Shinichi voice) It turns out that I played the same role
when I was in third grade.
Is there anyone who wants to play the role of Ikkyu in the next play?
-Miss.
-Mm?

Are you sure you want to play the role of Ikkyu, Sonoko?
I don't, but this Ikkyu is as cocky as Shinichi,
that's why I think he should play it.
Aaaah!
Me?
Mm-hm.
Isn't it?
Do you agree, Ran?
The Ikkyu priest is as smart
as Sherlock Holmes.
Are you really going to play the role of Ikkyu in the next school play?
Yes...
Fantastic, Shinichi.
You're the main character.
Yes, I know.
Then I, Ikkyu, assure you that I'll reach...
That's too bad.
To play this character well, you have to believe it more.
Let me take this.
Attention.
First, you must stare straight ahead.
Then I, Ikkyu, assure you that I will catch up for you.
You got it.
Do it again.
Lla-then I, Ikkyu, will catch up for you.
Don't you find it would look much better
if we changed this "you" at the end to a "vos"?
It will sound more period-appropriate and give it a more solemn tone.
And I also think it would be better to change "alcanzaré" to "capturas".
-Good idea, king.
-What do you say?
Does it look good to you?
Nobody notices these little details.
It's just a play, it doesn't matter.
You're wrong!
What do you want with this attitude?
To embarrass the great actress Yukiko Fujimine?
What the...?
Anyway...
They tortured me by forcing me to rehearse all the time.
Now I understand.
That's why you didn't need to come to rehearsals, right?
I still remember the text perfectly.
Wow, boy!
This tiger is super well painted.
Yes, it's so realistic it's almost scary.
You painted it yourself, didn't you, Miss Wakasa?
Yes, I admit I like painting and I'm not bad at it.
Attention, boys and girls.
You know that tomorrow we are going to perform the play
and we still have to finish preparing the missing scenery.
Yes!
(Pupils: chattering)
Oh, my goodness!
The water to rinse the brushes is very dirty.
I'll bring you a bucket of clean water.
-You're welcome.
-Thank you very much.
Aaaah!
-Huh?
-Huh?
-Ah!
-Oh!
Oh, what a pain!
-Oh.
The screen!
- (students: squeal)
What a mess!
And now what are we going to do?
I'm going to repaint it right now.
The problem is that the photograph that I used as a model
I don't have it here, I took it home.
I don't know, maybe it's asking too much,
but could I paint the mural at his house and bring it tomorrow morning?
I have already thought about it, but...
I need to compare the tiger with Conan
because the size of the drawing is proportional to his body?
(Conan voice) Don't suffer.
If it's okay with you, I can come home.
Yes, I want to come too.
Then we can help you paint the mural.
Really?
If we all give her a hand, we'll finish sooner.
And we also really want to know what her house looks like, of course.
I really appreciate it, guys.
So, you're in charge of repainting the mural?
Yes.
And, when we're done, I'll take the children home.
(Mitsuhiko) Wow, Miss Wakasa!
I didn't know you lived in a skyscraper.
Yes.
It looks a lot like the Ayumi's building.
-You live in a high-rise building, too?
-Yes, I do.
(Door: doorbell)
Follow me.
(Doorbell: insistently)
(Doorbell: insistently)
(Doorbell: insistently) -Ah!
(Doorbell: insistently) - Eh?
What a pile of makeup, huh?
She was painted like a parrot.
Yes, and she looked angry with Miss Wakasa's neighbor.
What does her neighbor do for a living?
I don't know, but I understand he's a professional athlete.
We've only met a couple of times, I hardly know him.
Oh, dear.
(Ayumi) We're done!
(Genta) It's better than before.
(Mitsuhiko) It's huge and imposing, it's perfect.
(Ai) When the paint has dried, we'll glue it on cardboard.
Thank you very much, guys.
I couldn't have finished without you.
We are always willing to lend a hand.
No need to thank us.
But to make up for all the effort you've put in,
I'll make you an omelet filled with fried rice.
-People.
-Really?
"You just said you didn't need to thank us..."
-You're welcome, bon appetit.
-Thank you very much, Miss Wakasa. -Thank you very much.
-Boníssima!
-It's delicious.
Yes, it's the best I've ever tasted.

Oh, thank you.
By the way, have your parents already told you that he will be late?
(Music: loud volume)
Yes, I...

The neighbor has played the music very loud.
Yes, he has this habit.
Instead of setting an alarm clock, he wakes up with music.
That's fine with me, but he could turn it off right away.
It's strange, actually.
He doesn't usually sit up this long.
I'll have to go sing her a good night's sleep.
Hey, Genta, where are you going?
Conan, wait.
Oh, geez.
Hey, please turn off the music and get up!
He doesn't seem to be here.
Wow, it's open.

-Man, I'm sure it's at home then. -Wait a minute, Genta.
-Wait a minute, Genta.
Hey, there's a loudspeaker over there.

There's a loudspeaker over there.
Let's see, let's see how to turn it off, that.

Ah.
I'll unscrew it.
Phew.
What a break... Aaaaaaaaah!
What happened, Genta?
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Coi.
What's this shouting?
Mm?
Where did you guys come from?
-It's... it's a zombie. -It's a zombie.
-Who's a zombie? -Who's a zombie?
By the way, didn't they teach you to knock before coming in?
-There... there... -There... -Huh?
Ah!
But...!
Apparently...
May I know what happened?
She's been beaten to death.
She's dead.
What... he's been killed?
Miss Wakasa, could you call the police?
Yes.
By the way, a very strange woman knocked on the door earlier.
About that..., in case you didn't know, she has something on her right cheek.
Something?
What kind of thing?
Look at it.
Some red letters.
Oh... "I love you"?
Who did that?
Did you have it written to the dead woman?
No, and now!
It's not Kurumi's handwriting.
Is it?
Ah.
She did it.
She did it.
Look.
It's the woman who called, the one with the white hands.
She knocked me unconscious, Kurumi died and painted my cheek.
It's the truth.
You must believe me, inspector.
Please believe me.
This afternoon, a strange woman I didn't know at all...
rang the doorbell and I opened the door for her.
Then she pulled out a stun gun and knocked me unconscious.
I remember hearing screams
and, when I woke up, I saw these children,
who had broken into my house without me noticing.
They told me to look to my side
and when I turned around, I saw my girlfriend, Kurumi,
lying on the floor with a pool of blood under her head.
Understood.
By the way, can you explain the phrase written on her cheek?
This is also written by the mysterious woman.
You mean the same woman who attacked him with the taser?
This photograph I found on the floor proves it.
Someone left it next to me and I saw it when I woke up.
Look.
You can clearly see a woman's white hand writing on my cheek.
This morning I have invited my girlfriend Kurumi for dinner
at half past five at my house.
She must have entered confidently,
without suspecting that there was that other woman.
The stranger waited for her to come in and then killed her.
Hmm...
-The imaginary girlfriend.
-Huh?
I've seen it on TV and in magazines.
There are some men who put make-up on their hands and paint their nails,
and then they take pictures of themselves called
because everyone thinks they have a girlfriend.
Maybe that's how this picture was taken.
I... can you tell what you're talking about?
Look, look before you speak.
In the photo you can see that I have my right hand under my head.
It's impossible that he could have written anything on my cheek.
There is another explanation.
Maybe he asked the girl to write the phrase on his cheek
and then killed her.
Stop talking nonsense!
The other photo left to me proves the opposite.
You see?
The first one was taken before they painted my cheek.
and the other one, just after.
Therefore, Kurumi could not write.
Mm?
Yes, that's right.
By the way, inspectors.
I can wipe my cheek, right?
The truth is that it makes me very anxious...
Sure, but we'll have to wait...
for forensics to have photographed it.
Then hurry, please.
And now, if you remember, could you describe the woman...
who you say stunned you with a stun gun?
Yes, unfortunately, I didn't get much of a look at it,
because it all happened too fast.
But I remember she was wearing a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses.
A wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses?
And what else?

Well... it seems to me... that she was wearing too much make-up.
Ah.
(Ayumi) "It's the woman we saw knocking on the door of this floor
when we got out of the elevator."
Mm?
Is this true?
She was ringing the doorbell nonstop, over and over again.
When she saw that no one answered,
she punched the door and popped her tongue in anger.
Come to think of it, that woman?
she was wearing pink rubber bands on her wrists,
just like the one in the picture.
She was also quite tall.
Yeah, that's right.
That was her.
She must have been about the same height as you, more or less.
I don't remember that.
You don't know who this mystery woman might be?
No idea.
She recently won the first tournament and I was interviewed.
That's why I have many more admirers lately.
The first tournament, you say?
You must be... professional golfer Teo Banno.
Good timing.
So, I guess the victim...
must be that model they said was dating you...
Was she known?
Yes, that's Kurumi Iiyama.
Yes, her father is a lawyer...
and he wanted to promote her as a high society model.
Now I understand why he has so many trophies..,
because he's a professional golfer.
The cupboards underneath the cabinet are full of file cabinets.
-That's not to be touched!
-Huh?
Ah... Well...
These are the documents of the tours I've been on.
The other day I managed to clean them
and I would prefer not to remenéssiu them to me.
-I'm sorry.
-Yes, I'm sorry.
By the way, with what excuse had invited to dinner the victim,
Miss Iiyama, at your home?
The Kurumi and I often dined together.
It's normal, she was my girlfriend.
I didn't need any excuse.
-I wanted to leave her.
-Didn't you?
Didn't you?
-Didn't you?
-You did? -Huh?
Excuse me, miss.
I've been meaning to ask you for a while.
Can you tell us who you are?
Yes, I am the assistant teacher of these children's class.
My name is Rumi Wakasa.
And can you tell us what you are doing here, an assistant teacher?
Oh, so much.
I also live in this block of apartments.
In fact, I'm the next door neighbor.
These children have come to my house to help me paint a mural
for the play we are going to perform tomorrow at school.
Suddenly, we heard loud music coming from here,
from the apartment next door.
It usually lasts only a short time, but tonight no one was turning it off.
The children and I came here to see what was going on
and we noticed that the front door was open.
And when we came in, we found this scene.
I understand.
And how do you know, that he wanted to leave her?
This morning, when I left to go to school...
and I passed in front of there,
I heard them talking and it seemed to me that they were arguing.
Ah.
You felt they were arguing, huh?
And what were they talking about?
If I understood correctly, he didn't want...
the girl to accompany him on the international tour.
So she demanded compensation..,
and he proposed
to come to dinner tonight to talk calmly.
The girl asked him to prepare a frying pan for her
and he whispered: "This dinner...
will be your last... dinner".
What?
His last dinner, he said?
What?
Yes, but I might also have misunderstood.
Well, there's nothing prepared here in the kitchen.
When we came in, the apartment didn't smell of food,
and the fridge is empty.
It turns out that, just when I was about to go out to buy the ingredients,
the mystery woman called and stunned me.
And who gave you permission to snoop around the kitchen?
Yes, but when we saw the unknown woman ringing the doorbell,
you weren't at home, because she didn't open the door.
You could have taken advantage of the fact that she had gone out to the street to shop.
What I do when I go out on the street is my business.
Takagi, question the neighbors...
and ask them if they've seen this woman.
Yes.
Miss Wakasa, we'd appreciate it if you'd take the children home.
We'll let you know when we're done.
We'll let you know when we're done.
- (group) Yes.
-Come on, kids.
Shall we go home?
(Genta) What a rage!
If we had known,
we would have taken a picture of the girl who kept ringing the doorbell.

Man, his hands do come out in one of the photographs.
I think something is nothing.
(Ayumi) What?
(Ayumi) Hey, Conan.
Couldn't you take her out of the picture, the mystery woman?
How... how do you want me to do it, this?
You're the Ikkyu priest, aren't you?
Besides, I'm not the Ikkyu priest.
"And even he couldn't do it..."
(Ai) Wow.
Do you feel that smell?
What is it?
It reminds me of the smell of cosmetics stores.
It must be some lady's makeup product.
What's that?
Wow, but it comes from Genta's hand!
What's that?
Hey, I do not use makeup.
What t'empatolles, you?
Just as I suspected.
I already told you that I do not use makeup.
What?
The culprit?
Not you, I meant the culprit.
Conan, you mean you've already discovered the girl's killer?
-Explain it to us, Conan.
-Who is the mystery woman?
The person who murdered Miss Kurumi, the model, is...
professional golfer Teo Banno,
just as I imagined from the beginning.
What?

No one in this position
can write on your cheek in such legible handwriting.
The truth is that you are right.
The mystery woman is real.
Everyone has confirmed that she was wearing a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses.
I'm guessing that the white hand in this photograph
belongs to this woman.
I just hope they find her soon.
It's just that the kids say they've discovered something important.
