DETECTIVE CONAN
"Half a year ago, an assassin named Fox disappeared
after committing a murder."
"Mr. Ushio, a real estate branch manager,
hired him to end his life."
"With Kogoro Ran and I made a trek through Tanbara."
"The other mountaineers in our group were.
In Wataru Takanashi, company director."
"On Kenichi Hirai, from the university hiking club."
"On Shingo Nose, novelist."
"And the hikers Kyoko Saegusa
and Akira Kawabe."
"There was a very, very good chance that at Fox it was one of them,
because Mr.
Ushio had told him to murder her during the hike."
"And he had a murder."
"Who must it be, the murderer?"
"This question had me with a fly on my nose."
"And then he came back."
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
A terrifying journey, part two.
(Think) "Ran, we're coming! Wait!"
(Kogoro) What the hell could have happened?
Conan, Father, it's terrible!
It's terrible!
What's... happened?
Ra... Ran... were you all right?
We thought you were murdered, my child.
The one who was murdered is that girl, Kyoko Saegusa.
-How? -But that's...
(Ushio) No, I don't understand.
What does he gain by murdering her?
He died with the knife!
It's Fox's second murder.
Kyo... (Ushio) Kyoko!
Who killed Kyoko?!
Look at the knife.
She's been stabbed from the upper left side.
That means the killer is left-handed.
I knew it.
Why did he have to murder this woman?!
Ran, this girl was alone in the shelter?
Well... I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
Well you were here, you.
It's just that we've been told to split up to go looking for you, Father.
Yes.
Each of us went to look in a different direction.
No one knows where the others have gone.
None of us has an alibi.
(Thinking) "The left hand ?! I thought Mr. Nose was right-handed!"
What the fuck does this mean?
Who did this?
What do you want to achieve, doing these things?
All right, I'll tell you all about it!
I'll tell you everything!
Actually...
Fox is one of you!
And he is the murderer who has perpetrated these murders!
-But what does he say?!
-She's talking about that murderer?!
At Fox?!
Father! Detective, are you sure?
He's murdered two people.
I can't hide it any longer!
(Think) "This has all gone too far."
"But it's too early to determine who the murderer is."
But listen, detective...
Don't worry, the famous Kogoro Mouri has already unmasked it!
What did he say?!
Really, father?!
It's impressive!
He's worthy of the fame he has.
Tell us who this Fox, the assassin that people talk so much about.
Fox is left-handed!
According to the inclination of the knife, the murderer is also left-handed.
And among us there is a left-handed person!
But the only person in the group who was left-handed was in Hirai,
the boy who was killed yesterday.
You have extraordinary powers of observation, Mr. Nose.
Every writer does.
Curiosity and observant eyes are indispensable qualities.
Is hiding whether you are right- or left-handed also an indispensable quality?
What-what do you mean?
It's useless to hide it.
You, who were left-handed to begin with,
suddenly you use your right hand.
You are ambidextrous.
It's clear with the lighter!
(Thinking) "Yes, Mr. Nose is ambidextrous, but..."
The true identity of the killer who has committed these murders
and that of the well-known professional killer Fox,
is the novelist Shingo Nose!
He is convinced ?!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
You've blown me away, man!
That I'm Fox, the killer?
You'd be a better novelist than no detective.

You write novels about murderers!
They are the result of what you experience in first person!
Really this guy is on Fox, Mr. Detective?!
You bastard!
But what did he think!
He's choking me!
Wait, wait.
Don't be violent!
Be quiet!
I have a score to settle with this wretch!
A... help me!
"It's not going well."
"If you lose your temper, you'll kill her!"
"I have to stop her!"
"What's this? Strands of wool?"
Hey, Ran! What's that?
Say.
I wonder if that murderer died at Fox.
And you're coming at us with such nonsense!
You don't need to talk to him in such a rude tone!
What did you mean, Conan?
He must have stabbed her with his left hand from behind.
But maybe he stabbed her from the front.
But what the hell, kiddo?
You mean...?
Will you leave me for a moment?
Represent that you are her, okay?
He put the knife behind her and stabbed her.
The killer should be right-handed.
He's got no head or tail!
But if he stabbed her like that, he didn't attack her by surprise.
In other words, the killer was no stranger to the victim.
Look at this!
He's got strands of wool stuck to his fingernails.
Yes.
And watch the color.
There's only one person wearing a sweater of this color
and who could have stabbed her without her suspecting!
Oh, shit!
That man is not here!
In Kawabe?
That fucker was at Fox?!
(Think) "It wouldn't make sense, that he was."
"We know he's left-handed at Fox, while he's right-handed at Kawabe."
"So what did he want?"
"What the heck does it explain, this murder?"
Hey, look!
It's full of bundles of 10,000 yen bills!
They're stained with blood!
She didn't have much blood on her, it must be someone else's blood.
But this blood is also fresh.
Whose blood is it?
Mm... The enigma is getting complex.
It's a pretty good story to write something about.
Where have you been, Mr. Ushio? It was here, until now.
He's gone off the beaten track.
It seemed to me that he wanted to find Kawabe to throw himself on.
Wrong!
Mr. Ushio is the target at Fox!
The guard is also gone.
What if Kawabe has taken her hostage?
It is possible.
Besides, he knows the mountain very well.
You two stay here.
If you force her to show you a way, you won't go back the way we came.
You'll want to go back the long way around to a distant place.
Maybe you want to die, old man?
Walk!
Come on, let's go!
An... an earthquake?
Help me, please!
Somebody help me!
Fox!
That rock is about to fall!
A... help me!
Kogoro, the log! Yes!
All right!
Hurry up!
Climb up here!
Hurry, the rock will fall!
It's gone a hair's breadth! Saved.
And Mr. Ushio and save him? Speak up!
Where are they?!
The guard has given me a force and has fled.
You tell me the truth?!
It is enough for me, let it be the shelter.
Now this path has been cut off.
We'll look for it, but now we can only go back.
(Kogoro) Ha-ha-ha!
Bird in hand!
The great Kogoro Mouri is what there is not!
-What, Fox?! - You're mistaken.
I'm no murderer!
(Think) "It's Fox that the police couldn't catch?"
"I doubt it. In this case, he..."
And Mr. Ushio?
We have captured at Fox and can now safely leave.
Strange, the guard has also disappeared.
Where did they go?
Hey, where are they, the two of them?
Where are they, the two of them?
Speak up, you bastard!
No idea!
And I'm not at Fox!
It won't do you any good, doing comedy!
Come on, talk!
Kogoro!
Look what's in Mr. Kawabe's backpack!
There's a fortune!
Ah, blood, they're stained with blood!
It must be the same blood as Miss Saegusa's banknotes.
How about that, huh?
Mr. Mouri, listen to this, please.
(Radio) "Mr. Tanaka had been part of a gang,
so the perpetrators could be former colleagues of his."
"The suspects, a man and a woman,
forced the victim to open the safe
and took out 100 million yen in cash..."
Wow, now I see it.
If the suspects are a couple,

are Mr. Kawabe and Miss Saegusa.
(Think) "They killed a gang member."
"They were scared that someone would follow them."
So, the blood we were talking about...
Must be that of the robbery victim.
And you also killed Miss Saegusa, the accomplice.
Yes, I have killed Kyoko!
I thought you, a detective, had followed us!
It's your fault!
You blame me?!
They must have thought
that she was hired by the gang to come and capture them.
She panicked and he eliminated her.
-We're right, aren't we?
Speak up! Yes!
The knife that almost killed me was yours.
Yes, that's right.
We are lost!
We must turn ourselves in.
Don't talk nonsense!
I'll take that retriever.
No!
No more death, please.
If you do, I'll go to the police!
I'm sorry I lost my temper, Kyoko.
We ran away.
If I hadn't killed her, I would have put myself in danger!
We shouldn't have run away to this mountain drop!
About the murder of the college student, I have no idea!
Ep, wait a second, then, what was it, from Fox?
(Think) "This is the serious problem."
"I would be surprised if you do not take this opportunity to act."
"But yes... Wait a minute! The fax!"
This shelter must have a fax machine.
A fax machine?
Of course it does!
Yesterday, they sent one.
Surely there is a separate line from the public telephone!
And if it hasn't been affected by the lightning...
(At the same time)... we can call the police!
Does it work?
Shit, no, no, no, no!
In the end we'll have to go down the mountain.
"But... what is this?"
"They've cut the telephone cable!"
"We all thought the damage was caused by lightning...
but in fact someone did it intentionally!"
"But why?"
(Kogoro) What does this mean?!
Someone has cut the telephone wire.
Yes, grandfather?
(Kogoro) It's me.
I'm going back to spend the night there.
"I'll be right down!"
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
"Alpine Refuge. User registration."
"He'll give us the clue we need!"
"It's here!"
"And here too!"
According to this in Hirai came here very often!
Since he was from the hiking club, it's only natural.
(Think) "If this was the reason that they killed in Hirai..."
Some will go to look for Mr. Ushio and the others will notify the police.
I will stay and keep an eye on this guy.
You're not staying!
You're coming with me!
Even if you don't trust me...
Don't do this to me.
I hate it when the sun burns my skin!
In the mountains, it is natural that I end up getting a tan!
(Thinking) "Tan? Of course, that's what it was all about!
"That's what I didn't like!
"He is the guardian of this refuge, but that grandfather is not brown at all."
"That's not what he represents! That man is at Fox!"
That this guy is not the guard of the shelter?!
And how do you know?
If he were the guard, he would be a very dark man.
Well, it's also true.
That grandfather had very white skin.
-You mean that grandfather is in Fox?! -You mean that grandfather is in Fox?! - And that he killed in Hirai?
That's right.
In Hirai he knew the real guard of this shelter!
If I let him get here,
he would have exposed that in Fox he had supplanted the guard!
And he killed in Hirai.
While we were making the arrangements to go up,
he must have felt the call he made in the shelter.
Halfway across he killed him by throwing him down the ravine
and completed preparations by cutting the phone line.
Then he waited for his target to arrive.
It was better to disguise himself as a guard than as a mountaineer!
Shit!
He has made good use of his disguise!
(Think) "But we still have no idea where he stops."
(Shot)
A feature! At Fox?
(Gunshot)
It... wait Conan!
(Think) "In Fox is a professional killer!"
"Surely he has a safe route that will get him down in a hurry!"
"He'll take the fastest way down the mountain!"
"It's this one!"
"A wallet?"
"If this is..."
Why, if this is...
None of your business!
"Mr. Ushio's wallet."
"And this might be his daughter."
"Tagaki kindergarten!"
"I swear it's that one."
Damn Fox!

"So that's what it was all about!"
You were not to imagine
that the person who had asked you to kill would strike back.
What does it mean, this comedy ?!
The motive is the revenge of your daughter.
When he killed the president of the company Sarak,
the bus of a kindergarten was involved.
a little girl died.
Of a kindergarten?
You are talking about my daughter, Chisato!
You are going to murder her!
But Mr. Ushio didn't know him at Fox.
So he targeted his own life.
And he hired Kogoro Mouri.
That sniper too...
I asked a hunting partner to do it.
I wanted the detective to accept.
In fact, I was chasing that young man, in Kawabe.
But unexpectedly,
the grandfather I was holding hostage gave him a push and ran away.
It became crystal clear that it was that well-known murderer.
At last we see each other's faces!
Mor, Fox!
Stop!
This wound is less serious than a blow of air.
It's nothing compared to what the Chisato suffered!
You'll suffer like never before!
No!
Even if you kill him, it won't bring back the Chisato!
If you kill this guy, you will be a murderer like him!
Will this make the Chisato happy?
Chisato...
Chisato!
You don't know how to lose?!
So you were here?!
What do you say, fake guard?
You're on Fox, aren't you?
This man is on Fox, no doubt!
Stop it!
I'm the great Kogoro Mouri!
Eh?!
What the fuck is this?
Wow!
(Think) "Now it turns out that Fox is quite a young man."

"The real guard was locked in a cave."
"Soon after, the police arrived and arrested Fox and Kawabe,
guilty of that robbery."
"And also Mr. Ushio."
Marrec, you're no ordinary boy.
I'm Conan Edogawa, detective.
Now we've solved the case!
I'll have a beer and dinner!
Father, you'll never change.
(Think) "In fact, that man is not ordinary either."
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
A hell of a dinner!
What has appeared?!
Yes, I saw her!
It was the Snow Woman!
You've discovered the corpse of Miss Akiko
dressed as the Snow Woman?
(Kogoro voice) Don't take the body away!
The murder of the Snow Woman!
