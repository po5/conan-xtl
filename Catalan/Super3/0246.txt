Destiny is a clue to deductions.
It is a light that sheds light on mysterious cases.
It's summer, it's hot and we're going to the beach.
An incident will be waiting for us.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is detective Conan!
Something 's just not right!
Nani o motometeru no
uso ni narete yuku Kyou mo fake your eyes.
The start of century!
Tashika na mono nakute
Hitori ya nakenai yowasa hate myself.
Shinjiteru Itami hikikae ni

I think it 's only my destiny!

Oh, yeah!
You're going nowhere, It 's only destiny!
Ari no mama ni susunde ima

You're in my heart!
You're in my heart!

(Shinichi voice) aaaa.... What a bore...
We've come all the way to come to Izu,
but with a child's body I can't swim as well as I'd like.
"I can't wait to get my real body back."
(Girls: laugh)
Ouch!
Ah... Oh, watch out!
Boy, have you had a bad drink? (Conan voice) No, I'm fine.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
-Bye-bye. Be careful.
"Well, I guess I'll be able to wake up for a while, with this body."
(Mitsuhiko) Hey, Conan.
Conan!
Stay in the game, man.
Don't forget what you have to do.
(Mitsuhiko) Yeah, okay.
Let's start again.
Count to 30 without cheating, okay?
He-he-he-he-he-he-he...
I've seen you.
Oh! (Laughs)
Come on.
Which one do you like better?
Don't hide it.
You were looking at their bodies, weren't you?
Don't be an ass.
There's nothing special about them.
But the girl behind me in a blue-striped swimsuit
is another story.
(Ouch) Right...
Coincidentally, you've superimposed this girl's silhouette...
to that of a person you know,
and you've imagined her.
Hey, pretty girl.
Is that you, Conan?
But what are you doing here?
Ra-Ran!
What the fuck is he doing here, this gossipy kid?
I don't know.
"Come to think of it, the Ran said he was going with the Sonoko."
This is the beach Dr. Agasa told us about, isn't it?
Yes.
Something happens when we take this little boy.
That's why we didn't take her.
What's wrong with it?
Besides, the more of us there are, the more we'll laugh.
Isn't that right?
Yes.
THE MYSTERY entangling the NET, (PART ONE)
Hey!
You can't run away!
Got it!
Ouch!
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
What now?
Do you recognize that you have lost?
Damn it!
Next time I'll beat you!
You're a very strong girl.
It's not that I'm strong.
It's too childish.
What about the Ran?
What about Ran?
Have you seen her?
When you went to pick up the ball, she went to the beach bar.
With Conan and Haibara.
Haibara was tired, and Ran went with her.
But she said she would come back after she rested.
(Shinichi voice) Her body is hot, her skin is very dry, and she's not sweating at all.
And also her pupils are constricted and her face is flushed.
But his pulse is strong and fast.
It is clear, he has a heat stroke.
So, we have to take him to the hotel right away.
He'll be fine.
If we cool his head, neck and arms with a wet towel,
he'll recover soon.
Doctor!
I asked an employee at the beach bar to give me some water and ice.
Ah, thank you.
Hey, how are you feeling now?
Well, his body temperature is dropping.
I think you'll feel better.
Oh, that's great.
Next time tell me right away, when you're feeling bad.
Then I'll go back to the beach with the others.
Yes... That's just it.
I'm, I'm impressed.
Yes, she was the first to notice...
that Haibara wasn't feeling well at all.
Oh, you could have had better judgment.
That's what you get for standing there and not getting in the water.
If you feel tired,
you should stay with the doctor under the umbrella.
That's right.
I didn't want to feel like I was running away.
What do you mean, running away?
Huh? What do you mean, running away?
You mean running from sharks?
You donkey!
There are no sharks here!
No, not sharks.
But there are dolphins.
They are one of the most popular animals in the sea.
The evil sharks that have escaped
from the darkness and coldness of the deep,
have nothing to do against them.

Why are you talking this pile of nonsense?
Dolphins?
But aren't sharks stronger than dolphins?
Please, let me be and go, you're wearing me out.
(Man) Hey, you guys, what are you doing?!
If you bump into people while I have this bot,
someone will take it wrong.
This bot was abandoned in the middle of the beach,
and besides, the waves are not strong at all.
Stop it, Sonoko.
It's too bad for us.
We'll put it back where it was right now.
It's all right, it's fine.
Come on, Noboru, don't shout so much, will you?
Yuuta!
(Didn't you see the look on people's faces?
He just went ballistic because he got dumped by his girlfriend.
Don't be ridiculous.
It was me who left that chard.
We'll take it back.
But we took it, we'll take it back.
Don't worry,
keeping the beach clean is part of our job.
Easy, girl!
Gee, I'm impressed.
Beach watchers?
I thought you were fishermen.
But fishermen who don't know how to fish,
they have no choice but to stay ashore and pick up debris.
Handy fishermen?!
If we don't catch anything, it's because of them!
Stop it, Noboru.
Mr. Aramaki, just as we agreed,
we'll meet at the Tong-Poo of the Queens Hotel at 8:00 p.m.
Don't run away from us, okay?
Of course I will,
and I don't want you to run away from me like a bunch of chickens either.
Ran, I think it's the restaurant where we have reserved a table.
The Tong-Poo Chinese restaurant.
Gee, you guys came here too?
(Agasa) Yes, we stayed at this magnificent hotel.
-Why don't we have dinner together? -Would you like to sit at the table with us?
(Agasa) Hmm.
(Agasa) Eh?
Where is he, Ai?
-He's resting in his room.
He's not hungry, that's why he didn't come down.
Ah.
What, you don't tell me?
You're worrying hard for that brown-haired girl.
I just want to talk to her.
I haven't been able to talk to her yet.
And she's been dodging me with her eyes before.
I wonder why.
Maybe she hates me.
No.
This is not true.
Yes, because the Haibara said to Conan:
"Lucky you, eh? You'll have some easy parts."
Oh!
What?
Hey, what's up, Conan?!
What's the meaning of this?!
You've got it all wrong.
This is Haibara's thing.
But it's supposed to be a very nice fulfillment, isn't it?
What parts, the ones with the fruit jelly in them?
No.
We're talking about the parts of an equation that has ass in it.
No, we're not talking about asses, man.
Listen, kids, listen: and he said something about me?
Mmmmm...
He said... he said you had an underdone ass.
Ah..., wow.
Aren't you happy?
He meant you're light, didn't he?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
You're the group you were on the beach, aren't you?
It doesn't make you anything, tell me what time is it?
It's just that my watch stopped.
It's 12 minutes past 7.
Damn, I'm too early.
Well...
I think there's about to be a fight, so let's order.
We just want to show that poacher what the rules say.
The rules?
Yeah, we'll teach that jerk...
that the laws of nature should never be violated.
(Sonoko) So he takes everything he finds without leaving anything behind?
Yes, we try to limit our catch...
and we've even set up a fish farm, but...
We won't let you fish whenever you feel like it.
That's why tonight at the Aramaki we'll give him a good lesson.
We'll show him how long it takes for a sea that has been overfished
to recover its original appearance.
That you can't control it somehow?
It is completely impossible.
There are regulations and limits on fishing,
but they're just a dead letter here.
-Yuuta.
You're late.
-It's almost 8 o'clock.
Hey.
Where is he, in Nobutsugu?
He didn't come with you?
That's strange.
Earlier he mumbled that he wanted to tell you what he thinks of him.
He called me to tell me that he would be late
because he was going to visit his parents' grave.
Of course, today is the day our parents died.
Your parents?
Yes, our parents died 8 years ago.
Their boat was wrecked in a storm.
(laughs) I guess any fisherman would be happy to die at sea.

You really know, girl!
(Think) "All 3 are the same."
Sonoko, don't talk like that.
Eh, what?
If nothing happens... (laughs)
(thinks) "Come on."
It is true that even though the storm was imminent,
our parents ventured out to sea.
(Boy) It wasn't because of the storm.
The parents' boat was sunk by that man.
The Aramaki's pirate boat did it.
Hey, Nobutsugu.
You're still repeating yourself?
-Yes, boy.
You're always the same, you're a pain in the ass.
Where is he anyway, that pirate?
He should be here by now.
It's half past five and ten past nine.
He must have forgotten about us, and now he's sleeping it off.
-He won't play with me.
I'll wake him up. You won't get anything.
We called him earlier, but he didn't show up.
(Ringing tone)
- (pick up) -Hey?
-Hello? -Did he answer?
They have picked up, but no one has answered.
I just feel a strange noise.
A strange noise?
-That's it... -The sound of the waves.
- (they hang up) -Merda.
They've hung up.
By the way, this beach is a shortcut...
to go from the hotel to the Aramaki's house, right?
Yes, but at high tide no one would take the shortcut to the beach.
Don't tell me that one has had the rod to go out fishing
while we waited for her here!
I don't think so.
We'll go look for it when we're a little calmer.
(Yokomizo) I understand.
So this person--Mr. Aramaki--and you 3
had arranged to meet at the Tong-Poo Chinese restaurant at 8:00 p.m..
at 8 o'clock in the evening.
But he didn't show up at the agreed time.
and an hour and a half later, around 5:30 p.m., you came here and discovered his body,
they came here and discovered her drowned body,
caught in the net that dragged her to the edge.
Everything all right?
Uh, yes.
Hey, hey... You're getting too close to us.
-We're not telling you any lies.
Ah, excuse me.
Everyone knew you had a very tense relationship with Mr. Aramaki.
So I thought that one of you might have drowned him
and pretended to find the body afterwards.
-How dare you! - (Sonoko) Tell him the truth.
(Yokomizo) Oh!
Sonoko, Ran!
Inspector, today we were at the beach...
and we felt like we were left with the man who died.
Oi, Ran? Hmm.
And it's also true that you came to the Chinese restaurant.
You see?
I've already told you.
But they've come all 3 each on their own.
Oh, doctor Agasa!
This thin gentleman here came at 10 past 7 o'clock.
The chubby young man, at 8 o'clock.
And I think the dark man, at 20 to 9.
Hm... The children don't look much like you.
No, they're neighborhood kids...
Their parents asked me to take them on vacation for a few days.
You're not going to tell me that Conan and that precocious girl are here too.
Ah, it means the Ai?
She's at the hotel.
And in Conan, look, it's here.
Hey, you.
Hey, you.
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it! Stop it!
Don't touch anything!
This is a police matter.
Inspector Yokomizo, don't you think there's something wrong?
Mm? Look.
He's drowned, but his body is full of marks and his clothes are wrinkled.
And why is he caught in the net?
They tried to drown him by pinning his arms and legs with the net.
And the marks, they must have been made while he was struggling with the murderer and...
We'll take care of everything!
We don't need your help!
All right, send the body to the forensic team.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Hey, can we go?
We should get ready to go fishing tomorrow.
-No, you can't.
I still have to ask them something else.
-Do you still suspect us? -We've already told him.
We've been waiting for you all 3 at the restaurant.
Yes, but it's certainly more likely that he was murdered...
before the time they were supposed to meet.
And I can't understand why they came here to look for him.
For the call.
We waited for him until 2/4 and 10 of 9, but he didn't show up,
so we called him to tell him to come.
He hung up without saying anything, but we heard the sound of waves.
Waves?
Yes.
That's why we came here to look for him.
So that the beach is a shortcut to go to the hotel at home.
I also called him while I was waiting for the Tong-poo.
I called him again when he arrived in Yuuta.
I also called him once, before I arrived at the restaurant.

I did it because I wasn't sure you were coming.
Really?
Yes, the phone was ringing, but he didn't get on.
Why don't you check the call memory of his cell phone?
Inspector, we found a cell phone attached to the network.
-It seems to have fallen out of the robbery. -Allow me a moment.
Look, enjoy yourself, Inspector.
My should be behind the one in Yuuta.
According to the record,
Mr. Yoshikawa called at 2 past 7.
Mr. Shimojo called him 3 times:
7:47, 8 and 3 and 8 and 18.
And then Mr. Nezu called you at 8:40.
This shows that he has answered only one call, as he told me.
Therefore, the person who picked up the phone was either...
either Mr. Aramaki himself or the murderer.
But then... why didn't he answer your 2 calls?
How do you want us to know?
Now you know that we are not dead, don't you?
(Thinking) "This is true."
"If the person who has picked up the phone.
"It was either the Aramaki or the killer,
"There's no way either of them could have committed the murder."
"But I also think it is not at all likely
"That the murderer answered the call."
"And if Mr. Aramaki did it.
"To call for help while she was being attacked by the murderer.
"Why did he hang up the phone without saying a word?"
(Ayumi) Eh?
Look, guys.
(Ayumi) There!
It's the boat!
The boat where we were going this morning, right?
-Yes, yes that's it. Please call for help.
Retrieve the boat.
This boat must be related to this case.
Damn it.
This reminds me of the day our parents died.
It's true, their boat came back to this beach...
the same way this bot did.
Yes.
Without crew.
And with that huge hole in the ship, it sank as if nothing had happened.
-Anyway, they're already dead and won't be able to come back.
Let's forget about it now, Nobutsugu.
Hey, you guys, what are you doing?
Take bot here right now!
Yes, I agree.
Excuse me, why don't you stop giving orders and go help them?
Ah, well... it's my men's job, not mine.
Don't tell me you can't swim, Inspector...
How could they make you inspector, if you can't swim?
Your hair is shaped like coral, but you can't swim?
Coral?
In the boat there is a bottle of sake and a sandal.
The water inside is seawater, I think.
What's this?
What's this?
A button on the bottom of the boat?
If I remember correctly, the corpse was only...
Yeah, the body was only wearing one and... one button was missing from his shirt.
So, then, the killer could have gotten Mr. Aramaki drunk...
and put him in this bot.
And then, wrapped him with the net and threw him away because he drowned.
The marks on the body,
he probably got them while he was fighting the killer.
But it looks very unnatural to me.
If I were a murderer I would not leave evidence everywhere,
I would throw it into the sea.
Donkey.
Don't you know that you shouldn't throw garbage into the sea?
You will destroy the environment.
But didn't you feel it?
I said that if I were the murderer...
Hell, no, Conan.
Are you the killer?
No, I'm not.
Now I was thinking from the point of view of the murderer.
(Genta) The good one or the nasty one?
Doctor Agasa..., please keep an eye on these children.
-Hey, inspector.
Can we go now, inspector?
No, not yet.
Then wake up and determine the approximate time of death.
Without this information, we can't understand anything either.
We're working now.
What a nerve.
Everyone knows not to throw things into the sea.
(thinks) "An aluminum can? Eh?"
It seems unbelievable.
Ah!
Aaah!
A-are you okay?
Yeah, I just felt something prick my hand.
Be careful, there's a lot of shells here.
And they're very sharp.
(thinks) "Shells!"
Hey, hey, mister.
There were marks, the victim's cell phone?
(Thinking) "Eh?
Ah, well, yeah, it's very scratched up.
Look at that.
(thinks) "Mite'ls. Now I get it!"
"I know what happened."
"Now it doesn't seem at all likely to me
"That the killer would have looked for this coincidence!"
"He must have used some kind of set-up."
"What are they, his real intentions?"
Yes, sir, I've figured it out.

The set-up the killer used to drown that man.
What? What?
What?!
(Thinking) "Of course... that's what it was all about."
"That's why that person did something so strange."
"I have no doubt. I'm sure he's the murderer."
And the next Conan:
"The Mystery Tangled in the Web, (part two)."
("Always")

(Heart) Always give my life!
Always give my life to you!
Always give my life!
Always give my love to you!
(Girl) Son Jana?
