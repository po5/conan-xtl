"A grudge hidden behind a mask."
(Orchestra, from afar: classical music)

(Woman) A masquerade.
A masquerade is a type of play popular in early England
very popular in pre-Shakespeare England.

The play performed on stage
is entitled "The Triumph of Folly",
by the famous Elizabethan author John Benson.

It is impressive, this duel almost feels like the real thing.
To make it more realistic,
we used real stocks in rehearsals.
Eh?

-What's the matter?
They don't talk? -No, there is no dialogue.
-These plays are dumb. Look at that.

-Where did he go? -Where did he go? -He jumped over the railing and hid.
There's a platform.

And now, what does it represent?
The prince and the minister have both just died,
and the king fills the cup to celebrate.
In fact, the one who provoked the quarrel that led to their death...
was the king.

But the minister had poisoned the wine that the king had just drunk.

(Rumor of voices)
In this play there is blood and liver in abundance.
Yes, it is very gruesome.
And they also say that the play is cursed.
What do you mean, cursed?
Since it was first performed in the 17th century, the play has been cursed...
and it is said that there is always someone dead in the company...
How handsome!
The actor who played the prince looks like a real prince.
Yes, he's the star of the company, Robert Banno.
Oh!
It's Hiroshi Komazuka! How do you know him, Father?
He's famous.
When I was in college, I loved his movies.
The minister is Atsushi Yabuki.
When you have to jump over the railing,
can you raise the platform lift a little higher?
The thing is, very strange things happened during the rehearsals.
That's why we called you, Mr. Mouri.
Leave it to me.
The next show will be like a boat ride... No, a cruise.
It's a piece of cake.
I don't think it's a very complicated case.
Mm?
Where's this kid got to? Huh?
Conan, where are you?
This is too big, maybe he's lost.
I'm going to look for him.
This kid is always up to his tricks.
If I trade the prop stock for the real thing, get ready, Robert.
Kyoko.
I don't know where you are, right now, but I hope you watch the news tomorrow.
Because they'll be breaking the news of the death
Of the man who seduced you and abandoned you.
Robert, tomorrow, on the stage,
the sword of justice will pierce your evil and treacherous heart.
Eh?
Oh!
Who... who are you? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Hey, how's it going?
Good bye! Wait, wait, wait!
You've come with Detective Mouri? Who, me?
I didn't feel anything.
I'm sure you've heard everything.
And, for this reason, I can't let you go.
At least, until the next show is over.
I'll keep you here until it's time.
Fuck!
Alcohol makes my hands shake!
Please, please, please, please.
Ah.
What's the matter?
Have you seen a boy about this tall?
No, I haven't.
Ah, you understand.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
- (footsteps: move away) -Uf.
That's it.

(Male) Here we go again... The real stock has disappeared.
It's gone?
This means that...
It's very dangerous!
I'm going to tell the others.
No, wait a minute...
Instead of electrocuting the rig,
he could kill with the stock.
I'll say that I didn't know it was the real stock, and that it was an accident.
Now I have to convince
why we switched roles before the show.
I know, it will be very easy.
All right, I'll talk to him.
What?
That he can't pay me what you owe me and you give me your part?
That's too bad.
It's impossible for me to raise the money.
And I'm offering my part.
Don't talk nonsense.
The show is about to start.
(Thinking) "Wait a minute... The play has no dialogue."
"Good thinking, it's a chance for me to show off."
Yes.
Understood.
Yes, I'll take your part.
All right, well, you can tell the director.
And why don't we make it a surprise, all the way to the end?
It'll make our performance that much more interesting.
Yeah, I guess...
"(Applause)"
-Let's do this, doncs. I'll leave this here.
Let's see how it goes, the show.
I hope nothing strange happens.
(Thinking) "I've got to get the wires out."
"No, if I fall to the side, nothing will happen to me."
Conan, where have you been?
This poison could kill an elephant.
Poor old man, there's nothing to be done.
-A gift from my fans? -Yes.
I don't drink alcohol anymore.
Well, a little won't do me any harm.
- (door: knock) -Huh?
(Woman) Mr. Komazuka.
Is everything all right?
-Yes, thank you. I wanted to ask you a favor.
Robert and Yabuki had never been the protagonists of a play before.
Mr. Komazuka, I'd be very grateful if you could give them a hand.
-Of course.
Don't kick me. Thank you.
And you don't do anything to embarrass me,
like you did during rehearsals.
-I promise I'll concentrate. -Yes, it's all promises now.
But, as an actor, you have no talent.
I don't understand how they let a dullard like you on stage.
Take the bottle.
I told you I've given up alcohol.
Oh... As you wish.
Grumpy old man... You only know how to grumble.
If it weren't for you, I'm sure I would have made it.
And they would have given me the leading role much earlier.
Let's see when you'll realize that the public is already tired of you.
But... after this show, I'll be the lead.
-Relax, it'll be all right. -Yes, I suppose it will.
Where is he in Conan? I don't know.
I've looked for it everywhere and I can't find it.
But... Do you think something's happened to her?
No, I'm sure he's fine.
He can't stand still.
- (warning bell) - (applause)
(bell ringing)
The moment of revenge has arrived.
Soon the curtain will rise.
The masquerade of death is about to begin!

(Think) "You don't know yet that this will be your last performance."

-No novetat.-Here, all right.
Oh... Conan, please don't do this to me.

"How can such a bad actor play this part?"

"You said it yourself."
"Your dream is to spend the rest of your life on stage."
"And I'm merely fulfilling your wish."

We're already at the climax of the story.
It seems to me...
"...that this time everything will be fine."
"Mmm... Today, Yabuki seems to be really into his role."
"He concentrates more during the performance than in rehearsals."
"Better for me, he'll nail the stock harder."
"Whatever happens, they won't blame me. It will be an accident!"
"What do you think of the actors having switched roles?"
I think so.
Am I imagining things?
Don't worry, don't suffer.

"Begging for mercy won't do you any good."

(I scream)

What's the matter?
He called!
"I've done it! I've killed Robert!"

"I'm so sorry... It was an accident."

(thump)

What was it, this noise?

"He who makes it, pays for it."

"I wish it was real wine."
I'd better go take a look at the platform.
(Man: call)

(People: whispers)
What's the matter, Father? No!
It's out of the question!
Ran!
He's still alive.
Ran, call an ambulance!
It's too late.

The poison has reached his blood.
This is his punishment for his contempt.
But who has exchanged the prop stock... for the real thing?
- (Yabuki) I've exchanged them. Huh?
It's your punishment for making my daughter suffer, Robert.
Did you say "Robert"?
(Yabuki) Robert!
Speak to me!
Mr... Mr. Yabuki!
What happened here?
(Robert) When I found out that the stock was real,
I offered him my paper to pay off a debt.
Everything was going according to plan
until I slipped and fell into my own trap.
(Robert) Hurry, cut the electricity to the platform!
Yes!
What is this?
(Kogoro) What happened?
(Kogoro) Robert...
Do you think I'm going to die?
Such a small shock won't kill you.
Ran, call an ambulance.
(Kogoro) But... when did you swap them, the stocks?
Last time I checked, it was the props.
What's that?
This stock... is the fake one!
(Thinking) "Of course it's the fake one. I've swapped them back myself."
"And I've done more things."
"I've dampened the electric current and changed the liquid in the bottle."
"But I've also been very scared."
(thumps)
(Thinks) "Oysters..."
"When I have escaped from the sarcophagus,
I used the real stock to cut the rope."
"And then..."
(Komazuka) Here we go again.
The real stock has disappeared.
It is very dangerous!
I'm going to tell the others.
"This will spoil Mr. Komazuka's plan."
No, wait a minute...
Instead of electrocuting the platform,
he could kill with the stock.
I'll say that I didn't know it was the real stock, and that it's been an accident.
"Robert wants to kill someone too?"
"So, I put the prop stock back in its place."
"Then I ran to Mr. Yabuki's dressing room....
and I felt it."
This poison could kill an elephant.
Poor old man, there's nothing to be done.
"Stopping one killer is relatively easy,
but with 3, things get complicated."
"And even if I stop them, they'll try again."
"I know that!"
"I have to save, even if it's a criminal."
(Komazuka) Well, a little won't do me any harm.
(Woman's voice) Mr. Komazuka.
Is everything all right?
-Yes, thank you. I wanted to ask you a favor.
Robert and Yabuki had never starred in a play before.
Mr. Komazuka, I would be very grateful if you could give them a hand.

"Then I had to take care of the other two."

"One bottle cap was enough."

"First, I made Yabuki lose consciousness."
"And then it was Roberto's turn."

What is this?
Aaaaah!
"And finally, Mr. Komazuka."

"The evidence is there for all to see,
none of the 3 can deny what they've done."
"If they repent of their actions
and promise not to try it again, maybe..."
Let's see, Conan, may I know where you've been?
Ah... It's just that... I went to the toilet.
Aaaaah...!
I've been looking for you everywhere!
I... I had a good reason.
I beg your pardon and I beg your forgiveness.

Eh?
You want to perform in a masquerade?
You mean, father? I'm a very good actor.
I'll prove it to you.
Oi, oi!
Oi, oi!
Oi, oi, oi!
Oi, oi, oi, oi...
You mean this is a masquerade?
Oi, oi!
And why don't you ask your father, Mr. Mouri?
Sure, sure!
The mother is a lawyer and the father is a private detective.
If he's a stalker, there's a detective.
