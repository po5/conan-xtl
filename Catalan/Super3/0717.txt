(Shinichi voice) "In Kogoro, Ran and I....
"We've gone to a noh mask museum on the outskirts of town,
"Because the Mouri Detective Agency has received a letter
"Warning of the existence of a plot
to assassinate its director and owner."
"At the museum, which is closed that day,
"In addition to the owner, Mr. Jisaburo Izumi,
"there is Miss Hatsuho Toba, his private nurse;
"And three museum workers: Mr. Tatsuro Seikanji,
Mrs. Moyon Mibu and Mr. Seinosuke Nagata."
"There is also Mr. Naruya Akaza, who visits Mr. Izumi."
"While Mr. Izumi shows us around the property," he says,
"various dangerous situations take place
that could have cost us our lives."
"At lunchtime, Mr. Akaza dies of poisoning."
"The Ran and I, who suspect Mrs. Mibu,
we're going to the office to contact the police, but..."
If you don't mind, I have to call the police immediately.
A few minutes ago Ms. Mibu has already alerted them.
No, she didn't.
She just made it look like she was calling them.
Is that so?
Ran, run away!
And you don't move either, little girl.
(Door: lock the door)
It hasn't occurred to you that the three of us are accomplices, has it?
You'll stay here until we eliminate Mr. Izumi.
Mr. Nagata is also one of them!
(Shinichi, thinks) "F*ck!"
"Mr. Izumi is in danger!"
"To find the perfect solution,
we must decipher all the mysteries and codes."
"There are three accomplices with an evil plan!"
"We have to solve the mystery of premeditated murder!"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult, and he's Detective Conan!"

"Demons dance in the mansion of noh masks (part two)."
He-he-he-he!
And at that moment I fell asleep!
(Both of them) Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Both) -Huh?
What happened?
- (glass: catacrac)
Hey, little girl!
It's not possible.
Hey? (door: open with key)
- (door: open with key)
-Have they escaped?
Iaaah!
Coi de nanos!
AAAA!
Uh!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Blow...!"
Mr. Mouri, this woman is the daughter of Kodo,
the author of the masks.
But she changed her surname to Mibu
after her mother divorced her.
-It's all right if I tell her.
-Jisaburo!
It's no secret either.
When I was well in Kodo, I used to make masks in that corner.
You used to play often too, didn't you?
She was furious when she found out that the Akaza was selling her late father's works
her late father's works at a very low price.
Wow!
That means she had a good reason to kill him.
Please don't pay too much attention to him, Mr. Famous Detective.
If you'll excuse me, I'll go make some more tea.
Ah, thank you very much!
Boy, the inspector sure is late, isn't he?
He should be here by now.
If you don't mind, I'll go to the entrance to see if they've arrived yet.
She's a very diligent girl.
I don't know what I would do without her.
Bah!
I haven't put enough weight on it.
Mm?
Ah, it's you.
It's a pity, it's been a pity, it's been too little.
What the...?
Ah... ah!
Aaaah!
Aaaah...!
Ah... aaah!
Iah!
(Conan voice) It's... the mask... of a vengeful spirit!
(Conan voice) Oh!
But why...?
It's Mr. Nagata.
- (both) Hey!
- (Kogoro) Fire!
We came in through the side window!
Geez, it won't open!
I'm sure they've set the cam.
It's a kind of small wooden latch.
The cam?
Mm!
Mmm...!
How I curse these kids!
-Don't worry, it's fine.
-Mr. Izumi!
Mm?
Father!
Open this little door!
Father!

(Door: call)
-Okay.
-I'm coming!
You take him out!
I'll open it now!
I'm coming.
What about Mr. Izumi?
And Mr. Izumi?
Miss Toba has taken him outside.
And Mrs. Mibu?
She went to the kitchen to get us a cup of tea.
What?!
A fire?
Gee, how is that possible?!
We have to get out of here!
Well, we're going out the way we came in!
Oh!
What's the matter?
I can't open it!
We can't get out!
Oh!
There's a door!
There's a door!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
You couldn't be more timely!
Come help me, please!
It'll take 20 minutes for the fire department to arrive.
Ah... AAAAH!
This is...
I'm already saved.
Aaa... oh!
The theater stage noh.
We're out, we're out!
Aaaah!
Oh...!
Ay, ay, ay, ay!
Father, look... up there!
The fire has already reached here.
The mask of a she-devil.
Yes, it's that woman.
Hey, come here!
The important thing is how to get out of here.
Don't run away!
Can you feel me?!
There's a ladder!
If we head for it, we can get out through that window, right?
Close your eyes and everything will be fine.
That window up there?
Come on, father, you're doing great!
We have a problem.
We are far from the house next door!
What do we do now?
We can use the ladder as a bridge.
As a bridge?
Faster, father!
Very well, but don't be so hard on me...
(Both) One, two...
(Both) Great!
Now we cross the bridge and go in through the window!
Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes...
Don't open your eyes for anything in the world!
(Kogoro) Close your... (Kogoro) Ah...
A little more and you're done!
Blow, suddenly we're back to the present!
They were supposed to build this annex later.
Well, come on, let's go.
That woman was here.
So, there must be some way out.
(Phone)
Yes.
- (phone)
-An indoor phone?
Who's calling?
Hello?
Ah, Miss Toba, are you all right?
Yes, I'm in the kitchen with Mr. Izumi.
Luckily the fire hasn't reached here yet.
Be careful!
Be wary of the manager and also of Mrs. Mibu.
We have already notified the police!
Stay hidden in the kitchen.
(Phone: woman) "Aaaah!"
And they won't be long in coming...
-What's wrong?
What's the matter?
- "Sister, don't do it!"
(Phone: end of call)
"Sister"...
"Sister"?
You mean Mrs. Mibu and Miss Toba are sisters?
Be that as it may, we must hurry, Mr. Izumi is in danger!
There's someone lying on the floor!
No, it can't be!
(Shinichi, think) "Third victim."
It's the manager.
In the kitchen.
(Shinichi, thinks) Let's go!
Where are the others?
(Shinichi, thinks)
(Shinichi, thinks) "Gee, we're late!"
Miss Toba!
(Police: siren)
(Police: siren) Easy.
Are you all right, you?
(Miss Toba: cries)
I knew what my sister and her accomplices were up to.
I was forced to kill her.
I stabbed my own sister, I am a horrible person!
Horrible!
I had no choice.
The fact is that she could have killed you too.
Don't think anymore.
(Shinichi, think) "Mr. Izumi, even though we had warned her..."
"Eh? What's there?"
"A skewer and something that floats."
"What's this?"
Inspector Megure!
We've counted four dead.
Mr. Naruya Akaza, Mr. Tatsuro Seikanji,
Mr. Seinosuke Nagata and Mrs. Moyon Mibu.
Mr. Izumi is seriously injured, but he's still alive.
(Shinichi, thinks) "How nice!"
Unfortunately we haven't been able to talk to him yet because of his condition.
But since the stab wound corresponds to the shape of the gouge
that Mrs. Mibu had in her hand,
we think it is quite evident that it was she herself who attacked him.
(Conan voice) A gouge?
Understood.
(Phone: woman) "Sister, don't do it!"
(Shinichi, thinks) "Sure! I've got it!"
(Mrs. Toba) I couldn't stop her.
My sister was angry with Mr. Izumi
because through Mr. Akaza
our father's work was coming abroad at a low price.
And what was your opinion of the whole thing?

My sister and I are daughters of different mothers
and we didn't have much of a relationship for a long time.
Besides, Mr. Izumi has always treated me well.
And when he knew there was a plan to assassinate him,
he wanted to prevent it.
Yes.
That's why I sent Mr. Mouri that anonymous letter.
But in the end I couldn't stop her.
So, she has killed the manager and the administrator of the museum?
I think so.
Because she often said that if the other two died,
all the money would go to her alone.
Inspector...
Okay, then.
I've unintentionally stabbed my sister, though.
Ah.
Then you took the skewer from the kitchen, didn't you?
I was just trying to protect Mr. Izumi.
Please.
Well, it's true that you killed Mrs. Mibu,
but in your case, I suppose you could...
considered to have attacked her legitimately in self-defense.
But you'll explain all this to me in more detail at the police station.
Hey, Mouri!
Come with us!
Thank you. Thank you.
Okay, okay, okay.
Eh?
Aaah...
Wait a minute!
Uh...
Aaah...!
But this case...
...we've already solved it!
(Kogoro voice) Quite the contrary, inspector.
In fact, right now you have the murderer before your very eyes.
What on earth are you talking about, Mouri?
Father, Miss Toba is a victim of everything!
(Kogoro voice) At first I have not been able to understand
how Mr. Akaza had died.
How did he poison the cheese that the victim ate?
Miss Toba had tasted the cheese,
and Mr. Akaza, who tasted it right after, died of poison.
Could it be that the poison was the butter knife that Mr. Akaza had used?
Mr. Akaza had used?
But everyone could choose where they wanted to sit,
so it was impossible to foresee it and hit the victim.
There was only one way to do it:
With the spoon Miss Toba had used.
If there was only poison on the outside of the spoon,
the cheese that was taken with the first spoonful
would not be poisoned,
but everything else would be.
When Mr. Akaza died,
someone replaced the spoon on the floor with a clean spoon
without anyone noticing.
Because if the murderer had left it there,
the trick would have been discovered.
And therefore, the only person who could have done it...
was you, Miss Toba,
when you cleaned the cheese off Mr. Izumi's skirt.
The truth is that he sent me the letter telling me about the plan
because he wanted me to act as a witness for him.
To testify that all three suspects in the plot had died
and you had survived by killing your sister in self-defense.
While keeping me cornered by fire, he eliminated the three accomplices.
And since you could not allow me to burn to death,
he looked out the window to see if I was alive.
The one wearing the she-devil mask was not Mrs. Mibu!
No.
And the high point of her performance...
was the scream through the phone inside.
At that time she had already stabbed Mr. Izumi
and had killed his older sister.
But he said, "Sister, don't do it!"
-I couldn't do something like that!
-She pretended, because she was alone.
My sister... stabbed Mr. Izumi with the gouge!
It's obvious that I didn't have material time to go and look for....
a weapon in the workshop!
Of course you did.
It's true that he could have stabbed Mrs. Mibu.
And you could have convinced him to do it,
by telling him it was right to kill Mr. Izumi
with one of his father's tools.
But you took two skewers from the kitchen.
A skewer and a gouge are two very different tools!
You killed your sister with the skewers.
Moyon Mibu was a bad person, but did she trust her sister?
No, I don't think so.
I must have deduced that it was you who had sent me the letter,
and therefore she thought that she could not be trusted.
But to convince her otherwise, she stabbed Mr. Izumi.
And the moment Mrs. Mibu let her guard down,
you stabbed him with the spikes.
B-but that doesn't make much sense,
because Mr. Izumi's wound was made with a gouge, wasn't it?
Yes..., this was his last ruse.

But unfortunately he has not eliminated a crucial test.
He had to take care of a lot of things.
And unfortunately you haven't had time to get rid of all the evidence.
I'm coming!
Here you are!
Conan, take it here!
What are these?
They look like... two small pieces of wood.
Kogoro is absolutely convinced
that they are handmade by this lady.
They have an incision in the shape of a V,
as if made with an angled gouge.
A gouge?
Oh, I get it!
Yes, it looks like this lady has gone to the kitchen...
and picked up two skewers.
She's angled them so that they make an angle in the shape of a V,
and used those little pieces of wood to fix them.
Then she stabbed Mr. Izumi with this weapon she made.
Isn't that right, miss?
Well..., okay, uncle, you've found me out!
I surrender.
You win.
You're right, this is my special weapon.
I used the spikes like you said.
The first time, two, to make it look like a gouge,
and the second time I used only one of the skewers.
So you mean... you killed them in cold blood!
That's right!
Yes, it's me, the murderer.
But why did you have to kill your own sister?
Why shouldn't she?
That woman had been Mr. Izumi's mistress, you know?
She had a life full of comforts
while my mother and I had to live with many hardships and difficulties.
and hardship.
And suddenly she says she wants to avenge our father?
Come on, man, what else?
That wretch Akaza was coming valuable masks noh
by order of Mr. Izumi.
And on top of that he had the bar to do like Mr. Izumi and flirt with me.
It was disgusting!
This museum was built just to show off in front of people.
It would be better to burn it down and make a park, and the space would be better used.
Inspector!
What do you want to do now?
Oh!
I've already finished my speech.
Go ahead, detingui'm or do whatever suits you best.
Yes..., all right!
Mmm.
Hey, Takagi!
(Mobile)
(Mobile) -Huh?
-Hello?
Yes, understood.
Thank you very much.
They say Mr. Izumi has regained consciousness.
That is, he's not dead.
Is that so?
I thought it didn't seem to stick well.
When I stabbed her, the wheelchair fell into the fountain...
and I didn't give her the coup de grace.
I probably wasn't methodical enough.
Before I forget.
Mr. Izumi asked us to thank the boy for him.
What did he mean by that, eh, Conan?
Look, it's just that I had to help her out a little.
Hey, Mr. Izumi,
if you tied a braided rope that tightly around your body,
if something were to happen, it would surely protect you, right?
Yes, you're right.
This armor accessory would protect me
if someone were to attack me with a weapon.
(Shinichi, thinks) "I'm glad!"

Don't tell me it wasn't a very curious case, this one.
Those who planned to kill Mr. Izumi
have ended up murdered.
Mm?
Kogoro, what's wrong with him?
This case has left us a little unhinged, hasn't it?
To think that all those people were bad people...
Anyway, there's nothing we can do about it.
When it's a murder case,
someone like us can't just say "I'm sorry"
and mask the reality.
Mm?
The noh masks...
Not a good idea!
Ouch...
"No", "noh"!
Ha-ha-ha!
Good one, eh!
Ha-ha-ha!
Good one!
(Shinichi, thinks) "I thought he wanted to make a deep reflection,
and he comes out with this..."
Why should they throw them away, these chocolates?
(Shinichi, thinks) "Why did he have to say it?"
(Conan voice) Eh?
Conan...
Do you find it normal, that everyone is suspicious of the editor?
(Kogoro) "The lone victor who survives is the one who laughs best".

(Kogoro voice) As Mrs. Kaido would say.........,
a diabolical and ironic circuit was activated.
(Conan voice) "Don't miss the next episode:
"The diabolical circuit".
