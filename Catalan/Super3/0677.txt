"After a two-hour drive from Beika, we arrived at Ohama beach.
we arrived at Ohama beach."
"Suddenly, in Kogoro he told us he wanted to go surfing."
"As we thought there would be no way to get it out of his head,
Ran and I took us to go with him."
(Nagida) Tuck your leg in, grab the wetsuit tightly and pull it up hard.
(Snorts) It's too tight.
It's fine now.
If it wasn't tight, a lot of water would get in.
"The reason we're here today
is this very attractive girl who's with us now."
"She invited Kogoro to come."
Put more strength into it, come on!
Ah.
Ah.
Aaah!
(Nagida) In order not to lose the surfboard when we're at sea,
we carry it attached to the ankle with a leash.
The leash should be a little longer than the board,
about two meters for an adult
and about one and a half meters for a child.
No, it is not usual at all.
And there is no danger of it breaking?
But you can't tell what will happen
when one of these big, strong waves comes along and swallows you,
and it swallows you up.
Surfing has this adventure part that makes it exciting.
So, ready to surf the waves?
Oooh!
Ah.
Aaaaah!
Aaaaah!
"Summer memories are so vivid
that they impose on the passage of time and solve mysteries."
"A corpse lies on the smooth sand of the beach, and there is no footprint."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The beach with no footprints in the sand"
(Man) You are Mr. Mouri?
I'm very sorry, I had gone shopping...
and I couldn't go surfing with you.
I already knew that the famous detective Kogoro Mouri would come.
Nagisa told me.
I was expecting your arrival.
My name is Kaishiro Imaoka.
Yes.
Nice to meet you.
It was my first time surfing.
But I turned out pretty well.
You have to keep your balance on top of the board
and follow the movement of the wave with fluidity.
(Thinks) "Holy cow, what a ghost!"
I have the feeling of wasting time.
Friso to go surf more waves.
Mr. Imaoka, is this a tide calendar?
Mm?
Yeah, you got it right, kid.
According to this, there will be a spring tide tonight.
Yes, Ohama Beach is famous...
for the wide variations in its length
between high tide and low tide.
At high tide, at night,
"The sea is about 100 meters closer than it is at low tide,
it's an extraordinary phenomenon."
"When morning comes, the waves are retreating,
as if they were fleeing from the coast."
"And an immense beach appears, more than a kilometer long,
with sand that has become totally clean and smooth."
It's fun to get up early
and go make footprints in the sand on the beach.
Mm-hm.
It will be,
like when you find a snowy expanse that no one's ever walked on
and you're the first one through.
Don't chatter so much, father!
Xaaa!
All these trophies are yours, aren't they?
Yes, they are mine.
Nagisa was a very good surfer, in the amateur world.
God-hay-do.
How lucky she is, to have such a fantastic daughter.
Ah... Wow, what a commitment.
What a commitment.
The Nagisa is not my daughter.
Is she?
So it's a son who has changed sex, maybe?
No, she's my wife.
I got married 3 years ago.
She's his wife?
But they look like father and daughter!
Yeah, we've been together for 35 years!
Ha-ha-ha!
"Wow, what an iron!"
Come on, father.
We have time to go for another surfing session.
Cheer up, come on.
Right, Conan?
Yes.
Oh, no.
I've had enough.
I'm really tired.
It's his wife.
Well...
Then let's go, Nagisa?
Yes.
Come on, let's go.
-Huh? -Atura't?
-Atura't!

Coming here with the car, I felt the weather forecast,
and there's a low pressure front coming in.
Look at the waves!
Voices that are starting to have white tips?
Don't they say that surfing goes better
when there are big waves like this,
that it's a lot more fun then?
This is very relative.
There is also more danger.
Especially because you are beginners.
There are many people who have given up their lives, with these high waves.
The sea cannot be taken lightly.
You can't enjoy surfing,
if you are always as scared as you are!
Yes I will come with you, Ran.
Don't be so vain and conceited!
What are you going to do if the sea starts to get too rough
and the waves get too big?
You're irresponsible, Nagisa!
Oops... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for calling out like this.
-No, don't worry about it.
-I'm very sorry.
The low pressure front will be over by morning.
Wait until then.
Oh, my goodness!
This man has totally lost his adventurous spirit.
He's become an old man
who only finds fun in assembling his plastic miniatures.
He's a bore.
But I feel the call of the sea.
The waves say, "Come, cavalca'm, go ahead!"
Inside me the passion for surfing bubbles and this man won't stop me!
-Your guess...
-Do you understand?
"It doesn't seem like a very well-matched marriage."
If we can't go surfing because of the weather,
we might as well go back to the boarding house, right?
Ah... Yeah, okay.
(Kogoro) More to the left, to the left!
No, no, to the right!
Here, here!
Oh, how nice!
So, the Nagisa was a customer from the center of it?
Yes.
According to the owner of the boarding house,
she often came to this beach to conquer the waves.
Ah!
And, instead of conquering them,
3 years ago, he conquered her.
- (door: itchy)
-Ouch!
Ouch!
Eh?
Come in, please.
Excuse me.
Mr. Imaoka, what's wrong?
What's wrong?
Nagisa has disappeared?
Yes, I was in the kitchen and he must have left without telling me anything.
Because I looked for him around the house and he was nowhere to be found.
And it occurred to me that maybe he had come to see you at the pension.
No, he didn't come here.
Hey, hey!
What if he went to the sea?
Where is his surfboard?
It's in our country.
And he couldn't have taken a board from the store?
Yes, he could have.
When he sees high waves like today, he gets excited.
His eyes shine.
It's like a shark going after prey.
Listen.
There's a light shining in his breast pocket.
Can't it be a new cell phone message?
It's a message from Nagisa.
"I haven't told you anything.
Sorry, I went to karaoke.
Maybe I'll be late.
I've taken a load off my mind.
It's a good thing she didn't go surfing, eh?
To the karaoke sure she won't be swallowed up by any waves.
You can rest easy.
Yes.
But to leave like this, without telling me anything...
I don't know what he would think.
Didn't you see that I would worry?
These are things that happen when you have a very young woman.
I recognize that we have problems.
But he had not done it, that of leaving without telling me anything.
The bad weather is over.
And the sea has receded, it's low tide.
What a big and beautiful beach it has become, isn't it, Conan?
Yes, it is beautiful.
Is it?
Listen to this.
What's that down there?
A log that's been washed out to sea?
Isn't that someone in a wetsuit?
Is it?
No!
It can't be!
Oh!
It's... it's-it's-it's...
The Nagisa!
Oh, no!
It's too late.
She's dead.
"This is..."
Ran, call the police.
And you, Conan, call Mr. Imaoka.
And while you're at it, bring some cardboard,
so those who arrive won't make any more footprints.
I'll do that.
Couldn't resist the temptation to surf the big waves?
"It's probably a murder. Yes."
"But the only prints around the corpse
are ours."
"How did he do it, the murderer?"
(Imaoka, tearful) Nagisa... Nagisa...
Nagisa...
"Sand?"
"How come he has sand?"
(Imaoka: crying)
Nagisa...
-It's true.
She goes on TV a lot.
-Eh?
But it's in Kogoro Mouri.
-Good idea.
-He'll ask for your autograph later.

And what, Mr. Mouri, what do you think must have happened here?
Well, I am practically certain that we are facing an unfortunate accident.
Ah.
So it's an accidental death?
Yes.
The Nagisa, seeing the big waves that the storm had caused,
surely she couldn't be bothered to go surfing them.
Therefore, she lied to Mr. Imaoka,
with the message that he was going to karaoke.
He took one of the wetsuits from the store, along with an iron,
and headed out to sea to try surfing those big waves.
But one thing puzzled me.
Why didn't he wear his own wetsuit?
that he had hanging right here in his house?
That's true.
Probably because she thought that, since I was around here at home,
she risked me seeing her taking it.
And he knew that, if he saw her, he would try to stop her at all costs.
On the Nagisa... she was driven crazy by the big waves.
I'm sure it went the way you tell it.
While surfing,
a huge wave must have hit her and swallowed her up.
"And she had the bad luck
that the little rope went around his neck."
"Then the sea stretched the board, pulled him away from it..."
and caused the rope to tighten and strangle her.
But it is that the marks of the rope that has strangled it
is on the part of the neck that remains inside the neoprene.
And what do you mean by that?
The sea was very choppy and the rope could have gotten inside him.
But the neoprene wetsuits are well attached to the body
so that no water can get in, didn't you see?
You're a pain in the ass, kid.
Au, run away.
Don't bother anymore.
The sea swallowed the iron and made it disappear,
but Nagisa returned to this beach that she loved so much.
It was the place where she had met her husband.
God-hay-do, what a privileged mind, su.
Eh?
Her nails are half-painted.
Mm?
Mm!
Eh? (Laughs)
You're right. You're right.
How come he went to the ocean to half-paint his nails?
"Wait. Where did I see yellow marks?"
Mr. Imaoka!
We found the Nagisa!
It's on the beach.
Mr. Imaoka!
"The bags!"
"It's clear that it was a murder."
"And the culprit is..."
Eh?
What prints would he leave behind, someone weighing more than 100 kilograms?
Yes, for example, if there is a person weighing 60 kilos...
and a person weighing 50 kilos in the load..,
it would leave some very deep footprints, right?
Yes, obviously.
But the thing is that when we have arrived here on the beach
we didn't find any footprints
other than yours and your friends'.
They don't deserve it.
You're absolutely right.
Thank you.
"Of course! I'm sure he's to blame."
"But how could he carry the body on the beach...
without leaving any marks in the sand?"
"Gee."
"This crab is crushed."
"But how... did it happen?"
(Inaudible)
"Could this be it?!"
I found it!
"That's it! He did it like this!"
-Yes.
-The sea has embraced the Nagisa....
The waves have claimed it.
We could say it like this.
Ah!
Aaaaah...
Eh?
What have you got?
Father?
We could say it like that, but it wouldn't be true.
It's a murder disguised as an accident.
A... a murder?
(Kogoro voice) Yes, that's right.
Look at Nagisa's left toenails.
She's only painted a couple of them, right?
Isn't it very strange for her to go to the sea and half-paint her nails?
Yes, it is.
I have already thought that it is strange,
when Conan has mentioned this detail before.
Nagisa stayed half-painting her nails
because she had no other choice.
"The assassin approached her from behind
and strangled her with the rope of the iron."
Mr. Imaoka... killed Nagisa.
Mr. Mouri, how come you're coming up with this now?
Look at the rope marks on Nagisa's neck.
One part is under the neoprene, see?
That's because, to make it look like an accident,
after you strangled her with the rope,
you undressed her and put on the neoprene.
Hey, enough, stop the car, Mr. Mouri.
You have found yourself, haven't you?
You've seen that you have to use a lot of strength to put on the neoprene.
If the Nagisa was dead, as you claim, it would have been like rubber.

How could I have put the neoprene on it?
You will explain it to me, because I do not understand it.
How would I have done it to be able to put it on Nagisa once dead?
What do you think if we try it, then?
Sakata, you're a corpse, don't move.
-Let's go.
-No, sir. -No, sir.
Oh!
You were right.
The foot went through without having to use much force.
Well, now let's go for the other one.
The plastic bag covering the foot reduces the friction a lot.
Please look at the garbage can that Ran has taken.
There are traces of nail polish on the bags.
They should match Nagisa's painted toes.
Yes, there are only two stains on one.
That's how she put the neoprene on using the bags,
put her in his rubber dinghy and threw her into the water offshore.
And in the morning, the current carried the body to the beach.
-Wait a moment.
-It must have gone like this, right?
According to you, when I went out with the boat to get rid of the body?
Yesterday at dusk or in the middle of the night.
Impossible, the storm had arrived and the sea was very rough.
With a rubber dinghy I would have sunk for sure.
Then maybe it was in the morning,
when the squall had passed and the sea had calmed down.
Enough of this color, damn it!
A dinghy with the Nagisa in it would have weighed a lot.
Have you ever seen any marks on the sand where a boat was dragged?
Well...
The Nagisa was supposed to be out surfing
and with those gigantic waves, she must have drowned.
And this morning, the sea ended up spitting her on the beach, poor girl.
It is true that when we discovered Nagisa on the beach, there were no footprints or marks of any kind,
there were no footprints or marks of any kind.
And so it looked as if it had come from the sea.
But, Mr. Imaoka,
you took a look at the crawler crane on the rack
and came up with a way to commit this crime.
The crawler crane, you say?
Oh, this one?
I get it.
He reached out and hooked the body to the hook at the end,
swung it around in a pendulum motion.
and released it when it was further out to sea.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
The point is that the body flew through the air
and landed out to sea without leaving any mark on the sand.
Did I get it right, Mr. Mouri?
-Huh?
-No.
Mr. Imaoka, after killing Nagisa,
covered her in sand to hide her.
The karaoke message was written by him.
And then, this morning, he dug up the Nagisa,
and carried her to the detour carrying her on his back.
But-but, with the weight of two people,
it should have left footprints, and very deep ones, too.
He has used a trick
so as not to leave any kind of mark in the sand on the beach.
The crane, with its crawler, inspired him.
Mr. Imaoka, you've glued two pieces of cardboard together to make a caterpillar, haven't you?
Ah, now I understand!
He put the Nagisa on his back, climbed into the caterpillar...
and moved forward on the sand.
He left it near the water and surrounded himself.
Isn't that how it went?
Confess, Mr. Imaoka.
Yesterday at sunset,
when the three of you were leaving home,
the Nagisa told me something terrible!
I'm meeting him tomorrow at 11 o'clock
under the lonely pine tree behind the beach.
When I'm settled, I'll send you the divorce papers.
Isn't there a chance you'll think about it?
Don't you know that if you're neither young nor handsome
you have to make up for it with money?
Forget me.
I found out that Nagisa didn't love me,
that she had married me only for my money, for the money and quite a lot of it!
For the money!
(Cries)
