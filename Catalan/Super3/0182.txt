I feel so all in Secret Life!
The great investigation of the nine floors
(Ayumi) I don't know if we'll find anything interesting.
The world is full of unsolved cases.
And nothing happens to us.
It's so strange.
(Think) Nothing strange!
Just that, it's called normalcy.
(metallic noise)
What is this?
It's a ring!
How curious, where it must have fallen from?
There's nobody here...
It must have been thrown from a window here.
Come on, all the windows are closed.
Maybe it's a joke?
Throwing things is dangerous!
I don't get it.
It's very strange, this ring.
They are double hooks.
Another one has fallen here too.
Maybe this hook was attached to the other hook,
and when it fell, they separated.
-What?
Wait a minute! -What's come into your mind, Mitsuhiko?
(Thinking) Oh, Mother, what a danger.
Look, guys!
Can't remember a specific word?
-Mmmm... Essa o sa?! - That's right!
Someone who has thrown the ring and the hooks,
has entrusted us with a distress signal.
(Thinking) He-he-he... I knew you would say it...
The person asking for help is a woman.
This double hook is stained with lipstick.
It's true!
It's stained with lipstick!
(Thinking) Come on, enough, you're overthinking things.
Mitsuhiko, let me see the ring for a moment.
It's a wedding ring!
"From M for A"
21 of the 3rd of 1999. It's engraved on the ring!
It's a gift from someone with a name that begins with M
made to someone with a name that begins with A.
-The date is from the wedding. You really know your stuff, Ayumi!
My parents' wedding ring has the same date on it.
That woman must have been wearing this ring!
Her husband's initial is M and her husband's initial is A.
-Yes. -Let me for a moment.
It's a number 11 ring.
Women usually wear rings from 7 to 9. She must have big fingers.
(At the same time) Ooooh! Come on, guys.
It's obvious!
Whoever sent us this distress message...
is in this building!
And for some reason he can't move from one of the floors!
-Maybe she's had an accident, or... -Maybe she's being held hostage.
The windows are locked.
After she dropped the ring,
she closed the window because she was in danger
or because the kidnapper noticed it.
We must hurry and find out where she is being held.
Let's go!
Junior Detective League on the attack!
SIII!
(Adult voice) What's got into you?
Do you really think we have a case?
(adult voice) Who knows... But it's a good idea to pass the time.
(adult voice) What's going on?
The building has an automatic door and it doesn't open from the outside.
Behind it...
Oh!
Thank you very much!
We're in.
What do we do now?
We have to look at what floors have the windows in front of us
and check the initial of the names of the couples who live there.
How do we do that?
The concierge is not here.
When we were on the street, the wall of the building faced west.
We must find out which floors have west-facing rooms!
It's this way!
Oooooh!
Well, he gets off pretty well.
Now is not the time to freak out.
(Mitsuhiko) It's called Tsutomu Otake?
The initial of the name is Tsutomu, the T. It's not this floor.
Then we'll go upstairs.
We'll split up and look at the name plates.
Okay, Haibara and Ayumi, you'll check the odd-numbered ones.
We'll check the even-numbered floors.
Okay, so far.
(Genta) Goju Kaze?
That's a strange name.
It doesn't say Kaze, it says Arashi.
It reads Igarashi.
Aaaaaaaaaah...
Shima?
Just with the last name, we don't do anything.
Shinichiro Koyama.

The initial of the name is S.
It is not this floor.
Ya...
Hurray!
This family gives all the names!
Kosaku Horikoshi, Natsue, Yohei...
It's a pity, but they don't match.
Kosaku and Natsue start with k and N.
Too bad, now that we had found a whole one.
Akihiko Uehara, Misato.
A and M.
Hurray!
So this is it!
We are looking for the apartment of a husband with a name with M as initial
and a wife with an A initial.
That's right...
Ah!
Look at this one!
(Haibara) Michihiro Ishida!
His initial is M!
His wife's name doesn't come out.
-Possibly he's someone who lives alone. -Ah, right.
So far, we have 5 possible cases.
Of these, 4 have only the surname.
Listen!
The mailboxes may contain the full name!
Ah, that's right!
Come on, let's look at the photo!
Good idea, Ayumi!
You stay here, Genta, okay?
If we all go out, we won't be able to come back in.
Oh... what a drag.
Wow.
At 205 and 305, only the last name appears.
Ah!
Look at it!
The 808 and 905!
(Haibara) Yoshio and Eisuke.
Y and E. Neither one fits.
Now we're down to 3. 205 and 305.
Won't we find some way to find out the names?
Ah!
There is a way, you guys.
Ah!
Where are you going, Conan?
Ah!
Where are you going, guys?!
Guys, don't leave me here!
You guys!
I've found it!
Beika City, 4, 11, 10.
It's this building.
His name is Toru Igarashi.
It starts with T, so nothing.
I've got him.
Masakazu Shima!
His initial is M! Okay!
So, the apartments with possibilities are 305 on Masakazu Shima
and 705 at Michihiro Ishida.
But we have nothing else that can give us information.
What if we examine the bicycles?
Yes!
Very good idea, Mitsuhiko!
Ah, damn!
What are they doing?
Eeeeeei!
Ah!
It's closing!
What.
You've got the urge to put on, haven't you?
(Adult voice) I have entrusted the enthusiasm.
They are here!
The Shima's bicycles!
Look at them!
Asuka, the initial is A.
-Her husband's is M and hers is A! -We've finally found them!
But there is still the possibility of Mr. Michihiro Ishida.
If it's just a name, we can ask the neighbors.
(Doorbell)
Looks like they're not home.
Anem the neighbors downstairs.
Here, the A and M were backwards.
Yes, I was completely confused!
(Mitsuhiko) Ah... Hello!
What do you want?!
Ah, well we, we're doing a job for school and we wanted to...
What?!
You don't feel well!
We are studying Japanese names.
Do you know the first name of Mrs. Ishida from the apartment above you?
How do you want me to know the name of this neighbor?!
What a slime!
If we have no luck downstairs...
Let's go upstairs.
Mrs. Ishida's name?
I'd say it's Fumiko.
It's spelled with the character used for the word "text".
If her name is Fumiko... The initial is F.
Her son's name is Yuta and he's very smart.
Once he went into the closet and it was locked.
A closet?
Do you know if it faces west?
Yes!
What do you think he did, the boy?
He hung toilet paper out the window
and let a pedestrian know he was there.
Does everyone who lives in this building know this story?
I'm sure they do.
It's an anecdote told among the neighbors.
(Think) I did not expect it, there is a precedent!
Conan!
What's gotten into you, Conan?!
Let's go to the third floor!
The only ones who match are Masakazu Shima and Asuka from 305!
Why did you cheer up all of a sudden?!
Now you think it might be true.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa! What... what's wrong?
Hide session!
Geez, it's a robbery!
(Ayumi) Oh!
She's wearing gloves!
And sunglasses!
(Girl) You're always leaving jobs half done!
-Why did you kill her?! - (Ayumi) Shut up!
Mo... death?!
Looks like we've made it late.
What will we do now, Conan?
We'll call the police!
Hurry, we have to get out to the street before they get on the elevator!
Ouch!
What... what a fright!
Ah!
Mr. Policiaaaa!
Eh?
We warned them!
There's been a robbery and someone's been killed!
It's in this building!
If you don't hurry, the murderers will flee!
Hurry, please!
Wait!
Don't run away!
-What is it?
-What's the matter?

-It's these people! -They have murdered a lady!
Maybe they have a gun hidden!
-B-but what catches you? -What's the matter with you, children?
Quiet!
Please!
Don't move!
You guys get out!
Anyway, go to the 305th floor. You'll find Asuka Shima's body.
The body?
What the hell?!
There's no body on the floor!
It's a lie!
Earlier you asked him why he died!
Yes.
We heard it right!
Apa, you're so stupid, guys.
We were talking about an insect.
An insect?
This fool killed an insect and I got angry.
Besides, Asuka Shima, it's me.
(All) What?
Put your little eyes on this driver's license.
You're such a nuisance.
You saw that there was no corpse, right?
Besides, the neighborhood has assured us that they are the Shima couple.
Guys, excuse me, will you please check this couple?
(At the same time) Yes... We're very sorry.
It's all right.
It's our fault, too, for speaking in a confusing way.
But what is certain is that they have someone locked in the building.
Stop it!
Don't make fun of people again!
(At the same time) Okay...
Ah, I can't believe it, those two were a married couple.
I was convinced it was a robbery and a murder.
We don't have any more apartments that match "M for A".
Maybe these weren't their initials.
(Thinking) Something doesn't add up.
What is it?
Listen, couldn't the Fumiko Ishida in 705 also be read as Ayako?
Of course it could!
If her name is Ayako, the initial is A!
It's lucky we found her so cheap, the meat.
That's how Fumiko was read.
And she's safe and sound.
Yuta, come and don't you love it.
This boy is the one with the toilet paper!
Yuta, come in at once.
Wow.
What a thin mother.
My mother is fat, and she wears her father's shirts.
(Thinking) Fat mass?!
Ayumi, let me have the ring, please!
Yes.
You have it.
Conan!
Now what's wrong with him?!
Hey, Conan!
Conan!
What's the matter?
Open up!
What are you talking about?!
Conan!
He's gone...
You again?!
What do you want now?
Wait, wait, wait!
May I know what are you doing?
(Think) I knew it!
What puzzled me was that!
Child!
Get out of here immediately!
Madam, are you Mr. Akihiko Uehara's wife?
Is it?
Is your name Misato? Is it?
Yes, that's my name.
Then this must be yours, right?
I found it in front of the door.
This "A for M",
it's engraved with Mr. Akihiko and his initial.
Can you put it on?
Madam, please take a good look at this ring.
Actually, there is engraved with "M for A", isn't it?
"M for A", from the Misato for the Akihiko.
Yes, actually, this is Mr. Akihiko's ring.
It was the ring that Mrs. Misato was wearing.
That's why I had trouble finding it!
The neighbors told me that Misato had put on weight lately.
She must not have been able to wear her ring and was wearing her husband's ring.
Because many Japanese men,
even if they're married, don't usually wear a wedding ring.
Besides, Mr. Akihiko, being a man, has thin fingers.
What are you trying to say, little boy!
The one who feels.
And look at these shoes.
They are a size too small for you.
Wow!
You just wanted to tell me that?!
You're not Misato, you're an imposter!
Well...
Well... So, you know what I'll do, from you?
Little!
Not much.
You're Mrs. Misato Uehara?! Yes, and who are you?
I am?
I'm Conan Edogawa, and I'm a detective.

DETECTIVE CONAN
(Off) "The aggressor's name was Ikuyo Hasegawa.
"She was a former co-worker of Misato Uehara's husband.
"She was resentful of Akihiko,
"because he had discovered that she had appropriated money from the company.

and had had her dispatched.
"The Ikuyo went to the building to assassinate the Akihiko.
"When Misato received her,
"he gave her an anesthetic and locked her in the closet.
"After that, Misato, who regained consciousness,
threw the hooks and the ring out of the window to call for help.
"But after that, Ikuyo, who came in to check on her,
closed the window and put her back to sleep."
(Man) Caram, you have done a feat, boy!
We are very grateful to you.
Thank you.
You're welcome!
What a face you have!
You've taken all the credit, as always.
You're annoying me already!
You have.
As punishment, you'll carry them!
Ah!
Eh ?!
Eh!
Do I have to carry them all myself, guys?!
(At the same time) Sure you do!
Hold on!
Me too, pretty boy.
Come on, you too, Haibara?
Now I should send me, that one or that one!
Do you know what the hell it is, the chlorine thing?
It's a substance with a very high toxicity.
The 120 yen gloves are these!
If I were to prepare the mole bait...
League of Detectives, the search bike has been discovered!
Come to the discovery site!
That guy wants to give it to someone else?!
In the next chapter...
A dangerous recipe
The clue to the next Conan is... A dustpan!
In the next chapter, the League of Detectives gets better!
(All) -Every case is a surprise!
(Haibara) -One case down!
