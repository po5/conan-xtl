A watermelon, right?
(Genta) "And a sweet one, right?"
Yes, I remember.
Yes, understood.
Hey, Ran, I'm going to the doctor's house.
Let me get this straight: her name is Kaori Kitasaka.
And he's a former member of the Jonan University Deduction Club.
Another member of the Club has invited him to their wedding
today at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
The thing is, he doesn't know where the banquet is, for the groom,
to honor the Deductions Club,
has sent him an unaddressed invitation,
with a kind of hieroglyphic that he has to solve.
Is this correct?
Yes, and try as I might, I can't get it right.
I happened to pass by here and I thought...
that the famous detective Kogoro Mouri could surely help me.
Yes, you can count on him.
Leave it in my hands.
The great detective Kogoro Mouri doesn't resist any enigma,
and neither can this one, he needn't suffer.
"I wouldn't be so sure.
Let's see, can you show me this hieroglyphic?
Yes.
It is here.
Hm?
What's this?
"I can see it won't be so easy to solve."
Kage wo mau col no kodou ga seijaku no umi wo saite.
Kasanariau koe ga ima yami wo furiharatta.
"The light of reason can pierce through the shadows
and also the deepest darkness."
"The feast is at the Bell Tree tower. The celebration hides a conflict."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The coded invitation."
I don't know much, solving riddles, neither now nor when I was a member of the club.
In fact, I only have trace with those in which some character has to be drawn.
What are these?
For the sentence to make sense, you have to get some character out.
Ah.
So how is it that you became a member...
of this Jonan's Deduction Club?
-Yeah, I know.
-Well, as a matter of fact...
The four painted fingernails, from the little finger to the index finger,
represent trains.
Trains?
Are you sure?
Eh?
The train lines are represented by different colors.
The yellow nail is the Sobu line.
Said with the green nail is the Yamate line.
The blue nail is the Keihin-Tohoku line.
And the finger with the red nail is the Chuo line.
"If we put our hand on the map,
there is only one place where we can place each finger in its color."
"And the banquet will be where the thumb falls."
Unbelievable.
I would never have thought of that.
You mean it exists, this place?
Let's see, now we'll check it out...
Exactly, it's just what I was looking for.
This number on the drawing
represents the scale of the map that we must consult.
First I put my little finger on Akihabara, on the Sobu line.
Then I place the ring finger on the Yamate line
and the middle finger to the Keihin-Tohoku line,
between Akihabara and Kanda.
And finally, I put the index finger to the line between Ochanomizu and Kanda.
And then, the thumbnail points to.... Kanda-Ogawamachi.
Kanda-Ogawamachi?
Ah... Of course.
The drawing shows a river, and "Ogawa" means "stream".
Yes, but the fingers of the invitation are all straight.
And when you have put them on the map, you have shrunk them.
This is an unimportant detail.
"Yes, of course."
What do you say?
This place reminds you of something?
It does.
The university assembly hall is Kanda-Ogawamachi District 2.
That's right.
"Really?"
The reception will take place in this hall.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Father, you're a genius.
"I can't believe it."
Thank you so much.
Now I can go to the party.
-No, no.
-How much... -Do I owe you?
I can't collect, this mystery has been too easy to solve.
-I don't want you to pay me anything.
-Ah... But...
Ah... Thank you very much, then.

You've been very kind, really.
Oh.
(thump)
Really, you don't know how much I appreciate it.
If you ever need me, you know where I am.
Yes.
Goodbye very good.
(Door: closes)
Hm.
Listen, since it's a group work, we do something really big.
Guys, what do you say we make a huge forest...
and fill it with insects made of papier-mâché?
Or an aquarium full of fish swimming in it.
(Genta) Or we could make a whole airport.
So the deduction you made in Mouri doesn't convince you.
No.
Officially, the color of the Chuo train line is not red,
but scarlet.
And I have also tried to look for lines of the four colors,
red, blue, yellow and green,
but I haven't found any combination that matches the hieroglyph.
Yes, I've looked at that too.
And what about the subway?
The problem is that there is no yellow subway line.
A bridge?
Mm... Yeah, I get it.
I get the hand code.
Hurry up.
I must have found him and I have to tell him.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
-Conan.
-Where are you going?
It seems to me that you have solved the mystery.
This looks like it.
What do you say?
Isn't that Kanda-Ogawamachi?
No, Kogoro, will you look at this map?
The river that appeared in the drawing is the Sumida.
This river has 4 different colored bridges:
Kuramai bridge is yellow.
Umayo bridge is green.
Komagata bridge is blue.
And the Azuma bridge is red.
The colors of the painted fingernails indicated the four bridges of the river.
You're amazing, Conan.
Didn't he give you a copy of the hieroglyphic?
Did he?
Yes.
If we put the painted fingernails on the bridges of the corresponding colors,
then the thumb falls...
On the Bell Tree tower.
That's where the party will be?
But you told us
that the university has the assembly hall at Kanda-Ogawamachi.
I have confirmed it.
On my way here, I called the Bell Tree Tower.
I have been told that the Jonan University Deduction Club
has reserved a restaurant
for a wedding reception at 4:00 p.m. today.
Father, please, you have to call Kaori, you have to tell her right now.
You are right.
(Woman) "The number you have dialed does not exist."
"Please check if the number you have is correct."
Eh?
Strange, he says it doesn't exist.
Father, don't call him at home, call him on his cell phone.
He has just left, but he will be on the street.
Just a moment.
Yes, understood.
If it was his home phone, how can it be wrong?
I don't know, he must have made a mistake.
It doesn't make sense.
But it's his home phone.
People know it by heart.
Then he must have done it expressly.
In fact, it's very common.
There are a lot of people who don't want their family to know
that they've been to a private detective's office.
But Kaori just wanted to know where her friend's party will be held.
It doesn't make any sense that she would want to hide it from the family.
What are you telling me?
Stop giving me a hard time!
(Ringing tone)
-Hello, is this Kaori?
- (woman) "Hello?"
Hello, this is... Kogoro Mouri.
It turns out...
Ah, you understand.
I was worried, because I'm the Ogawamachi campus...
and I noticed that there's no party going on in the assembly hall.
Is it the Bell Tree tower?
Okay, thank you very much.
They don't deserve it.
Good bye.
Wow, that's great!
You'll be on time for the party.
"Here are a couple of things I don't understand."
"Kaori gave us the right cell phone number,
but the home number was a fake number."
"And she told us she just happened to be passing by.
"But when someone enters a detective agency,
they usually do it for a specific purpose."
Mr. Mouri, has Kaori told you anything about her family?
Yes.
She told me that she is single and still lives with the father and mother.
And while she was writing down her house number
did she make any strange movements?
No, she didn't do anything.
No, she didn't do anything.
What a tiresome little boy!
Ah, now I remember!
Now I remember!
When Kaori wrote down your cell phone number...
Hey, do you want me to write down my home number too?
(Kogoro) Yes, if you don't mind...
Ah... (Kogoro)

"It is possible that I just misspelled the last digit."
(Ringtone)
(Female) "Kitasaka residence, tell me?"
"Oysters."
"I got the number right on the first try and now I don't know what to say."
"Tell me?"
Hello, good morning, my name is Conan Edogawa.
"Conan Edogawa?"
(Sato) "Eh? Conan? Excuse me, may I?"
(Woman) "Sure."
Inspector Sato?
"Hello. This is Inspector Sato."
(Sato) I'm at the Kitasaka residence with Inspector Takagi.
"But how can it be!?"
Why did you call this number?
Inspector, what are you doing here?
What happened?
I'm passing the cell phone to Mr. Mouri.
Aaa... Well...
Has something happened at the Kitasaka's house?
Mr. Mouri...
"If you tell me, maybe I can help them."
Well... a gun has gone missing.
-That's right.
-What? -A gun?
A pistol?
It's a Nambu type 14 semi-automatic,
an old Imperial Army pistol.
Mr. Michio Kitasaka found the weapon
while sorting through his late father's belongings,
Nobuyoshi Kitasaka, who died last year.
According to the law, when someone finds a military weapon,
they must contact the authorities and turn it in.
But, from what I have been told,
M.
Kitasaka kept the gun and five bullets as a memento of his father.
"Right."
-Exactly.
- "And the gun is missing, right?"
"But there is no sign of theft in the house," he said,
"And the only person who could have taken it is the couple's daughter,
Kaori."
This morning, Kaori left the house.
Before leaving, she told her parents
that she was going to a college classmate's wedding.
In fact, she seemed... worried about something,
"As if she was sad or depressed."
Oh, yeah?
Kaori's parents told us that the boy who's getting married today
was dating both Kaori and her real promise at the same time,
but neither of them suspected it.
So, this means...
-And in the end, he left Kaori.
"Yes."
"When Mr. Kitasaka realized that the gun had disappeared,
he called the Kaori on her cell phone, but she didn't pick it up."
"And then they called us."
The problem we have now
is that we don't know where the wedding reception will be held.
I do know where it will be held.
-Do you?
-At the Bell Tree tower.
Are you sure, that the person who has taken this gun is Kaori?
When she came to the agency,
she was carrying some kind of fat wallet, wasn't she?
Right?
When she got up to leave...
(Knock)
That's right.
He was probably carrying the gun, in that satchel.
And did you notice the shoes she was wearing?
They caught my attention, because they had very low heels.
Eh... Yes.
I also thought they weren't the most suitable for a wedding.
She wore them for a specific reason.
So she won't lose her balance when she shoots.
That way he has a better chance of hitting the target.
Uh... So... Kaori...?
"She told us earlier that she's not good at solving riddles,
"So she became a member of the Deductions Club
because she had a crush on her college roommate."
"Oops. We won't make it in time."
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What do you do, Conan?
"I can try... to change her mind."
(Conversation fluttering)
Hm...

Oh...
Friends, first of all I would like to thank you...
for coming all this way to celebrate this very special occasion.
Did you have a hard time guessing the location of the party?
-In Yonekura it hasn't arrived yet.
-Why do you ask, this?
All right, we'll talk about it later, then.
Now I want to welcome the bride and groom!
(Applause)
Uooh!
Viva!
Viva the bride and groom!
And now the happiest groom in the world wants to say a few words.
Where is Kaori?
Maybe she hasn't arrived yet.
"If she's come all the way from Kanda-Ogawamachi,
it must have been a while ago."
Kaori.
Father, where are you going?
Kaori.
Oh.
Kaori!
What?
"Don't do it."
"Kaori, don't do it."
And how did you propose to her?
Man, I just... do you really want me to tell you...?
Ka... Kaori...
"Kaori."
Ah...
"Kaori."
Hurray!

Congratulations.
To you.
Ah... Thank you, Kaori.
Eh?
I'm so glad you didn't do it.
That little boy...
Mr. Mouri and the police inspectors are looking for you downstairs.
They saw another woman and mistook her for you.
Earlier, as I was coming towards the banqueting hall...
(Mobile)
Eh?
"It's kind of sad, you were worried."
At first I didn't understand it, this message.
But, if we remove the character "ke", and the character "y",
it changes the meaning and then it says: "It's better that you go away".
And at that moment,
all the feelings of hatred that I had inside me have vanished like fog.
Hm.
I sent him a message in which characters were to be deleted
because I knew you would be able to decipher it.
What?
You mean it wasn't Mr. Mouri?
You sent it to me?
Mm-hm.
Kaori!
Conan!
Tell me something.
You told us that you came into the detective agency by chance,
but I'm sure you went there expressly
because he wanted you to help him solve the riddle at all costs.
Am I right?
Yes.
I used the great detective Kogoro Mouri.
I beg your pardon.
Caram.
Don't worry, it's all right.
-Myself.
-Kaori Kitasaka?
Inspector Sato, Metropolitan Police.
I'm Inspector Takagi.
All right, then, you'll accompany us to the police station.
I'll be right there.
Marrec.
Your name is Conan, right?
Hm.
Conan Edogawa.
Soc detective.
Thank you very much, you are a great detective.

How strong!
The Sonoko has invited us all to visit the Bell Tree tower.
-Me, a lot.
-Aren't you looking forward to it?
-Yes, so we'll have a good view.
Let's make it a clear day.
"Oh... And I'll be along for the ride, as usual."
Near the Bell Tree tower there are a lot of very good restaurants, aren't there?
"So we couldn't have suspected that another shootout was waiting for us at the tower.
and that this time it would be real."
"And that we would have to face a sniper."
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I expected nothing less from you.
No one else was able to discover the great Kaito K's hideout.
