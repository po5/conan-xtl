Today my father has been invited to a party and he must be moving.
Ah, that's why you got the best pants...
and blazer out of the closet, right?
Yes, and the tie.
Oh...
Eh?
What's on your mind?
I was thinking that I'd like to give
a nice tie to Shinichi.
Why are you so red, Conan?
That you're hot?
Eh?
Yes, yes, very hot.
Where is your father, by the way?
He went to the barber.
In fact, he should be back by now.
Oops, so late!
I-I'll go get him.
"Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano."
"When we meet face to face, the mystery begins."
"How can there have been a crime in front of someone who hasn't seen anything?"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The witness who saw nothing."
Mi has a great time at the pool.
I'm on duty today;
the barbershops are full.
- (chimes) -Eh?
(Woman) And so much.
I always bring him a snack...
No!
(Woman) Wait!
(woman) Hey!
Do not close, yet!
(BELL RINGS)
Hello.
-I was already tancant. -Sorry, it's an emergency.
Hey, hey!
Oh!
I see you still have a customer, here, right?
Hey, if you make me first,
I promise you'll always have me as a customer.
I see you're in a hurry.
Since he's asleep, I'll do you first.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Oh!
Oh!
How hot!
Just a moment, please.
(Thinking) "Let's see what food they're giving the party today."
"Maybe there will be French cuisine."
"Or maybe there will be Chinese food: shark fins and lacquered duck. (laughs)"
- (music, from afar) - "Oh! What is it, this music?"
"Ten come the pool bus."
(music, very loud)
(music, very loud) - "My goodness! Now it really feels loud! Oh! This is already too much!"
"These people on the bus should be reported! How they go too far!"

"Let's see if they'll get busy and leave right away."
"Oh! Stop this noise! Stop this noise at once!"
- (bus: move away) - (music, from afar).
"Ugh! What a break!"
-And now what?
Oh! What happened?
Oh...
-Oh!
It's dead. E-Ebihara!
-Did you like it? -I'm hungry!
Mr. Mouri!
Mouri!
He was looking for you.
Why didn't he go to the usual barbershop?
Conan, have you seen anyone suspicious?
Suspicious?
No.
Why do you ask?
-Avisi the police right away. -Yes, now.
What's the matter, Conan?
Don't come in.
I don't want children here. Oh!
Oysters!
Where are you going?
Come on, I'll try it again.
Hey, Genta.
Oh! (Laughs)
Conan!
Did you see if anyone came out back there?
We've been here for a while and we haven't seen anyone.
Did something happen? Ah...
-Oh. -Yes, something happened.
Rediantre!
Someone has committed a murder right under my nose.
-What a nerve! -Why?
-May I know who you are? -I'm the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
-What?
Are you for real? -Of course I do, man!
He-he-he! Conan, you got another case?
Out.
You can't bring creatures in here.
You said it.
No, I didn't mean that.
And then, when I felt the brittle,
I got up and saw that the barber was lying on the floor.
I immediately saw that he was already dead, poor man.
It is very strange.
Anyway, his ears must have recorded...
all the details of what happened.
Yes.
What made him get up was the noise from when this was broken?
Yes, sir.
This statuette was on the counter.
It probably fell when Mr. Ebihara gave it a blow
when he also fell to the floor.
Of course.
(Thinking) "And how can it be that that dart is the only thing
that went so far?"

And now you, Mr. Noda.
Can you confirm me that when Mr. Mouri came in
was sleeping soundly in the armchair?
Yes.
I didn't hear anything.
I didn't even notice that Mr. Mouri entered the barbershop.
Can you tell me at what time he entered this establishment?
I didn't check the time.
I had been going around the streets looking for an open barbershop for some time.
All I can tell you is that the murder took place
a few minutes after I came in here.
The police emergency number received the call
that there was a dead man at 18:36.
So, we count that you came in here at about half past five o'clock 7.
And you, can you tell us what time you entered the barbershop?
It would be 06:20.
But today I didn't stop and I was so tired,
that I fell asleep as soon as I sat down on the couch.
And you, who were awake, are you sure?
that no one has entered or left the barbershop since you arrived?
"Yes, while I was lying there, I heard the music of the bus...
carrying the children from the swimming pool."
I don't think anyone could have entered or left without being seen.
I got there right away and didn't see anyone enter or leave either.
You didn't see any movement through the back door either?
No, we didn't see anyone there.
We had been playing in the back lot of the barbershop for a while.
Another possibility is that Mr. Ebihara's killer fired the dart from this street.
fired the dart from this street.
From outside?
When the bus returning the children from the swimming pool passed by,
the music was so loud, you couldn't feel anything.
"I'm sure the barber opened the window to protest."
And the murderer took the opportunity to shoot him with that dart, right?
That's right.
The murderer was probably hiding in the alley in front of here.
"From there to the window there are 4 meters."
"At this distance it's not difficult to hit a target with a dart."
Apparently, the tip of the dart was poisoned.
But I don't understand why he was wearing this wig, Mr. Ebihara.
It's true.
It has a lot of hair.
He didn't need it.
Why do you think he was wearing it? I don't know.
(Thinking) "What reason did he have to wear it?"
I also find it curious that Mr. Ebihara wore this sweater.
This jersey is the uniform of the Darts Hearts team,
which is based in a bar two corners from here.
So, the man played darts.
You did, too?
Yes.
A man playing darts in a bar is killed by a dart.
Perhaps the murderer was someone who also frequented this bar you say.
These two men used to play darts with him:
Mr. Nozomu Shimazaki, who works in a laundry,
and Mr. Tatsutaro Koike,
who works as a clerk in a drugstore at the other end of the neighborhood.
Just now we received a report
that says that yesterday you and Mr. Ebihara had an argument at the bar.
J-I didn't.
Of course we argued, because he said things that were not true.
What things did he say? W-well...
It all started when the Ebihara said
that in Nozomu he was stealing from his company.
"In Nozomu got angry and grabbed him by the shirt collar
and I got in the way to separate them."
What a face you have!
And you, didn't you go into a rage,
when he said that the pharmacy would go down the drain
because you were stealing medicines to sell them on your own?
-It's not true (coughs).
Do you still have a cough, Masao?
You're not wearing your mask?
I don't remember where I left it.
You didn't say anything, but the police should also know...
that the Ebihara had left you money, because maybe it has something to do with the case.
That's right.
He told us that he had left you money to get the business going.
Can you explain that to me?
It's true, he left me money, but I didn't tell you because it wasn't much.
Yes, sure!
Besides, you're the barbershop when Ebihara was murdered.
I'm sure you'll be considered a suspect.
Yes, Mr. Noda was in the barbershop at the time of the murder,
but he's been in the chair next to me the whole time.
-He can't be the assassin. And who are you to talk like that?
I am the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
-Eh? -You are Kogoro Sleeper?

Another question:
I would like to know where you were this afternoon, around 5:30 p.m. 7.
First you, Mr. Koike.
I-I was at the pharmacy.
Are there any witnesses who can corroborate?
No, no one.
"No customers came in tonight,
and at that time my wife was in the kitchen making dinner."
You have no witnesses?
No, I don't, but it wasn't me.
Please believe me.
And you, Mr. Shimazaki?
At half past five at seven o'clock I was still delivering clean clothes.
Ah, yes, I stopped at a gas station.
At a gas station?
Would the employees recognize you if we asked them?
There weren't any employees, because it was a self-service gas station.
But, look: I have the receipt.
Hm.
It says 18:24 here.
Even if I had been going at full speed,
it would have taken me half an hour to come from that gas station.
Hey, I saw this man not long ago.
Where did you see him, Ayumi?
In front of the barbershop;
or rather, I saw him leaving here and going away.
And do you remember what time you saw him? It was in the afternoon.
I remember I saw the clock through the window of the barbershop.
Ah, yes, it was ten to six.
What clock?
What clock?
It's a quarter to 5?
But... it's three quarters to 8.
This clock is one of those that shows everything upside down.
It's for customers to look at it through the mirror.
Wow, you!
So, you finally bought it?
Until recently he had a normal watch.
-Masao, when did you sell it to him? -Yesterday, he took it yesterday.
That means today,
when Ayumi saw Mr. Shimazaki it wasn't ten to six,
but 10 minutes past 6:00, 20 minutes later.
And this means something else:
If he left here at 6:10 a.m., he couldn't have arrived at the gas station,
he couldn't have arrived at the gas station at 06:24.
Yes, that's right, I stopped by to pick up some towels.
"We've had a sticking because of what you said yesterday at the bar,
"But since I still had to pick up laundry elsewhere,
I left right away.
What the girl said is true: it wasn't yet 6 o'clock.
If this clock is set backwards, it must have been 06:10.
She saw the clock through the window.
No, sir.
It wasn't 6 o'clock yet.
Mr. Shimazaki, you killed Mr. Ebihara...
because he accused you of stealing from his company.
That's a lie.
When you left the barbershop, you hid in the alley...
and killed Mr. Ebihara when he opened the window.
No, you didn't.
I couldn't have done that.
Know that I'm the worst dart thrower in our team.
Now, in Tatsutaro I could have, because he's the best.
That's bullshit.
That's not true.
(Shimazaki) Isn't it true, that you're the best shooter in the whole team?
The tip of the dart was smeared with poison.
"Mr. Koike works in a drugstore
and it's very easy for him to get the products to make a poison.
-But-but I didn't do it. Mr. Koike, you are the murderer!
- (Koike) No.
No, I didn't soc.-Well who are you, the murderer?
You are a famous detective.
I'd be grateful if you could explain why you say that.
(Ayumi) Whoever understands, buy it.
Grrrr!
Get out of here, children!
-Oooh! No right!
We are important witnesses, and look what they do to us.
What a face!
Oh, man!
(Think) "If the murderer had a poisoned dart at the ready,
it is evident that it is a premeditated crime."
"And if so, would the murderer have shot from so far away?"
Oh.
"The clock can't be seen from the window."
Ayumi, where did you see the wall clock from, you?
What?
From here.
I remember I was here.
How strange!
Now you can't see it.
I don't understand what happened.
I really saw it from here before.
Someone has moved that clock?
But why?
"That's it. I know what happened."
"I've got you. It's clear to me: you're the killer."
Hm.
Mr. Shimazaki and Mr. Koike,
you'll have to come to the police station with us to explain all this.
But, listen...
Aah!
(Kogoro voice) Please wait.
I'll tell you how this murder went now and here.
What are you saying?
I don't understand.
Does this mean you've already found out the truth about this case?

And the truth is that the killer was in the barbershop before I came in,
and that, right now, even though it's between us.
What does it say now?
Yes.
The murderer is... Mr. Noda.
-Oh! -Yes, you.
Oh!
Oh!
Masao!
What have you done?
But-but what do you say, Mr. Mouri?
You said yourself before that I've been lying down all the while
in the armchair next to you.
When you heard the noise of the break and got up,
"Mr. Noda also got up from the chair."
"You said it yourself earlier."
Mr. Ebihara did not die
when the sound of the statuette breaking was heard.
What actually happened is that he was already dead when I came in.
He was already dead? What does that mean?
You said that you had talked to Mr. Ebihara
when he had entered the barbershop.
(Kogoro voice) "Yes, I spoke to a man who was disheveled,
wearing a mask and dressed in a darts team jersey."
And that man was Mr. Ebihara.
No, it wasn't him;
it was you in disguise.
Was it? In disguise?
He quickly put on the mask and the wig so as not to be recognized
because I unexpectedly entered the barbershop.
Mr. Noda, you still have the mask, right?
But, wait a minute, where was Mr. Ebihara's corpse?
It was in the armchair next to me.
"He was covered with a robe and had a hot towel over his face."
Oh!
Mr.
Noda, after killing Mr. Ebihara shortly before I arrived,
"You wanted to leave the barbershop as if nothing had happened."
"But before I could do that, I arrived."
"Since I was in disguise,
I thought you were the barber, naturally."
"You put a hot towel over my face...
"So that I couldn't see anything
and tried to get out the back door."
"But since there were children playing in the back lot,
you couldn't get out that way."
"Out the front, he couldn't get out either:
There was a group of mothers at the bus stop."
Then the bus that was bringing the children back from the swimming pool passed by.
The bus from the swimming pool?
As the bus was playing loud music,
you had an idea:
you decided to take advantage of the noise to get the dead body out of the armchair
and put yourself on.
Because the music was so loud,
I couldn't hear the noises you made.
"You hurried to stretch the corpse out in front of the barbershop counter
and took his place in the chair."
And how did he do it, to knock over the statuette on the counter?
He threw a dart from the chair.
It's the dart on the floor at the bottom of the window.
He means this one.
Then he made it clear that the noise had woken him up.
"And that he discovered Mr. Ebihara's body at the same time I did."
Yes, everything fits.
One question, Mr. Mouri:
why did you take the trouble to stretch the corpse on the couch?
He didn't know, that you would come in here.
Mr. Ebihara was killed while sitting in that armchair.
And how is it that the owner of the barbershop sat in an armchair?
To check if the watch was properly placed.
Which clock does it mean?
The wall clock that they came to bring to the barber's shop
before the murder was committed.
Eh?
I saw it from outside a while ago.
Eh?! (Takagi) Co-Conan, what are you doing?
(Takagi) Co-Conan, what are you doing here?
But, on the other hand, I didn't see it from the window.
Have you seen it or not?
I don't understand, kid.
Maybe the clock was hanging somewhere else before.
Yes, it's true.
Before the clock was there.
And when it was there you could see it?
(Kogoro voice) Before, when Ayumi has seen Mr. Shimazaki,
there was still a normal clock hanging there.
Then Mr. Noda came
and hung the clock upside down on the other side.
"Then Mr. Ebihara sat down in the armchair
to check if the watch looked good."
"The murderer attacked her from behind and stabbed the dart into her chest."
"He then put a hot towel over her face
and covered her with a robe."
He did this because, if anyone came into the barbershop,

"It looked like he was a customer who was expected to be shaved."
But you arrived before
the killer could leave the barbershop.
One detail is missing: where is the watch that was hanging before?
I saw it in a cupboard in the back room.
That's a lie!
Mr. Mouri, don't try to fool us.
Can you prove that the first person you spoke to was me in disguise?
Mr. Noda, this sweater that you are wearing under your robe
is not the uniform of your darts team?
Take off your robe and show us, please.
Do this thing you've been told to do.
Uh... Yes, all right.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! There's nothing stamped?
Now is that clear?
Don't run so fast, Mr.
Noda.
You think you can fool me with such a simple trick?
Inspector Takagi, take Mr. Noda's robe off.
-Oh! -Aphans!
-Yes!
Come on! -Let me go!
Let me go!
Aah!
-Let me go! -Stop!
Oh!
Take the one in the front back.
You've put the front back when you've taken the chair, haven't you?
Only the murderer would have reason to carry it this way.
Masao, why did you do that?
The promissory note I gave to the Ebihara
when he left me money for my business
ended up in the hands of some gangsters.
Every day they came to me to claim the debt.
My wife couldn't take it anymore.
How did the promissory note go to the gangsters?
Because the Ebihara had a very big debt with them
and gave them my promissory note to be able to dry.
Wow!
I could not forgive him.
(Cries) I couldn't forgive him.

Yes, he couldn't wake up.

He didn't make it to the party in the end.
I want some more.

He thought that today he was going to relax
