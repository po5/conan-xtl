there will be no unsolved cases."
"Today in Conan you will have to review your knowledge."

DETECTIVE CONAN
The murder case of the Holmes fan meeting (I).
(Man) Oh, "Study in Scarlet!"
Yes.
It's a memorable work.
Detective Sherlock Holmes makes his first appearance.
I like "The League of Redheads" better.
I like "The Sign of Four."
"The sign of the four."
It's famous all over the world!
How clever.
Can you read Chinese characters?
A little bit...
(thinks) "Which one do you think."
Why did I have to come to a meeting like this?
In fact, Conan had signed up to go alone.
Yes, and unfortunately they accepted him.
What a bummer.
What is your favorite story?
You're asking me?
Yes! Yes!
Well, my... is "The Four Forty Train."
(thinks) "Shame on you."
You mean "The Four Fifty Train"!
And besides, it was written by Agatha Christie,
and not Arthur Conan Doyle, which I respect very much.
How can it be that there is a beginner, to the encounter?
It's not funny anymore...
Daughter, I have to spend 3 whole days with these guys?
And it's not just us, sir.
I have been told that the owner will bring more people with his car.
What fun...
The more the merrier.
Shut up flights, you ?!
Hello everyone, welcome to Mike's hostel.
I am Hiroyoki Kanaya,
owner of this hostel and organizer of this meeting!
Everyone is an expert on Sherlock Holmes.
I have made a careful selection of participants.
You mean you have made a careful selection?
There is a beginner who has no idea.
And now!
Are you serious?
It's this man with the mustache.
Very well, then.
Then I'm off.
Wait, please, Mr. Mouri!
One moment, please!
I invited her to come because he's an active detective,
who is also very famous and almost as good as Holmes.
Mr. Kogoro Mouri, right?
Kogoro Mouri, right?
I recognize him, I've seen him in the newspapers and on television.
Maybe he's smart,
but he sure isn't as smart... as Sherlock Holmes!
If he competed with Holmes,
he wouldn't even be a match for him!
They are an ill-educated bunch.
It is logical that they say so.
They compare him to Holmes.
Shut up!
I won't compete with a fictional character!
It's your fault! Poor Conan!
(At once) Conan?
-Is your name really Conan? -Really?
Isn't it a good name?
(At the same time) It's fantastic!
Gee, boy, I don't know why he suffered so much.
I was suffering because, as he is so serious and so grown-up, in Conan...
now I am happy to see him so cheerful and innocent.
He's just like him, he's also a fan of Sherlock Holmes.
Who is he?
Yes, "he", don't you remember?
He's a snooty boy, a Sherlock Holmes fan.
He's got a hearing problem...
He's got a hearing problem but he's a good footballer.
He disappeared after beating me in a match.
You mean Shinichi Kudo?
Heiji Hattori ?!
You're a Holmes fan too, aren't you? No, I'm not...
I signed up for the match
because I thought I might find in Kudo.
I like Ellery Queen better than in Conan Doyle.
But maybe in Doyle it's better?
Since it's getting a little late, we might as well go to bed.
Tomorrow we'll have breakfast at 9, lunch at 1 and dinner at 8.
After dinner, we'll have the riddle contest,
and, as every year, you'll have to solve very complicated mysteries.
And the winner will have a fantastic prize.
The first edition of Conan Doyle's famous novel,
the one that gave life to Holmes, "Study in Scarlet".
(At the same time) Oooooooooh!
But before we begin,
you will have to demonstrate to me your knowledge of Sherlock Holmes.
You will have to take a test.
A test?
Yes, the waitress will give you 1,000 questions about Holmes.
(Woman) 1,000 questions?
The deadline for submitting the test is tomorrow at dinner time.
Only those with 990 points will participate in the contest.
As a security measure,
you must give the waitress

Sherlock Holmes books they have brought with them and telephones.
And there's no point in hiding anything:
We'll be watching them all the time with cameras and gadgets we have.
And if we catch you cheating, you'll have to leave immediately.
Hey, don't run so fast.
Do I have to take this test too?
Ah, no, you're a special guest.
Tell us an anecdote.
Sir, if I score 990 points or more, will I also be able to participate in the contest?
Eh?
Yes.
The day, month and year Holmes fell into the valley with Moriarty?
(Think) "May 4, 1891!"
"Lucky you, they're easy enough, the questions."
"And now, the next one."
Write down the cipher messages that appear in "The Dancers"."
Are you still awake?
It's 4:00 in the morning.
What a mess.
No phone, no TV, no newspapers...
Plus, it's so hot and there's no air conditioning.
They only have surveillance cameras.
(Thinking) "What fun I'll have!"
(Kogoro) How fed up I am!
It's been a long time since the owner of the hostel came to tell us anything.
Girl, tell the owner
and tell him to correct our proofs.
I'm sorry,
but he told me to take care of the guests until he arrives.
(Thinking) "What a bore... he doesn't show up in Kudo."
"I must not have signed up for the meeting."
What a disaster!
I can't take it anymore!
I'm going to sleep!
Mr. Fujisawa...
It turns out that the rumor was true.
I was told it was a set-up, about the novel prize.
There won't be any winner
because the owner just wants to brag.
Excuse me, but I'll go to sleep.
I'm going to sleep too.
I've had enough.
I'm retiring too.
What are you going, Conan?
I'm staying a while longer.
I can't take it anymore.
I'm dead sleepy.
Hey, Kent, I can't take it anymore, let's go to the bedroom.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
The ones who leave are always the ones who lose.
What?
Isn't that the car we came with?
(Ayako) It's the owner's!
He's driving the owner.
Now the real contest begins.
You got it right, Kent.
(Ayako) - Huh?
What's he doing? -S'estimbarà!
Hell, no!
It's going faster and faster!
Hey, listen!
Pari, he'll fall off the cliff!
(Thinking) "A blanket." (Noise of moving air)
"This noise... it's not from the engine."
Hey, hey!
-What?!
The owner is dead?!
-Yes, that's right.
He just fell into the sea with his car.
How could he have fallen into the sea?
Aaaaaaaah... It's a suicide.
I didn't want to give the first edition of the novel to anyone.
No, I think this could also be a murder.
It could be that the murderer had given her some sleeping pills,
or that he killed her and put her in the car.
In neutral, the car moves by itself.
The killer must have set it all up in that garage over there.
Could the killer be one of us?
Well, I think so.
But the car accelerated at the last moment.
And there was a strange noise, as if air was coming out of the car.
It must have been the noise of the air conditioning!
It must have been on,
and when they started the engine, it started working.
Anyway, we can't recover the body.
We will call the police and wait for them to come.
But the owner has our phones.
Ah, they must be in Mr. Kanaya's room.
What are you doing, Conan?
Are you looking at the trail of ruts?
I'm looking for something.
Ah!
Well, what are you doing, Heiji? Nothing! I was checking to see if the air conditioner was running and...
I was checking if the air conditioner was running and...
It always gets in the way!
(Thinking) "Again?!"
"That day I was also looking for evidence and I came across him."
It's too dark.
Oh... Yes, you're right.
This will do.
You got enough light now, detectives?
Ah, thank you.
Thank you.
The phones are smashed.
Who could have done it?
They've stolen the novel!
Damn, dammit!
I've had it!
I'm going with the other car.
You can't.
The fuel tank of that car has a hole in it,
and all the gas has spilled out.
Besides, it has no battery.
No one will be able to leave here!
What's that?
Oh, man...

He must have been murdered, the owner of the hostel, right?
I don't know how the murderer managed to speed the car up,
but if he's cut us off...
it's because he wants to keep playing...
the beautiful game of the murdered.
We'll have to be careful.
What is clear is that the murderer is among us.
If we investigate well, we'll find out who he is.
Maybe the surveillance cameras should register something!
Sorry, the cameras are a joke.
What are they?
They're papier-mâché.
We used them for the meet.
We know that the car has started to move towards 2/4 of 4.
We also know that the 5 people who haven't moved from here
can't have committed the murder!
Hey, you mean the murderer is one of the 5 of us who weren't with you?
You don't count me, right?
Hey, Heiji, did you find what you were looking for?
-No, I haven't found it. No?
(laughs)
Ayako?
What's the matter?
I already know everything.
I know who the murderer is, and I know what strategy he has used.
And I have a proof.
(At once) What?!
I give you a margin of 10 minutes.
If you don't want me to reveal your name, you must confess your crime!
-Ayako, where are you going now?
-To the toilet.
No!
The murderer will come looking for you.
And now.
But you won't protect me?
What?
Wait, wait, wait!
The famous detective has been baffled.
He just wants attention.
No.
Miss Ayako has discovered some clue we don't know about.
Yes, surely.
Ayako has been behaving very strangely this afternoon.
I saw her after lunch,
when I was on my way to my room to rest.
When she saw me, it seemed that she was frightened.
and hid a piece of paper.
It seemed to be the proof given to her by her landlord.
(At the same time) The proof?
-It can't be. He was cheating?
Wow you, what a bar.
Hey, come on, who's the killer?!
-Tell us, please! -Did he tell you?
He locked himself in the bathroom and told me he can't tell.
Now he wants to keep the suspense, that girl.
Hitomi, aren't there more people who haven't had dinner, apart from Ayako?
Yes.
Mr.
Kent Tokanoh
and Mrs.
Nananko Shimizu.
(Thinks) "The Ayako already knew, that the camera was made of cardboard."
"Of course. That's exactly why she tried to cheat."
Mr. Tokanoh,
Miss Ayako has entered your room, in the afternoon?
No, you are wrong,
I was in my room and no one came in.
(Thinking) "She saw it in someone else's room."
(Thinks) "It's something vital, related to the murder..."
"He has seen something in the room of one who has no alibi."
Doesn't it take a little too long, the Ayako?
Yes, you're right.
He's been gone for 20 minutes.
Gee, no!
Eh, Ayako?
Ayako?
What is it, all this fuss?
It's very rude, disturbing me in the washroom.
It's just that we were all worried about you, Miss...
Isn't it about time you told us who the mysterious murderer is?
Ah, yes, it...
It was a joke... I beg your pardon, gentlemen.
-Huh? -I won't do it again.
-I won't do it again.
I just wanted to draw attention to myself.
(Thinking) "Why? Why has he changed all of a sudden?"
(Think) "Wow! There are so many things we don't know..."
Eh?
Where is he, the Ayako?
For a walk.
Let's see if he gets some air.
He said "there will be no more murder".
All the suspects are here, so...
If we don't move from here, nothing will happen.
What was that?
In the garage!
What the fuck happened?!
Don't tell me the Ayako is...
My God, the Ayako!
Ayako!
You idiot!
Don't move.
If she goes in, she'll burn!
Somebody get a fire extinguisher! Yes!
Please put out the fire, otherwise the novel will burn!
-We have already extinguished the fire. -Ayako, where are you?
Are you there?
Ayako!
What's wrong?!
Oh!
Ayako!
Ayako!
Ayako!
For the clothes and the figure, it sure is her.
The Ayako... no.
But she was fine just a moment ago.
The murderer killed her to shut her up, sir.
Yes, because she surely knew who the murderer was.

But when the fire broke out in the garage, we were in the owner's room.
So who did it?
-Who did it? -The sun didn't light the fire.
No, but there is a person who could have started it.
The owner!
We all think he's dead, but I think he's alive.
Don't you find that it all fits together?
Yes.
Maybe it was a dummy, the person you've seen.
There is a novel, with this plot.
No.
It was the owner of the hostel, the person in the car!
I'd say it was him too!
Well, who the fuck did it?
Come on, answer.
-Ayako is here!
Burnt! -Calm down.
At least, we know that the murderer is not one of us.
Let's go inside and wait for daylight.
-It will be the best for tothom. Let's stay in the living room.
I can't have mistaken a person for a dummy!
I mean, all the suspects were in the room, right?
What if he had put some ignition mechanism in the garage?
I didn't see anything strange.
Then how could he have lit the fire?
We wouldn't be here if we had found out.
And besides, what did Ayako come to do in the garage?
It's raining so hard.
We won't be able to go out even when it gets light.
I'm sleepy and hungry...
I can bring you coffee or something to drink.
Ah, I'll help you, Hitomi.
I'll be right there.
I'm coming too!
I don't want the killer to hurt him.
I'm coming too.
If it were true that the murderer is the owner,
why should I fake his death and kill Ayako?
The owner likes to murder, I'm sure!
Look at this card.
If there had been any trouble, he would have killed me too.
At five o'clock?
"If you want the book come to the garage at 5 o'clock."
"I'll leave it in the back seat."
When you set fire to the garage, it was about 2/4 of 5, right?
That's right.
And the body was in the back seat!
Excuse me, but where did you get it, this card, sir?
After dinner, I found it on the door of the room.
I get it!
It's quite clear!
Just a moment, I don't want to repeat it, but the owner is dead!
-How do you want us to trust a young man? -What did he say?
(Think) "From the place where the corpse was found,
he must have gone to the garage to get the book."
"The question is how the murderer lit the fire in the room while he was there."
There are many cases to be solved because of detectives like you!
You are ill-mannered!
The father solves all the cases!
When he makes any deduction, he adopts the sleeping one.
He's been nicknamed "The Sleeping Kogoro"!
Oi, father?
Sleeping?
Come with me.
What flights, Heiji?
When your father makes deductions, where is it, this nano?
This nano? What's in the middle like Thursday.
This nano!
On Conan?
He doesn't usually say anything, he.
Oh, he doesn't?
But he always stands behind the father and helps her to expose the deductions.
From behind?
Mmm, he helps her from behind, doesn't he?
I really like to play detective.
Is the power out?
By storm.
No, the power's out.
(Kogoro) Somebody turn on the power!
Shit, just now...
Wait, that already illuminates you.
(Think) "An ice pick?!"
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What happened? (Cracks)
What was that?
-(Glasses) -Miss!
Turn on the lights!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Mr. Fujisawa!
What happened to him?
Father!
Look, they broke the glass!
The murderer broke it and ran away!
(He thinks) "No, it's not true!"
"The murderer is here and now I know it!"
(Think) "I know how he did it, the murderer,
to set fire to the garage from here!"
("Hiraki to Kaze no Roman")

DETECTIVE CONAN
Maybe the killer didn't expect it, this third murder.
But what are you saying, Conan.
What are you talking about, Conan?
I don't understand anything because I'm too small!

(Think) "This kid is not playing detective!"
"He's making deductions!"
"Although the body and voice are different,
he looks so much like Shinichi Kudo in the way he does..."
In the next episode...
Holmes fan meeting murder case (II)
