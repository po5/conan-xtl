(Shinichi voice) We have barely started a new year
and I've already found myself involved in a case in the most unexpected way.
It all started when I helped stop an out-of-control car.
Its owner, Mr. Takuya Hoso Sr,
is a wealthy businessman from the world of commerce
who was carrying a briefcase with an object of great cultural value,
the legendary mask of the two faces.
The recipient was the most popular actor of the kabuki theater,
the eBiz Ichikawa.
The eBiz, who is a friend of Mr. Hoso,
planned to use the mask for the February performance.
The theater's president, Mr. Yabusaki,
kept the mask in his closet, but someone has stolen it.
In addition, at Hitoshi Takahashi,
Mr. Hoso's secretary,
was found dead inside his car.
Next to him was the briefcase,
but the two-faced mask was missing.
We have several suspects.
One of them is Shinnosuke Iwami, the playwright.
There is also Eiji Kaneko, the photographer;
the president of the theater, Mr. Yoshiyuki Yabusaki;
and Yukari Shioji,
the accounting manager of Mr. Hoso's company.
As I wandered around Ginza looking for the culprit,
someone attacked me in an alley.
The feeling that we have always carried in our hearts
has made us take flight towards the 20th anniversary.
The mask and Conan are gone.
A brilliant end on the stage.
The truth always comes out in the end.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is Detective Conan!

"The theatrical mystery of Conan and the eBiz (Part Two)."
(Drip: plim)
(Drip: plim)
(Shinichi, think) "Where am I?"
"I'm fine..., I'm not hurt."
"It looks like a basement."
"Are they boilers? They're huge."
"I must be two or three stories underground."
"Oh!"
(shaking and cracking)
"It looks like... they're tearing the building down."
"Oh, I don't have my cell phone."
"It's not working."
(Interference)
(Crane: brittle)
"I've got to get out of here!"
How!
The can opener?
The other day you're going to open a can of salmon with beer, right?
The salmon?
I did eat it!
Ahm... you tell him.
Me? No, no way.
No, no way.
All cans have a tab.
What do you want to open, by the way?
Some cans!
Tuna cans.
But tuna cans always have tabs, lately.
"Are there still tuna cans without tabs?"
Well, yes, they were 58 yen for three.
Only?
58 yen?
And you're sure, it's tuna?
Throw it away, even though it will hurt us, that thing you bought!
Sorry to keep you waiting so long, Mr. Mouri.
Wait, I remember now.
The nano opened...
A can of peaches?
I asked for a couple and he had the nerve to say no!
Very well, father.
I'll ask him.
Oh!
What a long meeting, he must be tired.
It's lasted more than 4 hours.
Meetings with foreigners always take longer than they should.
Besides, there was a pile of documents to sign...
that I had to go through one by one.
And, on top of that, they were written in English.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I have another one, a document I should sign.
Ah, yes, right now.
(Mobile)
How strange!
(Mobile: ringtone)
(Crane: brittle)
(Shinichi, thinks) "Let's go."
"Without this tiny body, I wouldn't have gotten out."
They have stopped.
Attention!
We rest and put ourselves back on later.
Let's meet at 7. In the meantime, you can go to dinner.
- (man 2) Yes, okay.
- (man 1) Yes, understood!
(Shinichi, thinks) "It's the electrical box."

I'm in luck.
"And the hot streak continues..."
-Yes.
-Do we have to go back to the rehearsal room?
The eBiz is waiting for us, she says she wants to talk to the theater staff.
What does she want to tell them?
What a face, isn't it?
We've come to bring you the can opener and we're staying for dinner.
You prepared all this food for yourselves, didn't you?
Still not picking up the phone?
Mm!
It's delicious, finger-licking good.
Tuna salad and pasta with tuna.
The whole dinner is made with tuna.
I already told him it was tuna day.
-That's right, the tuna festival.
-Yes, the tuna festival. -Yes, the tuna festival.
Yes.
Has he got his cell phone on?
Me too.
I'm starting to get worried.
It won't do any good.
Maybe I should call Shinichi.
If Conan has the cell phone's GPS activated...
-Of course.
- (all) Can you find out where he is?
If he went to Ichikawa's restaurant by himself, I won't forgive him.
What an obsession with the restaurant!
-Don't push me.
-You still haven't found it, Ai?
Perfect, he's got the GPS on.
- (all) Where is it?
-It's here.
-To the sushi restaurant?
-To Ginza.
-That looks like an alley.
-Do you want to stop with the restaurant?!
-Oh.
Strange, nothing's moving.
-What's he doing, in an alley? -What's he doing, in an alley?
He would have called us.
Maybe he lost his cell phone.
Eh?
It's not a creature.
-Come on, let's go!
-Let's go look.
(Genta) Yes.
Let's have a quick dinner and go.
- (Genta) All right, all right.
- (all) We'll have dinner later!
You don't need to call me all at once.
(Shinichi, thinks) "At last!"
Getting out of here will be a piece of cake, huh?"
Hey, don't do this to me!
MHM!
"It's deformed at the top."
(Pipe: clanga-clanga)
Come on, come on, somebody help me!
- (whistle blow: piiip)
- (pipe: clang-clang-clang)
(Man) Come on, boys, let's get started.
(Pipe: clang-clang-clang)
(Conan's voice) Auxiliii!
(Pipe: clang-clang-clang)
Somebody help me!
Help me.
Surely you already know what happened.
The mask of the two faces that Mr. Hoso left us
is missing, someone has stolen it.
Also, Mr. Hoso's secretary in Takahashi is dead.
And our playwright, the Iwami, is in the hospital.
What seems to be the least suspected of committing a crime
is usually the most suspicious, the guilty one.
-No, nothing, nothing...
-What?
What did you say?
I have worked hard to be able to offer the public
a new interpretation of "The Seven Masks",
one of the main works of kabuki.
And for me it's very painful that the project I have started has had these consequences.
has had these consequences.
But I do not intend to throw in the towel.
I will carry this play on stage at all costs.
- (all) Yes, sir!
-Counting on you.
Hello, eBiz.
Iwami!
Are you sure you're ready to come back?
I couldn't stay in that room any longer
because I knew you guys were still working.
Now I won't run away anymore.
What looks the least suspicious is the most suspicious.
In this new version, the four actors who accompany me...
will change quickly and dress in modern clothes.
Then I will say
that the karma of mankind has not changed over time.
Iwami..., I know you will write me a good script.
Yes.
Excuse me, we need to talk to you for a moment.
(EBiz) Inspector Megure...
- (Ai) I'm sure.
- (Genta) Wow, are you sure it's here?
(Ayumi) And what was he doing in Conan, in a place like this?
No idea, but in the alleys of Ginza there are only drinking bars.
Maybe he's taken to alcohol, now, this one.
At our age we can't drink, you donkey!
-Calling him on his cell phone, Ran.
-But he looks older....
(Mobile: ringtone)
Yes, it makes signal.
Do you have it on?
-I don't feel it.
- (mobile: ringtone)
I may have it on silent and it may be vibrating.
Everybody be quiet for a moment.
I'm here!
Have you found it, or what?
-Xxxt!
-What's the matter with you?
Listen.
(Mobile)
Conan!
It's coming in here.
It's in here!
(Mobile)

And Conan, where is he?
He has disappeared from the face of the Earth.
-Don't make jokes in bad taste.
-What?
We must find him!
We'll ask Inspector Megure and company for help.
It's obvious... something's happened to him.
Remove the transmitters, boys!
We'll split up and search Conan.
W-where are we going?
Let's go, Sonoko!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Come on!"
"I hope there's enough battery left."
We've analyzed the car and the briefcase
and only found Mr. Hoso and Mr. Takahashi's fingerprints.
Who could there be who is capable of killing
to steal the mask of the two faces?
I am sorry.
He should have kept it in a safer place.
It was not his fault.
As I see it, there are three possibilities.
One: Mr. Takahashi steals the mask of the two faces
to sell it to a third party,
but the buyer kills him and takes the mask.
If this were true,
I don't see what need the culprit had
to make it look like Takahashi had committed suicide.
Yes, it would be strange if he had invested so much time?
preparing the string trick, wouldn't it?
(Kogoro, think) "Look at him. He's obviously trying to throw me off."
Eh?
(Kogoro, thinks) "What's wrong?
Well, no deduction is perfect.
Second possibility:
The culprit steals the mask with the intention of selling it.
I-I swear I didn't do anything, I'm innocent!
Don't worry, Mr. Minowa.
Mr. Mouri has not accused you at any time.
(Kogoro) Ahem!
Where were we?
The culprit steals the mask to sell it,
calls Takahashi and proposes to buy it back.
Once he gets the money, he kills him.
Because he has already seen his face, of course.
And fakes his suicide to frame him for the robbery.
I don't understand why he contacted the secretary.
If what he wanted was to sell the mask,
what he should have done was to offer it to Mr. Hoso.
(Kogoro, thinks) "He's always trying to antagonize me."
"And I know why he does it."
Did anyone call you to offer you the mask in exchange for money?
No, not at any time.
(Kogoro, thinks) "This means that the culprit might be you."
Can we rule out the suicide theory altogether?
(Kogoro, thinks) "Ah, look."
Yes, almost 100%.
"Try to take up the suicide hypothesis to cover up the crime."
In the car there were signs that she had been wiped from top to bottom,
even the engine was clean of fingerprints.
That's why: a person who intends to commit suicide
doesn't waste time wiping off his own fingerprints.
Of course not.
(Kogoro, thinks) " 'Naturally not,' he says."
"He's dug his own grave."
-Hey!
- (mobile: ring)
-Ran?
- (mobile: ring)
Hey, Father, it's an emergency.
I'm busy.
If it's the can opener story, we'll talk later.
No, it's not that.
I'm not looking for the can opener anymore, now I'm looking for Conan!
Hey, what happened to the can opener kid?
What happened to the kid with the glasses?
What's that?
He's disappeared?
He thinks he disappears every now and then, this one.
He says he goes to the toilet one minute and doesn't come back until the next day.
-Hey!
-May I?
Ahm... Who-who are you?
Yes, Ichikawa, yes...
What?!
You're the eBiz?!
Mm.
Mm-hm.
Okay, I'll be right back.
What's happened?
It looks like Conan went missing while he was hanging around district 4.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-In Conan?
I'm going to look for him.
Mm?
I've got it figured out.
Those guilty of a crime...
are more willing to cooperate with the police.
...to collaborate?
They are willing...
