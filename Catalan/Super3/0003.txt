"My name is Shinishi Kudo."
"I go to high school, and I'm a famous detective."
"But some delinquents gave me a poison..."
"(Child's voice)... and I became Conan Edogawa."
"I'm small, but I solve all the cases."

DETECTIVE CONAN
Beware of idols
(Alarm clock)
(Thinks) "It's been 3 days since I shrunk."
"I still don't know anything about the men in black who poisoned me."
(Laughs)
"But with a detective like the one in this company..."
"If they don't even order us anything."
Hurray!
Yoko is gorgeous!
Uyyy!
"Ay... So big and so dumb."
"This one too..."
(Students) Two times one, two.
Two times two, four. Two times three, six.
I can't take it anymore.
Let's go for a walk together, okay?
The new students are alone.
We'll be your friends.
No, I'm not... I mean that...
(Boy) Hey, you!
Don't you agree with Yumi?!
Come on, Genta, but don't hit her, man.
Shut up, Mitsuhiko.
You want to fight me?!
Stop it, you heavies! I've got work to do.
Good bye!
Conan, wait!
Oysters!
If this doesn't change, we won't find the men in black.
Be patient, Shinishi.
If they found out who you are, you know what it would mean, that.
Yes, I put myself and those around me in danger.
That's right.
Hey, Ran came yesterday.
In Shinishi hasn't come to school, nor was he at home.
I'm going to the police! Wait, wait, wait, wait.
He must have stuck his nose in another case.
Don't worry, she'll show up sooner or later.
This time I've convinced her... but I don't know how long I'll be able to do it.
Ran...
I know...
I have something that might be good for you to investigate.
A voice-transforming ribbon.
Transforms it?
You turn the knob on the back and you have a whole selection of voices.
You can be a boy, a man, a woman...
It'll fool anyone.
You'll do just fine.
Aaaaaa... aaaaaaaa... aaaaaaa...
I doubt that he will be of service to you, to that detective agency.
So Conan lives here.
We'll have to force her to be our friend.
-Oooooh!
It's her! -Ooooh!
Look!
(doorbell)
Today is closed, the agency.
Come back tomorrow.
I do not believe it!
It can not be!
It's you!
It's you!
It's Yoko Okino!
Yes.
Why are you coming here, an idol like her? I want to hire you.
I think you have a problem, my queen...
Yes...
Gee, who is this?
(Kogoro) What did he say?!
That someone is bothering you?!
When I return home, I find all the furniture moved.
They send me photographs that have been secretly taken of me.
and I get anonymous phone calls.
How could anyone dare to do that to her?
I wish it were a confidential matter.
Who are you?
I'm Yamagishi, his manager.
His manager.
I understand.
I'll be very discreet.
Write me his address and phone number.
And will you autograph me, by the way?
I'll do that.
Ah, write on it "For Kogoro".
Now that Kogoro is in charge of this case, don't suffer for nothing!
Can I come with you?
I want to see the house of a star.
And you, Conan?
Yes, me too.
Don't get in the way, okay? Yes.
(Kogoro) Uaaaaaaaaaah!
What a building!
It's the ideal place for Yoko Okino!
Xxxt.
We don't want it to be known that she lives here.
(Kogoro) Ah!
Xxxxxt!
Well, well, on the 25th floor?
Wow!
It's the real Yoko Okino.
How strong!
-We have to make friends with Conan. -You're right.
It's beautiful!
Oooooooooooh! Oooooooh!
Come in, please.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What's wrong with you?
(screams)
How loud! What's the matter?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! -Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Are you all right?
Donkeys.
So this guy was already dead when they got here.
Yes.
And the people you're with...
Hello, Inspector Megure!
It's me, at Kogoro Mouri!
(thinks) "What bad luck. Why did it have to be this one?"
Just like in the old days.
Think of the cases we worked on together.

Yes, thanks to you most of them were never solved.
It's so hot in here!
Do you always have the heating on?
No.
Not that hot.
I usually turn it off when I go out.
How strange that is.
It's not the only strange thing.
You can hardly see it, but there are traces of moisture around the body.
And that's the only thing that's not from the ground.
And the heat in this room?
Could it be to prevent the time of death from being known?
They should not be in the way, children.
This is for you!
Do you know the cause of death? A stab wound, surely.
Is it yours, this knife?
Yes...
Why do you suspect her?
Do you know the victim?
We should take a closer look...
Ah!
Ah!
Do you know him?
Sorry, Inspector, we've never seen him before, have we, Yoko?
No.
(Thinking) "I'm sure... But what's he doing? He's taken something!"
Ah... it's nothing.
"Let's see..."
"What could that be?"
"It looks like a hair!"
The corpse was in this locked room.
Therefore, the murderer is the person in the house.
I am not a murderer!
Of course you're not!
Just so you have the key...
Do not have spare key, people? Yes.
Yes, of course, esclar.
Calleu!
That's right, Mr. Yamagishi has one.
I got it!
Mr. Yamagishi, the murderer is you!
The Yoko wanted to break the relationship and you wanted to harm her!
Can you prove that it wasn't her?
How can you want such a pretty and sweet person to be the murderer?
Oh, right.
"Donkeys."
It's... it's true, I have a spare.
-But I lost it two days ago.
That's- That's bullshit.
I lost it in the locker room of a television studio.
It's true, she told me.
If Yoko says so...
"I have a feeling there's one detail missing that will explain everything."
"Mm? Ah..."
"A slope?"
Inspector!
Look under that sofa.
Here, the creatures don't have to do anything!
"Damn! They won't ignore me!"
"I've got it! I'll try that!"
"I'll change the voice."
(Man's voice) Inspector, there's something under the couch.
What's that?
An earring?
It's from Yuko Kesawa!
Yuko's?
Yes, it sure is.
I've seen her wear it often.
Yes, she was angry.
because Yoko was given the lead role.
Now I'm absolutely sure.
The killer is Yuko!
Go arrest her!
Right, Inspector?
Well, let's go to the station.
No, we'll question her right here.
You've already felt it.
Hurry up!
(Think) "The murderer is Yuko Ikesawa. No doubt about it!"
"The way the crime scene has turned out, Yoko looks guilty."
"The manager's actions have been suspicious."
"And what were the dirt stains?"
"All the pieces are here."
"Now we have to put them together."
What a nerve they have!
They should be suspicious of Yoko, if the crime happened in her apartment.
But Yuko...
It's the first time I've come here.
Then why did we find this?
Well, you finally found the earring!
I didn't know where I lost it.
And there's more.
The janitor saw someone who looked like you.
Who looks like me?
That's silly.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Hold it!
We haven't finished!
You think I'm a murderer because of an earring?
I'm not burdened, I've got work to do!
But maybe I don't have as much as number one has.
If the press gets wind of this,
your popularity will plummet.
You'll have as little work as I do.
That's-that's-that's... She's stupid!
(Thinks) "They're exactly the same from behind."
"And how could I know..."
Ah... excuse me, gentlemen...
Shut up, little boy?!
-Dolent! -Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What did you think?!
Conan, you mustn't meddle in the investigation.
If Shinishi were here, he would solve the case in a moment.
Where did that...
...damn detective?
I'm sure he'll be back soon, don't suffer.
What's that?
Maybe... it could be...
How many times do I have to tell him?
I've never been here before.
Mmm!
What a strange lighter!
He said he hadn't been here,
but he knew this was a lighter.
He's right, the boy.
How did he know?
A friend of mine has one just like it.
What's this friend's name? It's...
The sink?

As I have never been here, I don't know where it is.
It's at the back.
Besides, you knew where the sink was!
Yuko Kesawa, it's you, the murderer!
You wanted Yoko to be involved in a scandal
and you murdered that man here.
You are mistaken.
I didn't kill him!
It was him.
He attacked me by surprise, I was only defending myself.
It's true, I've been here several times.
I was using the key I stole from the locker room.
I just wanted to cause a scandal.
"But today..."
"Suddenly a man came in."
"I shook him off and ran away."
But he killed her in the panic, didn't he?
I didn't kill him!
(Man) Inspector...
Sir, we've identified the victim.
Akiyoshi Fuji.
22 years old.
Studied at Conan High School and worked at Kakubeni Company.
Conan High School?
Miss Okino went there too.
It's a coincidence, isn't it?
No... She's right.
I did know him!
In fact, I knew him well, because... he was my high school boyfriend.
Boyfriend? Boyfriend?
Yoko!
I'm sorry, Yamagishi, I can't go on lying.
And he did it to end the relationship.
Of course he didn't!
He left me when we were still in high school.
(Think) "Who's the murderer?"
"The Yoko Okino?"
"The Yuko Kesawa?"
"At Yamagishi, the manager?"
"Oysters... There's something missing, here."
"What is it? What's missing?"
Oh!
"The dirt hole!"
"The room was a mess."
"The only thing that hadn't fallen out was this chair.
"and it's extremely hot."
"Water stains around the body..."
"Hair on the fingers..."
"That's it! I've got it!"
"I've solved the riddle!"
The murderer...
...is him!
The manager!
What?
I was afraid this man would cause a scandal that would affect Yoko.
When he got here, he found him and killed him.
"No. It's not him, the murderer."
What a nap!
Genta, you're awake at last!
-Where's the washroom? -Over there.
You're the only one who could have done it.
I have to fix this, come on!
Excuse me, excuse me!
Come on... Ah!
(Voice) "I will adjust to Mr. Mouri's voice."
(Voice) "It seems the most obvious, but it's not the truth."
"If you had killed her, and you had hired me
I would have left some clue to prove her innocence."
"This is also because of Yoko, because she would be the most suspicious."
So, the murderer is...
...the Yuko Kesawa!
It's not true!
"No. Even if I had unintentionally killed her,
she wouldn't have admitted that she had found it."
But this is very confusing.
"Yes, it's all pure assumptions."
"They won't prove anyone's innocence,
but they will confirm my theory."
"Mr. Yamagishi has made it look like he was falling
and pulled out a hair from the victim."
So, the murderer is you!
"No, it's not him."
"The victim was stabbed in the back."
"In the back!"
"Isn't it strange that he grabbed the attacker by the hair?"
Now that you mention it...
"The attacker wanted to make it look like a murder,
a murder committed by Miss Okino."
Why did it look like a murder?
Y-you mean...?
(Voice) "That's right. The murderer is..."
"...the same victim, Mr. Fuji."
Suicide?!
It's impossible that he could stab himself in the back!
"On the contrary, it's easy if you use ice."
"He turned the heat up high,
"he took hair from Yoko's brush,
"climbed up on the chair
and dropped backwards onto the knife embedded in the ice."
"The knife handle has left a mark on the floor."
"The ice has melted because of the heat,
but Mr. Fuji didn't foresee one thing."
The hair, right?
"When Mr. Yamagishi saw it, he thought it was Yoko and wanted to hide it.
and wanted to hide it."
Why did he do it, this, in Fuji?
"It seems to me that he did it because he was still in love with you."
"Haven't you noticed?"
"You and Yuko are the same from behind."
"He took Yuko thinking it was you."
"No, I think he wanted to talk to you."
"Thinking you wanted to get him off your back,
he's been standing very still,

and this unrequited love has turned to hatred."
If it was he who left me!
Why did he leave me?
Yoko, you're wrong.
He left you because I asked him to.
But... But why, Yamagishi?
Inspector...
What's the matter?
We have a personal diary of the victim.
A diary?
"It reflected the pain she felt."
"He wrote that he'd come to see her
because he couldn't get her out of his mind."
"He wanted them to reconcile,
even if it meant the end of his career."
"He wanted to explain to her why he had left her:
Because he couldn't go on living with that lie."
So this tragedy was the result of a lie,
a misunderstanding and a twist of fate.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
What powers of deduction you have!
I was wrong, you are a great detective!
Ah!
I'm shattered!
I was a little scared, but it was exciting.
If we make friends with Conan, I'm sure we're in for a thrill.
Okay, okay, okay!
We have to force him to be our friend!
-Yes! -Yes, yes!
He's very brave!
After what happened, you've pulled yourself together.
I am not.
I can't be as strong as she is.
I can't even sleep since she disappeared in Shinishi.
I'm a fool...

"It's very strange."
"It's been a week since he disappeared in Shinishi."
"Something must have happened to him..."
"It can't be. He's very smart in Shinishi."
"Shinishi, come back soon."
"Shinishi!"
(Phone)
Detective Mouri.
Hello.
Ran, do you know who this is?
It's me.
Shinishi!
Knowing you, I thought you'd be worried and crying.
Donkey!
Why should I cry?
Shinishi, where are you now?
Where are you now?
I'm working on a very difficult case.
I'll be back when I've solved it.
Don't worry, don't suffer.
(Think) "Forgive me, Ran."
"I don't know how I'll do it, but I'll be normal again."
"And I'll confess to you, out loud..."
"...how I feel about you."
(Mitsuhiko) -And these drawings? (Ayumi) -A treasure map!
Come on, guys, let's go treasure hunting!
We'll be the junior detective league!
With the money from the treasure, I'll go to the best restaurants!
What about you, Conan?
I think I'll save it.
Hey, we got it!
In the next chapter of Detective Conan...
