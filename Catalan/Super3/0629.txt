What a nice little air, isn't it? Yes, indeed.
On the coast of the island I have been told that there are fish.
Incredible and really beautiful fish!
Ha.
I can't wait to get there.
Too bad the Ai didn't come.
He said he didn't want to get sunburned.
(Ayumi) Look, Conan, seagulls!
Hm.
(Ayumi) Eh?
They're there, the seagulls.
I know, so what?
You think these here are rain clouds?
Do you?
"We'll melt the mist that surrounds love
and crimes to see them clearer."
"A tragedy on a remote island."
"A fight breaks out among the film crew members."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The shooting of a promotional video (part one)"
Mr. Kurahashi, thank you very much for hosting us.
To you, Sonoko, for your loyalty to our pension.
Thank you very much.
Let's leave our bags in the room, and go scuba diving.
I'm sorry, but there is a very strong storm coming this way.
I know you've come a long way to enjoy the sea,
but now you'd better not go, it's too dangerous.
What? We can't go?
-No way, there's no right. -Oh, you!
What a stick!
How serious, I wanted to see the fish.
(He thinks) "He-he! I knew it would end up like this. It was obvious."
If you come with me, I'll show you the rooms.
What a shock, guys!
I didn't expect it, that the weather would be bad.
We could have imagined it, it's the rainy season.
What's up, Conan?
What's up, Conan?
What did you see? Mm.
Look, I'd say they're filming something down there.
Filming?!
Okita!
Careful with the lighting, it must look perfect.
Yes.
Yes, that's it.
That's good.
Ran, look.
Isn't it Yuya Miyasaka, this one here?
Who are you saying?
Is he someone famous?
Yes.
He's an actor.
He was in the news, last year.
He was arrested for assault and drinking.
Yes, I remember.
Because of that they canceled the series where he was the main character.
I remember that too.
I liked the series a lot.
Since that happened,
he hasn't been seen much in the movies or on television.
I would like to know what he is shooting, here.
It looks very interesting, this, guys.
Come on, let's go check it out.
Yeah. On wow?
Look, it's Saeko Akimoto, the actress!
An actress?
Where?
Ah!
Xxxt...
Cut!
Yes, that's perfect.
Very good.
Ui.
Excuse me.
No pasa res.
I'm sorry.
We're staying a few days in a boarding house nearby,
we have seen that they were filming and we wanted to come and see.
It's very interesting.
Oh, is it?
If you are in a pension, it must be the same as us.
What are you doing?
Filming a movie? No, it's not any movie.
We are shooting a promotional video by Yuya Miyasaka.
Mm? And what's it about, the story?
Yuya and Saeko are shipwrecked and end up on a deserted island.
He protects her and they are able to survive
thanks to Yuya's knowledge of survival.
-The plot is this: A deserted island, eh?
Hm.
-Let's stay like this, then.
I'm counting on you. Yeah, okay.
Hey, Miki!
-Mm? -Oysters!
He needs me.
See you later.
Who are they, these kids?
A group who are staying in the same boarding house as us.
See, such a famous actress and she does her own makeup.
Yes.
But isn't the one who was talking to us the makeup artist?
Is she?
No, not now.
Watch out for Saeko, she's watching us.
So what?
I don't care.
We can keep rolling now.

Mm-hm.
I thought so, això. Eh?
Why do you say that?
For a while,
there was a rumor that Yuya and Saeko were dating.
Eh?
Yes, and then another woman appeared.
What?
"My goodness! How are they...!"
We continue, scene 14!
It's when I climb down the cliff to save the Saeko
that's hanging on the wall below!
What, Yamamoto?
All set, here?
Ah..., yes.
A-all set, up here.
Come out, do'm the phone.
Mr. Miyasaka, what is the meaning of this?
I don't have to do stunts, I don't get paid for it.
Come on, man.
You told me you were going to the gym and that you were in great shape.
If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have hired you as an assistant cameraman.
If you don't want to do it, you're on your own, but I'm not paying you anything at all, you hear me?
Shit!
I'll have no choice but to do it!
It's better, that's what I would do.
When Mr. Miyasaka says something, he doesn't back down.
Shut up, I know.
It's easy for you to say so it doesn't affect you, that.
What do you want to do, hang over the wall from up there on top of everything?
-As good as you are, it's impossible. -That's scary.
You may be very fit but I think...... that this is too much, yes.
Ready?
Action!
Aah!
Iaaah!
Aah! Oh!
-Oh! -Aah!
Ah! Oh!
Aaah!
(Miyasaka) Cut!
(Miyasaka) Ah.
Mitsuo, are you all right?
I'm sorry, but this fall didn't look good at all.
-L'hauràs de volver a repetir. -What?!
What?
You have nothing to say?
Why don't you do it, if you didn't like it?
-Yes, rather! -What do you want, you?
Mr.
Miyasaka, you have not seen it?
It has gone from little that does not really hurt!
What do you want?
That he kills himself?
-He's right! He is right!
May I know who has asked for your opinion, you?
AAAI!
But-but who has left this can here on earth?!
-Oh, I'm sorry. Genta, again?
They stained the sheath and the machete.
Wow, wow.
-Tros of idiot! -Aah!
How could you mess up my stuff?
-Calm down, calm down, home. Are you all right, Mr. Yamamoto?
Shit!
Nothing's going right!
Now it's raining.
That's all I need.
I don't know, it seems to me that the gods have abandoned you, Yuya.
I've never seen anyone so unlucky.
Shut up!
(Sonoko) Mail, hurry!
We're going back to the boarding house!
-Aah! -Aah!
(Kurahashi) Here.
They're soaking wet, they'd better dry off with it.
The bathtubs are ready.
When you want to take a bath, just say so.
(Kurahashi) What?
Have you recovered?
While dinner is being prepared, you could play a board game,
get to know each other a little better, what do you think?
Yes, that's great!
-Yes, it could be a lot of fun. -Yes.
Are you kidding?
He thinks we're on a school trip.
I'm going to rest.
I don't know why most guesthouse owners
want their clients to get to know each other.
We have to dry all the equipment and check it out.
If you'll excuse us.
(Genta) Come on, I'll start.
The 8 of spades, bird!
Well, I'll play the 8 of diamonds.
Well, I... Let's see, yes, a 6 of hearts.
Does Mr. Miyasaka always behave this way?
He was involved in an unpleasant incident a while ago, wasn't he?
Mr. Miyasaka, in Yuya,
is trying very hard to regain the popularity
he had before that incident.
He's paying out of his own pocket for the promotional video we're shooting.
He's betting everything on this project.
I guess that's why he's nervous.
I'm sorry you had to watch this show.
I'm sorry you had to see this show.
Don't be.
(Door: stings)
(Door: stinging) Huh?
-Who is it? -Me, Saeko.
What is it?
What are you doing, like this?
You haven't changed for dinner yet?
I don't think you care.
Why did you come here?
Wouldn't you like to share a drink before dinner?
In this weather, I doubt we'll be able to shoot anything until tomorrow.
This is already... the second punch.
Shit!
You bastard Miyasaka!
How dare he do this to me!
(Door: stinging)
- (Takayama) Hey, Okita! Ah, what?
Hello.

What is it, Mr. Takayama?
It's in Miyasaka.
He wants you to go with the camera in his room.
-He wants to make a "making of". Huh?
And he wants me to record it?
-Won't you record it, now? -No.
He told me to go with you.
Maybe he wants to apologize for what he made you do before, I don't know.
Ow, there you go.
Mm.
I'll pass a second time.
Noooo!
I'll pass again.
I can't pass anymore, now!
I pass too.
That's 3 times.
It's no good.
Conan is so smart, he always ends up winning!
"What's my fault. If they don't know how to play, let them learn."
(Steps: approaching)
Hurry up!
In Miyasaka it's... it's death!
What?!
What do you mean, in Miyasaka it's dead?!
Mr. Miyasaka?
I went to his room...
because I wanted to film a "making of" and that I was the cameraman,
but when I got there...
-Ah! -What?!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
In Miyasaka... d-dead!
Miyasaka!
Miyasaka!
Mitsuo, go tell everyone!
Yes.
-It's not a joke, is it? -No!
Nooo!
Hurry, let's go to the room!
Don't go in.
Wait outside, you.
Is it death?
Are you sure Mr. Miyasaka is...?
He has no pulse.
Nothing can be done now.
Yuya!
Noooo!
What is it, this drama?
What happened?
-Oh! -Ah!
Yu-Yuya.
"He's been stabbed through the heart with a machete."
"There's something I don't..." Conan, what are you doing?
You can't go in! Ah.
Right, sorry.
Uh...
Ah.
"What's this?"
What's this doing here?
It's my foundation.
I don't get it.
-How did it end up here? -Stay still!
Don't touch anything.
Ah.
We have to leave it as it is.
We'd better all get out of here without touching anything.
I'll lock the door to the room
and I'll call the police to come.
-The-the police?! - A person has been murdered.
You can't expect me not to call the police, can you?
No, no, of course not, but...
Miki, maybe you'd better get some rest.
She's right.
(Cries) Yes.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I've notified the police, but they told me that as long as the storm lasts...
they can't send anyone to investigate the murder.
Anyway, it's obvious that the murderer is one of us.
I say this because, with the storm that is raging,
that not even the police with their means can't get here,
it's impossible that the murderer is someone from outside.
I don't like to say it, but I think so too.
So, the murderer...
Hey, what do you think we should do, for dinner?
I don't like the idea at all,
but we'll think about dinner when the police arrive.
Anyway, I'm not hungry.
And I'm not looking forward to dinner at the same table as a murderer.
Why do you say that?
You think you couldn't be, the murderer?
That you're crazy?
What's the matter with you?
You suspect me, huh?
Calm down, calm down.
It's better that we all calm down together
and try to analyze what happened.
Ah, Miki, are you feeling better now?
Yes, yes, I am.
I'm sorry, I didn't want to worry.
Well, we're all here now.
Miki, come sit here.
Thank you, Ran.
Well, the murder has taken place in the time interval
from the time Mr. Miyasaka left the hallway
to the time that the Okita found him dead...
stabbed to death in his room.
During this time, we did not move from the lobby.
This means that I, the Ran, the Miki,
Mr. Kurahashi and the boys have an alibi and have not been able to do so.
Therefore, the ones without an alibi are....
Saeko, the actress;
on Takayama, the cameraman;
on Yamamoto, the director of photography;
his assistant, the Okita, and my wife.
5 people in all.
But I've been making dinner in the kitchen the whole time.
I know.
You just met him today, Mr. Miyasaka.
It's impossible for you to be the murderer, you had no motive.
That is to say, the murderer must necessarily be one of the four of us.
I'll record what happens from now on,
so we can show it to the police.
Well, who wants to start justifying themselves.
Hey, excuse me, can I ask you a question?
Conan, do me a favor!
I just want to ask you a question!

This is a question for Mr. Okita.
The rooms are automatically locked.
How did you get into your room?
Was the door open?
That is, when the Okita entered the room,
Miyasaka was still alive.
But he has lied, and made it look like he was the one who had discovered the corpse.
You were angry with him because he made you fall down the cliff.
-It could have been you.
What?
You have no idea what you're talking about.
When I got to the room,
"The door was jammed with a bottle of makeup."
The room was open!
This makeup bottle was yours, Saeko!
This means that you were in Miyasaka's room before me.
What's the matter?
You suspect me, too, now?
It wasn't me.
What motive could I have for murdering him?
-You had one, don't say you didn't! -Hm.
Saeko suspected me of having an affair with Yuya,
and she was jealous.
Wow, a love triangle.
I see I'll have no choice but to tell all.
"That's right, I went to Yuya's room,
to ask him about his relationship with Miki but..."
I'm sorry.
I don't feel like talking about it, now.
"He made me outside, he didn't even let me enter the room."
But when I went in, I didn't have the makeup bottle with me.
I don't understand what I was doing in there, in Yuya's room.
It's really weird that she showed up there.
There is something that has me intrigued and I would like to ask the Takayama.
What is it?
What is it?
I entered the room and found Miyasaka dead,
"You appeared very quickly, right away."
"It was as if he was waiting for me to run out of the room."
Maybe it wasn't true that he had asked for me,
and Miyasaka's murderer is you.
It couldn't be that the only one he wanted was to frame me?
-What?
It's not true! -There's something I didn't say.
In Takayama likes gambling very much.
He owed a lot of money to Miyasaka, who had left them.
What?
You bastard!
I came to make sure you had no trouble making the "making of".
My debt to him has nothing to do with it!
Are you sure?
And you, Eiji?
You had no reason to kill him?
The machete that was stuck in his heart...
is one of the props you had, isn't it?
That Yuya had two punches thrown at you...
is a good reason to kill him, isn't it?
Come on, he had always treated you worse than a dog, admit it.
This makes you accumulate a lot of hatred, and in the end...
No, I didn't kill him, it wasn't me!
When he hit me in Miyasaka, I lost the machete,
I didn't see him anymore.
"He was looking for me when it started to rain very hard and I had to leave.
and I had to leave.
I looked for it for a long time, but I couldn't find it.
You're sure?
"Let me think."
"When I saw Mr. Miyasaka's body,
"I had a strange feeling,
as if... as if something didn't connect."
Oh!
Ah, Mr. Okita, when we went to Mr. Miyasaka's room,
the camera was recording, wasn't it?
Eh?
Yes, I started recording for the "making of"...
so I went into his room.
So...
from the moment you found Mr. Miyasaka's dead body,
everything that happened in the room is recorded.
If we go through the footage,
maybe we could find some clues, don't you think?
I'm sorry, but I couldn't bear it,
seeing Yuya's corpse!
Conan, please,
think that the Miki is very affected by Mr. Miyasaka's death.
Think about it hi.
D'accord.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
"Who here is the murderer of Mr. Miyasaka?"
"They all had motive to kill him."
"In Takayama he owed him money because of his gambling."
"It's possible that after killing him
"He made the Okita go to Miyasaka's room to frame him
and make him believe that he is the murderer."
"The Okita was angry at Miyasaka
because he made her do dangerous scenes."
"Maybe he had died, and then made it look like he had discovered the body."
"The Saeko was jealous

because of the relationship they had in Miyasaka and the Miki."
"Her makeup bottle was at the crime scene."
"In Yamamoto hated in Miyasaka because he beat her."
"It's possible that it's not true, that he lost the machete."
"Be that as it may, the murderer is here, among us,
at the boarding house."
But I know

How much longer do we have to stay, locked up here?
And how the hell do you want him to escape, from a remote island in the middle of a storm?
It is not me, who has murdered him.
Wow, Takayama, I see you're really worried about the police coming, huh?
"I no longer have the strange feeling I had the first time I saw him."
That the murderer just escaped!
"Wow, I finally know what I was intrigued about."
"Don't miss the next episode:
'Shooting a promotional video (part two)'."
