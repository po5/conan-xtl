Mother!
What are you doing?
Stay away, Ran!
Oh!
Aaaaah!
(gasps)
It was a nightmare.
(Eri) Really?
You dreamt that I was shot with a gun?
(Laughs) I missed you calling me at this hour!
It is that I was worried!
Lawyers have enemies.
There are always criminals who have a grudge against you, right?
Do not worry so much, Ran.
You have these funny nightmares
because you're always going up and down investigating all kinds of crimes.
It doesn't matter!
I'm glad you're all right.
One other thing, Mother, before I forget!
"In this nightmare I had, you're a little younger than you are now."
What a face you have!
You mean I'm already looking like a grandmother?
Ha-ha-ha!
Hey, I didn't say that!
I didn't mean to offend you, woman.
It's better this way!
Well, see you tonight at 7 o'clock.
Father and Conan are also looking forward to seeing you.
(Think) "How strange! Maybe he remembers..."
Good morning, Conan.
What happened?
Why are you up so early?
Ah.
Nothing happened at all... And I'm sorry I woke you up.
"Now I'm falling for it! We're having dinner with Ran's mother tonight."
"That woman makes me so nervous. What a stick!"
DETECTIVE CONAN
"The fourteenth victim."
My name is Shinichi Kudo and I'm a detective.
One day, I went to an amusement park with Ran Mouri,
a good classmate and even better friend,
and I witnessed a suspicious exchange
between two men dressed in black.
I was so focused on observing those individuals,
that I didn't notice another one behind me.
He made me swallow a poison and, when I woke up....
(Conan voice)... I was a little boy again!
If those evildoers find out that Shinichi is still alive,
they will want to kill me, and I will put everyone around me in danger.
Dr. Agasa recommended that I hide my identity.
When the Ran asked me what my name was,
I told him, without much thought, that I called myself Conan Edogawa.
Since Ran's father is also a detective,
I decided to go and live with them,
to try to get information
about the criminals who had changed my life.
But in Kogoro he's a small-time detective,
so I was left with no choice but to impersonate him
and solve a lot of cases
with my incredible powers of deduction.
Thanks to me, Mouri is now world famous in Kogoro.
Sometimes, life is like that....
I impersonate Kogoro
thanks to two inventions designed by Dr. Agasa.
The first is... this!
The anesthetic dart clock!
As soon as you press this button,
it fires an anesthetic dart
that can... put a person to sleep for a few minutes.
The second great invention is the bow tie that changes the voice.
All I have to do is adjust the frequency by turning these two knobs,
and I can imitate any kind of voice, adult or child.
The ultradynamic slippers are a lethal invention.
They stimulate the most important points of my feet by means of electromagnetic waves.
by means of electromagnetic waves
and give me an extraordinary, immense strength.
The turbo skateboard is a very useful device for chasing criminals.
And another very sophisticated invention is the megaresistents suspenders.
When you press the buckle, the rubber stretches a lot.
They are really fantastic!
Actually, I still don't know who those men in black were,
but there are many more cases waiting for me!
And even though I've shrunk, my brain hasn't changed a bit,
I'm still a great detective!
Listen to this.
Will you eat this one too, Genta?
What I eat is my business, you stay out of it!
Only old people can eat chocolate like this.
What?
Are you serious?
(Thinking) "He's pulling your leg! I'm starting to get sick of waiting."
Ah!
Hey, look, look!
Conan and I are a perfect match!
You mean it works well, this thing, Ayumi?
Don't talk nonsense, Genta!
Don't you know that these seer machines never tell the truth?
Do you?
Well, now I'll test it by putting "Conan".
Born on May 4th...
"I don't remember asking you to tell me the future, but wow..."
Surely this refers to Conan and me!
(At the same time) A type A relationship?
A?
"But this machine is older than Methuselah!"
Guys, what does this mean by A?

The letter "A" always comes before the letter "B",
and it means that, if you don't shrimp...
Would you like some fried shrimp?
If they have garlic in them, we won't be able to make a kiss.
(At the same time) What?!
Sorry I'm late, guys!
I overslept.
(At the same time) It's about time!
You've kept us waiting, eh?
Sorry about that!
-Ooooh! -Ooooh!
- (Genta) It's awesome! - (Ayumi) How many planes!
Look at it!
Let you make this helicopter look ballsy.
-It will be sensational!
What a pity! What a pity what?
It says here that, in order to get into helicopters,
you have to do more than fourth grade.
Oh, what a drag!
"I feel sorry for them."
"When I was in fifth grade,
"I got sick of practicing with flight simulators."
Since he can't get into helicopters,
I'll tell you a very nice story.
Guys!
This story will be longer than a day without bread.
Don't worry, we'll distract him a little.
There is a character from Greek mythology, his name is Pegasus...
Attention!
A riddle!
You could wait for me to finish!
Three people decide to form a partnership.
The first was born on January 1,
the second was born on April 1st and the third on May 5th.
Let's see if you can guess what they named the association!
It is the name of an animal that flies, like the mythical horse Pegasus.
A flying animal, you say?
Mm...
Conan!
You've already guessed it, maybe?
Oh, so much!
Just add up the 3 dates of birth.
The birth dates?
-Born on January 1st, April 1st and May 5th.
October 7th? Yes!
The "group of seven out of ten".
How?
This, in Japanese, we pronounce it "to-na-kai", "reindeer".
And reindeer are the animals that carry Santa's sleigh.
Correct answer!
I was sure you got it right!
Look, people!
Isn't that the Eimeria Shishido, that one?
How strong, nanos! How loud, nanos!
(Doorbell rings: ding-dong)
-Thank you very much, madam. Next reader, please.
Apa!
Here you are, Miss.
Thank you very much, Mr. Nishina!
I am a big fan of yours.
I hope you continue to write books like this.
Eh?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I'm glad you're so interested in what I write.
Thank you so much!
He's much more handsome in person than in pictures.
I like him a lot, this kind of man.
You're a case, Sonoko!
This chick drives like an animal!
What if it's...!
Yes, that's her!
It's Nana Osanai, the model!
Sorry, you know women don't interest me at all.
Shall we go for coffee? Eh... Yes.
What time are you meeting your mother?
Seven o'clock.
This time it's your turn too, to organize everything?
Wow!
It's always up to you to arrange everything!
How long has it been since your mother left home?
10 years ago?
Yes.
She left when I was 7.
"She always argued a lot with my father."
They say they separated because they were incompatible.
And then your mother...
began her brilliant career as a lawyer.
Your father, on the other hand, left the police force,
even though he was an inspector,
"and became a totally mediocre private detective."
Yes!
Now your father is quite a well-known detective,
but if he didn't have you as his assistant,
he would have ended up solving cases involving children who make bells.
Don't be exaggerated, Sonoko!
What is true
is that the mother has been better at waking up than the father.
I'm here!
Hello, Conan!
Come on!
You're not dressed yet, Mr. Kogoro?
He said he was going to play cards with his friends...
and he's been playing all afternoon.
What a drag!
Why do we have to go to dinner with your mother tonight?
Please don't complain so much and hurry up a bit!
(TV: woman) "We went to Mr. Katsuyoshi Asahi's house today,
"the owner of Aqua Crystal,
"a water park opening soon in Tokyo Bay."
"Next, let's hear what this famous businessman has told us."
Eh? Run, you fool!
Eh?
Oops!
I'm going to change!
Excuse me, mother!
We've been stalling a bit.
Don't worry about it.
I imagine it must have been the fault of someone
who spent the whole afternoon playing cards.

"This woman has a prodigious intuition."
"I always have to be very careful what I say in front of him."
Hello, Conan.
How's it going? Uh... Well, Mrs. Eri.
You can't deny that you're a knucklehead at heart, Tsuji!
-Gee!
But it's in Mouri!
Tsuji!
What a surprise!
Who's this guy?
A famous detective.
Ah!
The famous Mouri!
Kogoro Mouri!
Yes.
I'm private detective Kogoro Mouri.
About that, Tsuji, may I introduce you to my family?
My wife, Eri, my daughter, Ran...
and Conan, a boy who lives out of a hat at home.
"A boy who lives in a cap? What a way to introduce me!"
Nice to meet you, Eri.
I used to play on your husband's amateur golf team, me.
By the way, Tsuji,
Thursday not the other one is the start of the Pan American Open, isn't it?
Yes, sir, the Pan American Open!
I have been training for a year for this great championship.
This year my goal is to be,
at least in the top 10!
Hopefully that will be the case.
Yes, but from time to time I also need to relax a little bit...
Tomorrow I'm going on a helicopter tour with these girls.
In Tsuji, among many other things, he has a helicopter.
And the ball himself.
And you know what?
Sunday I will also take a ride in the air.
If you would like to join me, you are all invited.
Of course I am!
I'm in! You bet!
Hurray!
I'm sorry, I'd be afraid, I have vertigo.
It's better that we leave it for another day.
What a pity!
Okay, as you wish.
"Party pooper!"
This man's name is Sawaki.
He's an acquaintance of my parents.
They met when they were young.
Why is he wearing this grape pin?
It's the emblem of sommeliers, Conan.
A sommelier is a person who tastes wine,
a wine expert, like Mr. Sawaki.
And that thing he wears around his neck?
It's called "catavinos".
It is a tool he uses to taste the different types of wine.
Now you've really made me stand still!
I read about it in a book by Nishina.
Red wine, at room temperature,
and white wine and ros√© should be served chilled.
There are many people who say so, yes,
but the temperature of the wine should be what each person prefers.
It is perfect.
A good smooth red wine also tastes delicious,
when drunk a little chilled.
When a wine is served cool,
the important thing is that the point of acidity is disguised.
How curious!
I didn't realize that the Ran...
is already old enough to be interested in gastronomy.
This means that we are getting older too,
even if we don't like it very much.
You can tell.
For the time being, it looks like my parents won't fight.
Conan!
Didn't they teach you to dry yourself with a napkin when you eat?
It's all the same, it's all right.
Wait, man.
Don't move.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
(Children) A type A relationship?
Ah...!
What a job he gives, this kid!
Thank you. (Children)
It's delicious.
The food and wine here are as delicious as ever.
-And so much!
What do you remember? MM?
The first time we came here for dinner, 15 years ago,
he brought me a very special gift.
Some Zigoba chocolates, which is the favorite brand.
We went for a walk in Beika Park and ate them all.
Yes, exactly.
If it isn't Towako!
Oh... But who the hell is that guy?
I'd say it's Peter Ford.
He presents a show on I don't know what channel.
Oh, shit!
And what's Towako doing with this clown?
(Eri) Who's this Towako?
The owner of a bar in Ginza.
She always treats me very well, this girl.
It's late, I have to go.
But it's early, mother!
Come home, we'll make some coffee!
Oh!
Sorry, Ran, but I have a lot of work to do.
Thank you for everything.
Oh, Mother!
Oh, Mother!
How tactless!
Oh!
You've distracted me and I don't know where Towako has gone, now!
"What a way to make a fool of yourself!"
(Man) Come in!
(Genta) Jusan Megure?
It reads "Juzo".
(Genta) Sure!
He-he-he!
It's just that in Genta it's kind of a borrido.
"Gee, I didn't know Inspector Megure's name was 'Juzo'."
Well, if it isn't in Mouri!
But it's in Mouri!
There was no need for you guys to come see me, you're too kind.

We had to go shopping,
but we got word and came right away.
How are you feeling, Inspector Megure?
Fortunately, the arrow did not hit any vital organs,
so the wound is not very serious,
but he will have to stay in the hospital for a few more days.
-Good morning, Inspector.
Why do you always wear your hat?
These... peeping toms want to know everything.
He must be very bald.
Maybe he has a huge lump in his shell!
We are almost certain
that the assailant has used a crossbow.
At the moment, we still don't know whether the individual fired at random...
or if he knew that the man in front of him was Inspector Megure
and attacked her with full knowledge of the facts.
Hey, Mr. Inspector.
You were carrying a gun, weren't you?
-What do you mean, you let the bad guy get away?
-I didn't have the gun on me, because I was out for sport, you fools!
But even if I had been carrying the gun
and tried to chase the criminal,
I'm not as good a shot as Kogoro Mouri, me.
What?
I didn't know my father was a good shot!
He was one of the best marksmen in the entire Tokyo police force.
"What a surprise! Even the denied ones have hidden hits."
By the way, we found a very rare object....
the place from where the crossbowman fired the projectile.
Look.
This one.
What's this? It looks like some kind of ancient dagger.
"Wow! I've seen this somewhere else, me! What does it look like?"
-Good morning. -Good morning.
What a pretty needle.
Mrs. Kisaki.
I've written down your calls in the phone book.
And I found this in the mailbox in the stairwell.
Look at this.
They're Zigoba chocolates!
They're Swiss chocolates, your favorite brand, aren't they?
(Thinking) "I know who sent me."
I was a little surprised that there was no note from the sender.
Don't worry, he already knows I know who it is.
Oh!
Bring me some water!
Water!
Oh!
Mrs. Kisaki!
How is she, my mother?
Don't worry, she'll recover soon.
We pumped her stomach right away and she's out of danger.
That's good!
Were they poisoned, the chocolates?
Yes.
They contain some kind of pesticide.
Mother!
Mother....
Eri.
Hello, Kogoro.
You've come to see me, too?
How are you, Mrs. Eri?
And you too, Conan!
I'm fine, thank you.
We want you to spend the rest of the day at the hospital
to make sure he's progressing favorably.
Yes, you'd better stay here.
First it was Inspector Megure and now, my wife.
What if it wasn't a coincidence?
She felt sick so she bit into the bonbon?
Yes.
And they found the box in your office mailbox, sir.
They are Zigoba!
And there's a flower, the wrapping paper!
And if it was... the same, the aggressor?
Wow!
This flower...
"Where have I seen it? It looks familiar."
(Agasa) How is it that a person as prudent as her
ate a poisoned bonbon?
(Shinichi voice) It's just that we all went to dinner together the other day,
and Ran's mother got angry with her ex-husband.
And she must have thought I was sending her the chocolates to apologize.
I understand.
There, that's settled, kid.
(Glass: brittle)
Who was it?!
Who was it, the hooligan?!
Doctor Agasa!
Do not open the door!
What? (glass shatters)
Oooh!
Doctor Agasa!
Don't suffer for me, Shinichi.
Follow him!
But...
Follow him, Shinichi!
Don't let him get away!
"Where must he have run off to?"
"The Ayumi and Genta live very close to here."
Let's go!
Ah!
It's Conan!
A black mototerreny?
What is it, a black full-color mototerreny?
It is!
A black all-terrain motorcycle, Genta!
We've seen it, Conan!
Thank you!
So, it's gone to the left.
(horns honking)
Conan!
I've seen it, it's turned right, it's going towards Beika station!
(Horns honking) All right!
I must get there before him!
I've got you, criminal!
You won't get away from me!
I won't let you out of my sight!
Careful, madam, if you fall, you'll hurt yourself.
Thank you, my boy.
"What's this?"
"Ah! Sure! Now I fall!"
(Kogoro) Letters ?!

The swift attacks the victims
based on the cards of the French deck.
The first victim was Inspector Megure.
His first name, Juzo, writes as the number 13,
which is the king of spades.
And the weapon carried by the king of spades is the same shape
as the dagger found at the scene.
Ran's mother, by surname, is called Kisaki, which means "queen."
Therefore, for this type, she represents the queen of spades.
The white flower worn by the queen of spades
is like the paper flower that came with the box of chocolates.
It is true, it is very similar!
And why does the Agasa have the number 11?
It is called Hiroshi Agasa.
"Hiroshi" is written with a symbol that, when broken down, forms the number 11.
It corresponds to the jack of spades.
In the past, the jack represented a soldier,
that's why he carries this strange sword.
They are identical.
You are absolutely right.
But why these cards?
And why precisely the spades?
Spades are related to death.
Just as hearts symbolize love,
diamonds are wealth
and clubs represent fortune, luck.
Then, the crossbowman tries to kill in descending order,
--starting with 13 and ending with 1...
a series of people who have a number included in their name.
And all of them... are related to you, Kogoro.
Who could it be, this man?
I don't know, we got the license plate of the motorcycle,
but it turns out it's stolen.
-Mr. Inspector! -Mr. Inspector! -What are you doing here?
I was told that the last victim was Dr. Agasa.
He was supposed to come and see.
But, Inspector... How's the wound?
Don't worry, it won't reopen.
I heard what he said.
The swift we're looking for is Joe Murakami.
Joe Murakami?
Who is he, Inspector?
He's a guy who used to work as a croupier in a casino.
"Ten years ago, he committed a murder."
"Last week he was granted parole."
What exactly does a croupier do?
A dealer is the person who deals cards in casinos.
A photo of Joe Murakami 10 years ago.
In Murakami!
Maybe so.
I wouldn't be surprised if he wanted to take revenge on me.
Why would he want revenge?
Because it was me, who stopped him.
But, Father!
It was simply the job you had to do as an inspector.
I know, but...
I've heard about this case, too, at the police station.
After it was in the hands of the authorities, in Murakami...
Stop it, Shiratori.
Don't talk anymore!
But... why didn't he attack me first, then?
If he wanted revenge on me, he should have tried to kill me.
He's going slowly to make you suffer.
He wants to provoke you to react, Kogoro.
Do you have any acquaintances with the number 10 symbol in their first or last name?
This person could be the next victim!
The number 10 is read... "to"... Oh!
"The Towako Okano!"
-Endavant. -Go ahead.
Look!
Mr. Mouri!
Oh.
Miss Towako!
Luckily, she's in top form!
Of course she is.
Is there a problem?
Inspector Shiratori,
when we were at the hospital you wanted to tell us something, didn't you?
How? When we were talking about Mr. Murakami.
Ah, that!
It's no secret.
I think you might know it too.
I heard it from some classmates from another class.
"Ten years ago, when Mr. Mouri was working in the police force,
"He often teamed up with Megure."
"And they arrested Joe Murakami, who had committed a murder."
"While they were interrogating him at the police station,
"In Murakami said he had to go to the bathroom."
"Mr. Mouri and the inspector
"They ordered an officer there to go with him...
"And they stood waiting in front of the interrogation room."
"Then, Ran, you and your mother arrived."
"They were bringing clean clothes to Mr. Mouri."
"At that time, an incident occurred."
In Joe Murakami had taken the gun from the officer guarding him,
taking advantage of a distraction, while they were in the washroom.
I remember!
I remember that day...
Bring me a car!
If not, this woman is going straight to hell!
Mother! Ran!
Don't come any closer!
Mouri.

What are you worried about?
You are very worried.
It's all right, don't worry.
(Women: laugh)
Oh... Pretty...!
"Mr. Kogoro shot your wife?"
That's right!
How could I have forgotten that?
(Shiratori) I guess he tried to erase it from his memory.
But... How did he think of shooting, my father?
He had absolute confidence in his aim.
He was convinced he would hit the target without touching the hostage.
But he missed by a few centimeters and wounded his mother.
There was a lot of commotion in the apartment,
when it became known that Mr. Mouri had fired the shots
without taking the hostage into account.
"Soon after, his father quit his job."
He left the police.
(Phone)
Hello?
(Shinichi voice) "Hello, Ran! How are we doing?"
Shinichi!
Dr. Agasa gave me a summary of the situation.
Things have gotten pretty complicated.
You called me to tell me this, Shinichi?
Where are you?
Come back right away!
I'm sorry, I have a pile of cases to solve,
and I can't come back at the moment.
Yeah... Don't be discouraged, woman!
Dr. Agasa and the inspector will keep you informed.
If I discover anything that might help to clarify the facts,
I'll let you know right away.
You... you should shoot, Shinichi?
Finally, I understood why my mother left home...
and left my father.
Yes, it seems that in Kogoro he shot your mother.
As good a shot as he was, he could have...!
You know what?
I don't trust my father anymore.
You wouldn't do that, would you, Shinichi?
"I don't know... I don't know, Ran."
What?
Hey, the fact is your father shot your mother,
but you know the truth is often more than just the facts.
What's your point?
I don't understand you, now, Shinichi!
At the moment, I guess that's all I can tell you.
Don't worry, Ran.
"Goodbye!" Oh!
Just a moment!
Shinichi!
Shinichi!
Actually...
Inspector, I'll watch the emergency exit.
Just a moment, Mouri!
Mouri!
When there's a woman in danger, he's capable of risking his life.
"In the end, Mr. Kogoro didn't sleep at home."
"If Joe Murakami were the aggressor," he said,
"What need would he have to leave so many clues
"that point directly at him?"
"Maybe he wants to challenge Mr. Kogoro and all the police."
"But how can he know who Mr. Kogoro's friends and acquaintances are.
"if he just got out of jail?"
"He even knows...
"What Ran's mother's favorite brand of chocolates is!"
"Hiroki Tsuji! Tsuji..."
Hiroki Tsuji?
The golf player?
(Phone) "Yes. It was Conan, who noticed it."
"To write his surname, the symbol for the number 10 is used!"
Tsuji.
It's true!
It could be!
I just called Mr. Tsuji to let him know,
but he left for the heliport half an hour ago.
Okay, beautiful!
Notify headquarters.
The target to protect is not Miss Towako, but Tsuji!
Yes, Inspector!
We'll go too, Conan!
We're going, Mouri!
Where are we going?
Do you want breakfast already?
Father!
Mm?
Ran, Conan!
What are you doing here?
What questions, Father!
We've come for this case we're just as interested in as you are!
After all, I am your daughter!
So it seems that this individual is in the business of assaulting friends,
family and acquaintances of Mouri.
That's right.
From number 13, in descending order.
The next is number 10,
and that means you are in danger.
Ideally, you should let this helicopter tour run.
Nothing will happen!
But, if you want to make sure, you and Mouri can accompany me.
No, thank you!
You know I have vertigo.
Speaking of which, where do you plan to land?
At Tokyo airport.
But I won't be going in a straight line.
When did you file the flight plan, Mr. Tsuji?
I filed it the day before yesterday, at the airport offices.
Inspector Megure, it's possible that in Murakami...
is waiting for the victim at the point of arrival, don't you find?
You are right!
You have to go right away to Tokyo airport by car.
You're right!

And you and I will go by helicopter, to secure the game!
What a ?!
I know, Ran, but something back home.
You know?
But if... Okay, okay, okay.
Inspector!
I'd rather accompany you in Shiratori and go by car.
You won't escape!
Let me go to the bathroom first!
Aaaaah!
Inspector!
I'm too young to die!
Get in!
We'll die together, man! No!
I don't want to die in here!
I'm leaving, Miss Ran.
Come on, Conan, we're going home.
Oh... Where is he?
Oh, my God!
One mattress, two mattresses...
Is it a spell not to fall, this?
Conan! What are you doing here?
How did you get up here?
I've always wanted to be co-pilot in a real helicopter!
Welcome to the control cabin.
Soon we will fly over Beika's neighborhood, your neighborhood.
Hurray!
How nice!
What's up!
It's too late to turn back now.
It must remain.
If you do the animal, I'll throw you out the window, Conan!
(Kogoro: call)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Thinks) "You can't see anything strange here."
What are you looking at, kid?
Take advantage of the helicopter and admire the scenery, man!
What's wrong with him? Nothing, nothing, take it easy.
Earlier I was watching him and I saw that he was putting drops in his eyes.
Do you often do that?
Yes, especially when I have to take the car...
or when I have to fly the helicopter.
We are approaching Beika's neighborhood.
Yes!
It's true!
Look, Mouri!
From here you can see your house!
I'd rather not look!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Are you alright?
My eyes hurt so much!
I can't open them!
But what does it say? "The eye drops!"
(At the same time) This means that...
(They call)
Watch out!
We're veering to the left!
Mo-Mouri, tell me you know how to fly helicopters!
How do you want me to tell you something like that!
"We can't keep flying like this."
"We have to find a space big enough to land!"
"The Teitan elementary school! Let's go!"
What are you doing?!
We'll land in the schoolyard,
you control the pedals so we can maneuver!
No!
Do not do nonsense, you want to kill us, fool?
Do not suffer.
As a child, I practiced a lot with flight simulators, me.
As a child?
What are you, now?!
Mr. Tsuji!
If we go on like this, we'll crash!
You must help me!
Let's give it a try!
Come on, let's go!
No!
You're serious?
We want 40 knots, right now.
Come on, let's go!
Yeah, let's go!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Altitude, 200 feet.
Speed, 30 knots.
Press the right pedal!
We've got the schoolyard right in front of us.
500 meters to go!
(Intercom) "What do you feel me, Genta? Genta!"
Hey, Conan!
I'm about to make an emergency landing with a helicopter.
Everybody get out of the yard! With a helicopter?
Get out of here right now!
I'm bringing down a helicopter!
(shouting)
"We have to land!"
We're turning left!
Press harder on the pedal!
Alert!
We have lost control!
Oops!
What a bump!
And Conan is inside the helicopter?
We're saved!
We're out, Conan!
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tsuji?
There's a fuel leak! What the hell?!
The helicopter has exploded!
Wrong!
It sure was expensive.
The rotor alone must be worth at least 10 million yen.
And how many plates of elvers are these?
(Agasa) I'm glad there were no injuries!
(Genta) But, doctor, Conan has a lot of bar!
He has piloted only one real helicopter!
-That doesn't matter, now!
We were all about to die!
By the way, Mouri,
the eye drops you put on Tsuji before takeoff contained a mydriatic drug
contained a mydriatic drug instead of vitamins.
Mydriatic?
It is a product used to dilate the pupil.
It's good in cases of pseudomyopia.
I see what you mean.
That's why she was so dazzled by the sunlight.
She has put some drops
which are used to treat an eye disease called uveitis.
Uveitis? I've never heard of that.
The normal eye drops take 5 minutes to work,
but the effects wear off very quickly.
In contrast, eye drops made to treat uveitis take a long time to work,
but the effects can last for several hours.

A few hours?
In some patients,
the pupil may be dilated for as long as 10 to 15 days.
Such a long time?
But the Pan American Open starts on Thursday!
He will be blind for the whole week!
He will have no choice but to give up participating in the Open.
When do you think the aggressor has changed the jar of drops?
If I am not mistaken....,
"This morning, Mr. Tsuji took the car out of the garage...
"and put on the drops."
"Then he heard the sound of breaking glass..,
"He left the eye drops in the tray next to the gearshift.
"And returned to the house."
"Someone had broken a window pane with a stone."
Wait a minute!
When Dr. Agasa was attacked, the same thing happened!
Mr. Tsuji thought it was a child from the neighborhood,
asked the maid to pick up the broken glass.
and got back in the car.
But the stone was not thrown by a child, but by the crossbowman!
Taking advantage of the fact that Mr. Tsuji had entered the house,
he changed the eye drops in the car for another one.
Yes, it is very likely.
Inspector.
I am totally convinced that the suspect is Joe Murakami.
Look what I just found!
It's the 10 of spades!
Mouri!
The next victim will be number 9!
Do you know anyone who has the number 9 symbol in their name?
I can't think of anyone right now.
But number 8 I know who it is.
Number 8? Mr. Sawaki, the sommelier.
His first name is Kohei.
And Kohei contains the symbol for the number 8: the syllable "ko".
So, for the time being, let's see this Sawaki end.
If I have not misunderstood, dear Mouri,
Joe Murakami is attacking one by one all your acquaintances
to take revenge for what you did to him a few years ago.
Still I have to say that you don't seem too worried, you.
Man, it's just that my name is number 5;
there's still a few more numbers to go before he attacks me.
(Kogoro: laughing uproariously)
Eh?
There's only wine here.
Yes, because it's a wine refrigerator.
It keeps the bottles at the right temperature for the wine.
It holds a lot of bottles!
Mr. Sawaki's parents have an orchard in Yamanashi Prefecture
and a wine cellar
that must have more than 100 bottles of the best vintages.
-Right, Kohei? -That's right.
They keep them there for me
for when I decide to open my own winery.
I am a great wine enthusiast,
who would let me take a closer look at these bottles?
Of course I would.
There's a hole in the parquet!
Did you hurt yourself?
I dropped a bottle on the floor the other day.
Be careful, Conan, you're not wearing slippers.
Margaux, Lafite and Haut Brion.
They are wines of extraordinary quality!
By the way, Sawaki, what was the name of that wine you said was your treasure?
Petro...
Wow!
What's in a bottle of Chateau Petrus?
"Chateau Petrus is Poirot's drinking wine.
"while solving the case of 'Death on the Nile.'"
I had a bottle, but I drank it the other day.
I thought this wine should be left to mature for several years,
before opening it.
Yes, but I didn't have enough patience.
Mr. Sawaki, how about talking about wines later?
You should tell us what you were planning to do today.
Well, then, do you know Mr. Katsuyoshi Asahi?
He is a very famous businessman
who has several restaurants in Tokyo itself.
-I do know him,
we met once to accept an order from him.
I heard that he is the owner of Aqua Crystal,
a water park that will open soon in the bay.
And so much.
Mr. Asahi offered me
the address of the restaurant that will be in Aqua Crystal.
We are meeting today at 3 o'clock to talk about it.
Katsuyoshi Asahi?
Asahi? Just a moment!
Number 9!
Asahi wears number 9!
This means that the next victim will be Mr. Asahi.
But he only asked me to look for the cat,
which was lost.
We hardly know each other.
But maybe Murakami thinks they're friends.
Like keeping an eye on Mr. Sawaki,
we could accompany him to Aqua Crystal.
Is that okay with you, Sawaki? Of course, I don't mind.
Ran, you and Conan should... Come along.
What?

Conan and I will also accompany you.
Stop it, Ran!
You have to understand that this is no game!
And I understand, Father!
Because of you many lives are in danger!
Can't you see that?
I'm not going to stay at home waiting for you!
"Ran!"
Here we have the famous Aqua Crystal.
Wow!
The facilities are impressive!
(Car: approaching)
"Eh? What a way to drive!"
It was a little crooked for me.
But it was pretty spectacular.
(Car:) Miss!
This is very dangerous what you've done!
-What do you mean? -You just know it!
Hello, Nana!
How come you've come too?
What a surprise, Shishido!
The Asahi made you come, too?
Excuse me, Miss, may I know who you are?
What is it?
How come, you don't know who I am?
It's Nana Osanai, Mr. Inspector.
A very famous model.
These 3 men are, from left to right,
writer Nishina, photographer Eimeria Shishido and...
Peter Ford, at your service.
You two are policemen, I presume.
And you must be the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
What?
How funny!
You're that famous detective?
Ha-ha!
It's the first time I've seen you in person!
I have to take a picture with this scourge of criminals!
(Kogoro) I smile?
"He's already forgotten that he almost ran us over."
May I introduce Mr. Sawaki, who is a sommelier,
Miss Ran, Mr. Mouri's daughter, and Conan Edogawa.
Hey!
You're that girl who asked me to continue writing.
Yes!
I thought she wouldn't remember!
Beautiful women are like fine wines:
they always leave you with a good memory.
"Hey, stop the car!"
I guess you've come to see Mr. Asahi, too.
We're meeting at 3 o'clock.
-You've also arranged for me at 3:00. -Me, too.
Inspector, did something happen?
Yes, it turns out that...
It's almost 3 o'clock!
We can't be kept waiting.
Mm?
Yes, you're right.
Come on, let's go.
We can go to the restaurant now.
"Come to think of it, the four people here..."
The only way to access Aqua Crystal is this monorail.
Oops!
Where is it, the driver?
It seems to me that all we have to do is push this button.
This whole complex is really impressive.
I see... you have vertigo strength too, Mr. Nishina.
Don't you?
No.
I don't have vertigo.
But the water scares me a lot.
I can't swim.
Well!
Don't suffer, we all have our weak points.
"The fact is that your father shot your mother,
"But you know the truth is often more than just the facts."
(Exclamations of admiration)
(Nana: river) This looks like an aquarium!
But it's a restaurant anchored at the bottom of the sea!
Oh, it's a Ferrari F40!
But it's a Ferrari F40!
How did they bring it here?
Strange, it seems he's not here, Mr. Asahi.
Yes, I'm surprised he hasn't come out to greet the guests.
Maybe he's already attacked it, in Murakami!
Mm?
What do you mean, maybe he's already attacked you in Murakami, Inspector?
Ah, I forgot.
I'll tell you all about it now.
In the meantime, I'm going around here, Inspector Megure.
I'll walk with you.
Very well, then.
Gentlemen, for security reasons,
keep your backs against the wall.
This is the emergency exit.
It's the only door that's locked.
(Sawaki) It's clear to us.
We're in a lot of trouble.
We haven't seen anything strange, Inspector.
According to this theory, I must be victim number 6.
Why is that?
"Shishido" is written with the symbol for the number 6.
(At the same time) Ooh! That's right!
And the other three guests also have a number.
Miss Nana is number 7, Mr. Nishina is number 2,
and "Ford" is pronounced the same as number 4: four.
Of course!
Here are all the numbers we were missing, except 1 and 3.
3 is also... It's right in front of you, Mouri.
Mm?
Don't tell me that 3...
My first name, Ninzaburo, is number 3.
Nin... Zabur?
But I don't know who it is, number 1.
Shinichi.

The number 1 might have something to do with the word "Shinichi".
Do you mean that in Kudo it will also come like this?
I don't think so, it's just a feeling.
Nothing more.
"It's possible."
"If I hadn't shrunk,
"This case would surely have caught my attention...
"And I would have come to investigate."
"This means that number one is me!"
Gentlemen, I have to ask you...
if you have or have had any relationship with Joe Murakami.
Of course you haven't!
He is a murderer!
I don't know him either.
I do know him.
Before writing novels,
I made a living from writing chronicles about murders and other crimes.
And I published an article about Murakami.
I know him too.
I once took some photos of him
that were published in a compilation called "Portraits of Murderers".
Did you have any problems with him? I don't remember anything specific.
What's wrong, miss?
And you say this man was released from prison 8 days ago?
Yes. I'm lucky I don't know him.
What's that?
Come on, don't take everything so seriously, guys!
Let's not talk anymore, about this wretch.
Rather... we should talk about you!
You wrote a pathetic book called "Restaurants of Paris".
Of all the restaurants you recommend, kid,
there's not one of them that's worth it!
You have a sense of taste in the soles of your feet!
What?
You know perfectly well that's not true, that!
-If it's not true, prove it-m'ho.-It's not necessary.
I brought a bottle of wine as a gift for Mr. Asahi.
Series able to guess which winery it is from?
You want me to identify a wine by taste, only?
Understood.
It has a refined taste and smells of violets.
It is velvety and glides smoothly.
Napoleon liked to savor this wine.
It is a Chambertin.
(Nana: laugh outrageously)
What a failure!
I would never buy a wine that is worth thousands of yen
to give it to a guy I hardly know!
What wine is it, then?
You said you're a sommelier, right?
Yes.
Teach that poor sap to identify a wine.
It's a beaujolais.
From Moulin Nave, I think.
Correct answer!
Oh, my goodness!
This is a beaujolais?
Yes, it is.
If it is left in the barrel and matures long enough,
a beaujolais takes on the flavor
and fragrance of a high quality burgundy.
Apa, I hope this has helped you realize....
that you should stop pretending to be a gourmet.
After this exhibition, I would like a glass of wine.
We'll have a glass, then.
I'll get the bottle.
I prefer beer.
Where is it, the kitchen?
Here the costat.
D'acord...
Will you show me how it's done, man? Yes!
"Who did you say 'nano' to?"
Let's see?
Yes, there is!
Look, man!
There are also fruit juices.
Really? Really?
That's great!
"I'm no nano."
You are.
This one's for you, Ran.
Oh.
Thank you.
Oysters!
(Shishido) Mm!
Mr. Sawaki is right, it's great, this wine.
Another glass, Mr. Sawaki?
No, thank you.
Now I'll go to the water, me.
Thank you.
No beer?
I can't drink now!
In Murakami can attack at any time, we must be vigilant.
Have a juice, inspector.
You've got this one, Conan, I'm not thirsty.
Don't worry, I'll get another one in the kitchen.
Kid!
Try not to break anything, you hear?
If you're looking for mineral water, it's the last drawer of the fridge.
Yes, thank you.
I've seen some very curious spices and I wanted to try them.
The juices are the top shelf, right?
Yes.
How come, Mr. Asahi makes us wait so long?
He takes a long time.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Hey, what's the matter, Peter?
Are you not feeling well?
Don't worry, it was a joke!
"It wasn't funny to me."
Hey, Mr. Ford, now is not the time to make these jokes!
Come to think of it, gentlemen,
I still don't know why Mr. Asahi called you here.
His secretary called me.
He told me that Mr. Asahi admired me very much and wanted to meet me personally.
and that he wanted to meet me personally.
Maybe he wants to hire me
to take some photographs of this facility.
I also received a call from his secretary,
and for the same reason he did.

Well, she even sent me a beautiful gift.
It's a French nail polish, and a very expensive brand, by the way!
And what did they say to you, Mr. Nishina?
The same.
What are you doing, Nana?
I made a drawing on the wine stopper with the nail polish.
It turned out well, didn't it?
What is it?
A wild boar?
-You're impertinent, Shishido!
It's obviously a cat.
Mr. Sawaki, it's for you, that's it.
It was here, on the ground.
"Dear Kohei Sawaki. I may be a little late."
"I beg you to go to the wine cellar,
"to choose the wine you like best from the M-18 shelf.
"and share it with the other guests."
"The key is the envelope I left by the telephone at the bar."
"Thank you very much. Katsuyoshi Asahi."
"Eh? Earlier, when I bent down to pick up the cans....
"There was no paper, on the floor."
That's great!
I want to see the Asahi's cellar, too!
It would be fun for me too.
It will be very interesting, to go and do a little gossiping.
Okay, gentlemen, let's all go, then.
Oh, it's huge!
It's huge! It's, it's phenomenal!
It's so cold!
On the contrary, it's a bit warm.
In a winery, the optimum temperature is between 10 and 14 degrees Celsius,
but the thermometer reads 17 degrees.
That's a little too high.
Ah.
Look at this, inspector!
These wines are real luxury.
Roman√©e-Conti, La T√¢che, Le Paris, C√¥te R√¥tie,
Clos de Mesnil... What a collection!
Where should it be, the M-18 shelf?
It is there.
Warning!
It was a trap!
Mr. Kogoro, Inspector!
Oh! It's identical to the one they shot at me the other day!
It's identical to the one they shot at me the other day!
Inspector!
I've found the crossbow!
It's the 8 of spades!
It was Murakami, who placed it here,
and the note was also his, then!
I don't understand why he skipped the number 9 and attacked the 8.
-Eh?! - Eh ?!
What if...?
Inspector, we must try to take shelter in some corner!
Oh, my!
It's locked.
We came in here before, I think.
Yes, the entrance is the same.
If you'll wait a second, I'll get my coat.
I'll get my coat.
Eh?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Mr. Asahi!
The 9 of spades!
He has died in Murakami!
The automatic lock is activated and the door won't open!
What are you saying?
Call for reinforcements.
Damn, there's no reception!
And there's no line either.
You bastard!
Inspector, I'm going to check the emergency exit.
What the hell?!
It's blocked with cement!
This is all your fault!
You involved us in this case when we had nothing to do with it!
Yeah, what are we doing here?
As long as Murakami hasn't decided to change the order of the murdered,
the next victim will be you, Nana, you're number 7.
How stupid!
Why should I want to kill,
a man I haven't seen and don't know who he is?
But I noticed that you are restless, Nana.
What? I've noticed before.
"And you say this man got out of jail 8 days ago?"
It has nothing to do with all this mess!
I'll decide if it has something to do or not.
Tell me everything you know.
Three months ago...
Yes, that's what they say!
Eh?
(Car: the march)
I didn't get to touch,
but I got scared and took off.
How was it, the bike?
Was it an off-roader?
Mm?
It was an ordinary motorcycle.
Inspector, Miss Osanai is right.
This anecdote has nothing to do with this case.
What we have to do is try to get out of this impasse.
It's true.
If we look at the whole building, we'll find a way out.
Well, we'll look for it together, Inspector.
All right, what can we do!
Ran!
You and Conan stay here.
You too, don't move from here.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
What's taking them so long?
It can't be that they haven't found a way out yet!
Don't suffer, they'll be back here as soon as there is news.
"I'm going to investigate too."
They told you not to leave here, Conan!
Someday you'll pay dearly for your curiosity.
Wait, Ran!
Oh!
The light!
What's happened?
Why did the light go out?
"The nail polish is phosphorescent!"
Aaaaah!

Somebody help us! Don't come out of here, Nana!
"The blackout was intentional!"
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Nana!
What happened to you?
What happened?!
What was it, this scream?
Inspector! Mouri, in the automatic room!
Nana!
It's here.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nana!
What happened?
Miss Osanai! Let me through!
She's dead.
The 7 of spades and a joker!
It's him!
Murakami is hiding somewhere in the building!
My God!
We must reduce!
-Don't go alone, Mr. Mouri!
It's dangerous!
I'll go with you!
Mr. Shishido.
I beg you not to take pictures.
Why not?
Until the forensic police arrive,
you'll have to start the investigation yourself.
And I imagine it would be good for you
to have photographs of the crime scene, wouldn't it, Inspector?
Yes, that's true.
But you will hand them over to the police, won't you?
Naturally, Inspector Megure.
What I don't understand is how you saw Nana in the dark, in Murakami.
The nail polish is phosphorescent.
You could see her nails perfectly, poor thing.
Oh, my God!
I get it!
The bottle of nail polish that she told us she got as a present
has some phosphorescent product in it.
"And the nail of the middle finger?"
Inspector Megure,
look at the fingernails on the victim's left hand.
Mm?
The nail polish is gone.
Or maybe the nail's been pulled off.
I'd say maybe the artificial nail fell off.
Fake? Yes, she wears false nails.
They're accessories decorated with different designs
that are glued to the nail with glue.
Yes.
It must have come off accidentally and fell off.
Here it is!
But I don't think this has anything to do with the case.
"That's weird... Eh?"
"It's the mark on the killer's left hand."
He seems to have caught it pretty hard.
"Oh! This means... the killer is right-handed!"
"On the other hand, on Murakami... he's left-handed."
"Miss Osanai's murderer is not in Joe Murakami!"
"Wait a minute."
"The person attacking us with the crossbow..."
"Make an effort..., remember!"
"He was right-handed!"
"It's unbelievable! How could I have made such a mistake?"
Nothing at all, inspector.
We didn't find Murakami anywhere.
-We didn't find him because he may have already left the building.
I don't think he's gone.
There seems to be no way out!
Surely he must still be in here!
"No. The killer is not in Murakami. It's one of us!"
"But who? Who could have murdered Nana?"
"Come to think of it, when the individual has assaulted her..."
"He kicked the can I had left on the floor."
"And a lot of juice came out."
"When I put the can down, there was maybe more than half of it left."
"When the killer kicked it,
"He threw the juice on the ground,
"And it's very likely that he stained the edge of his pants."
"One of these four men has killed Miss Nana."
"Eh? It was him! But why?"
I'm very sorry about this, Sawaki.
Because of me, Mr. Asahi is dead...
and your project to run the restaurant has gone down the drain.
And now!
I wasn't going to accept the proposal either.
No?
No, because I've decided to quit my job as sommelier of the restaurant...
and go back to the village of my childhood.
As I am an only child, now I have to take care of my parents,
who are grown up and need me.
Gentlemen, from now on we have to be very careful in everything we do.
Especially Mr. Shishido.
I know, I know.
I'm the next victim, me, right?
Well, I'll tread lightly, but there will be a happy ending.
-Inspector, I won't be hooked either.
I'm going to walk out of here!
"Wait a minute! Could it be that...?"
Mm?
What in head doors, now, you?
I'll bring them some water in case they get thirsty.
What a fool you are!
Please don't go anywhere without telling us!
Don't you see that we don't know where he might be hiding, in Murakami?
It's the same, I don't have any symbol of any number, the name.
You are right... Here.
Here, Mr. Sawaki.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, uncle!
Bring a glass over here! Yes!

Japanese water is very good!
Ah... How fresh!
"Now I'm sure! But I don't have any proof."
"By the way, where is it, that?"
"I already have the proof I needed!"
(Pip)
(Explosion)
(Shouting)
What was that? It was a very strong explosion!
An attack! Shiratori, Mr. Shishido!
Don't let anything happen to him!
Mr. Shishido!
Where are you, Mr. Shishido?
-I'm here! -But what's he doing?
You want to get him killed?
Oh!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I'm number 2, me.
It will be a while yet before they kill me!
What did you hurt?
Are you all right? -Yes, yes...
-You mean it's my turn again? -Ah... I don't know.
Mm?
The emergency lights!
It's about time.
(Pip)
Another explosion!
(Pip) Help, help!
Help me, please, I can't swim!
Take here!
All right, man!
You swim like a fish.
"Ran! Where is he? Ran!"
"Oysters, no!"
Conan!
Where are you going?
"Ran! Where is it?"
"Ran!"
Ran, don't suffer, Ran.
Breathe easy.
"Shi... Shinichi..."
"Conan!"
"I can't! I'll use the megaresistents suspenders."
"What?! What bad luck! I'm stuck here!"
"What a mess! I'm drowning!"
"Ran! Ran, no!"
"This wheel...!"
"That's it, finally! I have to go fast."
Ran!
Hey, Ran!
Can you feel me?
Pa... pa... father...
It was Conan, who saved your life, daughter.
Thank you very much, Conan.
Eh?
You're welcome.
What's the matter with you?
It seems to me that the wound of the arrow has opened.
-What does it say now? -Look!
There!
The cards from 6 to 2 of spades!
Oh, my God!
He wants to kill us all at once!
You bastard!
I'm afraid this is a dead end,
sooner or later we'll give up our skin!
No.
We'll get out of here! How?
We'll get out through the broken window!
Of course we will!
The windows of the restaurant look directly into the sea!
I can't swim!
I'm lost!
Don't grumble so much, man!
I'll guide you to the surface.
I'll take care of the kid.
I'll get out of here on my own, thank you.
You'll come out with me, my dear.
All we need is one last effort.
And I'll go with you. Thank you...
Well, I'll... I'll be the vanguard.
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go!
Take a breath, Ran!
Hold on tight and don't let go, okay?
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Give me your hand, inspector!
-Help Ran, please! -Yes. -Yes.
We're finally saved, aren't we, Shiratori?
Yes, the danger has passed.
Nishina!
Nishina!
Come on, react!
I'll try to revive him!
I took a first aid course.
(Kogoro voice) Just a moment!
Shiratori, hurry, give him artificial respiration.
Eh... But I didn't say anything, me!
Come on, Shiratori!
Yes!
Okay, okay, okay!
Look where!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah... Again... Aaaah...
Mouri!
Inspector Megure, we've made a mistake.
The murderer is not Joe Murakami.
What are you saying, now?!
It is proven by the fact...
that both the person who shot Dr. Agasa
and the one who killed Miss Osanai are both right-handed!
Right-handed?
Mr. Nishina is already breathing!
Surely, the murderer met Joe Murakami...
when he was released from prison.
In Murakami he explained to him that he had been a croupier,
that everyone called him "Joker"...
and that I shot him in the shoulder,
and the killer decided to take advantage of all this information.
Take advantage? Yes.
The murderer realized that the names of the people he wanted to kill
and his own name were written...
with the symbols of certain numbers.
And it occurred to him
that, by relating the numbers included in the names of the victims...
with the cards of the French deck of cards,
he could divert all suspicion to Joe Murakami.
So, when he attacked me, Dr. Agasa and your wife, he attacked us just because it looked like a card,
he attacked us just because it looked like Murakami's personal vendetta?
That's right.
And what were our man's real targets?
Above all, Mr. Asahi and Miss Osanai.
But also Mr. Tsuji.

It is evident... that he intended to kill Mr. Tsuji,
so that, with the substitution of the normal bottle of eye drops for that one,
the risk of death was very high.
Tell me, Mouri!
Who is the murderer?
The murderer is here, with us.
What?
Come to think of it, Nana made a fool of you before, didn't she?
So what?
I didn't kill anyone!
No.
You are just another target.
You don't know how to swim,
and the killer chose a restaurant located in the middle of the sea
because he wanted you to drown when the window broke.
By the way, dear Shiratori.
What is the first thing you did, before reviving poor Nishina?
What is always done.
I tilted his head back
and lifted him up... to open his airway.
What would happen if a murderer made it look like he was resuscitating someone...
but, instead of opening his airway..,
...but instead of opening their airway, he plugged their nose and mouth?
The victim would suffocate!
If someone does this...
No..., no-no way!
That's right!
The murderer of Mr. Asahi and Miss Osanai
and the person who tried to kill Mr. Tsuji and Nishina is...
Kohei Sawaki!
But, Mouri, think that they tried to put an arrow in me too!
It was a little trick you had very well prepared.
You prepared it last night,
after Mr. Asahi died right here.
It was him too, who dropped that letter on the floor?
And it was him, the secretary who called us all?
Yes, Sawaki himself called you.
And he sent the phosphorescent nail polish to Nana Osanai.
And the cell phone?
What is it, his cell phone?
Probably... it's related to a taste disorder.
A taste... disorder?
A person suffering from this disease doesn't notice the taste of food, right?
That's right.
And that's the problem Mr. Sawaki has.
What is it?
Taste disorder is an atrophy
that can be caused by psychological stress or a blow to the head.
By a blow to the head?
Don't tell me that the biker
that Nana almost ran over was Mr. Sawaki!
Don't get too excited!
A few hours ago, Mr. Sawaki tasted the wine...
that Ms. Osanai brought and he got the brand right!
He was able to guess the brand by the aroma and the color.
How is this possible?
The sommelier had to rely entirely on sight and smell,
the two senses he has left,
to be able to continue working in the restaurant.
But he aspired to become a world-class expert,
and the accident dashed his dream.
So he decided to quit his job as a sommelier
and return to his parents' home.
But first he wanted to take revenge
He wanted to take revenge on those who had caused him to lose his sense of taste,
one of whom was Nana Osanai.
I imagine it must have been a very difficult time.
He was so furious
he even broke an expensive bottle of wine that he treasured.
that he kept as a treasure
the day he could start his own winery.
Is that why there is a hole in the parquet floor of his house?
But how could you come to these conclusions, Mouri?
I caught Sawaki tasting the spices from the Asahi's kitchen.
To the one I could get my hands on, there was chili powder,
"A kind of very spicy bug."
"People who, like sommeliers,
"work with their tongues,
"never eat spicy products, because they damage the palate."
That's precisely why I asked Conan
to bring us a few glasses of mineral water:
To make sure that Mr. Sawaki's taste was atrophied.
With mineral water?
The glass that Conan gave you was the only one that contained salt water.
The truth is that I drank it all without realizing it.
It's true, I suffer from a serious taste disorder, yes.
But this does not prove
that I committed the murders you accuse me of, Mouri.
I still have another proof...
which is in one of the pockets of the jacket you're wearing.
The cork stopper where Nanai has made the drawing!
Miss Osanai has had this cork in her hand
until it came off, while it was falling.
How did it end up in your pocket?
I tell you:
You attacked her from behind, but Miss Osanai turned around,
"She grabbed you by the jacket

"And he put the plug in your pocket slyly."
"In that moment of struggle,
"a fake fingernail came off and fell to the floor."
It's ironic that a murderous sommelier
was given away by the stopper of a wine bottle.
And we still have one more piece of evidence.
I'm sure the missing card... is also in your pocket.
I'm referring to the last card, the ace of spades,
that you had... reserved for Shinichi Kudo.
The ace of spades!
Friend Mouri, all these conclusions are correct.
3 months ago, one night, when I was on my way home from the restaurant,
"I nearly collided with a car and went overland."
"Immediately after the accident,
"I lost my sense of taste.
"The doctor told me that the disorder could be due to stress.
"Or a blow to the head."
"I became so desperate that I decided to quit the job
"And take revenge on Nana Osanai,
"who was responsible for the blow I received,
"and the three men who had caused me the stress,
"namely Mr. Asahi, Mr. Tsuji and Mr. Nishina."
May I know what these 3 people had done to him?
Mr. Asahi realized that wine is big business
and invested a fortune
in importing lots of very prestigious foreign wines.
But he did not know how to preserve them.
Nishina!
You dared to write a wine book pretending to be a gourmet,
and you've only managed to fica'ls him in the head to your readers lies!
Not to mention Hiroki Tsuji,
who desecrated my dignity as a sommelier!
"4 months ago,
"I went to a party that Tsuji organized at his home."
Ah... We already have it here!
All you need is the pin worn by the great sommeliers.
And the wine glass, of course.
Oh!
How elegant!
(People: laughing)
And you decided to kill him for an unimportant joke?
Unimportant?!
You can't imagine
the shame he made me go through, that ignorant!
He snatched from me in seconds all that I had achieved with effort:
my dignity, my pride, my honor as a sommelier!
He laughed at my craft and took everything from me!
And he also killed Joe Murakami?
Yes.
The day Murakami was released from prison,
we met by chance in front of Mr. Mouri's office.
"But in Kogoro he had gone out to play cards..."
I immediately thought I could take advantage of en Murakami,
I told him I was a friend of Mr. Mouri's...
and I invited him to have a drink at my place.
"At Murakami I no longer held a grudge against him, Mr. Mouri,
"even though he was the one who stopped him."
"I wanted to talk to him, just to apologize."
"And I came up with the idea of using the numbers on the cards
"to commit the murders,
"to divert suspicion and throw the police off the scent."
Joe Murakami had been drinking heavily and it didn't cost me anything to kill him.
So, you had no motive...
for assaulting Mr. Mouri and Inspector Megure!
None at all.
Why did you summon us, me and Shishido?
-You had us come here so that you'd be missing 6 and 4?
That's right...
I thought that Mr. Mouri and Inspector Shiratori,
who were 5 and 3, would want to accompany me when I came here,
to see Mr. Asahi.
I was hoping that Shinichi Kudo would also want to come.
Unfortunately, the plan didn't work out very well for me.
And didn't he think that innocent people would die
who had nothing to do with your problem?
The only purpose of the restaurant explosion was to kill in Nishina.
I don't give a damn
whether the others die or get out of this maze alive.
Once I disappear in Murakami and the water park is sunk,
the case will be shelved unsolved.
"Do you want to destroy the entire water park?!"
Mr. Sawaki, you have no escape.
Turn yourself in to the police.
Shiratori, please handcuff Mr. Sawaki right now!
(Pip)
(Shouting)
(Pip) What happened?
Watch out, Ran!
Come!
(Pip) Too late!
What?
Why did Ran take the Ran, at Sawaki?
Don't talk crazy, Mouri!
You just unmasked him!
He's the killer! What did he say I've done?
What did he say I've done?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Nobody move!
One step, and I'll kill this girl!
"What a mess!"

"The Ran is weak, it can't defend itself with a karate chop!"
Due to the explosion,
the building has lost stability and is starting to collapse!
Ran!
Where are you, Ran? It's over there!
Where are you taking her?
He wants to try to escape with a helicopter!
He's probably posing as Mr. Asahi's secretary
to send for a helicopter.
He won't get out!
Mouri, come here!
We'll stop him!
Hey, Conan, come here!
You have to run away from here immediately!
But I can't swim!
Don't worry about it!
We'll look for a plank of wood that floats
and you'll get to dry land just fine.
Come on, Shiratori! Let's go, Shiratori!
Which way do we go? Down the stairs!
They're in the elevator!
Mouri!
Follow me!
Hurry, inspectors!
Hey, Megure, are you a good shot, Inspector Shiratori?
He's as inept as I am at shooting.
(Pistol: CLEC)
What's going on here?
This is coming down!
(Pistol: CLEC) Oh!
Don't get smart and land again, come on!
May I know who this guy is?
And why is he carrying this knife?
Damn elevator!
Why doesn't it go all the way to the top, this thing?
Come down right now!
I asked for it, this chopper, man!
Emergency, emergency!
This is Aqua Crystal Heliport.
A man has taken a girl hostage and is threatening her with a knife!
And the whole park complex is sinking!
Send someone else!
Raaaaan!
Hold it right there!
If you come closer, I'll slit her throat!
Surrender, Sawaki!
Let her go, Sawaki!
Let her go or I'll shoot!
You do it yourself!
Shoot, if you're brave enough, boy!
"His hands are shaking. If you shoot, you'll touch the Ran!"
Shiratori, don't shoot.
(moans in pain)
My God, what's wrong, Inspector?
Is it the wound?
Running away with the helicopter won't do you any good!
Let go of this girl!
Quiet! Quiet!
I'm taking him away!
And I'm going to go kill in Tsuji!
To kill in Tsuji?!
Because of you she won't participate in the Open golf tournament,
haven't you hurt him enough?
Not yet!
When I've eliminated him, I'll kill myself!
And she will follow me to paradise!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
He's... he's gone crazy!
"Shinichi..., help me, Shinichi!"
"The Ran is in great danger."
"This one is capable of doing what he said!"
"If I don't do something,
"Ran won't be the only victim of this sonado, we'll all die!"
-Passa'm the gun, ara.-What?
Pass it to me!
Hey, Shiratori.
Give me the gun.
-What? -I said give me the gun!
You're kidding?
That wouldn't be a very good idea, Kogoro!
Enough talk!
Give me the pipe!
I know!
I know it!
Let the nano take it!
I'll take it?
If you don't take this gun, your friend will die!
No way!
I don't want you to put the child in danger!
No!
Bring her to me, quickly!
No!
Don't take him away!
Conan!
Don't give it to him, Conan!
Don't give it to him!
No!
That's the way I like it!
Now, take it over here!
Come on, boy!
Take this gun to me right now!
"Sure! I get it! That's why Mr. Kogoro..."
(Inaudible)
Shi...
Shinichi!
(CLEC)
(CLEC) Shit!
Get up!
Come on, Auntie!
(CLEC) Hey!
(CLICKS TONGUE) Hey!
Oh!
Ran!
"You're out of your mind, Ran!"
Now I get it!
I know why he shot, that day, Mr. Mouri!
He didn't shoot to reduce the criminal!
He shot to save the hostage!
Yes, a hostage who has a gunshot wound in one leg....
can only hinder the criminal who tries to flee from the police.
"He shot to save the mother! I didn't realize it until now."
Father!
Kohei Sawaki!
You are under arrest for murder, assault with a knife and kidnapping!
(Calling)
Let me go, I want to die!
I can't let you die.
I want you to live long enough
to realize the gravity of the crimes you've committed!
Just a little longer and we won't count it!
Mr. Kogoro, I see you no longer have any vertigo,
how come you are cured?
What?
Aaaaaaaah!
Aaaa...
(Kogoro) Let me down!
Here.
It's been going so fast, I've been really scared.
(Kogoro) Ah... (Kogoro) My God!

Fortunately, the bullet only grazed Ran's leg.
If you weren't so sharp, there would have been a tragedy.
I hope you'll forgive me.
"When we went to Hawaii that time,
"Father took me to a shooting gallery and taught me how to shoot."
"But this I can't explain."
"Poor Ran! It seems to me that I've made her suffer so much."
Inspector, take advantage of your leave to get some rest,
now that you can afford it.
Good idea, Shiratori.
Hey, hey, hey!
I don't need to take my hat off, do I?
Father, do you think Shinichi would have shot too, like you did?
I don't know.
If he had as good aim as me, maybe he would have decided to shoot, yes.
I'm sure he would have.
Oi, Shinichi? What's this?
The ace of spades, Shinichi's card.
I've been holding it in my hands the whole time.
Because I knew Shinichi would protect me, like this.
Don't think about it... In any case, the ace of spades...
...has saved me...
(At the same time) Aaaatxim!
...me.

What a ?
So, you already knew why he shot you, the father?
Of course I did!
We were a pretty normal married couple...
And the most normal thing is
for a husband to try to protect his wife, I think.
But if you knew, why did you leave home, mother?
In the evening,
your father told me the dinner was disgusting and he didn't eat it.
What?
The leg made me horribly ill,
but, as a thank you, I made an effort and made dinner.
And the very unpresentable one told me....
Useless!
If you can't cook better, you'd better go to sleep!
So we decided to separate.
(snorts)
Every time I think of him... I get in a bad mood!
Now... I understand, of course.
"He-he-he-he! After this, it will be impossible for them to make up."
"Unfortunately, the mother..."
"...has always been a terrible cook."
