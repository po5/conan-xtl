I feel so all in Secret Life!
Nocturnal red homicide, part 1
Oooh.
The Kana Amusement Group is an important company.
Mr. President, what are you talking about?
The company wants to publish an album by Gerard Tenma.
And in order to reach an agreement and sign the contract,
we will hold a private party.
What an illusion!
How nice!
Tenma will finally make his debut in Japan?
You know him, this one? Of course, man!
He is very important, in the world of French song.
He's a mysterious Japanese singer!
Nobody knows his past.
I see that you are well informed.
Since I set the date of the party,
my wife Misaki has had some unusual events happen to her.
Out of the ordinary?
They call her repeatedly and no one answers,
bouquets of roses sent to her with no return address,
and then... these letters.
Intimidating letters.
"If you don't heed my love you will fall into hell."
Just yesterday another such letter reached us.
"The ceremony of revenge will raise the curtain soon.
Have a good time at the terrifying party."
The party is in 3 days.
We can't cancel.
Can you think of who may be the author of the messages?
The elaboration of the contract has been carried out in secret.
That tringuin news of the party, apart from my wife and me,
there are only the 4 people who will attend.
"You left me, but I am still unable to forget you:
I will always keep my eyes on you.
I feel your beautiful voice and I tremble..."
What are you doing?
Gee, Father, these are the lyrics in Japanese
of Tenma's "Nocturne of Red Love"!
"Every day I'll give you a flower.
"A red rose, a marigold, a Lobel,
"and then a deep red dahlia with a loving melody.
You will be mine forever."
(Think) What do you find good in this song, la Ran?
What an illusion!
I will meet Gerard Tenma!
We have come here for work.
Work!
Get it through your head that we are the Morita family, friends of the president!
Yes, yes.
They must not know that I am an eminent detective.
He doesn't do the combing either, it'll go unnoticed.
Let's see if you learn how to behave.
That's what I should say!
You have to go by car to the front door,
like in foreign films!
Come on!
This is impressive!
This is really powerful people!
I don't know, it looks like a castle out of a horror movie.
Oh no, a storm!
Too bad, until now the weather was so nice...
Didn't you want to see Mr. Tenma? See him sleepyhead!
Aaah!
You must be Mr. Morita.
Yes, I'm the Mr. Morita who was invited.
Welcome, Mr. Morita.
Come in.
Morita!
He was waiting!
Thank you for inviting us.
Thank you very much for coming!
Look, this is my secretary.
My name is Masayo Todudaiji.
Nice to meet you!
Ha-ha-ha!
And now!
Pleased to meet you!
-This is the festival hall. -Wow!
Really fantastic!
And the works of art are also magnificent!
They are the fruit of my wife's love of art.
Come, follow me here, please.
We'd like to take a look around to see what the mansion is like.
May we?
Yes, of course!
Todudaiji!
Please act as a guide.
Yes, Mr. Kana.
(Girl) No!
I'll guide them, if you don't do anything to yourself!
Misaki, my wife.
She's the president of the Kana Music Publishing Group of Companies.
How do you do?
Well then, follow me.
Yes, ma'am.
Go make preparations in the kitchen, Masayo.
I can tell Madam President can't even see me.

Oi, president?
Uh... uh, listen...
We are above the great hall.
This is the music room, with the grand piano.
Ooooh!
It's extraordinary!
There's even a gallery inside the room itself.
(Think) This sword...
Quiet, Conan!
Don't put the staples on it!
It doesn't come apart so easily.
Even if it's for decoration,
the materials are identical to those of the authentic pieces.
(Think) What a stick, it's not authentic?
Next to the piano room is my room.
Come in, come in.
(Kogoro) Mm!
It's also very tastefully decorated!
Caram, your wedding picture!
It's really beautiful!
Yes.
It was 10 years ago today.
We were in Fiji.
How nice...
When we were in college we were both in the Music Club.
Then we dated for a year and got married.
I'm envious.
(Phone)
Yes... Yes, tell me?
Who... who is it?!
Who is it, you!
He hung up.
(Phone)
Tell me!
He hung up.
Do you get these calls often?
Yes.
A man whispers to me with a rough voice: "Mon lleva" or "Je t'aime".
(Kana) When I put me on, he hangs up right away.
Does it occur to you that you can make these calls?
(Kana) It doesn't end here.
In addition to the letters, there's this.
Oh, boy, oh, boy... Didn't you realize you were making them?
I found them this morning with a marigold on the front door.
I'd say they were made yesterday.
He seems to have me under constant surveillance and I'm terrified.
(Thinking) After the roses, the marigold.
He's watching her.
Don't worry, madam.
I, in Kogoro Mouri, will protect you from all danger!
President, the guests have already arrived.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
Hello, sorry to keep you waiting.
Thank you for coming.
Brother, this is Mr. Gerard Tenma's manager.
My name is Michel.
Pleased to meet you.
This is Yoshinori Kana and his wife Misaki.
-So nice to meet you. -We are delighted to have you here.
And Mr. Tenma?
(French accent) I'm sorry.
He'll be a little later.
Who are those guests?
Mr. Morita, a good friend from years ago.
And his sons, Ran and Conan.
Mr. Morita, my brother Hideki.
He's the vice president of Kana Music Publishing Company.
(Quietly) -Brother, may I have a word? -What do you want?
Excuse me...
Gentlemen, come to the table, please.
Ooooh, how delicious!
(Think) What have you come here to do?
Why did you invite complete strangers?!
We must finalize the contract with Gerard!
Come on, let's go.
What contract?!
You came back from France with Gerard because you wanted to.
If I acted like that, it was for the good of the company!
For the good of the company?
If you succeed in this business,
Misaki will see your virtues and will reward you...
What... What do you mean?
-Stop hinting tea to Misaki! -Don't talk to me like that! -Don't talk to me like that!
What's with you and Todudaiji!?
The company is full!
Shut up!
I have nothing with her!
It's so much!
I'll pull through the contract successfully at all costs!
Gerard will be here soon.
I'll wait for her at the front door.
Yes.
I'll be there too.
I'll go to the washroom first.
You can use the seconds now, please, Masayo.
Yes, Chairwoman.
You're out of drink, Mr. Morita.
-I'll go get some more.
En-Ah, thank you very much!
I'll retire too, I'm going to touch up my make-up.
Father, you mustn't drink too much.
No way! I know that!
Kogoro, shouldn't you keep an eye on Mrs. Misaki?
Ah!
That's right!
Father, get to work!
Let's get to work!
How can I go into a woman's boudoir?!
You go.
You're right.
Ah!
A blackout?
(Kogoro) There must be lightning.
(Thinking) Wrong!
(A woman called)
It's been upstairs!
(Thinks) Damn it!
(Misaki) Help!
It's locked from inside! Get out of the way!
Help! Help!
Quiet! Mrs. Misaki!
(Misaki) Shit!
Where is it?!
Damn it.
Where is he?!
Mrs. Misaki...
What happened?
Are you alright?
Someone turned off the main switch!
Misaki!
Did you drink wrong?
Ouch... Someone attacked me!
That bouquet...
Lobelias!

(Thinking) I was afraid of it, it's related.
In the lyrics of the song there was the name of these flowers, right?
In the song?
Ah, "The Nocturne of Red Love".
Rose, marigold, Lobel...
So, the flowers that the man sent you...
I will always keep my eyes on you.
I feel your voice and I tremble with joy...
Someone wants to torment my wife following Gerard Tenma's song?!
Torment her?!
This means that there is someone who is dedicated to harass the president.
I'm sorry, but I would like you to tell me the facts.
You have turned the switch back on?
Yes.
On my way here,
I passed the room where the main switch is.
Mr. Hideki, where were you at that time?
And you, Mr. Morita?
I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself.
My name is not Morita.
I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri.
Kogoro Mouri?!
The famous detective?!
Yes, Miss.
The very same.
Mrs. Misaki, was the door locked from the inside?
Yes, when I was fixing my make-up, the power went out and I was attacked.
Did you see the attacker's face?
No.
I saw it.
Although it was dark, I saw that he was wearing a hood, and it was expressionless.
It looked like the face of a foreign man.
A foreign man?!
Why should it be me?!
Forgive me for asking: what was he doing?
I had gone to the front door to greet Gerard.
The power went out.
It started to rain and I went inside.
Mr. Hideki was there, we heard screams and came here.
Please don't bother me!
Michel is an important guest for us.
(Michel) Gerard!
(Quietly) It looks like the aggressor...
I will introduce you.
He is our guest, Gerard Tenma!
There was no one there and I went upstairs.
We've had a little incident, is it all right if we talk downstairs?
You too, please.
(Think) "The door was locked from the inside.
"Therefore, the aggressor was already inside.
"Everyone has left the room before and had the opportunity to do so.
"Someone must have turned off the main switch.
"But it wasn't just an aggressor?
"Where did it come from, this fragment?
"The cracks are fresh.
"There are some smaller fragments?
"Are they from here? No, the size is different.
Oooh.
What object made this mark?"
When the events took place, where were they?
I was in the washroom.
The power went out and I got worried.
I was looking at the oven to see if the cake was done.
Mr. Tenma, you were soaking wet.
Yes.
So the cab dropped me at the gate.
Are you telling the truth?
Come on, let's take a little break.
Excuse me...
Ah!
Wow, what a head!
And Conan?!
Here we are!
Are you all right?
Dear, can you go get the medicine in the room, please?
Yes, I'm coming.
Yesterday's photos were taken from under the balcony.
Wow!
They've turned everything upside down.
Mrs. Misaki and Gerard Tenma?!
It's from 10 years ago!
Wasn't it half a month before Misaki got married?!
Conan!
You know that the father will scold you again, right?!
Eh?!
What's this? Nothing, this is just...
Show me! No, I don't want to!
I don't want to!
Come back to me!
What's wrong?!
Oh!
Oh, Lord...
What's the meaning of this?!
You and Misaki had something?
Don't be rude!
Hideki!
You knew about it, you did it expressly!
How did you want me to know?
Don't fight!
-Misaki! -Darling...
Before I married you, I used to date him.
His real name is Juya Tenma.
He was an unfortunate musician then.
But one day about 10 years ago, you suddenly disappeared.
You remember, don't you?
When I saw Gerard Tenma's data on this contract,
I was surprised.
-How long, Mr. Tenma. -Yes...
Madam, we have a present for you.
Wine from our land, a delicacy not found in Japan.
I know it's daring, but let me try it.
(Think) It contains nothing strange.
We'll have some refreshment.
Come all of you, gather around, we'll have a toast, please!
We toast.
Cheers!
Cheers!
(Think) As I imagined, though she is restless.
Ha-ha-ha!
It's delicious!

Ha-ha-ha!
Oh, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
No worries.
No worries.
I forgot!
The cake is in the oven.
Masayo, go to the basement of the garden and bring the silver tea set.
You will taste a special cake, please wait a few moments.
The condition for me to publish "Nocturne of red love"
is that I can change the lyrics and make another arrangement.
Another arrangement?
How is this?
(Michel) It is Gerard's immovable wish.
There was this flower at the door.
A dahlia!
In the language of flowers, it means betrayal.
Betrayal?
Thank you for waiting.
Gentlemen, make the charge.
Mr. Tenma, won't you sing us a song?
It would be a pleasure to hear it.
With pleasure.
You have attacked the Misaki, haven't you?!
-You insist again?! - Who else would want to attack it?
I must prepare everything.
Leave me alone, please.
Are you planning to run away?!
(Leave me alone!
-Gee, they're arguing. Let's see what's going on.
(A man calls)
He called in Tenma!
What happened?!
No... I did not do it!
Gerard!
Ooooh!
Geraaaaard!
(Thinking) Oh!
This is...
(Title: "Secret of my heart")
Donna kotoba ni kaete kimi ni tsutaerareru Darou...
Alekara ikutsumo no kisetsu ga.

Toorisugita keredo itsumo soba de waratteru,
watashi nimo Iena koto ga mada Hitotsu dake aru.
Secret of my heart utagattemo nai él.
Itsu datte sukoshi no mira ga areba...
Shinjitsu wa té ni irerareru hazu.
I can not say moves sukoshi dake... I'm waiting for a chance...
DETECTIVE CONAN
The "Nocturne of Red Love"!
This song is a gift that Tenma dedicated to Misaki!
(Think) What is this?
Blood?
No, it's not blood!
It's the man who attacked Misaki!
In the next chapter...
Nocturnal red murder, part two
The clue to the next Conan is... Wine!
In the next one, the solution! # Dring-Drang-tin!

What did you say?
It's the sound of the solution.
Ah, right.
