DETECTIVE CONAN
The missing corpse
What a bore, lately.
The junior detective team, can't do anything without assignments.
(Thinking) "If the clients came easily,
the detectives wouldn't go hungry."
And that Dr. Agasa had made these plates for us.
I never get tired of looking at her.
It's so beautiful...
with the initials of the team and the transceiver.
The plates are of no use to us, like that.
(Boy) Hello!
It's just that...
I wanted to ask you something.
You're in Hiroki, from the class next door.
-Has there been a murder? -A swindle?
One of your parents is unfaithful!
No, it's not that.
The Akira disappeared last night.
(At once) A missing person!
Guys, this could also be a kidnapping.
Let's see, what does it look like?
Uh... wait, I have a picture.
Look.
-Huh?! -Huh?! - Eh?!
(Genta) A cat!
Are you kidding, kid?
The cat has disappeared?
Yes.
Too bad, it wasn't a kidnapping.
-I'll pay you 10 yen each. 10 yen?
No!
We only take clients in a worthwhile case.
If you're patient, I'm sure he'll come back, the cat.
-Please, please, please... -Come on, go home.
Well...
If you'll find him,
I wanted to give you my stickers of the masked Yaiba.
Look... I'm a collector.
-Masked Yaiba's stickers.
-These are the most wanted, these stickers.
These are the most important cards!
(At the same time) We accept the order!
Look how naive you are.
Wow!
We can't find them anywhere.
How strange...
If he disappeared yesterday, it should be in this area.
It can't be far...
We've done what we could, now you should give us the stickers.
No way, you'll have to find them first.
Hiroki, doesn't he have any special habits or anything that identifies him?
Man... now that you ask...
Akira always meows in a very, very characteristic way.
He does more or less like this. (meows)
Yes, yes exactly... that's him.
(meows) Huh?
(meowing) Eh?
Where did it come from, this meow?
From this house here!
Akira!
Akira!
-Ah, Akira! (At the same time) -We've found it!
It's full of blood! -We've got to take it to the vet!
(Thinking) "No, it's not hurt."
"This means... it could be..."
Wait, Conan!
What's the matter with you?
Ouch!
-Is there anything?
I want to see it! I want to see it too!
-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! -Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
"The police! I have to call them right away!"
Is it true that you have seen a corpse?
-Yes! -It's true!
We are sure.
What?
Conan!
Since we have seen the corpse, no one has entered or left.
The dead man must be inside for strength.
Police!
Open up!
What is it, this scandal?
Excuse me, sir, but these children have seen a corpse in your house.
A corpse?!
And so much, we have seen it!
-There was a man in the bathroom! -Covered in blood!
What nonsense!
I just came out of the bathroom.
Look, it's over there, the door at the back.
Well, I'll give a howl.
Hey, hey!
What? The corpse is gone!
The corpse, it's gone!
-It's gone! -How can this be?
You see, man?
These guys have played a bad joke on him.
I assure you we've seen it!
There was a corpse covered in blood!
-Yes, it's true! -He must have hidden it!
What the hell did you think?!
Mmm...
Let's see, it must have taken us about 15 minutes to get there,
since you called us.
That's enough time to hide a corpse.
What nonsense!
If you want to look for it, look for help.
I'm going upstairs to sleep!
You don't mind if we look around the house?
You do it yourselves.
If you have any problems, just tell my little brother,

that will arrive at any moment!
To swallow the joke of a few children
and make all this commotion...
The police have little work to do.
Search for him!
The corpse must be in this house!
Search everything!
Surely we'll find the body!
(Hoarse voice) Hey, did anything happen in my house?
Inspector, Mr. Tanaka's brother has arrived.
Eh?
But-but...
What's going on here?
The children have seen a corpse in the bathroom at home.
A-a dead body?!
Eh?!
What are you doing, man?!
It's the same.
It wasn't very expensive, this vase.
(Man) What is it, this scandal?!
Do not make so much noise!
Well, well: is upstairs, my brother?
Yes, and it seems to me that he is angry.
Forgive the indiscretion, what does he do, your brother?
Don't worry, Inspector;
my brother is a writer,
and he doesn't move much from home.
Ah... here, it's my card.
Tomofumi Tanaka.
Ah, he works for a security company.
And it's just the two of you living here?
Yes, but the house is mine.
My brother lives with me.
(Thinking) "What's this?"
"A leaf?"
We've looked in the attic and we've pulled up the floors,
we're only missing your brother's room.
Yes.
But I don't know if he'll be mad at us.
Can we come in?
Can you feel me?
(TV) "Low pressure is approaching from the west,
and this will cause the weather to become unstable."
"Tomorrow it is foreseen..."
Do not suffer, it seems to me that dorm.
Are you sure?
(TV) "From the day after tomorrow, the weather will stabilize..."
Wow, what a beautiful tree back here.
What tree is it?
Hey, Mr. Tanaka!
If you're going to sleep, at least turn off the TV.
I think you heard me.
Well, you've seen everything, haven't you?
It's obvious that the corpse wasn't... wasn't it, children?
I swear it wasn't a lie!
Maybe by now they've already taken the body out of the house!
Eh?
Mmm...
Let's see, when we arrived,
the first thing you told me was that no one had gone in or out.
Hmm.
That's exactly what I thought,
but I was watching the house from the front.
I couldn't see the back.
But there's a tall fence, behind this house.
But there's a tall tree next to it.
If you tie the corpse to your back, it jumps it easily.
Tanaka, say.
What?
What? No, you're wrong.
No, you're wrong.
Yeah, sure, bye.
They were wrong.
As usual.
What were we talking about now?
The back tree.
Ah, the tree.
It was already there when I bought the house.
(Thinking) "This call... You mean it rang, the phone?"
Uh... is it going well?
Yes.
What, you could climb, with a body on your back?
Yes, with a little effort...
It's impossible.
On the other side there is a river.
There is no road, next to it?
Yes, there is a narrow platform,
but if you drag a body, it's impossible.
You should hold on with your hands so you don't lose your balance.
Mmm, there is no corpse in the house...
and it's impossible to pull it out from behind.
You told me a lie.
It was true!
Come on, let's go home!
Wait, please!
I swear we saw it!
As I'm going to catch the Italian thieves, I believed it,
but I've been a fool.
(thinks) "How can it be?! How can it have disappeared?"
"The only thing I can think of
is that the older brother must have cleaned the blood out of the bathroom,
and he must have taken the body somewhere else and hidden it."
Eh?
That's the same leaf the little brother had.
He must have climbed the tree to get the body out.
Huh?
Ouch.
-Hey, hey, Conan. Hey.
You idiots!
What are you doing here?
Do you think we're going to stay calm if everyone treats us as liars?
(thinks) "Oh, sir, this scoundrel..."
-Hey, oh, hide, quick!
-Have you seen any co...?
Look guys.
Though he sleeps, that unpleasant one.
-He's a pain in the ass.
-Oysters!
What a guy!
He's been sleeping in the same position for hours.
Everything should be bad for him.
"Wait a minute!"
"It seems to me that..."
"It seems to me that I wasn't on the right track."
-Conan, where are you going?

-What happened?
It seems to me that he has used a tactic to hide the body.
Espereu's-e here, I'll check it out.
Let's see if I'm right!
Come on, guys, let's help each other.
No!
Don't go in.
There might be a murderer inside!
Wait for me in the front booth.
If I find the body, I'll let you know, and call the police!
Oh, he's closed the window.
(Thinking) "First, I'll check the room on the second floor."
"Wow, he's still awake. Eh?"
"What did he leave?"
"A cell phone!"
"Now I get it!"
"He fooled us with that."
"It's becoming clearer and clearer to me."
This Conan, what's taking him so long?
Don't worry, guys,
he'll let us know by minitransmissor-receiver,
when he finds the body.
I wonder if he wants to take all the credit!
(Ayumi) I would never do that!
"It's here, it's here."
"Yes... I think I've got it right."
"There's an answering machine and a video, in this room."
It's coming!
How strange...
I thought I heard something.
I must have imagined.
(Radio) "Conan! What's taking you so long?!"
Eh?
Who, who is it?
Who's here?!
-O-o-oops!
-I think they've found out!
Conan!
Run for it!
It's useless to hide.
Come on, give up and come out here!
"Shit!"
"I'll leave the transceiver running and..."
Mr. Tanaka, you, you must surrender!
What?! (Radio)
(Radio) "Neither the police nor I have found the corpse,
but, all the time it's been here."
Yes!
So that corpse was sitting on a chair watching TV here.
This man is your brother!
But, but who the hell are you?
I'm Conan Edogawa, a detective.
A... detective?
Yes, and now I'll describe the setup.
"After we've seen your brother's corpse,
"you cleaned the bathroom, dressed her in a bathrobe.
and left her in the chair."
"Then you opened the door to the police,
and you had the nerve to dress like the brother you had just killed."
"You two look a lot alike."
"A relative wouldn't have been fooled,
but an outsider is easy to do, with a disguise."
"And while the police were searching the house,
he climbed the tree and jumped over the wall."
"Luckily, the platform is wide enough to walk on."
"When you have been back on the street,
you went back inside posing as the little brother."
What?
You found the body?
Yes.
The corpse was that of the older brother, who seemed to be sleeping.
All this is absurd!
That man was very much alive!
He turned off the TV when the brother told him to,
and when you broke the vase, big brother booed you!
Yes... he played both roles
and behaved as if his brother was still alive,
using the video and the answering machine and his cell phone.
"The voice that was calling had been recorded by you on the answering machine
before the police arrived."
"Through the cell phone,
you activated the answering machine and the voice was heard."
All the phones were programmed not to ring,
because it sounded like her brother was calling from the second floor.
What is it, this racket?
Don't make so much noise!
"What you have confirmed to me
is that you picked up the phone without hearing the ringing."
"You must have seen that the light that signals a call came on."
If I hadn't picked up the phone, the answering machine would have gone off
and I would have felt the same scream again.
Like this.
(Recording) "What is it, this racket? Don't make noise !!!"
As for the TV,
I had the video programmed to turn off.
Am I right, Mr. Tomofumi Tanaka?
Eagerness s!
It will hurt Conan!
Damn children!
Do you want to stop?!
I hang up the phone!
(Radio: Tanaka) You're pretty smart, aren't you, kid?
You're right, it's me, it's me, the one who's killed my brother!
What?!
Fucking kid!
Where did he go?
That useless brother of mine found something
that he could use against me,

and came to live in my house because I kept it.
Tomofumi, I found them.
I found these documents in your room.
Hey, aren't these actions illegal?
Don't suffer... I'm your brother... I won't tell anyone!
In return, you'll take care of me all my life, right?
I kept him for a while
but he started asking me for more and more money!
And with my own hands,
crush the head of that wretch!
Marrec, you cannot understand my feelings.
I loved her very much, my brother.
He was a brilliant writer.
He would have made a name for himself, with the talent he had.
But he was a fucking bum!
(Thinking) "Wow! He's dressed like his brother!"
"He's out of his mind!"
My brother... my brother was my great idol.
"I had always... wanted to be like my brother."
"But my brother disappointed me."
"My brother, my idol, he gave up on everything
and became a parasite!"
I will get him back!
I will get my brother back!
Do you understand?
I'll be... I'll be...
my brother!
Now you've made me angry.
(Thinks) "I'll fix it with my hypersabates!"
"Wrong!"
"The shot is too strong, and has crushed the cabbage."
Now that you've found me out, I can't leave you alive, kid!
I'm sorry for you, but... you'll have to die!

DETECTIVE CONAN
"Soon the police arrived."
"We regained our reputation."
"That case, which had begun with the search for a cat,
had been successfully solved."
And then..."
Guys, this is like always, no clients come.
And look how well we solved it, the murder case!
Hello.
What can you help me?
The cat has disappeared again.
What? What?
Mmm... it seems to me that another case will come out of here.
It's not an ordinary cat.
-I accept the answer. We don't have anything else to do either!
"We later found out that Hiroki's cat, Akira, was a peeping Tom,
was a peeping tom who stuck his nose everywhere."
"But he didn't get involved in any other cases."
The victim is Denjiro Maru, owner of the house.
Her husband practiced sword fighting, didn't he?
(Think) "The murderer must be one of those men."
Inspector, I know for sure who the murderer is!
