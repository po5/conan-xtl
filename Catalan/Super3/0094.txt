DETECTIVE CONAN
The asassinat of the Snow Woman
"Genbe Guesthouse. Hot springs."
Even if my body wastes away,
the day will come when my soul will rise again with the snow!
will continue
What a blast, it's been as exciting as usual!
What is this?
A mechanical doll.
Take it, it's for you.
A doll?
Wow, it's very well made.
They've got some very curious things around here!
The person in charge of the boarding house left it for us.
Have you seen the Snow Woman? Yes.
Today, it made me very happy.
The Snow Woman doesn't exist.
That's not true, kid.
This area is known for the Snow Woman appearing.
And tonight she might show up again.
Good night, Yoko.
Yoko, do you want us to stay here?
What are you doing, good?
But woman, we have no other place to spend the night.
Welcome.
Thank you very much.
We made the reservation yesterday.
Yes, we did.
You must be Miss Akiko Kinoshita
and Miss Yoko Asanuma.
We thank you for coming.
You have finished skiing, haven't you?
What?!
You just said that Akiko Kinoshita...
He said that?
In the flesh!
We just saw her on TV at The Love of the Snow Woman!
Guys, the actress Akiko Kinoshita, the real Akiko Kinoshita!
She's amazing!
My name is Kogoro Mouri, at your service, and I'm a detective.
The scene where she has to jump into the lake was magnificent!
Unrepeatable!
It has been thrown in a straight line and with a power...
I didn't jump, Yoko did.
Exactly, I'm a specialist.
So you replace the actors in the dangerous scenes.
Yoko is my exclusive stuntwoman.
She's like my own Kagemusha.
Excuse me, where are you, the toilets?
I'm completely frozen.
If you want the restrooms...
Down the hall, on the left hand side.
The room is near the khaki?
Yes, just as you asked.
Conan, shall we go to sleep?
Yes.
Yoko said this was the first time she came here.
How did she know where the toilets were?
You really have a prodigious curiosity, Conan.
Toilets are usually built in the same places as usual.
And when we're talking about such old houses, it's even more obvious.
We hope it will be nice tomorrow.
Eh ?!
The Woman of...
Conan, the Snow Woman!
The Snow Woman?
There's no one.
No, there isn't.
I swear I've seen her!
What is it, so much screaming?
The Snow Woman is outside!
The Snow Woman?!
There is no one, daughter.
Once again you're afraid, you've ended up looking as if you saw her.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe it was an illusion.
Yes, we'll be back tomorrow night.
Prepare me a massage and a skin treatment.
All right, then, see you later.
Goodbye, then.
Akiko, you have.
Yes, that's right.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
They look exactly like bank robbers.
We actresses can't get sunburned.
Hint!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Look, Yoko and Akiko!
In the mountains, the weather changes suddenly,
but for it to snow so much is too much.
Miss Yoko, are you coming alone?
Yes, Akiko wanted to ski a little longer.
Wow!
I see that Akiko is a very vigorous woman.
Don't believe it, Akiko makes it look like she's full of energy,
but she's never been physically fit.
Until later.
What did you mean, she's not fit?
Is she sick?
Ouch... I'm worried about her.
I'm here now.
She's back, Yoko?
Yes, she just came back.
(Coughs)
Maybe she's caught a cold.
Thank you guys, you're helping me a lot.
Thank you.
Thanks for dinner, it was great.
Akiko coughed.
Are you all right now?
Yes, he wasn't very hungry, but now he's resting.

Thank you for your interest.
Ma'am, can I take a bath now?
Yes, the bathroom is reserved for you until 8 o'clock. Be quiet.
Thank you.
You, from 8 o'clock onwards.
I've reserved the men's room for you.
(Girl coughing)
Akiko, are you all right?
You'd better go to the doctor.
Yes, that's what I'll do.
I'm going out now.
I'll stay a little longer.
Mr. Mouri, what is it?
Yes!
Do you want to have a drink after the bath?
Of course we do!
Will we see you on stage in a theater?
Yes, they think very highly of my work.
I'll play the role that Akiko played on TV.
But you'll go out too, won't you?
Yes!
Of course I will!
Vingui'm see!
Here.
Of course I'll come.
Gee, there's not much left.
Go get another beer!
It's 10 o'clock.
The owners of the boarding house are asleep.
-I've got whiskey in the room.
N-No, it's not necessary.
Let's drink together a little longer.
I'll fetch it.
Father!
What's wrong with that?
We'll have a great time today!
Well... And the whiskey?
You can see it's the bottom of the bag.
The Akiko told me he'll bring it to us.
He did?
The Akiko?
Well...
Maybe he's arrived.
Ah, I'll go check.
Hello!
Not yet?
No, not yet.
I think it's arrived this time.
Thank you very much, Akiko.
The whiskey is here.
Blow!
I had a great time!
So did I.
Ran, you can go through to the bathroom,
I'll go check on the Akiko and come over.
What's wrong with her? Oooh.
I had the impression that the doll wasn't there,
but don't mind me.
Well, it is.
Maybe I've had too much to drink.
Although it's not coming, Yoko?
That one... That's the Snow Woman!
She showed up?
Yes, that was the Snow Woman!
Mr. Mouri, Akiko is in danger!
What happened to her, the Akiko?
Look at this.
It's the Akiko's will.
The will?!
When I came back to the room, it was gone!
I looked for it, but I couldn't find it anywhere.
And in the room I found this.
The Akiko had lung cancer?!
All I know is that she looked worried because of that strange cough she had.
She says: "I have the same symptoms as my father."
Yes, he died of lung cancer.
Maybe she was trying hard to keep all the symptoms a secret.
How he must have suffered.
"I want to die like the Snow Woman."
The Snow Woman I've seen... It could be Akiko!
Yoko, notify the police immediately.
It's very important that we find out where Akiko is.
Guys, we'll go look for her, too.
Make your way.
Kogoro, Akiko booked a session with the beautician.
Would someone who wants to commit suicide make any reservations?
It must be a premeditated suicide.
(Kogoro) -Where is she?!
Where is she?
Akikooo! (Yoko) -Akikooooo!
(Yoko) -Answer, please! -Akikooo!
Akikooo!
Akikooo!
"The next day, they discovered the corpse of Miss Akiko."
"She was dressed as the Snow Woman."
Akiko!
Akiko!
Without a doubt, it's the Akiko Kinoshita.
-Thank you for coming.
-Who are you?
I'm detective Kogoro Mouri, we were staying at the same guesthouse.
Oh, you are that famous...
I'm Kawada, from the Mikkamachi police station.
Next to Akiko was a bottle with a sleeping pill.
The Akiko took the bottle of whiskey at 10 o'clock.
She was to commit suicide afterwards.
Probably, the Snow Woman I saw was Akiko.
That's how we found the body.
(Think) "Eh?! What about that ?! What if it was...?"
As this is a case of suicide,
you should not intervene, Detective Mouri.
(Thinking) "This was done by someone who went up..."
What were you doing up here, Conan?
Excuse me, do you know where the former owner of this boarding house is now?
Eh?
The former owner?
I think he lives in the villa next door.
Why is that?
It's just that I would like to ask him some questions, to that gentleman.
(thinks) "This is a murder! And I know who the murderer is!"
Well, we'll have to take the body for an autopsy.
(He thinks) "Wrong!"
Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah...

(Kogoro voice) You can't take this body away!
This Akiko Kinoshita thing is not a suicide, it's a homicide!
On what basis can you say that?
Inspector Kawada, take another look at the photographs
they took when they found Miss Akiko.
The hairs are inside the collar of the kimono.
A person preparing to die doesn't dress clumsily.
Someone dressed her like that.
But who did?
Miss Yoko Asanuma,
you did it!
The Akiko's state of mind was not the same as usual!
I don't think when she put on the kimono she looked at the way her hair looked.
Inspector Kawada, please take a look at the photographs.
The body is sunken, as if half buried in the snow.
Yesterday it started snowing at 5:00 p.m. and stopped at 8:00.
If he had committed suicide after 10 o'clock,
his body would not be so sunken.
And now look at his face.
He is wearing sunscreen.
It was nighttime and he was going to commit suicide.
Who would wear sunscreen under these circumstances?
Doesn't it seem very strange to you?
It is true, that at the door.
It is possible that they made him take a very powerful sleeping pill.
Who could have done it was you, Yoko.
No one else would have been able to do it.
But listen, Mr. Mouri, last night we all saw Akiko.
It was you playing the role of the Akiko.
Playing?
What do you mean by that?
You invited her to ski and make the reservation here, didn't you?
Why did you choose this very place?
Because it was easier for you to play both roles here.
Both roles?
You and Akiko look similar when your backs are turned.
You killed her
and you had to make it look like she was alive.
Yoko commented that it was the first time she had come.
One winter, when you were still a student,
you worked at this boarding house for a while.
The former owner remembers what it was called.
Yesterday, on the ski slope,
he gave Akiko the sleeping pill to put her to sleep.
He is going to dress her up as the Snow Woman and left her there.
He must have found it very timely that it started snowing.
But she didn't think it would stop so soon.
Ran, the first Snow Woman you saw was Miss Yoko.
She wore the white kimono on her head,
trying not to draw attention to herself,
because she was going to hide another one, which was bulky.
The Snow Woman had two kimonos.
Akiko's and Yoko's, her specialist.
She covered the victim's kimono.
And last night, she dressed the
with what she had buried when Akiko was sleeping.
And he returned to the boarding house as if nothing had happened.
The Akiko also returned to the boarding house.
When he went back to his room, he disguised himself as Akiko
to make us believe that she was alive.
He climbed out of the window and climbed up to the roof by climbing khaki.
For a specialist like you it would be a piece of cake.
Next, she put on Akiko's ski boots,
which he had previously hidden,
and returned with her skis.
In addition, you played both roles in the baths,
because you wanted us to feel it.
You can imitate the Akiko's voice perfectly.
You finished your montage
when the Ran saw the Snow Woman from the baths.
You acted out a scene
to imply that she had committed suicide
and make us believe that she was alive until that time.
How do you explain that the Akiko gave us the bottle of whiskey?
Ah, the bottle of whiskey?
That too was pure theater!
We didn't see it.
But he put the whiskey directly in my hand!
If the Akiko had been dead, who would have wanted me to take it?
Although he had another reason for choosing to stay in this pension.
The mechanical doll that plays the waiter!
You went to get the whiskey.
But you had the dummy take it.
When I went out to look around, the mechanical dummy was gone.
But that was no illusion.
The mechanical dummy was behind me.
Thank you very much, Akiko.
Next, she pretended to go to the washroom
and returned the doll to its pedestal.
He had the dummy do the Akiko's supposed task.
You can take it for granted that the Akiko's fingerprints are not on the bottle.
It is definite proof that he had not been at the boarding house for a long time.
I... I gave her a sleeping pill.
I murdered her.

And I made the will.
The Akiko's father had died of cancer,
but she didn't hurt anywhere.
Why was that?
I always ended up losing to Akiko.
Casting for my first TV series, I passed the auditions.
and when I almost had it, I lost to her.
It was always the same story.
In the final auditions, I always lost.
While Akiko was becoming a star,
I was always told, "You look like Akiko."
As long as Akiko continued to work,
I could only be another Kagemusha.

It's the Yeti, it's the Yeti! It's the Yeti!
Snow!
Snow! Entoma!
Ah, if you're the Sachiko!
(Think) "In Kogoro he had fallen asleep?"
"But in Kogoro he was awake until 9 o'clock
and he stayed up chatting with Sachiko."
"Sachiko's alibi is perfect. Wait!"
