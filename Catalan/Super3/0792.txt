(Woman) Listen...
May I know why you made us come all the way here
and you assured us that no one was following us?
It wouldn't be
to show us your great skill with disguises, would it?
No.
I received a message from the Kir, the Rena Mizunashi.
-What?
-What?
Well, that means one thing: they don't know you're alive yet.
Yes, they might.
I received a text message, but there were only 3 letters.
-Was it an abbreviation or an acronym?
-There were only 3 letters?
No.
It's the name of a drink you know very well.
R-U-M.
Rom in English.
It's a code name.
- "Rom"?
-Oh!
When I was in the Organization,
I heard it two or three times, this name.
It seems to refer to an advisor very close to the head.
An advisor?
Well... I know absolutely nothing.
"Considering the brevity of the message,
"I think the circumstances would be so extreme
that he didn't have time to write anything else."
"Be that as it may, tell James...
that the big fish is about to make a move, okay?"
"It's someone more important than Gin."
"We solve mysteries with sharp deductions."
"Love and cases have the same origin."
"A child sees three grown men."
"A witness statement uncovers a crime."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The first three to arrive (part one)."
Hey, last night, did you guys watch the soccer derby?
The match between the Spirits and the Noirs, you mean?
I did.
Hide scored a hat-trick, didn't he?
Yes.
No wonder he's the highest paid player.
Yes.
L-U-M?
The alien?
Hooola!
No, no, not the Light of the manga.
R-U-M, the rum, the pirates' liquor.
Ah.
Doesn't ring a bell, no.
I thought I already told you.
I don't understand alcoholic beverages.
E-clear.
"For information from en Rom,
"The advisor to the head of the Men in Black,
"We should wait for the Rena Mizunashi,
who has infiltrated the organization, to contact us."
"That, or for the Amuro to tell us something,
that he has also infiltrated."
Eh?
But...
Listen to me well.
What I can tell you is that I know
that the code name for number two of the Men in Black is "Rom."
Number two?
At least that's what I felt when I was part of it.
But I didn't get to know him.
And... and what was he like?
Was he a man?
Was he a woman?
I just told you.
I didn't get to know him.
When I was part of the organization I heard rumors,
some descriptions...
A tall, burly man...
An effeminate boy...
An older man...
I don't know, some people said that all three existed.
A tall, burly man, an effeminate boy and an... older man.
Can't you hear me?
This is very serious, maybe this end Rom has started looking for me.
Yes, yes, of course I listen to you.
I was just pointing out what you were saying, which is very interesting.
The code names of the Men in Black are for alcoholic beverages.
(Genta) What god of rum?
Now we have rum.
-He just said it right now.
-(Genta) Huh?
Yeah, I've been feeling I don't know about rum too.
What?
Ah...
Come on, talk, we want to know.
Rom... Ram... Ra... Ramune, I was saying.
Yes, of course.
Ramune?
After playing soccer in the park, he was very thirsty.
That's why I was asking him if the candy stop across the street
across the street sold this soft drink.
-Oh, I like it very much.
-Oh.
You were talking about the Ramune soda?
Huh?
I like it too.
That kid is still there.
-Huh?
-Which kid?
That one.
The one over there.
When we were going to the park, he was already there.
And I noticed because he was already looking up.
How strange!

And what should you look for?
Maybe it is that there is someone
who's about to throw himself off the building.
Yes.
Ask him.
Come on, come on.
Look at that floor over there?
What's that about?
Hey, listen, can you tell us what you're doing?
Buaaaah!
It's just that... Miss Yasue has been murdered!
Just a moment.
What?
Let's see, but did you see it, how they killed her?
No, I didn't see it, but she told me before:
"In a little while, three men will show up at my house,
they'll come one after the other.
Once the three of them have left, if I don't get out of the apartment, it's probably because one of them has killed me,
I'm sure that one of them has murdered me.
Call the police immediately so that they will come".
And that means that the young lady....
She hasn't come out.
It's been more than half an hour since the last man left and she hasn't come out.
And you still haven't called the police?
I'm so scared.
I don't know what to do.
And these three men... Do you remember a little of what they looked like?
Mm-hm.
One was a very tall man,
the other, a boy with long hair who looked like a girl,
and an older man with very white hair.
(Ai) "A tall, burly man...
An effeminate boy...
An older man..."
No.
It can't be that much of a coincidence.
(Ai) What?
It can't be them.
But I'm sure there was...
another feature of en Rom that...
Descriptions of his appearance varied,
but there was one thing that didn't change.
But right now I don't remember what it was.
Hey, listen, we need to go up to Miss Yasue's apartment.
Eh?
Yes.
Come on, come with us.
(Mitsuhiko) But, let's see, who is this woman?
Your aunt?
(Genta) Is she related to you?
No.
I don't know her very well.
(Mitsuhiko) Eh?
You don't know her very well, you say?
No.
But she plays with me a lot when I'm alone in the park.
It's just that I haven't lived in this neighborhood very long and I don't have any friends.
But your mother must know her, this girl, right?
No, she doesn't know her because I don't have a father or a mother, me.
-Are they both dead?
-Huh?
Hm.
They were killed one day when I had gone hiking.
They said "the case of the Goto murders".
"The Goto murder case."
Since then I've been living at my uncle's house,
but he's always busy and can't play with me much.
And this girl saw that you were always alone
and decided to keep you company, then?
Yes, I had asked her to take me home someday,
but she always said no.
But today she told me it was a special day and that she was inviting me up.
It seems that he writes scripts for television...
(Door: doorbell)
And he tells me a lot of stories he wants to write.
"He's a scriptwriter?"
(Doorbell)
Yasue!
(Doorbell)
Well, he doesn't answer.
Let's see.
What's the matter?
The door isn't locked.
No, it isn't.
Don't come in.
He told me, if I didn't come out, to tell the police...
and that they'd take care of everything, but not to come in.
"What if he's...?"
"I knew it."
Oh!
Aaah!
No.
Stay outside.
Yasue!
Yasue!
Yes.
Understood.
Oh, you call the police.
Shouldn't we call an ambulance, too?
No.
That's not necessary.
Look at the feet.
If it was suicide,
there'd be a stool or something lying next to the feet.
But there's nothing.
Meaning someone murdered her...
and made it look like suicide.
One of these three men the boy says is surely the perpetrator of the crime.
And if it's true that half an hour has already passed
since the third man left, it's already too late.
Poor girl.
There is nothing we can do now.
"But it's strange."
"The murderer was in such a hurry that he forgot to put the stool down.
"To simulate suicide but,
but instead, there's no sign that he left in a hurry."
"In addition, the victim has no scratches on the neck...
"There is no evidence of resistance before drowning."
"It could be that she was anesthetized
and then hung."
"But if the killer had it all so well calculated..,
why didn't he put in a stool?"
"An envelope?"
"It's from a bank. And it's very new."
"This means that inside the purse on the table...
there must be money that he had just withdrawn."
"But there's practically nothing here."

"All there is is a detailed statement from an ATM."
"According to the statement, you withdrew 500,000 yen only three hours ago."
"But there's not even five here."
"It was a robbery that ended in murder, then?"
Be that as it may, one thing is clear to me.
They wouldn't do a job as shoddy as this one.
Right.
Let me get this straight, you say Miss Yasue told you...
that she's guarding the entrance to her apartment and that, afterwards,
when the 3 men you explained to me had all gone in and out,
she decided to go upstairs and found what you saw, right?
Hm.
So, you represent that the victim is the scriptwriter Yasue Koma?
Yes, Inspector.
Is that correct?
If this is a homicide,
we'll have to start looking to see if there's anyone in her circle
who had something on her, take them to the police station...
and have the boy identify him in a lineup.
What?
If you're referring to the three men
who were supposedly meeting the victim here today, I know who they are.
What? I just checked.
I just checked and they're listed in the address book on the laptop.
"Today at noon, visit from Ronpei Sakaba,
Kuramichi Habanaka and Denji Shibakaru."
This, it says?
It is well specified.
Yes.
The 3 names are on the notebook calendar,
on the calendar on the wall and in this notebook I found in the drawer.
So there is no doubt about the names of the 3 men.
And there is no trace of the 500,000 yen she has withdrawn.
Therefore, the murderer has killed her for money,
faked a suicide and fled the scene of the crime.
Let's immediately start investigating who exactly these 3 men are.
Eh?
-They're-they're-they're over there.
-What's the matter with you now?
The men who entered the apartment a while ago.
Those... those three.
-No. -No.
They can't be.
-What?!
Hey, can you tell us who they are without peeking over the railings?
Yes.
Are they down here?
Oh! (Laughs)
Over there.
That tall man,
the long-haired boy near him diagonally,
and the older gentleman behind him.
Hm?
Inspector Megure!
(whispers)
Yes, understood.
Yes.
Agent Takagi...
(Whispers) Oh!
Watch out!
(murmurs)
I don't understand anything.
Can you tell me what's going on?
I've only come to play the voyeur
because I heard that something had happened in the neighborhood.
And that's the only reason they want to interrogate me?
And I just happened to be passing by.
Are you telling me I look like a murderer, or what?
No.
We have a witness who claims that between 2:00 and 3:00..,
the approximate time of the victim's death,
the three of you entered his house separately, one after the other.
The witness has also assured us
that Miss Yasue Koma, the victim,
asked you to keep an eye on the front door of her apartment
because she was afraid
that one of these 3 men who would go there might murder her.
A... murder?
But she didn't commit suicide?
Suicide?
When a person is found hanging, it's usually suicide.
Hm.
And can you explain to me how you know, that the victim has hanged himself?
Eh?
Well...
I find it absurd that we keep lying.
My name is Denji Shibakaru.
I met Miss Koma in a bar.
We became friends and have been seeing each other.
This photo proves my point.
She told me she wanted to talk to me about something that was bothering her,
and that's why I came here.
But I never imagined that she wanted to commit suicide.
So, I understand that when she arrived, she already....
Yes.
So I have no way of knowing what was wrong with her.
If you want to know, maybe you should ask the two of them.
But I don't know who they are or where they come from.
Do you?
I came to get... some money she owed me.
She was a friend of mine for a long time.
I left her a lot of money.
But now I'm going through a bad time financially and I need them..,
so I asked her to return it to me as soon as she can.
Miss Koma owed you 500,000 yen?
What?
But... but how do you know?
Is it him, then, who has taken the money?
(Man) Just a moment.
I am a producer of Tohti Television.
I commissioned Ms. Koma to write a script
for the fall special episode of a mystery series.
She told me she already had it ready, and I came to get it.
Yes.
And where is this script?

When I arrived, I found it at the entrance of the apartment.
I picked her up and took her to my assistant.
And the victim had already hung herself when you arrived?
Yes, my boy.
I don't know what was wrong with her either...
But he finished the script before the agreed delivery date,
so it didn't cross my mind that she could be depressed.
There's something I don't understand.
If they see that someone has hung up,
don't you think the normal thing to do is to call the police immediately?
It's true.
No matter how many excuses they make now.
You are right.
Of course I am.
And so much so.
And even more so knowing that the girl was dead.
Why was she dead?
Why is that?
Maybe it's
because all 3 had compelling reasons not to call the police.
Eh?
-You stay out of this, you little brat.
-But...
May I know who this nano with the glasses is?
Why do they let these kids stick their noses in?
It just so happens that these kids were the first to arrive
and discover the corpse.
Well, now I would like to question them, but separately, of course.
Gentlemen, please enter the apartment one at a time.
We will begin the interrogation.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I have a good alibi.
Yes.
An alibi?
The Yasue was supposed to deposit the money at two o'clock,
but when I went to check the cashier,
I saw that she still hadn't made the deposit.
So I came straight home to get it.
Ah.
I saw that it had hung up and I got really scared.
And then I went back to the ATM.
Today is the day they charge the credit card fees,
and I had to deposit the money I had on hand.
And this is the alibi you say?
Yes, of course, because every ATM has a camera, right?
If they check the time that I left the ATM and I came here
and calculate the time it took me to walk all this way,
you'll see that I didn't have material time to commit murder.
I don't know if it can be considered a solid alibi,
but it may help us.
And this bank where you say you have gone, is it near here?
Yes.
It's that close.
It's not far.
Well, we'll go right now to confirm it.
Yes.
Understood.
So far.
Do you mind if I make a cigarette while we wait?
I have a portable ashtray;
I won't be smoking.
No, I don't mind.
But make sure the ash doesn't blow away.
It's very windy.
Yes.
"What flame!"
(Coughs)
-No, don't worry.
(Coughs) -Excuse me.
Does the smoke bother you?
Hey, you said you didn't remember...
the order in which the three men entered the apartment, did you?
Hm.
No.
But I'm absolutely sure it was them.
Well, we'll have no choice...
but to interrogate them thoroughly to find out the intricacies of the case.
All right, let's see...
And you made sure it was the only camera in the bank?
Yes.
Ah.
I didn't know you could smoke in here.
Hm.
Well, I'll have one too.
Look, Inspector, it took you 40 minutes to get to and from the ATM.
So it's no alibi for you.
In reality, however, it doesn't take 20 minutes to get there and back.
So why has he explained all this to us?
He tried to escape several times along the way.
-Merda.
-Maybe that's what he wanted to do.
-Ah, thank you.
-Here, look, use this one.
Oh, man.
No need to look at me like that, man.
I won't run away again.
It was a joke, they have no sense of humor.
Uh... (coughs)
(Coughs)
(coughs) Eh?
(coughs) What?
Hey, why don't we cut to the chase and start the interrogations?
(coughs) Huh?
Yeah, right now.
What? What? What? What?
For me?
Uh, we'll start with you, then.
All right, then.
All right, we got it.
We got it.
Let's go.
"I got it!"
("Kimi and no use", Valshe)

Did you get anything?
Yes, and I think I know how everything went.
And I already know who this kid is.
Do you?
Listen, Takagi.
It's not for nothing,
but I think you should search the apartment more thoroughly.
Huh?

I think the 500,000 yen that is missing is still there.
And another thing...
What?
Could you lend me 20,000 yen?
