Good.
I have assembled everyone as you asked.
Does the site look good to you?
It's one of my properties now,
and it looks like it used to be some kind of scientific laboratory.
There's no danger of anyone sitting in on us from the outside,
so we can talk with all the freedom in the world.
So, is it true that you have found out?
Do you already know who tried to assassinate me?
Do you already know which of these three suspects
is the culprit of the assassination attempt?
Ahem!
Of course I've figured it out.
I already know which of these three people tried to kill you.
There is no impossible mystery for me, in Kogoro Mouri.
I promise you that I will reveal the only truth right now.
He-he!
"A new day begins with a splendid sun."
"It is the hour of love and mysteries."
"Thanks to you we have reached episode 900."
"Do you think it has changed, in Kogoro?
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"Show in a locked room"
Last night, Mr. Azuma came to see me in my office...
to commission an investigation.
He had reason to believe that someone was trying to kill him.
Have you received death threats over the phone?
Yes.
One person told me he wanted to... kill me.
Maybe it was just a threat, though.
Yes, Mr. Azuma, but we have to be prepared in case it's true.
You see, don't you, that my secretary is more worried than I am?
That's why we've come to ask you
to investigate who made the threatening call.
I suspect it must have been one of those three people.
All three have reason to resent the president.
I'm taking over.
You have a list of suspects.
Could you fill out this form, please?
If the great Kogoro Mouri takes charge of the investigation,
I'm sure we'll soon have the problem solved.
Hm.
I hope you are right.
I decided that I would start investigating the next day,
that is, first thing in the morning.
Mr. Azuma had been pressuring me for some time now
to force me to sell him this land.
My wife, who did not agree,
died the other day in an accident and I finally gave in.
But I have discovered something.
I think Mr. Azuma is involved in my wife's death.
What?
And that's why you tried to stab him?
Hey, it wasn't me who tried to kill him.
I thought I said that before.
Mm...
It wasn't me,
but I understand perfectly well that they want to kill him.
I had a piece of land that I had inherited from my father...
and he stole it from me, he's an unscrupulous bastard.
Oh!
(Think: Shinichi voice) "Him too? But what's going on here?"
And is it possible that his father sold the land to Mr. Azuma?
I don't think so, unless the money is missing.
Mm...
I get it.
Listen, Miss Tomorai,
is it true that you have reason to resent Mr. Azuma?
Yes.
The father committed suicide when Mr. Azuma took a piece of land from him
that had always belonged to the family.
It comforts me to think
that murderers always end up getting the punishment they deserve.
Eh?
It's true that the three of them had motives
for wanting to kill Mr. Azuma, but I didn't have any proof.
But then, what were threats so far have come true.
(Kasai) I'm really sorry.
I shouldn't have moved from your side, Mr. President.
-Yes, but...
-It wasn't your fault.
I told Haruhiko to go buy four things.

"It was as if he expected me to be left alone."
Huh?
"He was wearing a ski mask."
Ah!
Aaah...!
And what did the police tell you?
-How?
-They don't know anything, I haven't told them.
I prefer that the police keep their noses out of my business.
Apart from the company, I have businesses that are not entirely transparent.
And now!
An attempted murder must be reported.
What kind of detective are you?
Can't you solve the case without the police?
IIH...
I'm eager to find out which of the 3 suspects is the culprit.
I plan to offer him money to leave me alone.
(Kogoro) "I went to the place where Mr. Azuma was attacked."
"The security camera in the parking lot was out of order."
So I was unable to review the footage of the attack.
Darn.
I know that one of you three is responsible for what happened to me.
-Don't be alarmed.
-I want you to confess right now!
After a while, I went to your company...
and talked to one of the employees, Miss Suematsu.
But Mr. Mouri didn't ask me anything.
Mouri didn't ask me anything about these three people.
Ha-ha!
No, and now, they have no problem.
In fact, they are very well matched.
They're always whispering little secrets in each other's ears.
Mm...
That's how I found out the culprit's motive.
Mr. Kasai, you seem to have committed many irregularities...
since you've been working for Mr. Azuma.
You can't do business without getting your hands dirty.
(Kogoro) But things have changed.
I understand that your sister...
was recently offered a very prestigious job at a reputable bank.
I didn't think it couldn't be explained.
If all her illegal acts were to come to light,
his sister would not be eligible for this job she was so excited about.
That's why she tried to kill the only person who knows her secrets.
-Was it you?
-I-I...
And now!
So in the end it was him, the guilty one?
He's responsible for everything that happened to us.
That's a lie.
It wasn't me.
In we have a proof: it comes out to the images of a security camera.
But didn't you just say that the security camera was out of order?
The one in the parking lot was out of order, yes.
"But then I went to a supermarket
that's very close by and they let me see the footage."
Look.
Isn't this Mr. Kasai?
He must be buying the things he's been asked to buy by the... Oh.
But this is...
Oh.
A ski mask.
So, these three are...?
I think that's clear enough, isn't it?
These three people have nothing to do with the... Aah!
-Aaah...!
-Oh!
At last.
We've got him here!
The Sleeping Kogoro.
(Kogoro voice) Don Kasai has attacked the chairman, yes.
But he has only done so by obeying the orders of a third person.
Oh.
Someone ordered him to do it?
Who was it?
Suppose Mr. Kasai had the intention
to kill Mr. Azuma from the beginning.
He would have done it discreetly, without publicly threatening.
He would have had plenty of opportunities to try.
Therefore, the author of the threats was not Mr. Kasai.
It is clear that if he has tried to kill Mr. Azuma,
he did not do it on his own initiative,
but because he was ordered to do so by someone else.
Someone must have threatened him after I was commissioned to conduct the investigation.
Otherwise, the secretary would not have been so insistent that I see a detective.
"Mr. Kasai must have received some kind of threat last night."
" 'I will report all the crimes you have committed,' he must have been told."
" 'Your sister will be involved."
" 'If you want to protect her, you must kill Mr. Azuma'."
Isn't that right, Mr. Yamanami?
Eh?
Earlier, when I came to talk to you,
I noticed that you had a very expensive pen in your hand.
"It was Mr. Kasai's pen."
"He must have dropped it last night, after you threatened her,
and he kept it."
You can't accuse me just because, coincidentally,
I have the same pen as him.
-You shut up!
-I told you I didn't want to do it.
(Kogoro) In order not to get his hands dirty, he used Mr. Kasai...
and threatened Mr. Azuma over the phone.
The threat would focus suspicion on the three of you.

In the meantime, Mr. Kasai would have a free hand...
to assassinate the president.
Ha.
You've finally unmasked me, Kogoro Mouri.
I'll have to use my last resort.
-Oh!
-Oh!
Ha-ha-ha!
It was all set up to deceive you, Mr. Mouri.
"I thought so."
Tatan!
The hidden camera was a success!
Our goal was for you to discover the culprit of a fabricated crime.
And to see the face that famous detectives make
when the culprit is about to detonate an explosive belt.
In reality, we are all actors.
We have limited ourselves to interpreting the script we had.
(Kogoro) A hidden camera, huh.
That explains it all.
Hm?
You don't look very surprised, Mr. Mouri.
In fact, I figured something was up...
when Mr. Azuma refused to call the police.
Ha-ha-ha!
And the strange attitude of Mr. Yamanami and Mr. Kita
only makes sense if they were playing a role
in front of a hidden camera.
He's a great detective.
We are actors from a very small theater company.
The person who has hired us for this work
is Miss Tomorai from Nichiuri TV.
She also wrote the script.
Yes, we are used to doing comedy plays,
and it was quite a challenge to participate in this program.
Anyway, if you had any suspicions that something was going on
that something strange was going on,
I guess we can't say it was a success.
-Hurray!
-Don't worry, it went very well.
I'm much calmer.
Au, we can leave now.
- (Suematsu) Shall we have a barbecue...?
- (Kasai) Yes, that's it.
"Who is she, really?"
(Suematsu) Wow.
The door won't open, Miss Tomorai.
Oh, man.
I can't take off my belt.
Hey, is there someone from the film crew?
Can you help him take off his belt?
(Tomorai) No need to call them.
There's no one else in here.
(Tomorai) Eh?
The real show...
is about to begin.
This hidden camera story was a lie from the beginning.
There's no film crew recording the footage...
and, evidently, I don't work at Nichiuri TV.
Aah!
(Tomorai) It's closed.
I couldn't run the risk of you escaping and alerting the police.
- (Tomorai) Of course not.
(Tomorai) -Merda, there is no coverage.
The walls block the signal of the mobiles.
I searched everywhere for two months
until I found the ideal location
to run this detective.
What are you talking about?
"Execute him?"
"I won't allow it. I didn't remember. I have the slippers in the workshop."
You just have to be quiet and watch the show,
if you don't want to see your partner explode.
In the dynamite that is wrapped around his body.
I have installed the same detonator.
What a ?
So, this belt is not part of the props?
"Shit. What do I do now?"
Eh?
(dripping)
(dripping) Oh.
Please, Mr. Mouri, do something.
-Mr. Mouri...
-Tregui'ns here.
Stand back.
Or you'll get a stray bullet.
Aaah!
Why do you want to execute me?
I'd like to know what I've done to you, me.
And who are you?
Come on, let's see if you can guess.
They say you're the best detective in the world.
You obviously resent me very much.
She's armed with a gun and an arsenal of explosives,
so she could have been trying to kill me on the street at night
or planted a bomb in my office.
But she has gone to the trouble of inventing a program,
write a script and make me solve a case
because you wanted to talk to the Sleeping Kogoro, I guess.
You have nothing against Kogoro Mouri,
you just want revenge on the Sleeping Kogoro.
Mm-hm.
And you say you've been making preparations for two months, right?
Two months?
It comforts me to think that murderers always end up getting punished.
I know who she is.
She must be Takashi Utsubo's girlfriend.
Ha.
I knew the Sleeping Kogoro wouldn't fail.
Then I promised I'd get revenge.
If it hadn't been for his brilliant deduction,
en Takashi wouldn't have had to go to jail and now he would still be alive.
That's true.
I remember her.
You didn't know him, but in Takashi he was a good man.
As handsome as he was intelligent.

But he used intelligence the wrong way.
"Six months ago, this man committed a murder....
and tricked us by pretending it was a suicide."
"The Sleeping Kogoro solved the case
and he was arrested for murder."
(Tomorai) Two months ago, the poor man caught a serious illness...
and died in prison while serving his sentence.
You robbed me in Takashi, you took me forever.
The Sleeping Kogoro was not to blame.
Silence.
I already suspected it, that it was all a set-up.
What I never imagined
was that there was another plan behind the set-up.
I had to wait for Sleeping Kogoro to come out to execute it.
I feel a little sorry for him,
but there's no greater irony than killing a cocky detective
while he's pimping and proudly explaining the truth about
the truth about some random case.
Hey, you guys.
Stay tuned.
I've locked you in here because I want you to be witnesses
the last moments of Kogoro Mouri's life
and I can explain them all.
Farewell, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro.
Give my regards to Takashi for me.
Atuuuri s!
Eh?
Eh?
Don't shoot him, please!
Please don't shoot him!
Get out of the way.
If you don't, you'll end up getting it too.
What's that?
You plan to shoot a child?
Please don't shoot.
The kid didn't do anything to you.
He hasn't.
Ugh...
Listen to me.
If you don't back off, I'll blow up the belt this man is wearing.
Aaah!
But...
I've got it.
You guys are actors.
I need you to make this girl laugh.
What?!
If you can make her laugh,
I'm sure she'll realize this whole thing she's doing is bullshit.
We can try it with our next play.
She's hilarious.
Come on, let's go!
(gunshot)
Don't strain yourselves.
Right now I don't have time to waste
with whatever nonsense I do on stage.
Hm...
"It didn't work."
Come on, get out of the way at once!
It won't do you any good to try to buy time, I won't give up.
And no one will come to the rescue.
AAAI, a beetle!
A rat!
A snake!
A centipede!
A wasp!
Aaah!
If it dies in Kogoro, I'm lost.
I don't think I'll ever be able to go to school again
and I won't have money to buy food.
Oh...
Please, I beg you not to kill him.
It would be very upsetting for your family.
(Cries)
You must have a family that loves you too.
Show a little humanity, please.
If you kill this man, you will regret it.
There's still time, let it go.
You will drop the gun and the detonator, won't you?
Please, please don't kill in Kogoro.
I beg you.
Please don't kill in Kogoro.
Please don't kill...
(Tomorai) Get up.
What I hate most in the world are melodramatic shows.
-(Tomorai) Huh?
-They're vulgar.
"I guess that's enough."
Aaah!
He'll shoot him!
He'll shoot Kogoro and kill him!
He'll kill!
He'll kill Kogoro!
(Gun: loading)
I won't let you!
Ah!
Oh!
I couldn't allow it.
You won't get away with it.
Marrec liar!
Aaah!
Get off me!
Get out of the way!
(Kogoro: Shit!)
(Kogoro: yawns)
RECO.
What's this commotion, eh?
Why are they calling so much?
Hm?
I'm out of time.
Hey, you.
All your protests, tears and comedy earlier...
I guess you just did it to buy time
while the bottle was filling up with water, right?
Of course I did.
Hey.
Buying time for what?
What are you talking about?
Ah... this...
And what do they all do?
What's gotten into them?
- (Azuma) That's right.
-You saved his life, Mr. Mouri.
We just finished the job.
