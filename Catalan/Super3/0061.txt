DETECTIVE CONAN
Afan s, mayor!
-What is this? -It's a boat!
But isn't it...?
Isn't it the ship that sank in the storm 7 years ago?
Prepare the boats!
-Yes, sir!
(Think) "This ship was carrying
almost 1 billion yen in gold nuggets."
-What, like? -There doesn't seem to be any, sir.
It can't be.
Where must it be, the treasure?
How can it be that it's turned up now, after all this time?
-It looks like a ghost ship.
-A ghost ship?
What if it was the pirates' curse?
Don't be an ass!
All these curses are superstitions!
The case of the ghost ship murder, part one.
Everything is going very well.
We will arrive in Shikijima in about 3 hours.
I want to thank you for deigning to come and do a lecture.
Man, this island is the ass-end of the world.
Ha-ha-ha!
Ay, ay, ay!
Mr. Kinoshita,
didn't they find a ship that sank seven years ago...
loaded with 1 billion yen worth of gold nuggets?
Yes.
Many people say it could be a ghost ship.
But they haven't found the treasure, have they?
No.
In fact, no one knows for sure if this treasure exists.
But the mayor is happy,
because thanks to the ship our island has become famous.
Famous thanks to a ghost ship?
Of course, it is not the only attraction and the island.
Having famous people like you come here also helps, Mr. detective.
Ah!
Even on this little island they have heard of me?
And of course!
You are the most famous detective in the world, think that...
Uh... who is this?
He is a representative of a travel agency in Tokyo.
He has proposed to organize a sightseeing trip
based on the ghost ship and its treasure.
Aaaah...
-They're coming!
-It's Detective Mouri!
-A real detective! -Hello!
-Welcome! -Hello!
-Hello, Detective Mouri! -Me-you!
-Run, come on!
Hello! It's detective Mouri!
-A detective! -To God.
Oh, my goodness!
What a splendid reception!
Hello, Mr. Mouri!
Thank you for coming!
I am the mayor of the village.
Welcome to Shikijima Island!
We are very happy.
Ah, hello everyone!
(Girl) This little man is so little famous?
Being so famous, I thought he would be a refined man.
You ill-mannered brat!
Suzu, you must be polite to my guest!
Mm?
Ah... What a pretty girl.
What's the matter?
What's your name?
Conan... Conan Edogawa.
What a funny name... so funny.
Is it a normal name, in Tokyo?
(thinks) "What does it say?"
It's the same.
My name is Suzu Mikami!
And I think I'm a little bigger than you.
What's that?
It's fashionable to date a smaller boy!
Aparteu's-e.
He's the one from the travel agency.
My name is Uehara, from "Pelarchi Travel", nice to meet you.
Welcome, Mr. Uehara.
If it's to encourage tourism, I'll provide you with everything you need.
-Where is it, the ghost ship? -Huh?
This is it, the ghost ship.
Hey... hey!
If you want, I'll show it to you.
No, thank you.
It's not necessary.
You don't need to come with me.
For a ship that has been sunk
there are no barnacles attached, apart from the keel.
Don't be an ass, that's why it's a ghost ship.
(Think) "It's so unscientific."
(Mayor) Help yourself, Mr. Mouri.
You still have time, before you do the lecture.
Ah, thank you!
(Mayor) Oh!
(Mayor) It's delicious!
This seafood is really bo.
Hmmm!
Yes.
By the way, I'd like to get your opinion on something, later.
You want me to find out where the Ryujinmaru sank, right?
What an intuition!
It seems to me that it sank near this island.
If we were to find out, we might be able to find the lost treasure, Mr.
Mouri.

He knows that even if he found the treasure he could not keep it.
It would end up being confiscated by the government of the country.
But aren't we entitled to 10% of the treasure, according to the law?
Ah, it could be...
Please, Mr. Mouri, help us.
I am not interested!
Searching for treasure does not do it for me.
And if you were to receive 10% of what corresponds to the island?
-I'm interested!
-Ah!
Thank you very much!
Kinoshita, explain all the details.
Yes, sir.
It was a sad stormy night 7 years ago.
The Ryujinmaru sent out a distress signal
when it was about a kilometer or so from the island.
But the signal mysteriously disappeared
before we could make any attempt to rescue it.
The next morning, we found only the corpse of the captain.
Never again did we find neither the gold nor any other object.
And... who was he, the owner of the treasure?
The owner was the captain we found drowned.
As he was about to be arrested for not paying taxes,
he traded the treasure for gold nuggets.
Mm... I get it.
Very good!
In Kogoro Mouri will find out where the gold nuggets went!
Oh, I trust you!
I trust you!
(Adult voice) Let's see if he'll be able to make the lecture, in Kogoro.
"Institute of historical compilations of marine soldiers."
Gee!
The head armor!
Eh?
Is it interesting?
Yes.
There are really curious things, here.
Yes, they are a very important cultural heritage of the island.
400 years ago, some marine soldiers
who had been defeated in a battle,
fled to this island.
But the islanders who were dazzled by the reward they paid for those
by the reward they were paying for those soldiers,
attacked them.
And finally they cornered them in a cave in a remote area,
and once there, they killed them all without mercy.
Since then, very unfortunate things have happened.
A curse?
Yes.
They go ferr a temple inside the cave for the spirits of the soldiers.
But these are just superstitions, right?
You can't say it's just superstitions.
Many islanders claim to have seen the ghosts of soldiers in the woods near the cave.
the woods near the cave.
And they say that some nights they hear some chilling screams
coming from inside the cave.
5 years ago, a very called professor came
to do a study on the missing marine soldiers.
He wanted to go inside and explore the soldiers' cave
without heeding the warnings of the people on the island.
And one night, after two or three days?
It was the professor?
Yes it was, or seemed to be, although we could not confirm it.
That professor disappeared
and since then, no one has come near the cave.
It is absurd, to believe this nonsense in the times we live in.
Suzu!
Yes, sir, they are besties.
The father said the professor must not have found anything and left.
Come on, Conan, I'll take you somewhere fun!
Just a moment!
Where are we going?
We'll sneak behind the stage, this way!
We'll see him rather!
What's wrong with him? Who's this?
He's the lighthouse keeper, in Hamada.
He's a strange man.
Strange?
He doesn't socialize much with people.
He's been seen walking around near the soldiers' cave.
-It's been a long time, Aoki. Oh!
Have you forgotten my face?
I don't think so.
I do not know what s'empatolla.
I live in the lighthouse, and I say Hamada.
You bastard!
You have the wrong person.
Let me go!
I will reveal your true identity, Aoki!
I present to you the world's most famous detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri!
Oh, my gosh!
Hello!
Hello!
I don't know how he's going to do it, so drunk.
(At the same time) How embarrassing!
It seems to me that he is a little nervous, Mr. Mouri.
Let Mr. Mouri open the celebratory balloon
to commemorate his kind visit.
Go ahead, Mr. Mouri.
I've got it!
(Thinking) "It smells..."
"It smells like gasoline!"
"Kogoro!"
Kogoro!
One, two...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ah!
I'm burning!
Father!
It's the curse!
The curse of the soldiers!
-Yes, it's the curse!
God help us!
(He thinks) "I get it."
"I was prepared so that when I pulled the string
it would ignite the gasoline."
His target was...
...Kogoro!

"The main suspects are in Hamada,
the lighthouse keeper who went out the back."
"And on Uehara, from the agency that was arguing with him."
"Maybe this has some connection with the ghost ship."
Mr. Mikami, what does it mean, this ?!
Nothing happened to me, but it would have been unfortunate.
I'm very sorry that you were involved in this accident,
very serious... very bad.
Accident?
Look, sir, it is obvious that you were prepared.
No, a spark ignited the gasoline that just happened to be there.
But... But... But... But... But... But... But...
I have no doubt about it!
You, you don't want the police to investigate this incident, do you?
Ha-ha... Of course I do.
You have no intention of giving the gold nuggets to the police.
If police came outside, I should give them to you.
Concentrate on locating the straws, without making deductions.
What do you mean?
I don't know if you will be able to leave safely if you don't follow orders.
I won't allow you to threaten me, understood?!
It is not necessary.
The ferry will not leave the island without my permission.
Think it over, tonight, please.
Shit!
I don't think we should have come.
Oh, Mr.
Kinoshita!
I'm sorry about that.
Mr.
Mikami wants to find the treasure
and turn this island into a tourist destination.
How disgusting!
But don't worry.
I'll see to it that you can leave the island tomorrow.
I'll be able to get you a fishing boat.
What a rest!
Ah, no, we're not leaving! Father!
Think about it!
If you stay here, you'll be in great danger!
I don't want him to think I'm running away because he scared me!
I'm staying!
(Think) "That's the way I like it, Kogoro!"
Mr. Kinoshita!
What do you know about Mr. Hamada?
What do you know, about Mr. Hamada?
You mean the lighthouse keeper? Yes.
Well... Mr. Hamada is not originally from the island.
The townspeople say
that shortly after the Ryujinmaru accident,
he came here saying he was looking for work.
Since we didn't have any watchman around the lighthouse,
the mayor hired him.
Aaaah...
Why are you interested in Hamada?
Ah no... I just thought he was a strange man.
Good bye!
Yoko, my love...
(Think) "It's in Hamada?"
Do you know who I am?
Don't give me these scares!
Little children should not go out alone, at this hour!
I've come to keep an eye on you!
Hey!
What's gotten into you?
We shouldn't do these things yet.
Xxxxxt!
(Think) "Mr. Uehara."
"Who was that, the man I saw just now?"
"And now!"
Why was he looking for a house, that man?
This smell...
Gasoline.
(Thinks) "So it's in Hamada, what he tried to kill in Kogoro."
Don't leave without warning!
(Think) "What was he doing here?"
"A telescope?"
Don't strain yourself.
It's not worth it.
It's focused on the mountains, you won't see anything interesting.
"What's strange..."
"A lighthouse telescope should be focused towards the sea."
"This telescope is focused towards the mountains."
Eh?
What's the matter?
"The Ryujinmaru!"
"I have no doubt."
"Mr. Hamada has some connection with the Ryujinmaru!"
"And he has some reason for not wanting it to be discovered."
"In Kogoro and Ran could be in danger!"
Again!?
Hey, wait for me!
Is it daylight already?
Aaaaah!
What... what's wrong!?
Who are you?
What is it, father?
Oh!
Ran, don't move!
Don't run, you bastard!
Watch out, Father!
Where is he, Conan?
Don't run!
Shit!
Aiiiiiii!
My ass hurts when I run!
Don't run away!
Now you'll see!
You bet, I'll find you.
Ouch!
Where were you?
I was worried about you! Nothing happened?
Of course nothing happened!
A ghost soldier has attacked the father!
What are you saying?!
(chimes)
What's that? The port bell.
They ring it when some misfortune happens.
Hell no! Conan!
Ah!
Hey, gentlemen, what happened?
(Kogoro) Help, let me go!
You're wrong! Kogoro?
Father!
What the hell's going on, here!?
The detective has murdered Mr. Hamada, the lighthouse keeper.
My father?
Yes, yes, look for yourselves!

When I arrived, the detective was on the floor passed out,
and everything was like this.
Believe me!
It wasn't me!
We won't forgive him!
The god of the marines is angry because of the outsiders!
(He thinks) "In Kogoro he is incapable of doing something like that!"
"I have to do something!"
