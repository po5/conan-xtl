Thanks for waiting for us, Conan.
Have you been paid for the investigation?
Yes!
I've been paid in a lot of money!
My bankbook is filled to the brim!
Congratulations!
We'll be able to go out to eat somewhere special!
It's been ages since I've had a drink!
We were talking about going out to eat, nothing more.
I have to go and get a new notebook....
(Thinking) I can see your feather duster...
The window...
Oh!
Ah!
What a hottie!
-Miss... -Huh?
Hello.
Would you mind, uh, exchanging this notebook for a new one?
You'll have to excuse me, but...
Would it do you any good to take a number and wait until it's your turn?
Sure, we have to go in order, in order, it's very important!
Yes.
I'll be back in a jiffy.
One number, one number!
Hello, Miss Hirota!
Ah, Conan!
What's the matter?
He keeps looking at his watch.
What's the matter?
Ah... it's just that I'm busy
and I thought it was getting to be time for lunch.
I'll see you around.
You know her, Conan?
Yes.
Her name is Masami Hirota.
She hasn't been working at the bank long.
She's usually much nicer.
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
She's not... That girl is not...
It's not right!
Ran, she's still got a while, I'm going out, okay?
Yes.
Watch out for cars.
(knocks)
(Thinks) "The bank's parking lot."
(Salvo and brittle)
"And that noise?"
"An armored car robbery!"
"It's two robbers."
"One with a shotgun and the other with a pistol."
"And the other guards?"
"Are they dead?! I can't tell from here."
Conan!
What are you doing back here? Let's go, let's go.
We're leaving!
What's going on?
Aaaa...
Help me, please!
We're being mugged!
What does he think he's doing, this animal?!
They've robbed the armored car!
What?! Ran, call the police!
There are wounded, call for an ambulance!
Ran, go to the bank and tell them what happened!
(Thinking) "What a way to run, this looks like a race!"
"I'll have to put my foot down!"
"A level crossing!"
"It's closing! Very good!"
"They want to pass caregant do it to them?! No way!"
"I won't let you run away!"
Damn it, I've escaped!
(Kogoro) What the hell?!
They've taken a loot of... 10 million?!
They have stolen the money they had to distribute to the branches.
10 million!
Conan, are you sure the car's license plate number is correct?
I'm sure, inspector.
Two armed robbers with a shotgun and a pistol.
Well, fortunately the guards only have minor injuries.
We had stopped the armored car
and was getting everything ready to unload the money.
Then, all of a sudden...
Oyama!
Murata!
Isn't he here in front?
Since I didn't get a reply from the driver,
I thought they were dead and opened the door.
(Thinking) "That's strange..."
"At that moment I felt a tear
and a glass breaking,
I ran to the entrance of the parking lot and peeked in."
"Then, they had started loading the loot."
"Surely you didn't have time to warn them!"
You understand that too, don't you?
I didn't know what to do!
Excuse me, sir...
You have very good luck.
Eh?
Why do you say so?!
The windows of the armored vans are smoked
to prevent you from seeing inside, right?
Yes.
The windows have been shot out,
and also not to touch it,

was able to get behind a sack so that he wouldn't be touched.
That's lucky.
Or maybe he had already decided
that he had to hide where the sack of coins was.
Don't talk nonsense.
(He thinks) "It's still premature,
but I have no choice but to go by this deduction."
Miss Hirota!
Where were you at such a critical moment!
Excuse me, it was my lunch time....
What are you young girls thinking about nowadays?
What time do they think it is?!
What's wrong with your watch?
It looks like we have another possibility..."
Inspector Megure!
Tell me, Takagi?
What have you got?
They've discovered a car, it could be the getaway car.
What?!
Where did they find it?
On the bank of the Teimuzu River, under the bridge.
We're coming right away.
You come too, Mouri.
Yes, inspector!
Ran, go on home!
What, we're going back?
What?
Conan... Conan?!
Oh, my!
He's disappeared again!
Mr. Tome, how do we have the situation?
Ah, Inspector Megure!
Looks like they cleaned up the footprints very carefully.
Did they leave any items unattended?
Well, the bulkiest we've found are 5 aluminum suitcases.
Of footprints found, cap.
And also...
Hey, carry those bags!
We found it lying on the driver's seat.
Thanks for that.
That's it.
This is...
A ski mask and some gloves.
Although we can't expect prints to come off either.
-Oh! -Oh!
You're here, too, kiddo? -Noiet? -Noiet?
Hello, Mr. Tome!
Naaaaaaano!
I told you to go back to the Ran!
On the inside of the balaclava there's something.
On the inside?
What is it, this pink spot?
(thinks) "I'm sure this pink..."
"But why? Come on!"
Let me! Eh ?!
But...
(Thinks) I knew it!
Ouch!
Too bad!
Do not protest!
What are you doing, with an important test?!
Stop it, that color!
"The case was considered a case of ordinary robbery
and investigations were initiated."
"But it was no ordinary robbery."
"It didn't take me long to see that my presentiments were real."
What?
That the perpetrator of that robbery was murdered?
Yes.
He was a former athletic runner named Shiro Kaizuka.
He was murdered yesterday at his home.
(Think) former runner... That's how you can understand that speed.
How did they know he was the robber?
In the apartment, they found a map of the area where the bank was robbed.
In addition, there was the schedule of the armored car and the escape plan.
With the same gun with which he was murdered,
another person was killed yesterday.
Security guard Kishii!
So, Mr. Kishii is also a perpetrator?
There is no doubt that he was his accomplice.
He liked gambling and was up to his neck in debt.
He had to make it look as if she had been threatened
and his role was to open the cash box in the van,
since it couldn't be opened from the outside.
It could be that they were both killed by the other robber, right?
That's likely.
Since we haven't found the money, we think he wanted to keep the loot,
and that's why he killed the other two.
Inspector Megure follows this line.
It's only a matter of time before she's caught.
What do you mean by that?
A pink lipstick was found in Kaizuka's apartment.
Lipstick?
It matches the stain on the ski mask.
And also...
It's identical to Masami Hirota's lipstick from the bank.
Conan, what do you say?
Confirmation that it's the same lipstick that Masami was wearing,
was given to us by her classmates.
(Kogoro) "With the excuse of food, he went out the back,
and added to the robbery started by Kaizuka."
But working at the bank, why did he do it?
This we do not know,
but the fact is that he has stopped working.
Today he said goodbye.
What did he do?
He had been working for 6 months and all of a sudden he disappeared.
What do you mean?
He had infiltrated to plan everything for the robbery.
So he didn't arouse any suspicion.
You can put it this way...
(thinks) "Certainly, we could make this reading."
"But I have a very big doubt."
"Is it credible, that he left his balaclava smeared with lipstick?

"Would such a perfectionist offender get it so wrong?"
"Besides, the spot marked with the lipstick
doesn't match the mouth."
"It's too low. It would be at the level of the chin."
"And, if you're going to split hairs,
if she wore the balaclava,
it should smell like cosmetics, but it didn't."
"And if a someone has schemed it all to endorse the crimes?"
"We're not doing well!"
Hey!
Conan, where are you going?
Leave it, leave it alone.
Yes, say?
I'm in Megure.
Ah, it's you, Mouri!
The address of the Masami Hirota?
We've already finished the investigations.
(Kogoro voice) Yes, I know, but I need to check something.
I've found it!
It's this apartment!
Think...
(Think) "If my deductions are correct,
Masami is in danger."
"There's nothing to give me a clue?"
"What's this? The plug is covered with the table."
"She hasn't hidden it? Could it be that..."
"This is..."
"This is the key to a locker?"
"It must be from the place where he's hiding the money they stole."
Ah!
Aaaah!
Don't... don't go, Miss Masami Hirota.
If you go, you will be killed.
Thank you.
Excuse me, Conan.
Wait!
(Thinking) "Shit, there's no one."
"I see her! It's over there!"
"All right, with this transmitter and these suspenders..."
"Very good."
"Paste-te!"
"Perfect!"
"Fantastic, it works! I won't let her run away!"
"I'm absolutely sure someone is using it!"
"But who must be doing it? Who's pulling the strings?"
Where have you got to?
Come out where you are!
(Man) You've done a good job, Masami Hirota...
No...
Akemi Miyano!
One question: why did you murder those men?
This is our way of doing it.
Au, now will you give us the money?
I have it in a safe place.
What?!
First, my sister!
Bring me my sister!
You promised me that when the job was done
my sister and I could leave the organization!
This request is inadmissible.
She is the most eminent brain we have within the Organization.
Unlike you, your sister is indispensable.
So, from the beginning...
We give you the last chance, tell us where the money is.
How trusting!
If I'm murdered, you'll never know where I've got it.
It is you, who trusts.
Only that you have the key to a slogan, we will know.
Besides, I warned you that it was your last chance.
Features ?!
There! (Gunshots)
(Adult voice) Miss Masami!
Don't die, Miss Masami!
Co... Conan... What are you doing here?
I stuck a transmitter in your car earlier.
I was sure he would meet
with the people who run everything from the shadows.
If you had told me everything...
Who... Who are you?!
In Conan Edogawa... No.
Shinichi Kudo, a detective.
In... Shinichi Kudo, is that you?
Of course it is... Yes, I've heard of you.
The two men I hired were killed.
I'm also living under the Organization's tutelage.
The Organization?
It's a powerful organization shrouded in mystery.
I'm just an ordinary subordinate.
All I know is that black is their color.
Black?
Yes.
The Organization likes it and they always wear black dresses.
Will you do one last thing... I'll ask you?
It has, the key...
This is the real one.
The one they have is a fake.
It's from a locker in Beika's station locker.
Please, before they find out...
I don't want them to use me anymore.
Check in for me, little detective...
(Telephone tone)

DETECTIVE CONAN
"On the gun, they only found his fingerprints."

"He was considered to have committed suicide because he was unable to flee.
"The 10 million yen from the robbery was recovered
and it looked like the case was closed."
"No! This is not over!"
"I will not forgive them for what they have done!"
"I will catch them with my own hands no matter what!"
"Be that as it may!"
(Think) "A 26-millimeter bullet!"
"With a one-piece steel sheath!"
