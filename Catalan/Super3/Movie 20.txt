Don't lift a finger.
Step away from the monitors and put your hands up.
Hm!
We had anticipated their movements.
Ah!
-Yes, I'm fine.
-Mr. Furuya, are you all right?
(Woman: river)
These eyes... They can't be!
Step aside, Mr. Furuya.
Don't move!
(woman) Stop!
Eh?
Stop!
(Horn)
Don't move!
But how did you think...?
(cars: horns) Eh?
- (cars: horns)
- (wheels: squeak)
Aaaah!
Eh?
What the...?!
Oh!
(wheels: squeak)
Who are you?!
Akai!
(Cars: horns)
Beat it, Akai!
- (horns honking)
-We want to catch her ourselves!
Oooh!
- (crashing)
- (crash)
What the...?
(crashing) Oh!
(crashing) Oh!
Ah... You won't escape!
Oh, shit!
"If I let him get away from me, I'll cause a worldwide catastrophe."
(Cars: horns)
No way!
"Going against direction?"
Rye?
Mm... That's funny.
T'esclafaré!
(Wheels: squeak)
(squeaking)
Akai!
You played me!
(Police, from afar: sirens)
(James) "Say."
(Akai) He's gotten away from us.
Authorize the cleanup operation.
"Okay."
(Festive music)

Oh!
- "(constant whistling)"
- (woman: moans in pain)
(hissing: does not stop)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
THE DETECTIVE CONAN "The blackest nightmare".
"I am the teenage detective Shinichi Kudo."
"One day, I went to the amusement park with Ran Mouri.
"my best friend and classmate,
"And I witnessed a suspicious exchange
between two men dressed in black."
"I was so focused on watching those two men,
that I didn't realize there was another one behind me."
"He made me swallow a poison and, when I woke up, I was so shocked.
(Conan voice)... my body had shrunk!"
"If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
they would want to kill me and the lives of those around me would be in danger."
"That's why Dr. Agasa recommended that I hide my identity.
to hide my identity."
"When the Ran asked me what my name was,
I randomly told him I called myself Conan Edogawa."
"Since Ran's father is a detective,
"I decided to go live with them
to try to get information about the Men in Black."
"By the way, besides Dr. Agasa, there are also other people...
who know my true identity."
"The Ai Haibara is one. In fact, he calls himself Shiho Miyano."
"At first he was a member of the Men in Black organization."
"In order to escape, he decided to take the same poison...
that I was made to swallow and his body shrank."
(Shinichi Voice) "The Men in Black Organization
is shrouded in mystery."
"We know that the codenames of their agents
are based on alcoholic beverages."
"There are several spies from all over the world infiltrating the Organization,
with the mission to discover the identity of its members."
"Such as Rena Mizunashi, an agent of the American CIA," he said.
"Her code name is Kir."
"And also in Zero or Bourbon, the spy Toru Amuro,
of the Public Security Agency of the Japanese police."
"There are other government agencies, such as the FBI,
who are on their own tracking the Men in Black."
"On James Black, the Andre Camel, the Jodie Starling....
And also in Shuichi Akai."
"He's a brilliant FBI agent and, what's more, an expert sniper."
"But he doesn't have an easy relationship with Toru Amuro."
"I'm small, but I have the brains of an adult."
"A detective who solves all mysteries!"
The truth always ends up knowing!
Look, doctor.
I'm all out of bags.
What are you saying?!
You've eaten them all?
- (Genta) Sorry, guys.
-You haven't left anything for us?
You're so focused.
May I know what you're looking at so intently?
Yes, it's just that it's so strange to me...
that they still haven't found the cause
of the general blackout last night.
Watch this!
They're doing a special report on the aquarium where we're going now!
Oh, right, right...
What?
Come on, Conan, let us see it!
I want to see it too...!
My belt won't let me breathe.
Hey, boy!
You can't take the belt off!
Phew!

Well, what a drag, isn't it?
Hold on a little longer, Genta, we should be almost there.
-Yes?
-Hey!
Look, it's starting!
...we offer you some exclusive images
where you can appreciate the great changes that have taken place.
The remodeling has mainly affected three areas of the park.
First of all, it should be noted that all the attractions...
and commercial establishments have been located inside the buildings.
This will allow visitors to enjoy the rides and stroll around the park
and stroll around the grounds without having to worry about the weather or rain.
Another important new feature is the remodeling of the main attraction
is the remodeling of the aquarium's main attraction,
the magnificent dolphin show.
The content of the show, which used to be the most popular one,
has also been redesigned from top to bottom.
With improved displays and acrobatics, the dolphins will surprise and amaze us,
the dolphins will surprise us and give us unforgettable moments.
And finally, the latest and most impressive new feature of this aquarium....
and the most impressive of this completely renovated aquarium..:
the giant Ferris wheel, the only one in the world with two rotating wheels.
The two wheels, which are called the Boreal Wheel and the Southern Wheel...
because they face north and south,
show a different landscape depending on their orientation.
In addition, at the fountains located around the giant Ferris wheel...
a unique spectacle of light and water will take place
which will be even more magical for the spectators
spectators who see it at 100 meters high.
It is a most entertaining proposal.
How about climbing the giant Ferris wheel?
But...
What a great idea!
Didn't we agree to go on the aquarium?
It will be more fun if we go to both places.
Won't it?
-Yes!
We can go to both places.
-Yes!
-What? -What?
-Doctor.
-Oh... -Oh...
You'll buy us tickets, won't you?
(Genta) UAH, it really looks huge!
(Mitsuhiko) Oh, so much!
- (Agasa) We'll be there in 5 minutes.
- (Ayumi) It's amazing!
(Mitsuhiko) Eh?
(Agasa) Ale, we've arrived.
Hi-hi-hi-hi-hi!
(Ayumi) Let's go!
-Don't run so fast, Genta!
-Hurray!
At last! (Ayumi)
(Come on, doctor.
Eagerness!
(Mitsuhiko) Haibara!
And you too, Conan!
Come on, don't dawdle!
Have you thought about where you'd like to go?
In the aquarium or on the Ferris wheel?
-That's not what we said!
-What?
We agreed to go to both places!
First, a riddle.
If you get the right answer,
I'll buy you tickets to both places.
Hold your ears.
When you make this color more intense, without mixing it with any other color,
it becomes something else.
Of these four, can you tell me which one it is?
U: red.
Two: blue.
Three: brown.
Four: black.
Making it more intense?
Eh?
It transforms without mixing it with any other?
AAAA, I have no idea!
Doctor.
Don't be so childish.
If you change the name of these colors, you'll find the answer right away.
(Agasa) Conan, you couldn't participate!
That we change the names?
The deep red is called "Makka".
And of the deep blue, "Masai".
- (Mitsuhiko) I got it!
(Mitsuhiko) -If you women give them so many hints...
The deep brown we call "Macchi", right?
(Mitsuhiko) -Yes!
-It transforms into something else!
Well, I still don't get it.
In Japanese, deep red is "Makka".
In Japanese, deep blue is "Masai".
Intense brown is called "Macchi".
And black, "makkuro".
(Mitsuhiko) Look closely at the brown color, Genta.
(Ayumi) Brown becomes "Macchi".
Ah, that's right!
"Macchi" means "green tea"!
No way!
If you give them so many clues, in the end...
Let's go then!
Let's go buy the tickets!
-Hey, wait!
-Yes!
-I'm not paying for so many tickets.
-Come on, let's go!
Come here!
(Woman) Don't separate from me, guys.
At the Ferris wheel there's a long queue.
-I love the Ferris wheel, it's super big!
-Well, we'll have to wait.
Maybe we'll see home, from above.
(Ai) What's wrong with you?
Hey, where are you going?
Do you need help, miss?
Are you all right?
Your face is dirty.
(Ai) What?
Oh, my gosh!
Ah...

Funny, he has one eye brown and the other blue!
Maybe he doesn't understand our language, Conan.
Don't worry, I do understand you.
Then what's she doing alone in a place like this?
It doesn't look like she came with any friends, does it?
Besides, she's got a lot of wounds.
On her knees and on her hands.
And it looks to me like her cell phone is broken.
Can I see it for a second?
Yeah, sure, sure.
How long have you been sitting on this bench?
-Do you know where she lives and where she came from?
-Well...
I don't know.
What's my name?
Do you know how to say it, miss?
I'm sorry, I just don't know.
-Yes, oh, so much.
-Can I look at your head, please?
The injuries don't look serious, but they're very recent.
He must have been in a car accident and hit his head.
So, then, he must be suffering from amnesia brought on by the injury.
But... how do you know, that he had a car accident?
(Shinichi voice) From his cell phone.
All indications are that he has received a very strong impact.
And, if you look closely, this little piece of glass is from a windshield.
Did he hit his head while driving?
Also, I imagine the car must have been an older model.
Modern cars have a plastic sheet between two layers of glass to keep it from shattering.
to keep it from shattering.
I can also tell from the clothes.
If you smell it, you'll be embarrassed by gasoline.
(Conan voice) Miss.
It does smell bad, yes.
(Conan voice) What?
Ah...
You don't have anything else on you?
Can you show me?
Yes, that.
It has.
(Shinichi voice) I don't know.
What's this?
They look like flash cards.
They're semitransparent cards of different colors.
(Genta) Eeei!
What should they be for?
-Conan, Haibara!
(Genta) -Huh?
The doctor has also bought his tickets!
Anyway, it looks like the quiet is over.
(Mitsuhiko) Hey.
Who is she, this girl with you?
How cool!
She has one blue eye and one brown eye!
How cute!
(Genta) Maybe she has a fake eye.
(Mitsuhiko) What do you say, Genta!
It's called "heterochromia".
Heterochromia?
Some people have strange names, don't they?
(Mitsuhiko) No.
It doesn't mean that the girl's name is like that.
(Ayumi) I remember!
It's the scientific name for marine bones.
-(Ayumi) Didn't I get it right, Conan?
-Of marine bones?
Oops!
Excuse me, guys.
Eh?
Ah...
Did you see that?
Looks like we made him laugh.
-Ugh!
-Yes.
By the way, kids, what were you standing around here for?
You got here just in time.
Apparently, this girl has been in a car accident...
and can't remember who she is or where she lives.
Is it true, Shin...?
Oh, no.
Conan, I mean.
Yes.
Maybe it has something to do with last night's accident.
-Oh!
No!
- (Agasa) We'll call the police.
(Agasa) Huh?
(Agasa) Why not?
How come, you don't want to call the police?
I don't... I don't know.
Well, he'll need help finding his family.
Hey, Conan, don't take pictures of him without permission.
Wait, please!
Look what you've done, Conan!
We're not calling the police.
We need to show a picture of her
to try to find someone who knows her.
Yes.
Someone who knows me?
Maybe we can help her get her memory back.
- (Ayumi) We want to help!
- (Genta) Do you really mean it, Conan?
Because we are...
-Of course we are!
...the Junior Detective League!
Oh...
We'll help you look for your friends,
and I'm sure you'll get your memory back very soon.
(Mitsuhiko) Don't worry, you can trust us.
Thank you.
We should start by looking for someone who knows her.
What to say?
But you didn't want to ride the giant Ferris wheel?
-Huh?
-Now is not the time, doctor!
If we go on the Ferris wheel, we'll lose valuable time.
Well, I had bought you the tickets...
-Come on, let's go.
-Apart from me, doctor.
-Come on, let's go, miss.
-Come on, let's go!
Let's investigate!
(Agasa) Wait, guys!
Don't take it as a game, this is very serious!
Are you really going to call the police?
I don't believe it.

Of course I'll let them know, woman.
(TV: woman) "Last night,
a car driving on track number 11..."
(Kogoro) This is what you get for ordering too much wine.
(Snores)
Father!
Hello, Yoko...
"...but the driver of the vehicle fled from the scene of the accident and..."
Ah!
Ouch!
Oh!
Hey, Father!
Are you going to spend the day sleeping and doing nothing?
Leave me alone!
The brains of great detectives need rest from time to time!
So you have a headache because you drank too much wine yesterday.
But how did you...?
Wait a minute, I didn't say that!
I didn't say that... Ah!
What?
Conan sent me this.
He says he's found a woman with amnesia
and wants you to send her photo to the police.
I've already notified Inspector Takagi,
but it would be nice if you could give us a hand.
Are you listening to me?
What a hottie!
What a hottie!
I just need to know where she is, this damsel.
Got it.
Say-say they're at Toto's Aquarium.
But what are you doing, father?
The great detective Kogoro Mouri accepts the assignment!
Let's go!
But no one asked you to go... Here we are!
Inspector.
These are the photographs Ran sent me.
It's possible that the girl was involved in a traffic accident.
A traffic accident?
There was a major one last night.
And they say the driver is missing.
For such an important one, neither the press nor we...
no clear and detailed information has reached us.
That is why...
We consider it necessary to open an investigation.
What's up?
Do you have any news?
Inspector Megure!
The Third Investigation Division
has no information about the incident either.
What happened?
Oh, my goodness...
Rumor has it that, last night,
someone broke into the Public Security Agency.
-Yes.
-And that's true?
But someone is not interested
that we from the Metropolitan Police are investigating it.
Mmm...
What can it mean?
I have the suspicion that, behind everything,
there is something very big.
(PA: woman) "We remind you that in our commercial establishments you can find a wide range of products of all kinds.
"We would like to remind you that you will find a wide range of products of all kinds in our stores."
"We hope you enjoy your shopping."
Eh?
That's her.
- "Where is it?"
-I've already found it, Gin.
- "To the Aquarium?"
-To Toto's Aquarium.
Yes.
Don't worry, I'll get it back to you right away.
(PA: woman) "Dear visitors:
welcome and thank you very much for coming today."
"Very soon the special dolphin show will start."
I begin to think it was the first time I came in the aquarium.
(Shinichi voice) Yes.
She has very distinctive colored hair and eyes.
It's very strange that no one remembers seeing her.
Where do we go now?
Do you have any idea?
We've already gone through most of the compound.
(Genta) You'll do just fine, Miss!
(Mitsuhiko) It's the last dart we have left, it can't miss!
But what the hell are they doing?
(Triumphant music)
-Oooh!
-Oooh!
Congratulations!
The young lady has obtained the highest score of the day!
-Huh?
-You too, Miss.
Put your hands like this.
I want to high-five you too!
-Bravo!
-Of course...
-Me too!
Now it's my turn.
-Viva!
-Mm?
-She's smiling again!
We like him much better when he smiles than when he's sad.
-Oh, so much.
-Yes!
-Of course he does!
-Really?
As a prize, you can choose three key chains.
-Mill!
-Oooh!
Surely we can choose three?
- (Genta) And I, this one.
- (Ayumi) I want this one!
- (woman) Then bird, this one for you.
- (Mitsuhiko) Then I'll take this one.
-I don't want head, thank you.
- (Ayumi) And for the lady?
-But that's not fair!
-Don't worry about me.
In fact, we wouldn't have won passage without you...
Ah, Conan!
What are you guys doing?
Hello, Ay.
You didn't want to help her get her memory back?
Don't do her any favors if she stays and plays at the first place she finds.
It's just that...
We thought we'd start when we were done playing.
You've seen how cool
these key chains we won thanks to the lady?
"Everything is left for after the game..."

I think we'll have to take care of this area too.
(Agasa) Hey, guys, I'm up here!
Here you are, your beloved Hiroshi!
I'm up here!
(Genta) Why are you calling us from up there, doctor?
There's no line for the giant Ferris wheel now.
If you wanted to go up, it's the ideal time!
Are you serious?
And if we start investigating when we get off the Ferris wheel?
That's a good idea!
Maybe looking at the scenery you'll remember something else.
Let's go, let's go!
Miss.
Let's go to the Ferris wheel, hurry!
Come on, let's go, come on, hurry up!
(Shinishi voice) I'm hallucinating.
We're going to accompany the doctor, who is a big fan of Ferris wheels.
So he's the one who should be the most eager to go up, right?
He-he-he-he.
I'm sure he is.
I'm sorry.
Have you ever seen him before, the girl who played just now?
Huh?
Mm... Who do you mean, the girl with the silver hair?
Yes!
You've never seen him before?
Not really, he didn't ring a bell.
If I'd seen someone with that kind of aim, I'd remember.
"He's stuck all the darts in the center. I doubt it was a fluke."
Wait a minute.
Thanks anyway.
When you see your friend, give her this for me.
Huh?
This is a keychain, isn't it?
It's an unpainted prototype we had left over.
Since it was left without a prize, I thought I'd make it up to her with this.
All that's missing is the paint.
Tell her to paint it in the color she likes.
I agree!
I'm sure she'll be very happy.
They don't deserve it.
Well, thanks for everything.
Come on, Haibara.
Have a great time, guys!
Yes... Where are we going now?
(Shinichi's voice) We'll finish asking about
the spaces that are still under construction
and meet up with the doctor and the others.
The dart thing has me very intrigued.
If we want to find more clues,
we'd better stay close to the girl.
(Girl) I want us to be alone in the cabin!
(Boy) Which one do we go up?
It's very exciting, isn't it?
(Genta) I'm sure you can see a lot of things from up there!
(Ayumi) Let's see if we can see the Bell Tree tower!
What are you doing here?
Oh, come on.
(Genta) Miss!
Don't dawdle, you'll be left behind!
Excuse me, but I thought someone was saying something to me.
-No...
- (Mitsuhiko) Yes?
And you recognized him?
- (man) All right, that's it, everybody?
-I guess I was just imagining it.
(Mitsuhiko) - Well, you can come in now!
-(man) Yes!
Gin, we have to make a change of plans.
There seems to have been a problem.
"Hurry up. We can't leave her hanging around alone much longer."
Yes, I know.
Wait for me, Mom!
We didn't get anything new out of the people at the construction site, either.
I guess we'd better call the doctor, Haibara.
What's that?
Excuse me?
What's the matter with you?
You seem very distracted.
Yeah, maybe I am.
- (Ayumi) We're here!
- (Genta) Hey!
Conan, Haibara!
(Mitsuhiko) Up here!
(Mitsuhiko) Here!
(At the same time) Hello!
-Up here, we're up here!
-Can you see us?
Don't peek!
Watch out, Genta!
-People!
-What? -What?
What did they say?
-Hey, you!
-Aaah!
Aaaah... Aaah...
Genta!
Genta!
-I'm about to fall!
- "There's very little room."
Help me, miss!
I can't take it anymore!
I can't take it anymore!
Genta!
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Are you all right, Genta?
Genta, are you hurt?
Come on, answer me!
(Inaudible)
Eh?
What happened?
What am I doing here, miss?
I'm glad you're okay.
Oh, I remember!
I lost my balance and fell from up there.
Are you all right, boy?
Is anyone hurt?
I'm fine thanks to this girl.
She saved my life.
What luck!
We'd better accompany them to the infirmary just in case.
What the hell's wrong with him?
Au.
That should do it, sir.
Yes.
Thank you very much, doctor.
Apa, come on.
Ay, ay, ay!
How can it be the doctor, the one who's in the most pain of all?
-He's worse than a child.
-What a shame, isn't it?
I'd like to see you when I'm my age...

(Mitsuhiko) Now that the doctor is well, shall we go back to the Ferris wheel?
- (Ayumi) Let's go then?
- (Genta) Thank you very much, Miss.
(Mitsuhiko) - Eh?
Yes, but...
-Come on, let's go.
You mean I'm not in your way?
Now, that's just silly!
How could you be in our way?
You saved my life!
Well, let's go to the Ferris wheel.
(Ayumi) It's true!
-(Ayumi) Huh?
-(Ayumi) Wait!
Of course, of course.
Edogawa, I need to talk to you.
(Ayumi) Okay.
We'll go through, in the meantime...
-Ah... Yes.
- (Ouch) It can't be!
Wait, doctor.
-What must be so important?
-But...
Well, what a drag!
-Listen.
-What do you mean? -What do you mean?
While Conan and Haibara are distracted chatting...
(Shinichi voice) Are you sure?
The girl is a member of the Organization?
I can't be 100% sure,
but you must have had suspicions too.
That dark right eye...
Come to think of it, it even looks artificial to me.
An artificial eye... Wait a minute!
Yes, it does.
I know what you mean.
Number two of the Men in Black.
In Rom.
-Mm?
What do you want?
-Miss.
Miss!
-Mm?
-Xxxt!
If she is the real Romo,
I would be very surprised if she had really lost her memory.
No one knows if Rom is male or female, nor how old she is.
Well, no.
When I was still inside, I heard a lot of rumors about his appearance.
They said he was a burly man.
Or that he was an effeminate man.
There were even people who said he was an old man.
And also...
that he had lost one of his two eyes in an accident
and had an artificial one.
If this woman doesn't have heterochromia and she has an artificial eye...
Exactly.
She could be doing comedy with the amnesia thing.
But to get close to us
she wouldn't have the need to dissemble so much.
Yes, it's true...
Considering his physical abilities,
we'll have to keep a close eye on him as a possible member of the Organization.
But if it is true that he has lost his memory, we could take advantage of it.
And a radish!
You can't help him get his memory back!
What do you want?
That he remembers everything to get information about the Organization out of him?
I hope that's not what you just implied.
It's too dangerous.
Not only risking our lives,
you might even endanger the lives of the children!
They're not here!
Eh?
What the hell are you doing, Doctor?
Doctor!
They're so cute!
What?
-It's no time to play with little birds!
-My pigeons!
Oh, the children!
Do you know where they've gone, the children?
(Mobile)
-Deixa'l ring, don't pick it up.
-Ugh!
It's in Conan.
Anyway, I'm sure he's calling to scold selected.
-Hey!
Look!
-You're right.
-It's true!
-What a pile of pigeons, isn't it?
-Yes, there's a lot of them!
-The voices, Miss?
(Female voice) "The user of this number can't answer it."
What do you bet they're at the Ferris wheel?
Where the hell did they go?
They really wanted to go up.
(Agasa) Hey, wait a minute!
Wait for me!
Yes.
(Mitsuhiko) Let's go!
(Mitsuhiko) Maybe you're a sportsman or something.
(Mitsuhiko) Me?
A normal person wouldn't have been able to save Genta the way you did.
It's true!
Besides, you have a nice figure.
Nice figure?
You mean?
Oh, so much!
But you look like a supermodel!
Oooh!
Have you seen how the fountain has grown?
- (Mitsuhiko) It's amazing!
- (Ayumi) It's getting taller and taller!
-Yes, it's very pretty.
- (Genta) You see it too, Miss?
(Ayumi) It's getting taller!
It's mind-blowing, guys!
Look down and you'll see the rainbow.
Come here in front and you'll see it.
-Oooh!
-Oh?
Yes!
"(constant beeping)"
- "(beeping: won't stop)"
-Ah!
-What's wrong with you?
-Are you all right, miss?
It's nothing serious, I just got a little dizzy.
Maybe you're afraid of heights and you didn't remember?
Yes... Hey, we're about to reach the top!
We are!
We have finally reached the top!
We are the highest in the world!
How cool!
We are so high!
Oooh!
What a blast!
"(deafening whistle)"
-Huh?
-Ah!

What's wrong, miss?
Are you ok?
Hey, hey, hey!
Say something!
-What do we do now?
-Do you have a headache?
Wait a moment, I'll call for help.
-Ayumi, Mitsuhiko!
- (woman) E... the NOCs are...
I think she's delirious now, she's started to say very strange things.
-The NOCs are...
-She must have remembered something.
Ayumi, call Conan on the cell phone and ask him to come over.
-Hey?
-People, did you understand what he said?
Well, I think he called me "fool"...
-Kir...
-What do you mean "stupid"?
-Huh?
Are you sorry?
-Bourbon...
-Xt!
Shut up and let me listen, Genta.
-You're saying strange things again! -You're saying strange things again!
Stout... Aquavit... Riesling...
Come on, hurry up!
-It's ringing!
- (telephone: dial tone)
(Mobile)
They're calling me.
It must be them.
What's the matter?
You see? (phone ringing)
I knew it.
(Ayumi) "Conan, you have to help us!"
(Conan's voice) Mitsuhiko, where did you...?
Ayumi, what's wrong?
We're at the Ferris wheel.
The lady suddenly started to feel sick, and...
What?
Well...
"Really? And how is she now?"
She holds her head with both hands as if it's very bad for her,
and says nonsense.
-Yes.
-I'm pointing at him.
"Okay."
At Mitsuhiko is writing it all down.
(Ayumi) Hurry up, please!
We're really worried!
Hey, Conan!
Where is she, that girl you found?
It's over there, she's just been taken to the infirmary.
(Ayumi) -Yes.
-Let's go too, Takagi.
Haibara, doctor.
I'm going with them.
-No way.
-We'll go, too.
You're not coming.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
You can come in now.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
As we have already told you,
this young lady will be under police protection.
For me there is no problem,
but I have to tell you something
that the doctors at the police hospital where she will be admitted should take into account.
should take into account.
On the one hand, we have no doubt that the amnesia...
is the direct consequence of a strong cranial trauma.
On the other hand, however,
we have found a very strange lesion to the fornix of the brain,
right in this area.
Could it be a sequel of the accident?
I would say no.
It looks more like a congenital lesion.
And it has nothing to do with the attack he suffered?
The lesion is not located in an area
where it can affect daily activities, so I doubt it.
(Sato) Thank you, doctor.
We will notify the doctors.
(Sato) -Don't go away.
There is another thing.
-Well, then...
While we were giving him a complete checkup,
we removed something from his right eye.
-You took it out of his eye, this? -That's it.
-That's it.
(Sato) It looks like a contact lens.
Yes, it's a colored contact lens that darkened his iris.
(Sato) "This means we made a mistake, then."
He doesn't have heterochromia.
...who has suffered from the Ferris wheel,
but it's better to let them know just in case.
(Door, open)
Excuse me, doctor.
We're ready to transfer her to the Police Hospital.
-Ah, very well.
-We're leaving too.
Thank you for seeing us.
And you?
Come on, they must be waiting for you.
Aren't you going with them?
No.
It's just that I want to ask you another question first.
You tell me.
I have a question about colored contact lenses.
If she only wore a brown lens in her right eye,
it means that, in fact, the girl has blue eyes, right?
Look, actually, the right eye is clear.
Well...
Transparent?
To be more precise, I should say that it "looks" transparent.
It's a rare phenomenon, but it can happen.
Sometimes, the iris and the scleral membrane...
have almost the same color.
That's why it looks transparent.
"After all, then, he does have different colored eyes."
I can explain it to you in other words, if you want.
What's that?
Doctor.
I really appreciate everything you've done for us today.
Mm-hm.
I'll see you another day.
Ah, you're leaving already?
- (Kogoro) Is this it?
-(Kogoro) Bye.
And be careful, huh?
Is this where they've taken my client?
Please, sir.
Unauthorized persons are not allowed to enter.
It's just that I'm not an unauthorized person,
the girl is my client!
What?
Kogoro!
Mi-te!
Good thing I found you.

What are you doing here?
You who know everything: where do you stop, my attractive client?
He's already gone.
She was taken a while ago to be admitted to the Police Hospital.
Besides, she's not your client, as far as I know.
Why not?
That's what she gets for not listening to Ran when she tells him things.
Is there anything you want to ask the doctor?
Ah... Well, no.
(people: whispers)
- (man) No idea.
- (woman) What happened?
I have discovered why he behaves so strangely.
He's lost his memory.
(woman) Good.
And do you know where he is now?
"He's been taken to the police hospital."
I gather the police have already stuck their noses in, then.
Yes.
But there's something else that worries me more.
"What is it?"
The doctor said he'd had some sort of seizure on top of the Ferris wheel.
-Exactly.
- "A seizure, flames?"
Understood.
You keep a close eye on her, you feel?
"I will."
An attack on top of the Ferris wheel.
Maybe...?
(Genta) How come you dislike Haibara so much, Miss?
(Mitsuhiko) I don't know, but I haven't seen him so angry.
You don't know what's wrong with her either, Dr. Agasa?
No, I have no idea.
When I was about to ask him,
he said he was feeling sick and went home.
Ayumi, it won't do you any good to ask him.
You are right.
In fact, the Haibara spends the whole day scolding the doctor.
-He-he-he-he...
-It's true.
Come to think of it, Conan has given me something for you.
-But it's...
-Oh!
It looks like the dolls they used to give away at the shooting gallery!
Yes.
But those were colored.
Why isn't it painted?
I don't know.
Conan explained it to me, but now I don't remember.
-Never mind, we'll ask him.
-Come on!
-What?
Who is it?
- (mobile)
Guaita!
You might as well have said it.
It's Conan.
Tell me, Conan.
Hello, doctor.
Listen, even if it's with the children?
"Yes, we're making tea at the Poirot."
So, I need you to do me a favor.
"First of all: do you know how she is, our friend?"
Oh!
He's fine, he was transferred to the Police Hospital a while ago.
"Don't suffer."
-What favor did you want to ask me?
-What rest!
"I want you to try to retrieve the information from the girl's cell phone."
I'll do my best,
but I can't guarantee I'll get all the data back.
Good.
One other thing.
The kids told me that when the girl had the attack on the Ferris wheel..,
"...she was saying things you couldn't understand."
Yes.
"Do you remember what she was saying?"
I could only write down a couple of words, I have them in my notebook.
Let's see... Here.
He said Stout, Aquavit and also... Riesling.
"To me, this all makes no sense at all."
"Alcoholic beverage names? My God!"
Doctor, aren't they Poirot?
What?
Yes...
"Can you tell the Amuro to put it on?"
The Amuro, you say?
Come to think of it, I haven't seen him today.
The Amuro didn't come, he took the day off.
What?
He called earlier today to let me know he couldn't make it,
but he didn't tell me why.
I've tried to call him more than once, but he won't pick up the phone.
Did you feel it, Conan?
"I hope nothing happened to him, but it's very strange..."
"Amuro! What if she had...?"
This is Stout.
I just got on the bus.
(Man) "You will receive further instructions shortly."
Understood.
(Gunshot)
Too bad.
Stout, I trusted you.
(Man) I'm sorry.
The Stout has been eliminated.
(Vermouth) "Understood. Come right back."
All right, then.
(The National Tower of Canada
was for 32 years the tallest building in the world.
This panoramic walkway allows us to walk
around the 116th floor
at a not inconsiderable height: 356 meters above sea level.
If you lean back and look down, you'll see that...
This helicopter... it looks like it's...
(Shot)
(People: shouts of panic)
You asked for it.
It is the death that more case to a traitor.
The Aquavit is eliminated.
Over.
(Vermouth) "I congratulate you. Come back at once."
I would have done it even if you hadn't ordered me to.
(Vodka) Hey, hey!
How far are you planning to go?

I told you I was giving you a one-minute extension.
And I already told you to leave me alone, I'm not a NOC agent!
(Gin) Then we'll have to figure out who's right.
Riesling.
What do you think?
(Gin) Gin!
Right now we'll clarify
if you belong to our side or if you're an enemy spy.
All you have to do is tell us the names
of the other rats infiltrating the Organization.
Come on, speak up if you don't feel like suffering.
How many times do I have to say it?
I am not a NOC agent.
You won't get anything out of threatening me.
Threatening?
You should know by now that I don't do this kind of petty stuff.
Five, four,
three, two,
one..., zero.
(Body: falls into the water)
(Body: falls into the water) - Huh?
Where do we go now?
-Let's touch two.
Hurry up.
(Body: falls into the water) -Huh?
You mean...?
-In Japan.
We still have two left.
(James) British MI6, Canadian CSIS and German BND.
The secret agents of these three countries have been killed.
Yes.
So...?
These agents had one thing in common:
they were infiltrated into the Organization.
You mean the Men in Black have discovered them?
The Akai tipped us off that there was a possibility
that a spy in the Organization
had stolen confidential information from Public Security.
"An Organization spy..."
Mm?
Hey, Jodie.
If I'm not mistaken, you brought me here...
because I was in contact with this possible spy, right?
I knew that.
Yes.
The thing is, the girl's lost her memory,
and the cell phone she was carrying broke.
A cell phone?
You say she was carrying a cell phone?
Mm-hm.
She'd left it on a park bench, and I picked it up.
We'd better send it to FBI headquarters for analysis.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
You're right.
The doctor told me he'd finish fixing it soon.
It'll be a lot faster than taking it to the FBI.
Then let us know as soon as it's fixed.
We need to find out how much information has been leaked.
And the sooner we know, the better.
Otherwise, the whole world will go into crisis.
What do you mean?
But what kind of information did he steal?
Isn't this...?
(Jodie) Covert operations.
Yes.
It's the NOC list.
The list of spies around the world
that had been compiled by the National Police.
So, all the spies infiltrating the Organization will be killed.
(James) Not only that.
If the NOC list were to come out,
intelligence services around the world could be left unprotected.
So, the Men in Black have stolen the key...
to start a global espionage war.
Yes, they have.
Therefore...
it's very likely that these three killed
were just the beginning.
-Yeah, but...
-In the end we have ended up coming, then.
You mean we've done well, coming unannounced to Conan and the Ai?
Eh?
Oh, and so much!
If we had warned them, for sure they would have forbidden us to come.
Come on, we don't think about it anymore and we go in.
Let's see if we are lucky and we can see it!
Yes.
Yes, that's right.
At the Police Hospital in Toto.
If things get complicated, I'm counting on you, Kazami.
"Yes."
Bourbon!
I didn't expect to see you here.
I came to take our partner, of course.
Look at that,
I thought you were coming to kill her before she got her memory back.
Oh, did you?
Why would I want to kill?
I really don't understand where you're going with this.
And how do you plan to get close?
They have her under strict surveillance and she's forbidden to visit.
Unless you have some resource that allows you to approach her easily.
Like, for example, some strategic contact within the police.
I'm sorry, but I still don't understand what you mean.
It doesn't matter.
I don't like to talk on my feet.
Why don't we go somewhere else?
If it's a direct order from the Organization,
I have no choice but to obey it.
-There's nothing to do.
-What did they tell you?
-I don't believe it! -I don't believe it!
-She's forbidden to visit.
She must be very ill, poor thing.
We don't know this, we need to have it confirmed.
-Yes!
-Yeah, but how will we do it?
-Of course!
-Uah!
Yes.
This is our best ally!
(Clicking)
Eh? (Shinichi voice)
(Shinichi voice) Doctor!

Halfway through.
Have you recovered the data?
I will only be able to retrieve the information of the last messages sent.
I will do my best.
Please, eagerness!
(Genta) And what can I say about this?
You hallucinate!
You can't make this move.
Oh, you can't?
I made a mistake.
Oh, it's in Takagi!
- (Genta) And the lady?
- (Ayumi) It's about time you came back!
- (flow) Xxxt!
Don't call so much!
- (Mitsuhiko) Can we see her?
Remember she's in the system on the sly.
Ui.
Oh, is that so?
Sneaking around from whom?
Excuse me, Inspector.
I must have said it out of habit...
Ah!
Miss!
How nice, you look so good!
-Not anymore.
-And your head?
It doesn't hurt at all?
I'm fine.
Thank you, guys.
I really shouldn't have let you come here,
but I can tell she appreciates and trusts you.
That's why I'll give you a chance to help her get her memory back.
-Live!
-Really?
Thank you, Inspector!
That is, only until the next interrogation begins.
(All) Yes!
(All) Yes!
And now?
Where could we put the next card?
Let's see... Why don't we put it here?
Yes.
Mm... What do you say?
-We've got it a bit hairy.
-And now, what do we do?
How nice!
-We've won, miss! -Oh, by the way...
-Oh, by the way...
- (Mitsuhiko) I don't know...
(Mitsuhiko) -Huh?
-Here, this is for you.
(Mitsuhiko) What is it?
The kid at the shooting gallery gave it to us for you.
So you can paint it any color you want.
Is it for me?
Are you sure, that I can keep it?
Yes!
You saved my life, it's the least we can give in return!
(Ayumi) Look!
-Mill, eh?
-Now we all have one just like it.
-Red?
Pink?
-What color do you want to paint it?
If it were mine, I'd paint it black like the orcas,
but it's yours, and I think white suits you much better than black.
-It matches your hair.
-Yes?
Besides, if you leave it white, it's better value for money.
I don't think that's the point, Genta.
You seem to be trying to foist a bargain on him...
But it's a very good idea!
Isn't it?
-Have you done yourself wrong, Genta?
-Oh!
Ah... No.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
-(Sato) Yes.
- (Sato) Are you all right, guys?
Ouch!
For once I was winning!
So that lady was helping you, you cheat!
All you did was follow her instructions.
M-maybe so.
-(man) Huh?
- (man) Can we come in?
We're from Public Security.
If I'm informed correctly, the head of the operation is Inspector Megure.
Inspector Megure must be you, right?
That's right.
Myself, at your service.
Then you must hand this woman over to us immediately.
And why is that?
The Metropolitan Police also has the right to investigate.
She is suspected of having entered the National Police building.
We must interrogate her immediately to find out her purpose.
If you have no objection,
I'd be grateful if we could start immediately
the formalities of the surrender procedure.
I remind you that you have no authority to refuse.
Eh?
Understood.
Accompany me, please.
I already have the application ready.
-I don't know.
-What now? -What now?
Do you know where they'll take you?
It's time to say goodbye and leave, guys.
- (all) What?!
-Come on, home.
Yes.
And you should go back to the room.
-Hold on, miss!
-(all) Okay.
-Just a moment.
Miss!
-Are you really leaving?
Thank you very much for the gift.
I'll treasure it.
-Yes... -Yes...
-Yes.
And I'm sure one day we'll all ride the Ferris wheel together again.
-I'm sure we will!
-You promise?
Au, we must go.
I just hope the lady is well.
-So do I. -Yes.
-Yes. -Yes.
I suffer for her.
And what did you find out?
Hey, Shinichi!
I've finished the analysis.
This.
"The NOC agents are Stout, Aquavit and Riesling.
As for the ones you were worried about,
the Bourbon and the Kir..."
Shit, I knew it!
I need you to identify the recipient of this email right away.
Let me know as soon as you do!
Yes.
Haibara!
Leave it.
Please leave it.

I told you once before, didn't I?
That you don't shy away from your own destiny.
I won't avoid my.
Kudo...
(Ayumi) Thank you for everything, Takagi.
And I'm sorry if we got you in trouble.
And now!
Be careful on the street, okay?
-Mm?
(Ayumi) -Yes!
Come on, Genta.
Don't make that face.
-Yeah, but it's...
-We'll see her again for sure!
I've got it!
What do you say we go back to the aquarium and ride the Ferris wheel?
Yes!
The lady said she wanted to go back, right?
We can take pictures of the scenery and send them to him.
The problem with going now is that it will be dark.
Besides, there will be a lot of people and we might not be able to go up.
You don't suffer.
The Suzuki family has invested a lot of money in the renovation of the Aquarium.
We have a good resource.
-Good idea!
-Yes!
Yes!
Meet our second best ally.
(Amuro) So you have a suspicion that we're NOC agents.
(Gin) Your names went out to the NOC list
that Curacao stole.
-(Gin) Yes.
-Curacao?
En Rom's right-hand man?
He's a specialist getting information.
I see you know who he is.
Her main physical characteristic
is that she has one eye of each color.
We've heard rumors within the Organization.
(Vodka) As we have always been good friends,
if you tell us the truth we will kill you without making you suffer too much.
If you capture us instead of killing us directly,
it will be because the information from Curacao was incomplete.
-Ha!
-I'm not wrong, am I?
As agile as ever, Bourbon.
She managed to steal the NOC list without any problems,
but the police caught her and she had an accident on the run.
And, to top it off, she's lost her memory.
So, what you should do...
is to get Curacao back to give you the NOC list, right?
Gin, you still have time to make things right...
and confirm whether or not we're undercover spies.
You're absolutely right.
But...
-What are you doing?
-Gin!
(Gin) I prefer to be true to my style.
Punish all suspects.
(Gin) Come on.
It's time to give the traitors the chastisement they deserve.
"Don't be impatient."
Not yet, Doctor?
I'm all right.
"The analysis will be over in 30 seconds."
"When you have the e-mail address,
do what I told you before."
Understood.
I have to encode the message as if I sent it
from the broken cell phone, right?
"Yes. Hurry, there's no time left!"
Look, that's it!
Ah... Now he hung up on me.
(Car: horn)
Get in, little spy.
Read this, quickly.
-Oh!
-But... but if it's...
(Gunshot)
(Kir!
You got a problem, Kir?
Go on.
You were trying to get out of handcuffs, weren't you?
Why did you shoot him in your ally?
It's not for you to decide if he's ally or enemy.
I'll give you one last one-minute extension.
The first one to rat out the other,
I will grant him the privilege
of watching a traitorous rat die.
Vodka, countdown.
Vodka, the countdown.
Sixty seconds.
Threats won't get us anything!
If I say the Kir is a NOC agent and I rat her out,
I'll be confessing that I'm one too.
- (Vodka) 50 seconds.
-And you won't let me out of here alive.
(Vodka) Ha!
I don't know why you're so sure.
I'm a lot more compassionate than you think.
Kir...
40 seconds.
So you're two little friends protecting each other, right?
We're not protecting each other or anything,
I have no idea if she's a NOC agent.
-30 seconds.
-I don't know either.
But I can tell you one thing for sure: I'm not a NOC agent.
-Come on.
- (Amuro) That's the same thing I can say.
-Which one of us is the traitor? -Which one of us is the traitor?
- (Vodka) 20 seconds.
Gin, are you really willing?
Which one of you two will be the first to sing?
Ten, nine, eight...
(Vodka) - Come on.
In Bourbon?
-Seven, six...
-Five, four, three, two...
-Or the Kir?
-One..., zero!
-I'll start with you, Bourbon.
Bourbon.
(brittle)
- (Vodka) The lamp has...
-What was that?
What's happened?
Kir!
Bourbon!
Don't move.
What?
Bourbon is gone!
He's run away.
Oh, shit!
How could he...?
What the fuck?
Find him!
(Mobile: vibrates)
I'm really sorry, Kir.

I won't be able to show you the corpse of the other rat.
But don't be sad.
I promise I'll send Bourbon to your side right away.
- (Vermouth) Wait, Gin!
-Goodbye, Kir.
-What?
-Don't shoot.
Rom's orders.
And what do you want us to do, then?
Yes.
Understood.
You've received an email from Curacao.
These two have nothing to do.
You've recovered your memory, then?
I think that's enough
to clear any suspicions about the two of us.
And now, can you get these handles off me at once?
-Eh?
- (Vermouth) Not yet.
In Rom still ordered me something else.
He says that we have to confirm
if the person who has sent you the email
is really the Curacao.
The problem is that it is practically impossible
to get her out of the Police Hospital in Toto.
-What?
-Don't worry, stop that.
If my calculations are correct,
by now there will have been some movement.
(Mobile)
Timely as ever, Gin.
These Public Safety pallussos are finally on the move.
"I thought so."
They're such jackasses they haven't even noticed we're listening to them.
"And where are they headed?"
Ha!
Right where you'd predicted they'd go.
Right now they're getting the girl into a car.
-You mean...?
- "Prepare the gyroplane."
But...
It's the ideal opportunity... to put it to the test.
"Anyone would think you wanted to declare war on them, Gin!"
I'm following Rom's orders.
We must accomplish our mission without making any mistakes.
"Agreed."
How strong, how strong, how strong!
What fun.
I'm so excited!
So am I.
Gin!
Are you really going to use gyroplane?
I couldn't find it, mate.
We missed it.
-Huh?
-It doesn't matter.
We'll deal with the Bourbon and the Kir later.
The priority is to recover the Curacao.
But at the hospital there's the police and the Public Security.
The Curacao has already left the hospital.
And where are they taking her?
Her destination... Toto's Aquarium.
Gin!
Don't tell me...?
Did you foresee it going like this?
Mm-hm!
Come on, Vodka.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-Take the car.
(James) Yeah, okay.
You're going right away, okay?
We'll take care of the rescue.
(Akai) "OK."
Looks like they're both out of danger.
(James) -Great.
-I'm so glad!
In the end, your strategy has been a success.
Eh?
No, it's no big deal.
As the sentence in the first email was half-finished,
I just had to complete it by adding:
"In Bourbon and the Kir have nothing to do with each other, don't suffer",
and I sent it.
-Yes.
-Well!
They're already saved.
No.
They are only temporarily saved.
Because the enemy's priority is to recover their agent.
They weren't at the Police Hospital?
Now they're headed for Toto's Aquarium.
Not anymore.
The Public Safety Agency have taken him to the Aquarium.
(Jodie) Then we'll have to go.
At the Aquarium, you say?
No need, I've already sent the Akai.
We have to rescue the agents
who are being held prisoner in the abandoned warehouse
and, above all, look for the NOC list.
-Conan.
-Yes.
It's okay to come down.
What? We don't know what's going to happen.
We don't know what will happen, and it could be dangerous.
(Jodie) Don't suffer.
(Jodie) But...
We will solve this crisis, trust the FBI.
I trust you.
Mm-hm.
We'll let you know when we're done.
Oh, by the way.
Does the Akai know anything else, about the spy who stole the NOC list?
No, the Akai doesn't know it very well either.
The only thing we've been able to find out
is that she's a trusted spy from Rom.
Thank you.
Be careful.
Her code name is Curacao.
"So it's not Rom, it's Curacao."
"Curacao is a liqueur made from orange peel."
"The most common varieties are white curaçao, orange curaçao, blue curaçao, blue curaçao, orange curaçao, orange curaçao, orange curaçao, orange curaçao,
blue curaçao, green curaçao and red curaçao."
Wait a minute.
These are the same colors.
Where have I seen this color combination?
Where was it?
Remember!
If this is the key...
We have found a very strange lesion to the brain fornix.
He's holding his head with both hands as if it's very bad for him,
and says nonsense.
He said Stout, Aquavit... and Riesling too.
Of course he did!

This theory would explain the movement of the Organization
and the Public Security Agency!
"But then... Hurry!"
"If we don't hurry,
the NOC list will end up in the hands of the Men in Black!"
Yes.
Yes.
We have protected it as you instructed.
We have protected it as you instructed.
We rode the Aquarium Ferris wheel, you say?
Yes.
It's not sure if it will work, but right now we have no choice.
- (Kazami) "Yes."
(Kazami) -Trust me?
"But it's better if you join us."
I can't.
We don't know if the Organization is still watching me.
I'll go straight to the Ferris wheel.
Goodbye.
"Don't hang up yet, Mr. Furuya!"
(Reco!
Who told me to visit an aquarium in the middle of a week's vacation?
And, to top it off, with a bunch of creatures.
- (Mitsuhiko) It's about time!
-Come on, we're here.
-Come on, let's go!
-(Mitsuhiko) Finally!
Not so fast, please!
Wait for me here!
What are you doing, father?
(scoundrel) Yes!
I'm sorry, but I don't feel like watching fish today.
I'll stay here and take a nap.
Enjoy yourselves!
Thank you.
(Sighs) -Yes.
-I'll talk to the staff.
-I don't know why...
-Did they take her back to the aquarium?
I figured they'd take her to the place where she had the accident.
Yes, but she thinks she had the attack here, at the Ferris wheel.
Maybe there is a secret up there that we don't know about.
For the time being, we'll wait here for a while longer.
Let's see what they're doing.
Where is she, the Sonoko?
I don't see her anywhere.
Don't worry, I'm sure she'll be here.
She should be here soon.
I want to buy tickets for the Ferris wheel.
(Woman) I'm sorry, sir, but the ticket office is closed.
The ticketing hours are over for today.
Then, I want to speak to the manager.
Tell him that the Public Security Agency
needs his cooperation.
(Sonoko) Ran!
I'm here!
Hello, Sonoko!
Look!
She's finally here!
Sorry, it's just that the paperwork took longer than usual.
-We knew you wouldn't let us down, Sonoko!
-You made it!
Let's see if someday you'll thank me properly.
Yes!
I'm sorry, even I had the bar to sign up.
And now, don't worry.
It doesn't come from one, nor from two.
-Yes.
-Let's go.
Take good care of the children, okay?
I'll take you to the Ferris wheel by another way.
-Yes! -Yes!
-Follow me and don't let me out of your sight.
Come on, let's go!
Of course you won't!
Won't it do you any harm to take over?
His job is to accompany visitors, don't suffer.
Hey, are you sure you don't want to call Shinichi to come?
Shinichi?
-The most important thing is safety.
- (man) What do you want us to do?
Mm-hm.
(man) What's up?
Do you know him?
The truth is I don't know who he is.
But the girl that's with the Public Safety guys...
looks familiar and I don't know what from.
You say they're from Public Security, these people?
Yes.
Something must have happened.
What do they think they are!
How unpleasant.
Let's go, let's go.
What?
Wait, Sonoko.
It's just that these people have really got me worried.
Then take the opportunity and play a trick on your detective girlfriend.
Eh?
Mm...
(Cell phone vibrates)
Well, if this phone rings, it can only be...
I thought so.
Hello, Shinichi.
(Shinichi voice) "What's up, Ran?"
I just wanted to talk to you about something.
(Shinichi voice) "Go ahead. But get to the point, please."
What, what?
What's he saying?
Ah... you're very busy?
XXT!
Shut up, Sonoko!
Yes, a little.
(Sonoko) "Stop it at once!"
(Sonoko) "You've turned red!"
"Sorry, Ran? I'm sorry, but I have things to do. I have to leave you."
"Just a moment, Shinichi!"
(Megaphone: woman) "Thank you for visiting..."
"I'll call you when I have a moment."
Goodbye!
No way!
Where are you now?
What a face!
He hung up on you again because he was too busy, right?
What's he doing, what's so important?
You won't believe it, but I thought he was here.
What's that?
What do you mean, what do you mean?
I heard the Aquarium's welcome message over the phone.
I get it.
The question is who he came with.

Don't be silly!
What?
Do you think men come alone, to this kind of places?
Oh, come on!
The one caught in the middle of infidelity!
What?
So... Sonoko!
It seems that there is no single power supply.
The old installations are on a different line.
I have no choice.
I've finished.
You can approach...
"...without suffering, you will not be easily detected."
That's great.
We must hurry.
The operation will start in 15 minutes.
All right, let's go!
Full speed ahead!
(PA: female) "Welcome to the giant Ferris wheel at Toto's Aquarium!"
"We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your visit."
"The special light and water show will begin shortly."
"Due to a technical inspection of the Boreal Wheel,
only the Southern Wheel will be available."
"We apologize for any inconvenience..."
-Yes!
-You can come in now.
-We've taken a shortcut.
-Hurray!
Hey, wait a minute, guys.
Where did they come from, these kids?
They're Miss Suzuki's guests.
What?
They are?
They've reserved one of the wheels just for them?
Yes, it looks like it.
(PA: woman) "Please be informed that the light and water show..."
"Shit! With so many people, it will be impossible to find them."
"In any case, I have to stop them before they go up."
"...the magical dance of colors that will illuminate the night sky
and the dynamic dance of the water of our fountains."
What should they do, the Public Safety people?
Look, have you seen how many police cars?
(People: whispers)
Let's see.
Come on, Kudo, where are you?
I knew it!
The Ferris wheel.
Porto the Public Security officers.
What?
So, the reservation was for these gentlemen?
Yes, the request was made by us.
Well, I'm sorry, gentlemen.
There was a misunderstanding.
I got confused and let a group of children up about 10 minutes ago.
-Hey?
What do you want to do?
-What do you want to do?
-No.
We wait for them to come down to go up?
They're no threat, they're just kids.
Anyway, now that we have controlled and secured the Ferris wheel,
it's more than likely that the Organization
will wait for us to come back down to try to attack.
-Yes.
Keep your eyes peeled then, all right?
Let's go, then.
(People: exclamations of disapproval)
Excuse me, I've lost my friends!
Will you let me pass, please?
Hold it! (People: exclamations of disapproval)
Hold it!
Don't get on the Ferris wheel!
This wheel is reserved, friend.
"Shit! I'm too late."
Will you let me through, please?
If they've set some kind of trap,
I'm sure it's inside the Ferris wheel cabin,
where it won't attract too much attention and there's not enough surveillance.
I have to find out their plans as soon as possible
and alert the police and the FBI.
Isn't that the Akai?
What's that?
What are they, those wires?
Maybe...?
Then...
My God!
I have to make sure right away!
(Vermouth) They're inside.
Just as we had planned.
The Curacao is in the cockpit.
And there's only one police officer.
"I estimate it will take approximately 10 minutes to reach the highest point."
-Ready.
Anytime.
-10 minutes?
How you doing, Vodka?
Where are they, the other cops?
There's a few of them spread strategically throughout the park,
but I don't think they'll interfere with the plan.
"Mm-hm. We're waiting for your signal to start."
Roger that.
You're not fooling me!
Is it true you've forgotten about me?
Mm-hm. Well, it doesn't matter.
-Yes, it is.
When you recover your memory,
I'll call you until my heart tells me it's enough
for you to tell me where you've hidden the NOC list
and confess everything you know about the Organization.
In theory, I should have arrived first.
But I didn't.
I see you had no trouble getting away.
How did you know to come here?
I can imagine.
-The light has...
-What was that?
What happened?
(Amuro) "After having made the lights fall down with one shot
and left them in the dark..."
Kir!
Bourbon!
Don't move.
"...you noticed that I was still trapped in the warehouse,
"unable to move,
"And you opened the door wide...

to make it look like I had escaped and fool them."
I'm really sorry, Kir.
"Thanks to this, I was able to hide behind the boxes...
and I found out what they intended to do next."
I knew that if it was all your doing, we'd be here.
But I'd like you to tell me why you saved us.
You didn't need to take such a risk,
you could have gotten information out of them without risking your life.
I don't believe that you came all the way out here specifically
just to talk to me.
Yes.
I came to ask you to ask the FBI to back off the case.
La Curacao belongs to the Public Safety Agency.
And if I tell you... that we refuse?
Then we'll have no choice but to take the force with us.
Go away, Shuichi Akai!
Iaaaaaaaaaah!
"All these electrical wires connected to the fire hydrant..."
"This is not normal. You'd better not force the door.
"Maybe this way."
"Oh! There's a detonator in here!"
"So,
"Whatever's attached to the ends of the wires of the Ferris wheel shaft
must be explosives."
"Now what do I do? It's a detonator activated by remote control."
"If I try to evacuate the park, they'll know and everything will go down."
"I've got it! There's one person who can help me."
"Dear visitors, sorry for the delay."
What's going on here?
How come there's no one here?
Oh!
No way!
What are you kids doing up there?
I've told you many times, Amuro.
You often seem to forget who your real enemy is.
I know who your real enemy is!
I will unmask all the members of the Organization
after I have crushed you!
What if, while we are fighting,
Curacao regains his memory and they come looking for you?
Why don't you say what you think?
That the Japanese police can't be trusted
because they stole information from us!
Damn!
Where has he gone, the Akai?
Please pick up the phone!
(Mobile)
I think it's there!
Where has he gone?
Oh! (cell phone ringing)
Ah!
Ah!
Iaaaah!
Ah!
Aaah!
Let it run.
Have you given up already?
Come on, it's time to start the second round.
Eh?
Akai!
You're up here, aren't you?
It's an emergency!
I need your help!
If they can't get the Curacao back, the Men in Black...
intend to blow up the Ferris wheel with explosives!
If you're up here, you've got to help me stop them!
If we don't defuse the bombs before they explode, we will die!
Amuro!
How did you get up here?
Is it true, this, Conan?
I'll explain later, now tell me where the explosives are.
Many are placed between the axle and the wheel of the Ferris wheel.
We don't know when they will explode because they are triggered by remote control.
We must deactivate them without wasting time!
Okay, I'll be right back with the FBI.
I'll be right with the FBI.
Girl!
That was beautiful, wasn't it?
Yes.
Don't lose hope, you feel?
I'm convinced we'll find him!
Ah... We'd better not.
I'd hate to bother you if you're investigating something important.
As nice a person as you are, you look like a sunny chard.
Listen to me!
If she jumps you with someone else, she'll be caught red-handed!
Please, Sonoko, let it go.
I'm telling you no!
Besides, we haven't even looked for him in the most important place yet.
Yes.
The most important place, you say?
In there!
That's right!
The Aquarium?
How do you see, Amuro?
I'm almost there.
Phew.
We can open the door now.
I thought so, that they had prepared a trap.
Well, you were on the right track.
You did very well not to force the door.
Eh?
It's C4 explosives.
Did you find the bombs, Akai?
They're strategically placed.
If they went off all at once,
the shaft wouldn't hold the charge and there'd be a chain of explosions.
We understand.
We can't waste any more time, then.
This is it.
And then?
Will you know how to deactivate it?
It's a standard model, I'll know.
I know the way to do it.
You do?
I didn't know you were an explosives expert!
I had a partner at the police academy
who taught me a lot of things.
He later went to the Bomb Squad, he was the best.

"Unfortunately, he was killed while trying to defuse a bomb...
placed precisely inside a Ferris wheel."
A bomb exploded in a Ferris wheel...?
Don't suffer for it, he used an impeccable technique.
That is precisely what I intend to demonstrate.
-Mm?
- (Akai) Take this.
You'll find all the tools you need to defuse the bomb.
And you, where are you going?
The location of the bombs
is a clue that the Organization will attack the Ferris wheel.
If they want to rescue the Curacao,
the only place from where they can approach
without running the risk of being hit by the explosions is...
That's right.
From the sky!
I'll go back to where I was before and try to buy time.
In the meantime, try to deactivate the detonator.
You'll need this, won't you?
Put like that, it looks like it would be easy...
Yes, thank you.
Now, it all depends on the time...
he can get us to deactivate it.
"It's true. If we don't know when it will explode..."
"No, wait a minute! They'll launch the attack on..."
I have to protect the NOC list!
What happened, Conan?
Geez, it's every man for himself here....
"Sure!"
"The spotlights are the same colors
as the translucent Curacao cards."
"Besides, at this hour they have almost the same degree of transparency."
"If I'm not mistaken, when the Curacao sees this color scheme,
it will remember the NOC list!"
"The storage device was his brain."
"And the doors of his memory will open up
when the cockpit reaches the highest point of the course."
"When you see the same colors with the same transparency,
you will recover your memory completely."
He's about to arrive.
Gin, last confirmation.
If all goes well, we start here 3 minutes.
"Ready?"
Everybody ready, we can start whenever you want.
Chianti.
We'll head to the alpha point.
-Okay. -Okay.
-Activate silent mode.
Ideally.
I have to finish as soon as possible to meet Kazami.
The next one should be this one.
Wow!
Phew, that was a hair's breadth.
If this lamp lights up, we're doomed.
Remember that haste is the worst enemy, right, Matsuda?
(Kazami) What's taking so long?
We'll soon reach the top!
With the fireworks earlier, nothing happened.
Perhaps Mr. Furuya's information was incorrect.
"(Constant beeping)"
Ah!
Aaaah!
Hey, what-what's wrong with you?
-Calm down.
Sit down and calm down!
-Aaaah!
Aaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
"What's the matter, up there? I thought I had already regained my memory!"
"So, this means that the mail that reached you in Rom..."
-Aaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
-Calm down!
See!
-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
-Hey, stop it!
Stop it!
The only one to blame for everything is yourself.
You unintentionally recorded in your prodigious brain...
information detrimental to the Organization.
You have an extraordinary memory, yes.
But if you use it against our interests,
you will become a great threat.
I hope you understand why we do this.
After all, this... has always been your destiny.
Good riddance, Curacao.
(Man: voice distorted) Stop.
B-but if it's...
What are you doing here?
(Man: voice distorted) Get out of my way, Vermut.
Curacao, you have no colors.
Only a darkness as black as coal.
Ro... Rom!
If this darkness is making you suffer, paint it another color.
Use your special abilities only for me,
both to send and receive information.
I want you to be my right hand, Curacao!
Hey, are you all right?
Get up!
Mother of mine.
Hang in there a little longer.
I'll call an ambulance, okay?
You don't have to.
He's finally regained his memory.
The Curacao has just entered the rescue zone.
It's two minutes before it reaches the highest point.
"I think we can start now."
-Okay.
-Vodka, get the arm ready.
Hatch open.
This rotor noise... They can't be long in coming.
(Helicopter)
They're already here!
I still don't understand what the hell they're up to.
(Mobile: vibrating)
-It can't be.
- (mobile: vibrates)
Who are you?

(Woman) "It's been a long time since we've talked, Vermut."
I see you've finally recovered your memory.
Yes, I have.
But I want to know when you're going to get me out of here.
There are a lot of Public Security agents down here.
"Don't be afraid, Gin will pick you up right away."
-In Gin.
-In Gin?
By the way, I need to know when you got your memory back.
"In Rom has received an email sent from your cell phone,
...but we suspect that it wasn't really you who sent it."
That email?
It was me who sent it, of course.
-Ah.
What's the problem?
Is there a problem?
"So, the Kir and Bourbon are clean."
"In Bourbon must have fled
to prevent the assassinéssim unjustly."
It's almost time, Cinderella.
Wait for your pumpkin carriage to arrive.
-Five seconds.
- "All right."
Three, two, one..., zero.
(People: exclamations of surprise)
What the fuck?
Shit, they're starting!
(Vodka) It's the Vermouth signal.
The park is completely dark.
(Vodka) Very good.
We can now start the descent.
(Vodka) -All right.
-We have to rescue the Curacao!
Calm down, please.
It's all right.
Do not move in the dark, it's dangerous.
(People: talk at once)
-L'Aquari is illuminated.
-Please cooperate a little.
-Let's go over there.
-There is still light there!
-Don't move, it's dangerous!
-Yes.
Hey, let's all go to Aquarius!
"I've got a bad feeling."
"I have to get the kids out of there any way I can!"
(Genta) Wow, the lights are out in the whole park!
We're in trouble, aren't we?
We were so close to get to the bottom...
-Nothing, I can't get it.
-What's he saying?
What happened to Mr. Kazami?
Sato, Takagi.
As far as I've been able to find out,
Public Security doesn't know what's going on either.
-And what do you want us to do, inspector? -What do you want us to do?
-I knew it.
We'll offer them cooperation.
-But if they've already... -But they've already...
-What?
It's time to forget the differences between departments.
(At the same time) Yes!
(At the same time) Okay?
(Sonoko) Well, it doesn't look like it's here either, girl...
No.
Sorry, Sonoko.
It must have been my imagination.
Hey, there's a commotion outside!
We're going out to see what happened!
Excuse me, will you let us through?
(Sonoko) Out of the way!
What happened?
(Sonoko) Oh.
What on earth...?
It's impossible to see the wires in the dark.
I'm so angry, I was so close to turning it off!
The power went out at the worst time.
If I just sit here waiting for them,
I'll have to go back to the Organization.
No way!
Will they take the cabin with them?
Oh.
But it's...
(Chianti) I've got the gyroplane under control.
20 meters to target.
Everything's going smoothly!
A Public Safety agent.
So, the one who just escaped jumping is the Curacao!
They're coming!
Wake up, sir!
Wake up!
This rifle won't be enough to stop him,
but he must have a weak spot somewhere.
Fuck!
Aaaah!
It's too far away.
Come on, let's play two!
-Look at 8 o'clock. -Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
At the top of the Ferris wheel.
There's been movement.
Maybe the cop got away.
Activate the thermal imaging camera.
This is the silhouette of a man!
And there is also a child, inside the cabin.
-What?
-The Curacao has escaped, Gin.
Curacao...
- (Vodka) Understood.
- (Gin) Let go of the cabin!
(Gin) Yeah, man!
You're kidding, right?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(People: shouting)
-It can't be!
-A cabin of the Ferris wheel has fallen!
(People: shouting)
- "La Curacao has disappeared."
-Gin, what's the situation?
- "We have to change plans."
-What?
-Don't be hasty.
- "We will eliminate the Curacao!"
"We still don't know if he's betrayed us."
And why do you think he has escaped, then?
He tried to leave the Organization!
-All right.
-Find him immediately.
-All right. -All right.
-Chianti, move away from the Ferris wheel.
-Right away.
-Korn, get the gun ready.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Ah!
Aaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaah!
What do you want?
If you try to make me go back to them, you won't succeed.
Who are "they"?

The Organization?
"I knew it! He's got his memory back."
Then you must be the traitor Sherry.
Come on, let's get out of here.
We're playing for our physical.
We're leaving?
Where do you want to take me?
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
Gin's coming this way.
I'm sure you know what that means.
But... but why have you...?
I don't know why.
I have no idea why I saved you.
"But I've been thinking that Curacao can be any color."
"And I like myself much better the way I am now than the way I was before."
It's as simple as that.
And now, let's go on, little Sherry.
Wait!
The children are trapped in the Ferris wheel!
We must save them at once!
I don't know what's happened, but this way...
Let's see.
I can make out the wires and the detonator.
Now, concentrate.
Try not to get nervous.
And don't dawdle.
Sir! Sir, are you all right?
Sir, are you okay?
(screeching) Shit.
- (squeaking)
- (rumbling)
What's the matter, sir?
You still haven't found the Curacao?
There are 5 people inside the Ferris wheel, two children and three adults.
I don't like this at all.
Gin!
There's someone crouched in front of the detonator!
-Look, here.
-What?
If I remember correctly, we had hidden it in the fire hydrant.
(Gin) "The Public Safety people must have found him."
All that's left is to cut these two wires that are connected to the piston.
Come on, the last one and we'll be done.
I've done it!
Phew!
I deactivated it just in time.
(CLEC, CLEC)
You can spray them now, Korn.
With a hail of bullets.
(Chianti: river running wild)
This is getting interesting!
Take them out, Korn!
Understood.
(People: screams of panic)
(People: shouts of panic) Oh!
God in heaven!
What's the matter?
(people screaming in panic) Shit!
I've got to do something!
If I don't hurry, I'll get shot.
From above I won't make it.
There's no way.
Everyone's trying to call and the lines are jammed.
I just hope the kids are all right....
(Curacao) Hurry, jump!
(Curacao) Run!
(Curacao) Shit!
They see me as soon as I start running.
There's no way to do anything like that!
It's me they want to kill.
-Don't worry about saving the children.
-What are you going to do?
You plan to act as bait?
Don't go!
They'll kill you!
These movements, this silhouette... I'm sure, it's Curacao!
The features have concentrated on a single point.
They're attacking someone.
I have to take advantage of it to move!
You will die, Curacao!
(Vodka) My God!
(Vodka) We've lost track of the Curacao.
-No, not yet.
-We've accomplished the mission.
We still have to liquidate the other rats.
-The axis explosives?
-Aim the axis explosives. -Yes.
Yes.
I didn't want to do it before because I was afraid that the Curacao would run off
taking advantage of the confusion,
but simple policemen won't escape.
Korn, reload the gun immediately...
and blow up the shaft before the air force arrives.
Okay, I'm on it.
Haibara!
-Yes, very good.
-Guys, is it okay?
Ouch!
Do you know what happened out here?
Don't worry, I'll tell you later.
Now, stay calm.
Yes.
(Akai) Soc here.
Akai!
Amuro!
Where do I weld?
Akai!
Mm-hm.
You all right, partner?
Take cover.
You can still hear the rotor noise.
I have no idea.
Where is it, the Amuro?
But if the Men in Black are attacking us directly,
it'll be because he's found a way to deactivate the detonator.
Now we need a strategy to...
(Amuro) And this rifle?
Is it a toy, or what?
Amuro!
Don't you know how to fight back, FBI?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I know what I have to do,
the problem is that I just broke my night vision scope
and I can only use the spare visor I was carrying,
which is useless at night.
I can't shoot down the helicopter in the dark.
Yes.
If you could see it, you could shoot it down?
But how will you do it?
If I aim at the rotor seal, I could...
I didn't see it, the joint!
When you're facing him, it's impossible to see it.
But if he destabilizes...
and, in addition, we illuminate the rotor area for only 5 seconds...
I could take care of this,

The problem is that I don't know what shape the area to be illuminated is.
What do you intend to do?
To explode the bombs on the shaft?
They intend to blow up the whole Ferris wheel!
My God!
There are still half of the explosives in the wheel shaft!
Ha-ha-ha!
Shoot, shoot!
Shit, shit, shit!
I know where they're shooting from, but I can't see where the rotor is!
(Amuro) You just need to know where it is, right?
(Amuro) Come on.
Try not to miss!
I've seen it!
(Amuro) Come in!
Artificial -FOC!
-And this light?
What is it?
What is it, that?
They are attacking us!
-Are they firecrackers?
But... from where?
Ajupe't.
Good!
Bravo!
(Alarm)
We have lost control!
If we keep falling, we'll crash!
Korn, get out of the way!
(screams) Shit!
"If you destroy the axle, the Ferris wheel will roll down!"
(Alarm)
(People: screams of panic)
(People: screams of panic) Ah!
I can't take it anymore.
We retreat!
Correeeeu!
Run!
Move away from the aquarium!
(People: screams of panic)
(Waterwheel: screeching)
Oh, my God!
If it continues to roll, it will crush the aquarium!
Don't you want to know who they were, the ones who attacked us?
Mm... I don't care to know them.
They are doomed to die.
Attention!
Go to the dolphin show stage!
You are in danger here!
Ran, we must march!
The Ferris wheel!
"Shit! It has accelerated down the slope!"
(Conan!
Can you stop the Ferris wheel?
Amuro!
I don't know, but I'll have to try!
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
I'm fine, I'm fine.
You concentrate!
Amuro!
Yes!
Go ahead!
Iaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
I can't reach!
Akai!
Mm-hm.
I guess you have a good plan.
Do you now?
Yes.
No, not yet!
Hurry up, Sonoko!
(Man) Mail!
Don't stop!
It's okay, I have another idea.
So it won't stop!
Kudo!
(Man) Shit!
I won't make it in time!
Take it easy, don't rush!
Akai!
Let's see if this... works.
Ran!
Isn't this ball from in...?
Inflate!
Faster!
Fatter!
Run!
Alert!
(Horn)
(horn) Nothing.
It won't stop!
(horn honks) Oh!
Ooh! (horn honks)
It's them!
(Mitsuhiko) Stop!

(Mitsuhiko) Looks like it's stopped, doesn't it?
(Genta) Finally!
It's stopped!
(Ayumi) Surely Conan has saved us!
(People: exclamations of joy)
What a creature!
He alone has managed to stop a runaway Ferris wheel.
That crane... Who was supposed to drive it?
Well done, mate.
Ah, yes.
(Kazami) Wait!
I want to identify the body.
Yes, of course, but I doubt I can recognize the victim.
(Kazami) Understood.
(Kazami) Thank you.
You may go.
Yes.
This is...!
Hey, kid.
Won't you show me what you've collected?
-A USB stick, maybe?
-What is it, this junk?
No.
It's not a flash drive.
It's a memory.
Even if it's been charred.

(TV: woman) "Last night was lived..."
(Scoundrel) Oops!
I missed so little.
What a bad aim, Mitsuhiko.
You think I'm a bad shot?
-Well, come on.
-Why don't you try it?
She... she told me... she wanted to save all of our lives.

I'm sure I would have.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have kept that little doll until just before I died.
But I still don't get it.
I don't understand why...
Yes.
We played with her in the hospital.
And we gave her a doll!
It gave her an illusion she won.
Didn't it?
Yes.
Just like the keychains that had been given to us.
-This is mine.
-Look.
But then... he disappeared.
I guess he eventually got his memory back and came home.
It was very bad for us, because we were about to become friends.
-Mm-hm...
-Yes...
Don't worry about it.
With God, you were already good friends.
Think long and hard, and you'll always remember each other.
-That's true!
-You're right! -You're right!
Yes.
Maybe the children are the ones who made her change.
(Ai) Yes.
Moments before she died
they changed her color.
