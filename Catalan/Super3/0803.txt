(Children) Watch out for the fire!
This parade makes me feel a little nostalgic!
Yes, it looks like a samurai movie.
No, more like something from the Showa period.
An elementary school kid saying he feels nostalgic for the Showa period....
It's a subject that worries me a lot, Haibara.
You mean the fires?
There's been one after another.
There was one four days ago and another one two days ago.
Yes...
This is a fire every other day.
There could be one tonight.
-But what's going on?
-Ah!
It can't be!
Mm?
What's this?!
(Man) You see?
There's a fire!
Let's run over there, come on!
Could it be the man we saw?
(Ayumi) Aaaah!
-(Man) Really?
-Yes, it could be the arsonist.
(Ayumi) -Oh?
-(Ayumi) Huh?
- (all) What?!
-It's just... I know him, this guy.
(Firefighters: siren)

(Conan voice) "The playground arsonist."
-Yeah, sure, I'm positive.
-But are you sure, Genta?
When I come here to buy my eel bento,
I've met this man many times
and he always buys a big portion of seaweed bento.
I was just saying that in case he's the arsonist we saw last night.
I've already found him.
If we're wrong, too bad.
This is what happened last year.
A string of playground fires.
And it seems to be repeating the same places.
In yesterday's playground there was also one, already.
Yes, they are all playgrounds in an area with a radius of three kilometers.
The fires occurred consecutively
within a two-week period.
And the fourth park, there ended up being a fatality.
No suspects were arrested and the arsons stopped.
And now, a year later..., it's back to square one....
the same places as last year and with the exact "modus operandi".
And haven't you thought about the possibility that he is now a copycat?
Yes..., but I think it's much more likely...
that the same arsonist is acting again.
-Xxxt!
-It's this one!
It's this man!
Don't shout so loud, Genta, he'll feel you!
I'm sure, it's the same man we saw last night!
Please, the same as always.
Understood.
The seaweed bento, a big portion!
Your kinpira is the best I've ever eaten.
And I'm not just saying that to be nice, really.
Caram, how much do you love me, mistress?
Thank you so much!
Is it because we're both left-handed?
Ha-ha-ha!
-Thank you, mistress!
-Here, boy, change.
Gee, you're incorrigible.
You should eat salad, too, once in a while.
Oops!
Now don't tell me I've lit a flame in your heart, mistress!
Ah, I'm a bad element, an incendiary of love!
-What a thing to say, eh?
Ha-ha-ha!
-Eh?
So long!
-I'm sure he's the arsonist.
-Whew, ten-hay-do, this guy.
Let's just say we saw him last night!
The Junior Detective League is handling the case!
Yes, sir!
What do we do now?
Shouldn't we leave the case to the police?
(Shinichi voice) Eh?
Maybe so...
But it could be that he went there, but he wasn't the arsonist.
(Shinichi voice) I agree.
We'll have to figure this out ourselves.
Yes.
Huh?
-Uuuh...
- (guts: rac-rac)
I'm starving.
You just ate three meat patties from the store.
I made a mistake, I should have gotten an eel bento.
-Couldn't it be that I went to sleep?
-Oh, oops.
The arsonist has been setting fires day in and day out,
so maybe tonight he won't do anything.

Alas, alas, alas...
Ep.
Well, look, he has gone to sleep as you said.
- (all) Eh?
-Bad luck.
Come on, let's go!
-What a rage!
-Well, he's escaped from us!
But where did he go?
Until the third fire, the parks where he went
have been the same as last year.
If the same rule applies to the fourth fire, we should go...
In the park of the fourth fire last year.
Hey, wait for me!
-But I can't take it anymore, Mitsuhiko.
-Come on, let's go, Genta!
I'm starving!
This is the park where last year's fourth fire took place.
And also, one person died, a victim of the fire.
If I remember correctly,
it was a drunken office worker who stayed in the park to sleep it off
and the fire caught him when he was unconscious.
This park is a bit scary at night, don't you think?
They should put more streetlights, make it more illuminated.
Yes, but there's all the lighting in this building next door.
Strange that there were no eyewitnesses.
But this band is the north.
There are a lot of people living here.
(Genta and Ayumi) Aaaah!
(Genta and Ayumi) Aaaah!"
-Aaaah!
(Genta and Ayumi) Oh!
-Aaaah!
It's gone out!
(Genta and Ayumi) -We had a narrow escape.
-Oh, boy, we got away just fine. -Oh, boy.
-Are you sure you're all right, kids? -Yeah.
-We were lucky, though.
Ah!
The arsonist!
Hey, hey, kids, I just saved you from the fire, don't tell me that.
Oh, shit!
He got away from me again!
It happened yesterday too, didn't it?
"Again"?
Yes, I was about to catch him.
-What do you mean?
-But at the last moment...
So you think that these fires in the children's playgrounds
are related to the fires that happened last year?
That's why I was on guard yesterday.
Yes, children, you could say so.
Why are you so interested in catching the culprit?
Because... there are no more fires.
If it's the same arsonist as last year..,
I feel like catching him with my hands.
But... can we know where we stand, you children?
--The Junior Detective League!
-We are...
-Yes, we're junior detectives.
-Junior Detectius?
We're very grateful to you for saving us from the fire.
We thought you were the arsonist, it's too bad for us.
Well then, if you're looking for the arsonist too,
you could say we're all on the same side.
On the same side?
Yes!
.
Shut up!
It's true!
Well, I'm the Lone Detective League
that wants to catch the damn arsonist to protect the people!
But a League is a grouping of people.
A league is never made up of just one person.
Okay, thanks.
I already have your details, I don't need you for anything else.
I'm going home.
-You're going home?!
- (all) What?!
And then what about the arsonist?
Kids, leave that to the Lone Detective League.
-We could all work together.
-It's too dangerous.
We also want to protect the city from this arsonist.
-Mm!
-Go, please don't be unfriendly.
Do you have a reason, for not working with us?
Ah... No, of course not, no way.
-We'll make a new detective league!
-Well, it's already decided! -Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
-Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Mm..., mm...
What a bunch of kids!
I can't waste my time with those kids.
-Good morning, we're here!
-What?!
Already...
This is the first park where they set fire to it, right?
Last year they burned this swing set here in front of the park.
And this year..., this year they've been burning this one.
-It's about reviewing the case.
-And what are we doing here?
Investigate what system they use to set fires.
Or we'll look for eyewitnesses and listen to what they have to tell us.
But, if there had been eyewitnesses as you say,
wouldn't the police have caught the arsonist long ago?
-I suppose so, of course.
-I would say, I don't know.
Don't you think so?
I haven't had breakfast yet.
If you'll excuse me...
Me neither, me neither!
You've had breakfast, you're not fooling me.
Yes, I've had breakfast, but I'm hungry again!
-And what else can we do?
-Coi de nano!

I'm sure the police investigated everything
and are investigating it again right now.
Yes..., you are absolutely right.
These climbing bars were burned last year.
And this arched bridge was burned in the second fire this year.
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
-That's right.
Eh ?!
Mm...
Geez, you, I'm hungry again!
I'll go eat some ramen.
- (Ai) It's not time to eat yet!
- (Genta) Yes, I'm hungry too!
(Ayumi) Research comes first.
For you, too!
(Man) Sorry, guys.
(Ayumi) In this park, they set fire to it the day before yesterday.
(Mitsuhiko) This year they burned the children's climbing tubes.
Last year, this zebra, right?
-Mm...
-Oh..., I'm so hungry!
(all) Oh!
- (all) Hey?!
-Hey, are we going to eat eels?
(all) Eh?
(all) Oh!
Yeah, yeah! (all cheering)
(all) What?
Can it be a coincidence?
Is something wrong?
(Genta) Oops, oops, oops!
How it looks like, that!
And I have extra ration!
Are you sure you're doing well inviting everyone?
Yes, don't worry, I just got my salary.
-And I've ordered soup.
Bon appetit!
- (Ayumi) Thank you very much.
I'm going to the bathroom.
(All three) Thank you very much for inviting us!
(Genta) Mm!
How nice!
(Ayumi) Eh?
Oysters!
(Genta) Wow!
Yes...
(Ai) He took off?
-(Ai) What's wrong?
Where is he, our friend?
-Why did you run away, Conan? -Why?
He stood us up.
He's got us all tangled up.
And why?
Why did he stand us up?
I don't understand.
I think we were in his way because of what he wants to do,
that if we should all go together, we'd be in the way because of his plan.
I do not understand you.
What do you mean by this, Ai?
-No, not at all.
-But so maybe...?
Now you're not going to tell me that yes...?
He's the arsonist!
(Mitsuhiko) He's tricked us.
- (Ayumi) That's bad!
-Why did he do it?
It was delicious.
But I can't forgive him!
What is true... is that his interest in the subject was not normal.
Because... there are no more fires.
If it's the same arsonist as last year..,
I feel like catching him with my hands.
There's no doubt he's somehow involved with these fires.
You're right.
Last year...
What is it, Conan?
But this is...
Eh?
Come, mail!
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?
Conan!
(Genta) Wait Contact us
In this park we were yesterday.
You three stay here, please!
(All) What?!
I see where you're going.
(Shinichi voice) Just as I thought!
But who must it be, the arsonist?
And what is his motive for setting these fires?
Here are the two key questions.
Eh?!
Look over there!
(Conan voice) I didn't see him yesterday, because it was already dark.
But this can't be a coincidence, no way!
But what do you mean, Conan?
It's a countdown!
That the arsonist has left characters encircled with the red circle
in each and every place where he has acted: in the first square...
And what else can we do?
Surely the police investigated everything
and they are investigating it again right now.
Yes..., you are absolutely right.
This character can be read as "tone".
In the second park...
Mm... Gee, you, I'm hungry again!
I'll go eat some ramen.
Mm?
"He".
Third park...
Oh!
Hey, let's go eat eels?
"Ho.
And this is the fourth park.
"Ni".
"To", "he", "lo", "ni"...
A countdown!
This is the verse "Iro-ni-lo he-to" written backwards!
Yes...
"Iro-ha" is missing.
This means that the fires are not over yet, step by step,
that there still have to be more.
Last year I wanted to do them all.
But when a person died on the fourth fire,
the arsonist stopped out of fear or because there was police pressure,
and the chain of crimes was interrupted.
He let it go before setting the fifth fire.
But why does he always choose playgrounds?
And he sets fire to children's playgrounds.
I can't figure it out.
Could it be that it was...?
That's right!
Iroha Games.
Here too.
-And that too, Conan!
-That's Iroha too.

Yes, I thought so.
Yes, yes, to all says "Iroha Games".
It is likely that the children's equipment that has been burned to the other playgrounds
was from this company.
Hey, look.
They just happen to have the factory very close to here.
(Mitsuhiko) Everything that has burned is from Iroha Games?
(Mitsuhiko) -Do you really know?
-Do you know where the next fire will be?
It's the fifth and last place, and I think it will catch fire today.
The factory must be closed so today is Sunday.
What?
Look there!
This van is not from...?
-L'incendiari!
-Aaaah!
-Well, it's him after all!
-He's left-handed!
Yes!
Call 110 and 119 at once!
-What are you doing?!
-Come here! -Where are you going, Conan?!
Where are you going, Conan?!
(Carafe: tap-tap)
The police will be here any minute!
(Woman) Who... who are you?
Conan Edogawa, a detective.
Look, I recommend that you turn yourself in...,
bento store cook and arsonist.
You can't be!
He's not the left-handed guy we know!
It's just that both he and she are left-handed.
But the van they took the kerosene drums with is hers.
-Oh?
- (man) MHM!
MHM!
MHM!
MHM!
Yeah... I figured as much.
But I don't understand... Why did you do it?
-Thank you, mistress!
-There you go, boy, the change.
Gee, you're incorrigible.
You should also eat salad, once in a while.
Aaaah...
(thinks) "This smell is kerosene. Could it be that...?"
Eh?
The mistress.
Where has she gone?
I don't see her.
- (thumping)
-Ah!
About a year and a half ago,
a little boy who was playing in a playground,
in one of the equipment assembled by our company,
got hurt badly, he was seriously injured.
The company put all the blame on me,
because I was the director of the factory,
and they washed their hands and dismissed me.
But what fools!
What do you mean?
So you were the factory manager?
And why this countdown to Iroha?
Why did you stall?
I wanted to take revenge for their injustice,
and make them regret what they had done to me.
If the company had acknowledged that they had behaved wrongly
and asked for forgiveness, I would have stopped.
But you are the only ones
who have noticed the message I have been leaving.
-For God's sake, ma'am!
- (crying) I'm an idiot!
A person died because of you, in one of the arsons!
Have you already forgotten?
This can't be true!
Your kinpira was so and so delicious!
It's that, I just loved it!
(Woman: cries)
(Police: siren)
(Police: siren)
Mr. Inspector, detingui'm me, too.
- (all) What?!
-Eh?
You witnessed the fourth fire we had last year.
What?!
Isn't this it?
-And-and how was that?
-Yeah, the nano got it right. -Yeah.
-Really?
-No way!
-Look at this.
-And how do you explain it?
-Yes...
-A robbery?
I broke into that apartment.
-So you're a thief?
-No way!
Really?
Yes, and you went to steal in that block of apartments...
in front of the park of the fourth fire.
The fire in which one person died.
Since that day I've changed and stopped stealing in apartments.
At that time I didn't say anything because I was afraid of being arrested.
I justified myself by telling myself that I had not seen the arsonist properly,
and so I went away fooling myself.
But if I had turned myself in then, they would have arrested him sooner.
They should have clarified the motives for the fires in the playgrounds
and this nightmare would have ended.
And suddenly it started all over again, just like the year before.
And then I decided that I would go after the damn arsonist
and capture him,
and that after that I would turn myself in to the police.
But what I've been more puzzled about is that you knew he was the thief.
Ah, well, i-it seems to me....
You consulted Kogoro about all this, didn't you, Conan?
Yes, that's right!
When I explained to him that you were so concerned about the fires,
and I told him about the "modus operandi" of the robbery,
the Kogoro explained his deduction.
Caram, the Sleeping Kogoro?
Blow, you!

It has an impressive reputation!
Well, then I really had nothing to do, me.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

And about the accident of that boy in the playground

it was announced that the investigation of the factory had been reopened.
Beware of fire!
Beware of fire!

No.

I'll investigate the photographer.
