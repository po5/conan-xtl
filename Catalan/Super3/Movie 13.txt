(TV: female) "We are talking to you live from the Toht tower,
"in the Minato district,
"To inform you of the Tanabata Festival..,
which is taking place here at the tower these days."
Yes, I know.
Let's meet at the doctor's house at 4 o'clock, okay?
But above all, don't be late, eh, Genta?
So far.
I just... I'm missing my flashlight.
Now I don't remember if I left it in the drawer or...
(knocking)
Ah, it's here.
Who's there?
What are you, Ran?
Strange, Kogoro's gone to play mahjong.
Mm?
My imagination.
How long, eh, Shinishi Kudo?
No.
Your name is now Conan Edogawa.
Who knew you'd be living here with this child's body?
What a shocker!
I didn't expect it at all.
(Thinking) "But how can it be? How did they know, who was it?"
Conan!
What happened?
I heard a very loud noise.
Conan!
And now you will see...
what happens to all those who have helped you in one way or another.
Conan.
Don't you feel me?
Conan.
That you're in here?
Conan, if you're...
Conan...
Ran!
Wow!
What a nightmare!

DETECTIVE CONAN.
THE BLACK PURSUER

"I am Detective Shinichi Kudo."
"One day I went to the amusement park with Ran Mouri.
"My best friend and classmate,
"And I witnessed a suspicious exchange
between two men dressed in black."
"I was so focused on watching those two men,
that I didn't realize there was another one behind me."
"He made me swallow a poison
"And, when I woke up....
(Conan voice)... my body had shrunk!"
"If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
they would want to kill me and the lives of those around me would be in danger."
"That's why Dr. Agasa
recommended that I hide my identity."
"When the Ran asked me what my name was,
I randomly told him I called myself Conan Edogawa."
"Since Ran's father is a detective,
"I decided to go live with them
to try to get information about the Men in Black."
"The Men in Black organization are, as far as I know,
"Gin, in Vodka,
"the Vermouth, the Chianti,
the Korn and the Sherry."
"The Sherry's real name is Shiho Miyano."
"Her parents were scientists
"who worked for the criminal organization,
"so when they both died,
"She was left to work with the Men in Black
and they gave her the code name Sherry."
"She is one of the creators of the reducing drug Apotoxin 4869."
"Subsequently, the organization...
"Murdered her older sister, the Akemi Miyano,
and that's why she decided to leave them."
"She took the same drug as me
and was left as a child."
"Since then she calls herself Ai Haibara.
"And she also leads an incognito life.
"Pretending to be an elementary school student
at the same school as me."
"Recently, I've managed to talk to Vermouth...
and found an important clue about the organization."
If I were you, I wouldn't do that, because... think that, if anything happens to me,
my colleagues will immediately receive the e-mail from your head.
"The seven raven broods"?
(Shinichi voice) Yes, when they dial the e-mail address of your head,
the buttons sound like this song.
Don't tell me you're dialing it now!
No, man, no.
I wouldn't make it, this mistake.
No, because first of all I'll tell Inspector Takagi...
to find out whose e-mail address this is.
If you do, they'll kill him.
When the poor man pulls any strings to trace its origin,
the organization's people will kill him.
And they will get to you, because it is obvious that, to begin with,
they will investigate who gave him the address.
I hope it's clear to you that you can't send it to anyone, this address.
And leave alone, the Men in Black organization.
If you follow their lead, you will regret it.
It would be like opening Pandora's box.
Soc small, but I have the brain of an adult.
A detective who solves all mysteries.
The truth... always comes out in the end!
Look up there.
And it's a good-looking one.
I've got it.
How nice!
The stag beetles are the most beautiful of all.

-No, no, wait.
-Come on, I'll go to the tree too.
-He can't.
-It's better that you can't, Genta.
Only Conan or a monkey can climb so high.
Don't you see?
Thanks for calling me a monkey.
But why don't you use the suspenders?
What suspenders... you mean?
Ah.
Those special ones you made me?
I always wear them.
Yes, of course you do.
I modified them so they can be extended up to 100 meters.
If you push the button once, they go as long as you want them to go,
and when you press it again, they snap right back into place.
Ouch!
I'm sorry, man.
Man, you went a little overboard.
Oh!
A beetle!
Wow, lucky you, isn't it, Genta?
-Ha-ha-ha!
-Look, look, another one! -Look, look, another one!
Look, look!
Look at it!
Yes.
There's another one.
-It's fantastic, isn't it?
-They'll have to be male and female.
The female has a thing... it's got something attached to the wings.
Look at that.
But who put it on her?
Eh?
It says something here.
-Ah, it says "open."
- "O... pen..."
It's one of those labels they put on packages of prepared food.
I opened a chicken one yesterday that had it on it.
Chicken?
Didn't we tell you not to sneak food so you don't get fat?
-Yes, here.
-Come on, let's go, I'll get it out of you. -Oh.
Oh.
Look what you're putting on this, poor little animal.
If they're male and female, maybe they're sweethearts.
Let's see.
They were both here, together.
Come on, come on, we have to give them a name?
Let's see, what if we name the male Hikoboshi and the female Orihime?
Yes, how nice!
It's true, it's the Tanabata festival.
Yes, speaking of Tanabata, which is the festival of the stars,
I have one of those stories that you like.
This is what you say that we like so much.
It turns out that on the eve of Tanabata, many years ago,
it rained so much that Hikoboshi and the Orihime
"They couldn't find each other."
"They were so upset that they decided to create a day to see each other,
"And they called it 'The day with your beloved',
which later became 'The day of lovers'."
And now... see if you know which day we're talking about.
Option 1: January 1, the first day of the year.
Option 2: February 2, the day of the change-of-season holiday.
Option 3: March 3, girls' day.
Option 4: May 5, which is "Tango no sekku", the children's day.
I know!
Option 3: girls' day.
Because that's when they put on the dolls of the emperor and the empress.
No, the 5th of May, the day of the "Tango no sekku",
because tango is a very passionate couple dance.
I say option 1: because on New Year's Eve you always eat good things!
Wow.
You always relate everything to food.
What's the good one?
-I got it right!
-It's option 4, May 5th.
Yes, but the reasoning was wrong.
May 5 also says: "Kodomo no".
If you separate the characters of "Kodomo no"...
you get "Ko-y-tomo-no-hay", which means "Lover's Day".
Yes.
That's right.
That's why earlier the doctor let us know
that over time the day changed its name.
Valentine's Day...
Well, I hope that these two cute beetles,
Hikoboshi and Orihime, can always be together.
But I don't know if Hikoboshi and Orihime
are very appropriate names for beetles.
How can they not be?
They are very well matched.
The star related to Orihime is Vega.
And it turns out that the label that was attached to the female
was in the shape of a V.
That's right.
Yes, you're right.
That's nice, isn't it?
Ha-ha-ha!
Hey, how do I get down from here?
Huh? (Laughs)
Oh, shit.
What's wrong now?
What's wrong now?
Don't brake.
Brake.
Brake!
Shit, shit, shit!
Easy, easy, don't move.
Run, call an ambulance.
Ta... Tanabata... it's today...
Hey.
Hold on, the ambulance will be here soon.
Hey.
Open your eyes.
Hang in there, man.
(Kogoro) For the record, I let you come, but I don't want to feel it.
Yes.
Get along, eh?
Your tie's crooked, Father.
(Ah, Mr. Mouri.
Thank you so much for coming so quickly.
Hello, Ran, good morning.
Hello, Conan.
(Ran and Conan) Hello, good morning.
-(Takagi) Yes.
-Is this about the serial killer case?
Yesterday's murder was the highway toll to enter Odawara.

We have included it in the list because there was a piece of mahjong.
It is one of the clues left by the killer each time:
In Tokyo, in Kanagawa, Shizuoka and Nagano.
Everywhere we've found one of these pieces.
-All right.
-We have a total of 6 cases.
Now at the meeting we will inform you of all the details.
It looks like a complicated case.
-Come in.
-Let's see what they say.
Oh, but it's Mr. Mouri!
But it's Mr. Mouri!
It's been a long time!
Ah... You keep shouting instead of talking.
Hello, Sango.
This is my brother, in Game.
You kneaded.
I've already thought about it.
-Xxt!
-What... you're kneaded, he says! -It says!
Ah!
Well, and the lady, who is she?
Eh?
Oh, yes, sorry.
Inspector Ogino, from Saitama Prefecture.
Yes, Ayami Ogino.
I've already heard about you.
Well, I'm surprised that there's such a pretty woman in the Saitama police.
Yes, and when I worked there, she was my assistant, precisely.
Is there any case there, too?
No, but the residence of one of the victims we are investigating...
was in Tokorozawa, that's why they made me come too.
And you, why did you come?
Mr. Mouri is here because superintendent Matsumoto
made him come as a special advisor.
It's really bad, if we have to ask for help from a private detective.
(Man) You can say that.
Well, what a surprise!
If it isn't Inspector Kansuke Yamato, from Nagano Prefecture,
and the most clumsy officer of Gunma Prefecture.
Please, Mr. Mouri, I have a first and last name too, eh?
Misao Yamamura.
Look.
But wasn't that in Nagano prefecture, the murder?
Why is there someone from Gunma?
The first case took place
exactly on the border between Nagano and Gunma, so...
The victim's body was left, from the knees to the feet,
in the corner of Gunma prefecture, which is my prefecture.
Ah.
Yes, I've already seen it, the badge, heavy!
Mm?
But are you an inspector?
-Ah.
You've already seen it, right?
-Don't smoke, they've made you an inspector! -Yes, thanks to my team, they promoted me to inspector.
Well yes, thanks to my team, they promoted me to inspector.
(Kogoro) I can't believe it.
"They don't know what they've done, Gunma Prefecture."
By the way, didn't the boy with the glasses come today?
What glasses boy?
Oh, you mean Conan?
Yes, that's right.
At Conan Edogawa.
I don't know why, but when he runs around here,
the cases always get solved.
Yes, I have that feeling too.
-Ah, I see we all feel the same way.
-Yes, and so do I, it's true.
Yes, because we both say so too.
When he's there, there's a moment when I lose consciousness...
and when I come to, I don't quite know how, I've already figured it out.
-Really?
-Lose consciousness?
-Me neither.
-It doesn't happen to me.
What?
Am I the only one?
"You're the only inspector
I can shoot the anesthetic dart at with no problem."
Ahem...
That's very strange.
Let's see, we'd like to start the meeting.
Ah.
Yes, excuse me.
-Huh? -Mr. Mouri.
-Mr. Mouri.
Mr. Mouri!
Who's that guy?
The fat guy with the unfriendly face.
Shut up, you donkey.
It's Superintendent Kiyonaga Matsumoto.
What's that?
With this face?
Let's see if he'll punch you in the face.
(Sango) Before we talk about the sixth case,
I would first like to go over the common points
between the 5 previous cases.
We know that a large knife has been used in all of them.
And from the size and direction of the wounds,
we're sure that the assailant has always stabbed her from above
and with the right hand.
But the most remarkable thing is that the first 5 victims were abducted
by immobilizing them with a stun gun,
killed them in another place and left them.
And here a first question arises:
Why does the aggressor paralyze the victims
and take the trouble to take them to a specific place to kill them?
Another common element is the mahjong tiles,
all with a red mark and a letter of the alphabet
and a letter of the alphabet with a vertical black line on the back.
We have found next to the 6 bodies.
I am sure it is a message that the killer expressly left.
(Ogino) There is always a circle painted in red.

There are only two of the four circles below that have not yet been painted:
the upper right one and the lower left one.
The others at the bottom and the three at the top have all been marked.
There are two A's, an E, an H and a Z in capital letters.
And a lower case R which, upside down, could be a capital L.
In all 6 cases without exception we have also been able to verify that one of the personal items was missing.
that one of the victim's personal items was missing.
Yes, a pendant, a purse, a charm?
The key ring of a motorcycle, a compact disc, an animal figurine?
And couldn't it be that the victims had lost it during the kidnapping?
No, as in each case it is a single object,
it seems quite logical to think that they were taken by the assailant.
So it's all about deciphering the message.
Well, we have one last clue.
It was left by the sixth victim, Mr. Ryuzaki.
He said, "Tanabata is today."
In this case, it was oral.
We also know that Mr. Ryuzaki stopped at the Hakone service area
because he was leaking brake fluid,
and maybe that's where he met the killer.
Now, wait a minute.
I think everyone here is overthinking things.
The pieces indicate what it is, a game of mahjong.
And the motive could be... an argument over a game.
Oooh!
We have marks on two types of pieces: single-circle and seven-circle.
And this indicates that there are 8 people playing mahjong.
Of the seven circles, there are two that are not painted red.
One of them indicates the murderer and the other the last victim.
This means that there will be more victims, then?
Yes, maybe.
But to indicate 8 members,
wouldn't it have been more logical to use the 8-circle pieces?
No, because the one-circle and the seven-circle pieces have different meanings.
The murderer could have needed one of the two,
either the one-circle or the seven-circle, to win.
Besides, this game would have made him the absolute winner!
-Huh?
-I get it.
But someone won it in an easy and inelegant way.
Ah.
That's why the killer got angry, right?
That's right.
The other contestants were also supposed to play dirty
and the killer, in anger, killed them one by one.
Yes, I'm practically convinced...
that this is the motive for the 6 murders that have taken place.
But then, what do the letters of the alphabet mean?
And why does the killer take the victims to a particular place?
(Takagi) And another thing...
What does Mr. Ryuzaki's oral message mean?
Well, that's...
Let's see, it's just that... I've... (Takagi) I haven't finished thinking.
-It can't be.
-What?
What's he saying!
Sir...
(Men: whispers)
We should consider whether the places chosen by the murderer
might have some significance to him.
If so, there's a good chance...
that this would give us a clue as to his identity.
And we should also think that...
the six victims may have some kind of relationship.
If so, I'm sure...
that the quickest way to get to the killer
would be to find out what that relationship was.
It is also true that all this
may have something to do with the mahjong game.
But above all we must find out the meaning of the letters
and of the lines that have been written on the index cards
that we have found next to the victims.
And, obviously, the meaning of the last oral clue:
"Tanabata is today".
We have to be very attentive because it is possible
that the killer will strike again soon.
Therefore, any discovery we make should be reported immediately,
and must be shared with everyone to prevent him from killing again.
-Yes, sir!
-The sooner we find him, the better.
Ouch!
I'm pissing myself!
Where is the bathroom?
Conan, it seems to me that the meeting is over.
Yes, it is.
Ah... Superintendent...
It's good to see you.
I wanted to ask you about the Sayuri.
How are you?
You're Mouri's daughter.
She's as usual, really.
Goodbye, Mouri.
I'm counting on you.
Ah... Yes, superintendent.
I assure you that I won't stop
until I achieve the results expected of me.
Have a nice day.
He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he!
Hello.

Chiba, haven't you lost some weight?
Eh?
Have you noticed?
Yes, I've been on a diet for a while now.
I follow a program they do on TV to lose weight.
Speaking of slimming down, Shiratori,
on the contrary, I'd say you've put on weight.
Eh?
I guess you're joking, Mr. Mouri,
think that I go to the gym twice a week.
Strange that you drink black coffee, Sango.
Yes.
The doctor told me to avoid sweeteners and sugars.
What I find strange is that you don't drink it black as usual.
Yeah, it's just that with so many murders in a row,
I need a little sugar to wake me up.
-Huh?
-Hey, Inspector Yokomizo... -Hey, Inspector Yokomizo...
-Ah.
-Sorry, I was referring to the older brother.
Isn't that boy over there Conan Edogawa, what you said before?
Yes.
I don't know if it's because he always listens a lot to what Mr. Mouri says,
but sometimes he finds incredible clues.
Yes, he is very observant and he notices things...
that we professionals sometimes overlook.
Oh, really?
Is that so?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Eh? (Yamamura)
(Yamamura) Oh, little corvette, you cry all alone...
(Cell phone keys make the same melody)
Crows of the mountains...
Why are you singing that, Officer Yamamura?
Hey.
You don't know it, but I'm already an inspector.
How come you're singing this song right now, inspector?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because coming out of the washroom I felt someone dialing a phone...
and the tones of the buttons were like the melody of the song.
And, if I'm not mistaken, I think it was an officer wearing glasses.
Hey, Conan.
Where are you going?
Hey, Conan. Where are you going?
But...
"It can't be. They can't be here."
"They can't be."
"There."
Mm?
Hey, Conan.
Where are you going so fast?
"Shit!"
Hey, Conan.
I'm looking for a sink.
But it's right here, the washroom.
"It's a Porsche 356A, Gin's car."
"What are they doing, meeting about these serial killings?"
"What do they want?"
What do you say now?
That they have infiltrated the meeting?
(Shinichi voice) XXT!
Please don't call.
I hope the Ai didn't sense us.
No, it seems to me that he's working in the lab.
I'm sure it was the Vermouth disguised as a policeman.
Just leaving the meeting has sent the information to his head,
just as I was waiting for the elevator.
Yes, of course.
That's why in Yamamura has said that, coming out of the toilet,
he heard the tones of the buttons
reminiscent of the song "The Seven Broods of the Raven", right?
But why?
How many times have I told you that you can't hide anything from me even if I want to?
Hello, Ay.
Let's see, and why do you think so, that it's the Vermouth?
You don't have enough evidence.
Ah!
I've also seen Gin's Porsche.
They are not so stupid as to risk
to attend a meeting without being in costume.
And if anyone should dress up, it's Vermouth.
We know she's an expert at impersonating other people.
Be that as it may, after what I've seen,
I'm starting to be pretty convinced
that the Men in Black organization
has some hidden interest in this case.
Therefore, I would like to inspect every crime scene.
Yeah, sure, don't suffer.
Mm?
You will accompany me, won't you?
I suppose, no matter how much I ask you, you won't let it go, will you?
Well... go very carefully.
You know perfectly well that if they find out who you really are...
Yes, I know very well.
(Kogoro) What?
That they didn't know how to play mahjong?
No.
We have investigated it thoroughly expressly
and found out that none of the victims knew how to play.
That's too bad.
Your hypothesis cannot be confirmed, Kogoro.
I wish Shinichi were here.
Well, we're at an impasse now.
Shinichi, you say?
You mean Shinichi Kudo,
who you've gone to on a few cases because he helped you solve them?
Yes, this one.
Come to think of it, you don't hear him talking much lately.
Maybe he's tired of playing detective.
No, no, he hasn't.
It's not that he's tired of it.
He just recently solved a case at Teitan High School,
he showed up in the middle of a festival.
What?
Takagi, please.
-Why are you shushing him? -Why are you shushing him?

-Oh, yes, sorry.
It's just that Shinichi doesn't want it to be known
that he's been helping us in some cases lately.
-Yes, he's a very modest boy.
-All right, okay.
Yes, but, in fact, he's become so recently.
Because he used to like to let everyone know that he helped the police.
(Ai) Have you cleared up anything, the two days you have missed?
(Shinichi voice) Eh?
Ah...
(Ai) Not much.
What do the letters and stripes on the index cards mean?
I don't know yet.
Nor do I know what "Tanabata is today" means.
Alza, Mitsuhiko!
But you really know!
You've done very well, the beetle.
Yes, I've got a knack for handicrafts.
When I think of that tag
that they attached to the poor beetle...
Yes, to the Orihime, you mean.
-I don't know.
-Why would they do it to him, lo?
By the way, Genta, what have you done?
A snake?
Let's see.
Can't you see at once that it's an eel?
An-gui-la.
Have you made another eel?
You love eels, don't you, Genta?
The other day you also put something about eels
wishes for Tanabata.
"Come to think of it, tomorrow is Tanabata day."
"Tanabata is today."
"What would you like to say?"
(Mobile)
The cell phone, now?
In meetings I should turn it off.
Excuse me.
Yes, it's me.
Ah. (Cell phone ringing)
Yes.
Right. Right.
What does it say?
All right, all right.
Good news.
They're about to arrest a man
who could be our serial killer, in Beika's neighborhood.
Are you sure?
Minoru Fukase, 27 years old.
He's part of the list of suspects we've got
for the stabbing of the first victim, Shuhei Jinn,
who died at the Usui gazebo.
I had one of my men keeping an eye on the suspect's partner
and he just informed me that he is heading towards Tokyo from Nagano
and got off at Beika station.
His partner's name is Lisa Yoshii.
It appears that she worked at a bar in Nagano.
What was her motive, in Minoru Fukase, for stabbing Mr. Jinn?
I understand that they were in line at Tropical Land
and it seems that Shuhei Jinn asked him to stop smoking...
To Tropical Land, you say?
Oh...
Takagi, did you think of something?
I might have.
Maybe it's silly...
But what if it turns out that all the victims were also in line?
-Okay.
-What?
Explain a little more.
The mahjong tiles we found are of two types.
One, the one with one circle, that would be Mr. Jinn's,
and the others, which have 7 circles.
If we put the victims in the position
indicated by each red circle on each card,
it could be that the victims go to the queue following this order.
In Fukase it would be the one....
I get it.
Hurry, Megure, take your men and accompany Inspector Yamato.
I don't get it.
I don't know why you had to come, you.
Because I've always wanted to speed along the express lane.
What's the matter?
Don't you like it, you?
Now we'll do exactly what we've planned, okay?
"Is she the suspect?"
"Or are you waiting for him?"
Minoru!
Fukase is here.
Everyone stay in position and wait.
I don't want him to see you.
(Boy) Go, mail!
The game room is the seventh floor, right?
Mm-hm.
And then we'll get ice cream.
I'll have vanilla and chocolate.
Oh! (Laughs)
Inspector, there are some kids near Fukase.
Everybody be quiet.
Nobody do anything until these kids are out.
-It's never over.
-It's still missing.
They go up to the fifth.
-Yes.
-We're here.
Let's go.
Come on, take it.
-Wait.
-All right... Receipt...
Ah... What an ass he is!
Fukase.
Hands up.
Police!
-Merda.
- (Yamamura) You have no escape.
Let her be.
Let her be.
Don't come any closer.
Let me go or I'll kill her.
(Yamamura) Shit!
(People: shouting)
(people shouting) Eh?
Don't move.
Don't move if you don't want to get hit by this.
Leave it.
It won't do you any good.
It only makes it worse.
Shut up!
Don't come any closer!
(People: shouting in panic)
Don't move!
-All right, don't do anything to him.
-You, get back!
You've wasted our time.
He's been knocked unconscious.
What a shot!
(Woman) Get out of the way.
Get away from Minoru.

Get out of the way, I said.
-No!
-Calm down, Lisa, put down the knife.
It won't help you at all, acting like that.
Let it go, come on.
No... No!
Watch out!
-Leave Minoru alone.
(People: shouts of panic)
Come on, stop it, Lisa, please, don't complicate things any more.
No.
I didn't mean to...
Inspector.
Is it serious?
Don't worry, luckily, I have many layers of fat here.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It was my fault.
It caught me unawares.
Don't worry, it's better that I did the damage...
than a policeman from another prefecture.
But... Mm...
What's the matter?
The woman, the hostage, where did she go?
How strange!
Are you sure you want to leave like that?
Didn't you have to pass information to that man, Vermouth?
Now I can't tell him.
And I think it's because of you.
Isn't it?
But I don't think he's the killer either.
Yeah, neither do I.
Ah!
Watch out, you hurt me!
I have injured my right shoulder.
Ah.
The right shoulder, huh?
Ah.
Now I understand the scream from before.
Don't move!
A man who can't even lift his arm can't stab someone from above.
Maybe he's taken it wrong after the murders.
I'm still surprised you knew it was me.
Oh, is that so?
For the leg.
By the right ankle, specifically.
You're hiding a gun in there, aren't you?
Besides, I saw him cut you on the cheek with the knife...
and no blood came out.
Geez, kid.
Ha-ha-ha!
I'll have to make the next mask with blood on it.
You were smart of me to take you hostage,
Vermourth.
It was ideal for getting him away from the police
and then take the opportunity to kill him with your concealed weapon.
Although maybe you wouldn't even have needed the gun to kill him.
I have to admit that I am surprised that you are so upset.
May I know why you are interested in the murderer in this case?
Well, I see you're getting to the point with your questions, huh?
TNO.
Tell me.
TNO?
Unofficial Cover.
There is a member of the organization among the victims
and he doesn't want them to find out.
Yes, and the killer took a memory card from him...
with information on all of the organization's unofficial covers,
and we don't want it to get into the hands of anyone.
That's why I've been ordered to kill the assassin.
But of course...
You can't kill him because he hasn't figured out who he is yet.
That's right.
And, on top of that, I think he took that memory card...
without knowing what was on it.
I see what you mean.
If the police catch the killer first and find the card,
he's gonna be in a lot of trouble, right?
But you being here means he's got someone on the inside of the police force,
among the inspectors.
Or it's even more likely
that one of his people has disguised himself as one of the inspectors.
That's why you went undercover too, the other day,
because you wanted to make sure their man was doing the job right.
And he must be doing it right, because if he wasn't, you would have to come back to the meeting today.
Who is it?
Who is your man?
Is he alive, the inspector you have replaced?
I can't tell you any more.
You'll have to figure it out for yourself.
His code name is Irish.
Irish.
Yes, it's a kind of very smooth whiskey.
Hey, please.
I think this kid's lost his way.
No, he hasn't.
What's that?
A lost child?
Good luck to you.
Have a good one.
Hey.
Oysters!
(Mobile)
Yes, this is Megure.
Superintendent.
I just got a call from an artist named Sumire Shindo.
She thinks she knows who the serial killer we're looking for might be.
She gave me an address in Hachioji.
Yes.
Yes, okay, sir.
Sato, Takagi!
You must go to Hachioji immediately.
Yes.
Very well, all right.
"Sumire Shindo.
Even if we get rid of the cops,
they're sure to be sent by others in the area
who will arrive before us.
We don't have to take off our heads, cops.
Yes, it's me.
-I do the right.
-We're here.
Just in time.
Okay, I'll take the left.
Ha-ha-ha!
He's cute, the boy.
The girl, too.
Ah! (Laughs)
What was that?
Slow down and pull over to the shoulder to stop us.
Wow.
That's loud!
Look, the tire blew out.
And this one, too.

Takagi, call Inspector Shiratori.
Yes.
-Well, we're leaving right away.
-Bullshit.
We're late.
Let's go.
What?
He's not here?
I don't think he went willingly.
No, there are signs of violence and there's a lot of things on the ground,
it seems to have been taken by force.
We should mobilize to look for her,
and that the scientist comes here, too.
-Thank you.
- "Okay."
-Di.
-Takagi... Eh? (Takagi) What's wrong?
(Takagi) What's wrong?
(Shinichi voice) Yes.
(Takagi) What?
One of the inspectors?
His code name is Irish.
Ring a bell, this one?
Too bad.
No, I've never heard of him before.
If we knew what he looked like physically, we could deduce the inspector.
What? I don't think
I don't think you need to get involved.
What if it turns out that this Irish guy posing as one of the inspectors
saw you running after the Vermouth on the day of the meeting
and today at the mall, what?
Don't you get it?!
Yeah, but...
The more you help solve the case,
the more chances there are that they will find out
that you're Shinichi Kudo, you donkey!
Oh, come on.
I understand that you're worried about me, that's normal,
but I have to get involved, in this case.
The life of the inspector the Men in Black have replaced
is in danger.
Look, Haibara, for the moment, we already have a sure thing.
We know that this Irishman attended the first meeting.
"Therefore, I must hasten to deduce who he is,
but I also have to find out who the serial killer is."
to retrieve the card he took from one of the victims.
Because maybe by recovering that card,
I'll have enough to catch them all.
And are you sure you can trust what Vermouth told you?
She knows that the Ai is the Sherry,
and... she surely knows who I am too.
But she must have some reason not to tell.
And now it's the only clue I have.
At least she got you out of the cave you were hiding in.
I'm interested in getting the Irish out, where he's hiding.
Well, but for now, until the case is solved,
you and I shouldn't see each other anywhere but at school.
We must take the utmost precautions.
-Mm?
- (cell phone)
(Mobile)
Yes, say, Gin.
"Where have you been for the last two hours?"
"I know you've turned off the mobile, I want to know where you were."
Why do you care so much?
I'm not worried, I just want you to concentrate...
on the mission we've assigned you.
Look, if we put it like that, it was you, wasn't it,
that made the teenage detective swallow the drug?
-With Shinichi Kudo, I'll take you out.
- "What are you dating me with now?"
Don't you remember?
(Conan voice) Ran, what's wrong?
(Conan's voice) Ah!
Sorry, I broke your bowl.
That's all right.
But what happened to you?
You don't drop anything.
I don't know, I had a shiver all of a sudden.
Yes, it's the same one.
The victim is Sumire Shindo.
All right, okay, until 3 o'clock.
-The victim is Sumire Shindo.
Bye, see you later.
Yes.
That was Inspector Takagi?
There's a case meeting again today.
What else have you found out?
Yes, another victim, Sumire Shindo.
Where was he?
He was found this morning.
In a park in Ayase, Kanagawa Prefecture.
And there was also a mahjong tile?
And the red circle was the one at the top right, the four at the bottom.
And behind it there was no letter, but a kind of triangle.
(Kogoro) Go, mail.
You'll be late for school.
-But how can it be?
-The one from Conan?
(Kogoro) Good morning.
Who did it?
I don't get it.
Hey, Conan.
Bad news.
Someone broke your dolphin fin.
Are you serious?
Oh, uh... Wow.
"There's traces of a leather glove."
No, nothing for me.
It's very mysterious, that, isn't it?
Someone must have accidentally dropped it while passing by or while cleaning up.
We've looked for it, but we haven't found it.
It's all right.
I'll make another one and stick it on him.
It's not that, you're not fooling me.
It's nothing.
You do not suffer.
"It was them, I'm sure."
This thing with the wheels could have ended very badly.
-Yes, and you don't find it strange?
-When I think...
It's not very normal for two tires to blow up at the same time.

And what do you mean?
That there were nails in the road?
-What?
-Snipers.
I'm sure they shot at our wheels.
And it had to be from here.
It had to be from here.
There was a car up here.
Ah... Don't smoke.
I know this may sound like paranoia to you,
but I have a feeling that, apart from the serial killer we're looking for,
there's more people involved with something else in this case.
People involved with what?
(Sato) In Sumire Shindo's workshop there were two different footprints.
"One had crushed the paint tube
and another had stepped on the spilled paint."
"Therefore, one had been made later than the other."
And this could mean
that the first is from the painter's kidnapper,
and the second from someone who happened later.
And couldn't it be that it was the same person but later,
and that he is the murderer?
But there is another thing:
the woman in Fukase who used the department store as a hostage.
Maybe she was also one of them.
Maybe she expressly offered herself as a hostage and then left.
Eh?
Why is that?
Sato, you see more things than you should.
Yes, I do.
Maybe you're right.
"But..., if it were true,
"It would mean that there's a spy inside the corps
who sends information to people outside."
"And, furthermore, it must be someone who attends the meetings."
Eh?
The Black Knight's helmet?
Yes, it's broken.
The theater group was very angry.
They were very angry. Huh?
And the bowl...
Yesterday at home my Conan's bowl broke.
And now the helmet that Shinichi put on here is broken.
It's a bad omen, for sure.
You mean you're not exaggerating a little?
But they have nothing to do with each other.
I know, but... I'll tell him anyway, just in case.
"The Black Knight's helmet?"
"I don't like it at all, that. There were my prints."
"If this fin and helmet thing is the organization's thing,
I don't have much time."
"I have to think of something, and fast."
"Ran and Kogoro's lives are at stake."
"The memory card."
"If I could find that memory card, everything would be so much easier."
"I have to find the killer any way I can."
Yes.
Ah, maybe it's Shinichi.
Look at what he says:
"Now I'm investigating a dangerous case, don't write or call me."
It must be dangerous, yes.
Wow...
Yes.
"I could have at least let me hear your voice."
"Now... what's still making my head dance
is that 'Tanabata is today' message."
What would that mean?
Mm?"
"Tanabata is today."
"Kyoto!"
(Heiji) Ah, Kudo!
It's been a long time, nano!
What do you want to ask me, let's see?
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
-Ah!
Ah!
Oh! (Laughs)
-Can I know who you're talking to?
Don't scare me like that.
Sorry, sorry.
Gee, you're really loud.
Heiji, who are you talking to, you're so scared?
Oh, shut up.
It's in Kudo.
In Kudo.
You're asking me if "Tanabata is today" rings a bell.
It's about a serial murder investigation.
Sorry, Kudo, it's just that Kazuha keeps asking me questions.
-Let's see, "Tanabata is today," you say?
- Tanabata is today, right?
That's the Mitarashi Festival, what is done to Kitano Tenmangu.
Or Tanabata, Shujin Temple, which is also well known.
Yes.
Why don't all 3 of us go today?
If you want to go, go by yourself.
Are you still here, Kudo?
I'm still here, Kudo?
But what Kazuha said makes sense.
It does?
Well, look, it would be quite a novelty.
Come on, please, let's go.
The festival is in Kyoto itself, we don't need to look for a hotel or anything.
Shut up, come on.
I wouldn't have thought of taking a hotel.
Don't you remember the fire two years ago?
"Hey, Hattori."
Hey, you...
What did you say about a fire?
Yes, the one in a hotel a couple of years ago.
Now that you mention it, it was the eve of Tanabata.
Tell me about it.
It happened in a luxury hotel, the Vega.
And, if I'm not mistaken, there were two dead and everything.
Hattori, find out everything you can about this fire.
I'll do that.
And as soon as possible.
Hey, what are you doing?
Where are you going now?
We're about to start.

Ah, tell the teacher I had to go.
Tell him I had to go to see the Vega
to investigate the Tanabata fire.
-What?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who's at the Vega?
-Goodbye.
"A fire."
"Could it be that the red marks
and the alphabet on the tiles symbolize a fire?"
"...the cause of the fire
could have been a cigarette thrown from the fifth floor,
aggravated by the fact that the emergency stairs were closed.
One of the people staying on the sixth floor died from smoke inhalation.
died from smoke inhalation.
Nanako Honjo, born in Mitaka City ".
Mr. Mizutani.
Mr. Mizutani.
Mr. Mizutani is not in today.
And you don't know where I might find him?
Ah, so you're Detective Mouri's assistant?
I'm Shun Sawamura,
I'm doing a doctorate in law at Jonan University.
Thank you very much.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
But please don't tell anyone who has seen me around here.
It's a very secret research.
Ah.
I get it.
That's why they send a child, right?
And what was the relationship between Kosuke Mizutani and Nanako Honjo?
Well, they were a couple.
Their parents were against the relationship
and they had run away from Chiba to come here.
They ran away?
The fire was two years ago, around Tanabata.
They had just been here and went to a hotel to celebrate.
But he had to go out for a while to meet up with a friend of his
and, while he was out, he set himself on fire in the hotel.
He has always felt guilty about his death.
He says that, had he not gone to see the friend, Nanako would still be alive.
He says it often, in tears.
And what does he do at Kosuke?
He used to be self-employed,
but since what happened, it seems to me that he hasn't worked much.
And lately I haven't seen him around the house, either.
No.
And do you have any idea where he might be now?
Ah.
Maybe he's back in Chiba.
Because today is the anniversary of Nanako's death.
It could be.
And they're having a ceremony for her?
We can ask her brother, if you want.
Just a second.
Nanako's brother had come to see her here several times.
He left me his card in case she ever needed anything.
This is it.
Here.
This is her brother's name: Kazuki Honjo.
Do you mind if I write down his number?
No, and now!
And would you mind giving me his phone number, too, Mr. Sawamura?
No.
(Cell phone)
Hello, Kudo.
(Shinichi voice) Yes, say, Hattori.
You hit the nail on the head, man.
The names of the victims you sent me
all match the guests
who were on the sixth floor of the hotel on the day of the fire.
But it turns out there were two more.
Nanako Honjo and Kosuke Mizutani.
Wow.
Did you already know that?
Let's see if you know this, too.
It turns out that at Mizutani this
has been doing the same research I'm doing for a year now.
"I would say that there is no doubt
"That the murderer you're looking for in your case
has something to do with the fire two years ago."
But I don't know how you can tie it all together.
Because let's say Mizutani was the murderer.
What motive would he have?
Nanako Honjo died by accident.
"Hattori..."
Do you know how many elevators there are in this hotel?
Elevators?
I'd say there's only one.
I look at it.
Do you know the capacity?
It holds a maximum of 7 people.
What's that got to do with it?
Ah... (elevator: overweight warning)
(Elevator: overweight warning)
Hey.
I'm going down.
I'm going down.
Good one.
Now I've understood.
Yes, it's very likely that on the day of the fire Nanako Honjo...
Do you think someone made her go down because there were already 7 of them?
Maybe the eighth was Mr. Jinn, the one with the single circle token.
And the other 6 inside are indicated with the other circles.
The circles painted in red on the mahjong pieces
indicate the position they occupied inside the elevator that day.
It is likely that the mahjong tiles are already in the shape of an elevator,
if you notice.
And the vertical line at the back
could symbolize the elevator door.
Yes, it's very clear to me.
In Jinn entered last and, as the overweight warning sounded,
it forced someone to get out and it was Nanako Honjo;
The other 6
"They were supposed to pretend it was nothing and didn't lift a finger to prevent it,
"Because they knew that if they helped her,

maybe I'd throw them out."
And since the Nanako Honjo could not go downstairs
and the ladder was locked, she couldn't save herself.
"What? It can be, all this I say, can't it?"
Yes, but what worries me....
is the meaning of the letters of the alphabet.
Yeah, and what doesn't fit me is that the seventh tile is not a letter,
but a triangle.
But if the seventh red circle was the Sumire Shindo,
I guess there won't be any more murders.
I hope not.
I have to find in Kosuke Mizutani any way I can.
Thank you very much as always, Hattori.
Really.
You're welcome.
Ah.
There's a place that makes great okonomiyaki pizzas?
I have to take you there one day.
Why don't you come see me?
Oh, uh... Yes.
You promise, right?
I'll wait for you.
Yes, of course I will.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Very well...
He promised me.
(Kogoro) What?
On July 7th two years ago?
(Kogoro) Really?
You were all at the hotel fire in Kyoto?
Yes, all the data tells us so.
Therefore...
The words they felt from that man: "Tanabata is today"...
They were probably referring to the motto of the Kyoto festival.
I will send more personnel to investigate what happened in Kyoto right now.
The problem is the message
the killer wants to leave us with the mahjong tiles.
Of the 7 circles on each tile,
the one at the bottom has not yet been marked in red.
Therefore, there is a possibility that there is still another victim.
Also, I doubt it is coincidence, that today is July 7.
So, he will kill again today?
But... who and where?
"The murderer may be one of those here."
Ah!
I've got it!
These 7 tokens indicate the shape of an animal, I see it very clearly.
-Exactly.
-The shape of an animal?
If we join all the points where the victims have been found with a line...
...this is what we see.
It's got a very long neck, a body like this, a chest like this,
and the back is thrown backwards.
So, it's not the Loch Ness Monster,
for us it's... the Loch Ashi monster!
Ashi?
-I had never heard of it.
-And does it exist, this monster?
I don't know what you're getting at, really.
If I do this, it becomes clearer?
Well, maybe now that you say that...
I do see it, the monster, yes.
But why does it have to be from Lake Ashi?
It could be from Lake Yamanaka.
Why don't we look at the shape of the lake?
The Yamanaka looks like a whale and the Ashi is more...
I see where you're going, Mouri.
You mean the next kill will be the tip of the nose, right?
Don't run so fast, Sango.
It's what it might look like, but it'll happen here.
It will.
In the eye.
It matches Annaka.
I know it very well, this city.
I have to go right now.
Who's coming with me?
-I'm coming too.
-I am.
-You're not going.
-But... but what are you doing?
Two people alone against a murderer is too little.
It's up to them.
What fun!
Yes, and this time Conan missed it.
And... don't you think he's been acting strange lately?
He went home alone today too.
He still hasn't fully recovered from his cold.
Not long ago he missed two days of school.
Ah, here he is.
Another beetle.
He must have come from Beika's park.
It must have climbed on this gentleman when he was walking in the park
and carried it here.
-It can't be.
-This one has a tag too.
But what does it take them, the people, to put this on them?
Poor things.
I can't, it's too attached, this one.
Well, we'll tell the doctor to remove it himself.
In the meantime, we'll give him something to eat.
Kazuki, today there was only one bouquet of flowers, but it didn't say who it was from.
Yes, I've seen it.
(Conan voice) Hello.
(Conan voice) Good morning.
So you're Detective Mouri's assistant?
Yes.
I'm looking for Kosuke Mizutani for an important case we're investigating.
But I see he didn't come to the ceremony.
No, he came early this morning,
brought some flowers and left right away.
Yes.
He only left flowers?
My parents haven't forgiven him for running away with my sister...
and that's why he doesn't stay long.
That's normal.
So the flowers that arrived without names are his?
I heard they said they were the only ones.

In the other years, more people had arrived?
Yes, he always sent us more people.
How many?
Do you know where they came from, the other branches?
Yes, of course.
Let's see.
Two years ago we received 4.
From Matsumoto, Kawasaki, Numazu and Kamakura.
Last year we received 3: from Tokorozawa, from Odawara and from Hachioji.
"From the cities where the victims were from."
In fact, when I saw in Kosuke, this morning,
he told me something very curious.
What did he tell you?
That there are 8 people he can't forgive,
he still has one left.
(Agasa) Oh... (Agasa) That's it.
This was made by the same person.
The label is in the shape of a V like the other one.
In fact, it could also be a message.
A message?
Yeah, see if you can figure out what it could be.
-Mmm...
-Mmm... -Mmm... I don't know.
The answer is "help" in English.
-Huh?
-Ah, yes?
How do you know?
Because beetle is "beetle" in English.
Like my yellow car,
and the name comes from the shape it has, which looks like a beetle.
And then there's the word "beat",
which comes from the beat of the music and sounds like a part of the word "beetle".
Which sounds a lot like the Beatles.
The Beatles?
An ensemble?
Yes, sir, and their first album was called "Please, please me",
the second was called "With the Beatles",
the third was called "A hard day's night",
the fourth, "Beatles for sale", and their fifth album called "Help".
-But what are the Beatles?
-You still haven't got it?
An early music group, I think.
Ah... How come you don't know the Beatles?!
-They sound familiar to me.
-I don't.
My older sister listened to them from time to time.
Because she liked old music.
Mu... old music?
And why doesn't she make us snacks and not so many riddles?
If I understood you correctly, you said that "Help" in English means "help me", right?
That's right.
Well, it's a case for the Junior Detective League!
-Huh?
-Yes.
I know what the clue "Tanabata is today" refers to.
That the seventh victim was at the hotel?
"One of the fire victims was a girl named Nanako Honjo."
"And her partner's name is Kosuke Mizutani,
who a year ago was inquiring about the fire at the hotel."
And today, in Heiji Hattori....
(Heiji Hattori) It is seen that he has also gone to ask the same questions.
(Heiji) Yes, exactly, I am interested in this case.
Yes, of course you are.
Can I tell you something interesting?
The drawing on the cards symbolizes the elevator.
The elevator?
Ah! (Heiji)
Oh...
"There were 9 guests, the night of the fire,
on the 6th floor of the hotel."
"Apart from the Nanako, who died that day, and Kosuke Mizutani,
there are 7 who have already died."
(Woman) Yes, I know!
"Who should it be, what's left?"
This is water to wash your hands, right?
Yes.
How nice that you know!
Yes, what happens is that I do not know how to do it with the ladle.
Well, I'll show you now.
Come on, let's go.
"Yes."
What's that?
The position of the stars?
"Somebody see if the seven murder sites indicate..."
the shape of the seven stars of the Chariot plus the North Star."
Yes, they match... if you get them right.
They fit perfectly, it looks like it was done expressly.
This is a very perfectionist person.
Yes, and I've also seen that all the mahjong tiles...
and the letters of the alphabet refer
to the North Star and the Big Dipper.
The one with a single circle is the Pole Star
and the other 7 make the shape of the constellation.
The alphabet is Greek
and indicates the name by which each star is known:
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta....
Y...?
Oh...
The last star is Merak's position.
I'll place it now.
I've got it.
Yes.
Near Shiba Park, in the Minato district.
(Mitsuhiko) I'm sure that the person asking for help
must be near those trees where we found the beetles.
-Let's go!
-Well, we have to go help her.
(Mitsuhiko) -Yes!
-The League in action!
If it's about the Nanako Honjo and Kosuke Mizutani,
a boy with glasses has already come and I've explained it all to him.
-Yes.
-Huh?
A boy with glasses?

He told me that he was Detective Mouri's assistant.
And he says that in Kosuke Mizutani has told him with these words:
"There are 8 people I can't forgive, and there is still one left"?
Yes.
Why is that?
What's the matter?
You have done nothing wrong, in Kosuke?
No, easy.
What is it?
This means that the killer intends to kill again, doesn't it?
(Shiratori) "Well, it's likely."
"And it seems that in Conan he has also passed this way."
Ah, yes, in Conan?
No, I would never have asked him to do something like that.
Believe me.
Then how can it be?
Unless he's been mistaken for Kudo...
So... the killer is in Kosuke Mizutani, right?
Yes, everything points in that direction.
Now we have to find out who the missing person is
and get to know where he intends to kill her.
Nanako...
Kosuke!
Again, bird, go.
Shall we go back?
Come on, man, it's our first trip together.
Kosuke!
Ha-ha-ha!
Nanako!
Nanako!
I must go!
The Nanako is in there!
Nanako!
Nanako!
(Agasa) Okay.
Okay, I'll look to see where they can be.
Good bye.
Mitsuhiko hasn't come home either?
No.
And it's already 7 o'clock. Where did they go, those 3?
They're not answering the pin transmitter either.
Ah!
Something.
And if it turns out that they have gone there?
(Mobile: standby tone)
Is this Mr. Sawamura?
(Man) "Hello?"
Yes.
(Man) "Hello?" Yes.
Something you two would be interested in?
Mm-hm.
Such as stargazing, or so.
Yeah, they told me they'd come to live here...
because there was the observatory nearby.
"I knew it."
I remember they were very fond of the North Star and the Big Dipper.
They always talked about the very unique shape of the Big Dipper
and the North Star and how it always points north.
Frankly, it seems to me that they thought....
that their relationship was very much shaped by the stars.
I don't know why I'm telling this to a child.
I don't think you understand.
"I don't think you understand."
"And the best place around here to look at the stars is..."
"We greet you from the Toht tower,
the focal point of the Tanabata festival celebrations."
"It's the last night of the festival
"And many people have come dressed in yukata.
"the traditional, lighter-weight summer costumes
and which are now a classic for this celebration."
"We take this opportunity to say that the weather that is expected for tonight and tomorrow,
throughout the Tokyo area, may be a little unstable."
"It may rain a little from 10 o'clock onwards."
Oh!
Excuse me!
Hello, handsome.
What do you want?
Yes, sure.
But what about your parents?
Can you hold this for me, please?
It's just that I went to the bathroom for a moment
and my father and my brother have gone and left me alone.
Can you keep it for me?
How beautiful!
It's a beautiful dress.
And so are you.
-One, no.
Many.
-Come on, let's take a picture all together.
-Yesssssss!
-Come on, let's go.
Haven't we already passed this way?
Maybe we made a mistake.
Ah... I'm hungry, why don't we go back home?
No, we have to find this person ourselves.
Hey, don't tell me you don't feel like solving...
at least one case without Conan.
I'm sure I am.
But there are no oak trees here.
I've got it!
Why don't we have this beetle lead the way?
Just think, beetles always go to the trees they like best.
That way.
(Genta) But should we run so much?
The investigations
have provided us with the name of the possible killer,
and we think it is very likely that he will kill again.
But we don't know where he is, or where he plans to kill, or even who.
If anyone has any ideas, please say so.
What a rage!
To think that right now maybe he's....
Maybe he's killing someone, yes, let's say it clearly.
Look!
We've already found the oak tree!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
There's another beetle.
We should see if this one also has the tag.
One... little more.
Go on!
It also has that label.
Yes, and so much.
I'm sure the person asking for help is found.
-You're right.
-I don't think it can be anywhere else.
But it's very strange, this house, isn't it?
-Don't tell them, these things! -Yes, maybe it's haunted.
-Yes, maybe it's haunted.
- (squeak)
- (branch: creaks)

(Kogoro) Ah... But how beautiful!
How you can see the stars from here!
There's the North Star.
And I can see the Big Dipper, too.
Yes.
Eh?
This shape... What does it remind me of, now?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What do you say?
The Big Dipper and the North Star?
But how, that the next murder?
will be done in the place where the Big Dipper and the North Star are indicated?
(Kogoro) "Yes! That I'm sure, inspector."
Ah, it's the police who came earlier.
Yes.
It has helped me a lot to know that Kosuke Mizutani and the Nankin Honjo
were fond of astronomy, thank you very much.
The place that matches the position of the missing star is Shiba Park.
is Shiba Park.
Very well.
Megure, have your men search Mizutani and you wait here.
The rest of us have to go to Shiba Park.
Hurry up.
Doctor!
-Did I scare you?
Did I?
-You scared us good. -You did.
And can you explain to me what you're doing, playing here alone at this hour?
-We're looking for someone.
-But who said we're playing?
The one who sent the messages asking for help.
So much so.
Everybody go home.
Her parents are worried.
It's not that late either.
We have time to go help that person and then come back, don't we?
Thank you, thank you very much.
Thank you for your visit.
-I'll get it.
- (cell phone)
-Yes, better.
Thank you, thank you.
You have it.
Yes?
You've reached Inspector Takagi.
Ah, doctor Agasa.
It's just that you can't get through right now.
I'm sorry to call you at a bad time, but please pass a message.
Well, it's a bit of a strange story.
What is it?
Some beetles?
What if it was...?
All right, we'll be right back.
But you... try to hide somewhere safe with the children.
-What?
But if not...
-Takagi, Beika's forest, run.
Don't suffer, I take full responsibility.
Me too... I'll take my responsibility.
Eh, but where are we going?
Eh?
I don't know.
I don't understand.
-Okay. -Okay.
-To the left!
What's that?
You've seen Conan on TV?
(Sonoko) "Yes, just now. It was in the Toht tower and I was alone."
(Sonoko) Okay.
"On the 8 o'clock news."
"He looked good, don't worry, I'm sure he'll be back soon."
Yeah, but... he's got his phone off.
Nothing, superintendent, there's no answer at Takagi or Sato.
All right, let them be.
Let's see, I'm sure Mizutani is hiding in this area.
We split up selected to cover more ground.
We have to find her.
Yes.
Eh?
You can't see it today because it's cloudy.
The North Star that you and Nanako liked.
And you can't see the Big Dipper either.
But you who...
-Saw him around here?
-Ah, yes, that boy...
Yes, he's asked me many times what time we closed,
that's why I remember.
The last time I saw him, the sun was rising in the observatory.
It was around 7 o'clock.
Ah, so, you're Detective Mouri's assistant?
Pretty much.
What a pity that he came all the way up here to look at the stars
and now, because of the clouds, you can't see them.
No, I can see them.
No matter what time it is,
I always see them.
What do you see?
At the observatory?
Yes, this girl told us she saw it.
-No, I didn't see her go out.
-And you're sure she hasn't left?
So, we know that right now...
the suspect is in the observatory tower.
And that maybe he's meeting the victim
and is about to commit the ultimate murder.
We need to go in immediately
and catch him before he takes him hostage and he can escape.
It is practically certain that he is armed, so take precautions.
And no one is to turn off or turn on the tower lights.
-Let's go.
-Okay. -Okay.
Mm?
Something, Mr. Mizutani...
You've planned to kill yourself when you finish your glass of wine, haven't you?
"There are 8 people I can't forgive, and there's still one left."
I know I'm not wrong.
The person left is you, isn't it?
Is that so?
What the...?
I can understand the bewilderment,
the pain and anger you must have felt
when you learned how Nanako died.
That's why you wanted to go back to the hotel
and find out exactly how it went, right?
Yes, you are absolutely right.
It was two years ago today.
If I hadn't gone to see my friend, Nanako would still be alive.

When I think about it, I can't forgive myself in any way.
But killing herself, what good will it do?
Killing herself won't bring her back.
I know it won't.
I know, it won't.
But I can't bear to live in this world without Nanako, I can't.
No, it's not true.
Besides, they will condemn me anyway.
They won't condemn you to anything, because no one has died.
All the people who know him well
know that he has a big heart, that he is a good person,
and that he is absolutely incapable of having murdered these people.
He feels responsible for Nanako's death, I know.
And I guess it's inevitable.
But I doubt that 7 people died.
The person who did it, always wanted you dead.
Eh?
So that you dared to tear
your dear sister from your side.
I'm talking about Nanako's brother,
Kazuki Honjo.
Ah!
Kazuki!
What are you doing here?
You know perfectly well that I don't want to talk to you.
Brat, how could you figure it out, all of it?
Because it didn't bind me... nothing at all.
I couldn't see how Kosuke Mizutani could be a murderer.
Nor did I understand how he had been able to plan the murders
using the shape of the Big Dipper,
because this was soiling the constellation they loved so much.
Therefore, I began to consider the possibility...
that someone had set the whole thing up
by taking advantage of Kosuke's devotion to astronomy
to make him look guilty.
And then I deduced that someone who was capable of calculating the coordinates
"To imitate the Big Dipper
had to be a very meticulous and very well organized person."
"And that didn't tie in with the sign on Kosuke's door,
which, apart from being crooked, was handwritten and in poor handwriting.
On the other hand, the phone number I saw written on Kazuki's card....
"It was written in neat handwriting."
"Even his address book is neat and polished,
"And he has written down all the names and addresses of the people
who had sent flowers to your sister."
And that means you really are a meticulous man, aren't you?
And you... may I know who you are?
Conan Edogawa, a detective.
Hello, good evening.
Dr. Agasa, where are the children?
I've taken them home to their parents.
-Yes, please.
-Come on, I'll take them. -You wait for me in the car, Ay.
You wait for me in the car, Ay.
It was you who called Kosuke
after his sister's death, wasn't it?
Yes, just when he told me that that artist,
Sumire Shindo, was also at that hotel the night of the fire,
"I went to see an exhibition of hers and ask her some questions."
Right there I overheard
a conversation she and Ryuzaki were having.
She ran to tell Kosuke about it, adding lies.
She told him that the flowers they had received
were from the seven people who were staying on the sixth floor on the day of the fire.
the day of the fire.
And that if it had been one or two,
it might have been an act of good faith,
but if they were all 7, it could only be interpreted
could only be interpreted as a feeling of guilt.
But it was not guilt, it was gratitude,
because the Nanako voluntarily got out of the elevator
because they could be saved.
He told me that she had been forced out.
At no time did he tell me that she had decided to do it.
Yes, she did... because she was a very good person,
but still...even if she did it voluntarily,
that doesn't change that the other 7 took advantage to save themselves!
Mr. Mizutani...
It is true that Nanako died that day
because the other 7 people were able to save their lives,
but it was... a voluntary sacrifice.
It has nothing to do with the sacrifice that you want to make.
to take the blame for everything and take your own life.
They are two things... as different
as a star shining in the sky and a dark stone on the ground.
Nanako...
-But what...?
-I won't do it.
I'm sorry, but I've decided I don't want to die.
This boy has opened my eyes.
Kosuke!
I'm sure that Nanako, from heaven,
because I'm sure she's in heaven, doesn't want me to commit suicide either.
It has, I turn this to you.
I, now, I don't need it at all.
Surrender, Kazuki.
Please, please.
Mr. Honjo, are those the items you stole from the 7 victims?
He gave them to Kosuke
because the police would link him to the 7 murdered people
taking advantage of the fact that he was already dead.

I'm glad I came, really.
When I saw that Detective Mouri was investigating the case, I thought things could still get complicated,
I thought things could still get complicated.
and I wanted to make sure that this time you did what you had to do.
Because to avenge my sister... we already know that you have not been unable to do it.
That's why I had to do it myself!
This was not the right thing to do, it was only to satisfy the rage and the...
You shut up!
I'm sure you also came alone.
I don't see detective Mouri anywhere.
Who do you think you are?
Aaaah!
(Man) We've arrived on time.
-From... the police?
-I'm Superintendent Matsumoto.
-No, no.
-Are you hurt, you?
You'll have to come to the police station.
"Gee, no!"
No!
I'm not going to get caught!
I thought as much.
You're the Irishman, aren't you?
Everybody freeze!
-Quiets!
Police!
-You knew?
-I knew it!
It's the superintendent.
-I don't get it.
-Please, hold on a little.
But what's he doing here, the superintendent?
The other Matsumoto is an impostor.
Someone is impersonating him.
He's from the Beatles era.
When they explained it to me, I thought it might be him.
-Yes.
-Calling Inspector Megure.
(Mobile)
(Mobile)
It's me.
What's the matter?
They've already found out who the impostor is.
That's it.
Understood.
"La Vermouth..."
Eh?
You've seen her here, you say?
Yes, she asked me to keep the scooter for her,
but she didn't come back for it and I didn't know what to do.
So, it could be that she was still...
No, that can't be.
If he hasn't left, too bad, because he'll meet the murderer.
What murderer?
What killer?
The police are looking for him all over the building.
And where are you going?
Ran!
Sonoko, wait here.
(Hey, girl!
Where are you going?
And where's Superintendent Matsumoto?
No, he's still alive.
He's dead?
I need him to take the blame for everything I've done.
This card is the one that contains
the names of the unofficial covers, right?
Yes, more or less.
When did you know it was me, the impostor?
I thought it as soon as I saw... that it wasn't Vermouth,
because she's an expert at impersonating someone else.
If she hadn't done it herself, it was because the person she had replaced
had a radically different complexion from hers.
And the superintendent was the most obvious choice.
A deduction worthy of your talent, Shinichi Kudo.
I wasn't quite sure
until I saw the fingerprints.
And have you informed your superiors yet?
No, not yet.
No one else knows at the moment.
No.
Not even Gin?
(Irish) "With Shinichi Kudo, I'll take you out! Don't you remember?"
(Gin) "You think I remember the names of everyone I kill, me?"
(Gin) "What about this one?"
Nothing, it's not important.
"You just concentrate on your mission, period."
Why?
Some time ago he killed a member of the organization
for making a simple mistake.
"And, moreover, he left his body right there to burn."
"It was at the Haido City Hotel."
And that man happened to be very dear to me,
as if he were my father.
"The fire at the Haido City Hotel."
In Pisco?
I see you've done your research too.
His mistake was not killing you
or be able to discover your true identity.
That's why I'll have to bring...
to our superiors.
Because you will serve me as a witness...
...to get rid of that incompetent Gin.
"At the moment he's the only one who knows my identity."
"Therefore, I just have to stun her."
"But I've already used the anesthetic dart."
"The only thing I have left..."
Don't suffer, I'm not going to kill you.
I just want to sleep for a while.
I have to keep you alive so I can prove to those upstairs
that you're Shinichi Kudo.
I guess you understand, don't you?
Chiba!
What happened here?
Chiba!
Chiba, what happened?
It seems to me that he's just unconscious,
just like everyone else.
Conan!
Ah!
Hey, you!
Freeze!
Hey, hey, hey!
Where are you going?
Conan!
Conan!
Did they hurt you?
Yes, they did.
Ran... You've come...
Guys, are you okay?
Superintendent!
Have you seen him?

The inspectors are all unconscious.
Yes.
It was the serial killer.
No, Ran.
Go away...
What?
But why?
Run away from here.
He's not...
(blow)
(Weapon: CLEC)
You're not... Superintendent Matsumoto.
You take it easy.
Watch out, Ran.
"If I were carrying a rifle, I wouldn't be able to dodge it,
but a small gun..."
"Ran, you know what?"
The bullet speed of a rifle is 1,000 meters per second.
But the velocity of a pistol's bullets
is only one third of this speed, 350 meters per second.
Of what rivers, now?
What do you think?
Will you be able to dodge my bullets, or what?
Interesting. Let's try it.
Of course I can.
That's strong!
Very good, girl.
What do you know, you're a karate master!?
I wouldn't have guessed it.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ah!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ran!
Aaaaah!
Aaaaaaah!
You're wasting my time.
"Ran! Don't get up!"
"Let me do it, you don't move."
Oysters.
Run, run!
I'll still have a better time.
-Mm?
- (thump)
No!
Too bad.
You almost made it.
What's the matter?
Don't you have anything else?
All right, keep running.
Do you plan to run much more?
The game has to end.
The tables have turned.
Oh, shit!
Come on, give me the memory card right now.
They're selling.
Who wins now?
Eh, boy?
(Mobile)
(Mobile)
It's me.
- (Mobile) "Yes."
-What?
How's it going?
Do you have the card?
I can't quite see.
Put it forward.
Yes, a little more.
Now.
-I wanted to shoot him.
-Diana!
-Look down.
-Gin?
Gin?
There's a lot of them.
They wouldn't have let him get away.
You did a good job... Irish.
(Irishman): Huh?
There's someone else.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
You've got to hang in there, you feel?
You haven't been touched... any vital organs.
If we can get you to a doctor, you'll be cured.
Yeah, right...
No wonder the Vermouth likes you...
Now don't talk.
Once you're cured, get ready,
because we'll get the name of your superiors out of you any way we can.
Irish!
Aaaah!
Shinichi Kudo,
don't ever stop chasing us.
Irish!
He's used Irish as a shield.
We can't leave any witnesses.
Go ahead.
All right.
No!
"No way, Ran is short."
I've got it.
Follow him.
What do we do now?
-Okay.
-Chianti, take him out.
No!
What do we do now?
Tear gas?
He's coming out.
Come on, now corner it upstairs.
We've already caught the mouse.
From above, shoot from above.
-Okay.
-So we won't have any blind spots.
"No! What now? I can't go any higher."
"Shit! What do I do?"
Now we'll see the face he makes.
But... he jumped!
He accepted that he couldn't escape.
Let's go!
- (alarm)
We have been touched!
-We have lost control.
-But may I know what's going on?
(alarm) -Okay.
-What are we going to do!
Retreat!
"But who...?"
"Who the hell is that?"
(Vermouth) Just as expected from our silver bullet.
(Vermouth) He's dangerous.
I don't know what happened, really.
I got hit in the head and fainted.
I'm glad there were no serious injuries.
I don't know what to say...
Let's see, Ran, maybe it's better...
to tell us everything that happened tomorrow, or when you're better.
Yes.
We'll have a car coming right away to escort you home, okay?
Yes, thank you very much.
Mm-hm.
Are you sure you're okay?
You know what? I'm gonna get you something to drink.
I'm gonna get you something to drink.
Yeah, if you don't mind.
No, that's not necessary.
Thank you. (chuckles)
Uh...
Ran...
It's all over now.
Do you want to know something?
Shinichi said that...
Ah... He's gone.
Where is Shinichi?
He's gone to solve another case.
He's gone to solve another case. What?
He can't be.
He's gone away again?
Yes, it's just that...
And I'm sure he told you not to tell us he was here...
or something like that.
Yes, that's true.
But he said you could call him.
What did he say?
That I could call him?
In fact, he said please call him.
Well, if I can hear his voice, I'm already happy.
Because... there are those who can't even talk...
and who only see each other once a year.

So the identity of the Irishman has not yet been discovered, eh?
I don't know what I'm betting that the police don't know anything either.
They wouldn't believe it either, this whole story.
When I think that he had the superintendent shut down
10 days in a place like this, I shudder.
It looks like the superintendent couldn't see him either,
when he kidnapped him.
Good thing the Junior Detective League found out where he was.
And so they did.
Because Irish died before he could tell where he'd left it.
"Irish..."
Shinichi Kudo, don't ever stop chasing us.
"Of course I won't stop."
(Shinichi and Conan) At least until I unmask them all.
