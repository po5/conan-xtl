I feel so all in Secret Life!
Father, please drive carefully.
Yes, next week you will be participating in the charity show
orphans who have lost their parents in accidents.
If you were to have an accident, Beniko Suo, the organizer,
who has chosen you as a special guest, would be called into question.
Yes.
I know that!
This today is also an express invitation from her at a party!
If I had an accident, I would be left without eating such a fantastic meal!
Kogoro, Miss Beniko is a famous former singer, isn't she?
Yes, she used to be called "The Canary of the East".
and she was a very important star.
This season she is very busy
running an artistic production company called "Producciones Escarlata" (Scarlet Productions)
and she is no longer seen on stage.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Casum dena!
This is dangerous!
What's this tree doing in the middle of the road?
Look, there's something stuck to it!
What's this?
"Don't collaborate in the Beniko Suo's charity show.
You will regret it.
The messenger of the cursed mask."
What does this mean?
(Think) The messenger of the cursed mask?
The haunted masks laugh coldly, part one.
Gee, hats off!
It's an amazing mansion!
Eh?
This gentleman here... Is photographer Masanori Katagiri!
He travels continuously around the world
photographing landscapes of breathtaking beauty.
Oh!
The player Mamoru Matsudaira, the home run king!
And you are that famous detective?
Yes.
Are you Mr. Kogoro Mouri?
Yes!
You're also guests of the charity show?
Yes!
Oooh!
What a hottie!
It's Haruka Nagara!
That famous tarot fortune teller on TV?
I see she knows a lot of things.
I always wear gloves of the same color as the lucky color of the day.
(Think) And thanks to this, you're the Home Run King?
This place... Can we help you?
In this mansion I feel a sinister presence.
I have a presentiment that announces a serious misfortune.
Don't talk like that, it's bad luck.
This is no place to talk straight, is it all right if we go inside?
Yes, that's a good idea.
But this mansion... where can you enter?
There are two entrance doors.
Welcome, we thank you for coming.
Ah, wow, the entrance is that way.
Eh?
Welcome, we thank you for coming.
Uh?
One... one moment.
Mr. Mouri and escorts,
please go through the east entrance door.
East entrance? Eh?
Mr. Katagiri, Mr. Matsudaira and Miss Nagara,
please go through the western entrance.
Why are we entering through different doors?
The mansion is divided into two wings.
Those staying in the western wing enter through this entrance.
And the guests who settle in the chambers of the eastern wing
must enter through the eastern entrance.
It is a tradition.
(Thinking) What a strange place....
If we do not keep the traditions of this mansion...
we can cause serious misfortune.
Cause misfortune?
Where do they get this from?
Because this is...
Because this is...
(At the same time) The mansion where the haunted masks dwell.
The masks... haunted?
Ah, a mask!
There's one here too.
Mrs. Suo has a penchant for collecting masks.
Come in, follow me.
This time it's the mask of a cat.
I'll take your luggage now.
Wait a few moments in the Mask Room.

The Hall of Masks ?
It is this camera that you can see.
-Ah... -Eh?
Mr. Mouri?
Why, this chamber joins the east wing and the west wing of this mansion.
Blow!
How cool!
It's full of masks!
Oh... Extraordinary!
What's this?
A remote?
Eh?
What's the matter?
What's the meaning of this?!
(Think) What the hell are these, these masks?!
Why are there so many?
What are they, these masks?
(Woman) "The Masks of Jofre".
(Woman) Ah!
You... you are Mrs. Beniko Suo?
I welcome you most cordially.
What do you think, the pleasure of my precious collection?
Ah... I wouldn't know what to say...
The masks of Jofre are the ones that crowd the walls?
Yes, the 200 masks that a Spanish sculptor, Jofre Gonzalez,
made a few weeks before he died.
Also called "the cursed masks".
The cursed masks ?
What is so cursed about these masks?
Jofre Gonzalez was a sculptor with a tragic life.
He had a sublime talent,
but his brother, jealous of him, set a trap for him
and snatched his position, his honor, and his fortune.
In Jofre fell into an absolute contempt for the human being,
and created these 200 masks as if something had possessed her.
After finishing them, she took her own life.
Everything was full of masks,
as if her blood had been ingested.
Jofre's honor was restored
and the masks passed through many hands.
In many cases, their holders met with an unfortunate end.
The director of a bank in England, the day after obtaining a mask, fell while on horseback and died,
fell while on horseback and died.
A merchant of precious stones, in a robbery, lost his life.
After this, they called them
"The cursed masks that suck the vital fluid from their owners".
And you think that having all 200 of them is wise, madam ?!
Not to worry.
An excellent master exorcist counteracted the curse in them.
(Thinking) The conversation is heading towards the occult...
Instead of curses,
you should fear the evil intentions of people in the real world.
Why do you say so, this?
We found a tree fallen in the middle of the road
and there was this paper stuck to it.
I also received a letter like this, 3 days ago!
-They sent me one too! -To me too.
How do they say?
(Think) It wasn't a bad joke....
They sent you a strange letter.
Toya, you're late.
You caught me in the middle of a tour.
You'll excuse me, won't you?
Who is it, this guy? Don't you recognize him?
He's the most popular rock singer in Toya Aigawa.
A strange letter?
There's no return address and the handwriting isn't normal either.
They've written it with stiff strokes to disguise their own handwriting.
-May I open it, ma'am? -Yes, please do, please.
To see....
"Tonight, the cursed masks will engulf your vital fluid.
The messenger of the cursed masks."
We'd better get it to the police.
No need to worry.
Ever since I started preparing for the benefit show
these kinds of intimidating letters have been coming in all the time.
(Kogoro) That's nothing!
This stew is a masterpiece!
And this wine is also fabulous.
It's top notch!
Dear guests, I'm glad that you wanted to take part in the benefit show
the benefit show as special guests.
Thank you very much.
Mrs. Suo, may I ask you a question?
Please tell me.
What prompted you to help children orphaned by traffic accidents?
I started sponsoring charity events 15 years ago.
5 years earlier, a woman who was quite close to me
caused an accident and ran away.
-Was it running away? -Yes.
Since then, I can't remain indifferent to accidents.
There are people who do this kind of thing to advertise themselves,
but that's not what we're looking for.
Excuse me.
What did you do with that person close to you afterwards?
She committed suicide.
-That person was my mother. Your mother?!
My father also had an untimely death,
and I ended up placed with relatives.
But in spite of the rejection with which I was treated,

Mrs. Suo helped me a lot.
What I am now, I owe it to her.
Of course, because Toya's mother was the most important friend I had.
To Scarlet productions,
there are many people who have lost family in accidents.
Mrs. Suo works to ensure the support of orphans.
Ooooh!
It's a touching story!
I will do my best to help you!
Me too.
My wife also died in a traffic accident 20 years ago.
From heaven, she must now be glad that I am participating in this show.
Mr. Mouri, I would like to ask you to do some research.
Already.
You want me to stop the author of those letters.
-No! -Ah!
Aaah!
I want you to investigate
who caused the death of Katagiri's wife in that accident.
Mr. Katagiri's?
Why do you want to know?
Some things keep me awake at night.
Two million in fees.
Two thousand?
I'll gladly accept!
-You defend yourself well, home run king! -It's a job.
Conan, you play very well.
This year there will be an opportunity to do some new projects.
Yes?
A new project?
Cheer up!
Do you want to debut as a singer from our company?!
You are a famous detective!
Your songs will become bestsellers!
Then, I'll sing you a song.
(Maids) Sorry to interrupt you.
Gentlemen, when it's 12 o'clock at night...
...we have to lock the mask room.
And there is no passage between the east wing and the west wing.
Please retire to your rooms before noon.
No way.
What a closing time!
12 o'clock is too early!
Why do they have to lock up?
Jofre's masks get into mischief,
and after midnight they go out to play.
That's why we have to lock up.
But this is absurd.
We tell the truth.
The next day we found the masks tilted in an unnatural way.
And we have also found them falling to the ground.
(At the same time) Therefore we beg you to go to your rooms.
(Think) The occultism of this story is never exhausted?
(Chimes)
(Snoring)
(Think) Come on, enough.
With this snoring I can not sleep!
(Phone)
(Kogoro) aaaaaaaaaaaaa!
The telephone!
(Laughter) Who is it, you?!
(voice distorted) The messenger of the damned masks.
The messenger of the cursed masks?
Give it to me!
Hey, you!
(Voice) The cursed masks are nourishing with blood.
-Who is it, the victim of the ritual? -As you say?!
(Voice) If you do not hurry you'll be late.
It's smoke from us!
It's locked!
Wake up Miss Honami and ask her to bring the key!
(Think) "The room is locked.
And the call came from the internal line."
Father!
-Miss Honami, the key!
-Yes, sir!
What happened?
The masks are gone!
What the heck does it mean, this?!
Aaaah!
(rumbling)
What was that? Looks like it's coming from upstairs.
From Mrs. Suo's bedroom?!
I'll be right there!
This way won't go!
You have to go through the staircase in the west wing.
It is also closed!
I'll wake up Minaho and tell her to open it!
Hey, what is it, this clatter?
What is it?
The masks of Jofre!
May I know what's going on?!
Mrs. Suo!
Mrs. Suo!
Coi, it's locked!
Break the glass!
-Mr. Mouri, what are you trying to do?! - Has anything happened to the lady?
Aaah!
Speak up!
What happened to her?!
She seems to be badly wounded.
She has a hemorrhage!
Jofre's masks are scattered around the room!
Jofre's masks?!
Is there another entrance?
Ah!
Here is a door!
It's impossible.
It's been locked for years.
I'll go in up here and see how it is!
Yes, we can't choose.
Father!
You got it! Thank you, Father.
I trust you! Yes!
(Think) The door is locked from the inside, by two points!
Check Mrs. Suo's condition!
Yes!
How is she?!
It's useless, she's already dead.
How do you say?!
She's dead?!
Teacher!
-Teachers! -You can't go in!

Stay here!
This is impossible!
The door was locked from the inside?
Mr. Mouri!
You mean it's a murder?!
He's been stabbed through the throat!
(Kogoro) Yes, from the state of the body, we can't think of a suicide!
"Our curse has been consummated in this place."
What is this?!
The statement of the crime.
It's from the messenger of the cursed masks!
-The curse! -The curse of the masks!
(At once) The lady has been killed by the curse!
(He thinks) "That the curse of the masks has killed her?
"This is ridiculous!
"But the room was tightly locked.
How did he, the murderer, kill Madam Suo?"
