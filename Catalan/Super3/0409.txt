Stars have a certain appeal.
Whether they are guilty or actors.
They kidnap a heroine from the stage.
The show is almost over.
Show up, Detective League!
He looks like a child but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

(Mitsuhiko) Police!
Hey!
Surrender and don't resist!
Quiet where are you!
Wait just a moment.
Damn thief, surrender to the authorities!
(Genta) Excuse me, please!
Thank you, police.
Thank you. (Genta)
(Genta) All right!
Up here!
All do very well!
-Especially Conan!
-You mean it?
Oh!
Thank you so much!
-Oh!
-I'm glad!
W-wait a minute, girls.
Something, Tamanosuke.
Do you really want to do it with amateurs like us?
You can get up on your feet now.
It'll be a very special performance,
it won't be the main performance.
The problem won't be you.
-Why are you sitting on your hands?
-Yesterday I won.
Just because I'm not on stage now doesn't mean I don't have to rehearse.
Forgive us, Tamanosuke.
(Tamanosuke) Renge!
Now don't get me to open the script!
How long have we been rehearsing?
(Tamanosuke) Sorry...
Don't apologize out of habit!
If you don't have enough faith in your acting, stop being an actress!
I'm sorry... Yes, I can do it!
How scary, you look like a different person.
No, Genta, that's what you call a real director.
It's admirable.
By the way, don't you think the Renge looks a bit like the Ran?
Come on, let's start rehearsing!
"In Tamanosuke Ito."
"The young director of an excellent touring theatrical company...
"had returned to our town to give a performance."
A KIDNAPPING AND A THEATER PERFORMANCE AT THE SAME TIME, (PART 1)
(Sonoko) Ran!
Run, hurry up!
Tamanosuke's rehearsals will be over!
I can't come, I have to make lunch for the father.
Let it go, girl!
He's had so much to drink that he sleeps the midday monkey.
Wait, Sonoko!
(Kogoro) Aaaatxum!
Aaaa... Did I catch a cold?
Or maybe... Ah, is that why?
Do you feel like making an ugly thing to your maniac of deductions?
Come to think of it, Tamanosuke has... a certain withdrawal.
"To Shinichi, of course..."
You mean, Sonoko?
It doesn't look like it to me.
Ah, the performance is from "The Bamboo Cutter", right?,
Princess Radiant Night's play.
Yes!
In Tamanosuke will play the emperor,
the love of Princess Radiant Night.
Ah!
I would like so much, it was Princess Radiant Night!
Sonoko, what a fool you are.
Who is it?
What an expensive car, isn't it?
-Yes.
-Segueixi'm, chairman.
Ah!
Man, who have believed ?!
Ill-mannered!
No!
Not like that!
Oh!
It can't be!
Renge, I've come for you.
You're coming back with us!
I'm not coming!
I want to stay here!
(Man) Renge!
(Man) -Yes, sir.
-Onuki!
-I don't want to!
-Come on, let's go, Miss.
-Miss, please!
-Let me go!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's the meaning of this?
This girl is the one who plays Princess Radiant Night.
Wait a minute!
What do you want?
Who are you two?
My name is Hanshiro Kataoka.
I'm the father of Renge Kataoka.
-... Kataoka?
-Hanshiro...
(Thinking) "I could swear he's..."
He's the president and founder of the Kataoka Business Group.
What's that?
So, you mean...?
-That's so cool!
-That she's a good girl.
Hey, Renge, can you tell us why you didn't tell us?
It's just... that's not your business!
The fact that I want to act has nothing to do with what my family is like!
Yes, but...
-Are you going to run away from home?

-Challenge..., don't tell me that...
It's been 6 months since I've heard from you.
All this time, I've had the Onuki looking you up and down.
What a surprise.
We came from a similar situation.
The parents weren't surprised that we make a living this way.
-That's true.
But it hasn't been right, making him suffer like this.
-Yes!
-Onuki.
Aw, come on, miss.
I don't want to!
I won't come!
I'll never come home again!
-Onuki!
-Miss!
Yes.
Forgive us for inconveniencing you.
Or please accept this compensation
for any prejudices you may have had.
We want nothing.
And we have no right to accept it either.
Ta-Tamanosuke!
Renge!
Go back home.
Right now!
Renge!
Go back home, fix things up and then you can come.
Wait, what are you saying?
We don't have time to change actresses before the premiere.
-That's true, we have a hard time.
-The premiere is 3 days away.
But we can't leave things this way either.
No, we can't!
You're right, you're right.
Come on, go, Renge!
-Miss Renge.
-Wait! -Wait!
Tamanosuke, listen to me, please!
I...
Ah!
Ran, can you come over here for a moment?
Eh?
Yes.
Someone get the costumes and props for Radiant Night!
"Hey, don't tell me that...?"
No way!
You want Ran to play the role of the Renge?
Oh!
What are you thinking?
We can't continue rehearsing if we don't have a Radiant Night.
But we've got to get ready for opening day.
And you will rehearse until then?
-That's right.
-We have no choice.
Come on, let's start the rehearsal!
Miss... Miss!
- (boy) You mean Tamanouke?
- What a cold thing.
(Boy) You're right.
You're wrong.
He's acted this way because he knows the Renge will return.
(Girl) Exactly.
It is very clear.
-She's really pretty!
How beautiful she is, Ran!
-I agree!
-I wish she'd come out to the play, too!
"Come on."
- (all) Eh?
-But this could be terrible.
See.
(all) What?
(all) Ah!
A love scene!
-Will they do it on Tamanosuke and Ran?
-Don't tell me that this...?
What danger, what danger!
It's a lucky thing.
A deduction maniac I know can't see, this....
"I've already seen it."
Changing the subject, why didn't you choose me?
(All) Uiiiiiiii....
"But the Renge... not to come back."
"And in a jiffy we had the premiere on top of it."
(Boy) 3 hours left.
After all we've done,
we can't stay without raising the curtain.
-And raise it without a leading lady?
-Tamanosuke.
-What shall we do? -What shall we do?
I'll go look for her.
-To look for the Renge?
-L'anirà look for?
But her father is a difficult man.
And also... she might have changed her mind.
Impossible.
Because then, this play...
We will suspend the premiere!
Have you ever seen a performance of "The Bamboo Cutter"...
without a Radiant Night princess?
- (boy) Tamanosuke!
-I'd have left.
Wait, Tamanosuke!
I must say something very important at the Renge, as your substitute.
Hurry, Mr. Taxi Driver!
(Takagi: lazy) Conan!
Xxxt!
What a surprise, Takagi!
You guys?!
May I know what you've come here to do?
But, Father...!
I'm sorry, Father.
Takagi...
As I didn't know if the culprit was watching us,
I had to let it pass.
"The culprit?"
Is it you?
What did you come here for?
Well, it's quite clear!
What about her?
Where is she, the Renge?
I... I thought the Renge was back with you, but...
We haven't heard anything since last night.
She said she was going out to go shopping.
Father: what does that mean?
As you say, sir?
(Kogoro) Do not meddle where you are not asked!
Conan, what are you doing?
Hey... be quiet!
"Ransom: 150 million yen."
La Renge!
"Imai Electronics... Kato Network and Nakao Media..."
"Payment should be divided among the 3 companies."
"You have until 2:00 p.m. to prepare the sum."
"Have your secretary take you alone...
"In the Yoshioka district parking lot."
But a ransom is... It can't be!
A kidnapping.
So about an hour and a half ago,
she received this e-mail asking for the ransom.

Do you know who he is, the sender?
Yes.
This is completely frustrating.
It's a procedure that is also used by international crime
and it's a global problem.
Mr. Kataoka,
why are you demanding that the amount be divided among these companies?
Onuki.
Yes, sir...
I guess it's because we have business dealings with all 3.
Wow.
But what are they asking for, these 3 companies, let's see?
Well...
You can explain it to them.
Yes.
Very well, gentlemen.
The presidents of these 3 companies had asked...
Miss Renge's hand in marriage.
My-te them!
Where is there an identical situation?
It is...
Exactly, Snow White!
Father, but what are you saying?
You mean Princess Radiant Night!
Yes, this story also applies.
"They're not even close, man!"
"Anyway, what's this? There's something that doesn't fit."
Excuse me.
See it!
It's already too late, because tell me your stories!
What's wrong?
It so happens that one of the suitors who had asked for the Renge's hand
can't come up with the ransom money.
It's ridiculous!
This would only bring us trouble and cause a scandal.
I will not put my daughter's life
and the company's reputation in the balance!
Very well, but it is essential that I have the ransom.
I've had it ready for a while now
and I will deliver it as if it came from these 3 companies.
But I will not give them my daughter!
Therefore, he has been left out of the competition to marry her.
This, more and more...
Forgive me, sisplaaau!
Princess Radiant Night!
Snow White.
Yes, this one!
Listen, Inspector Megre:
regarding the other 2, they have already sent the specified sum.
When the time comes, I'll go to deliver the ransom.
To begin with, we are not in a position to refuse their demands.
We can only watch as the kidnapper comes out on the scene.
We will make it our priority to get her out safe and sound
and we will investigate where she may be being held.
"This is... There has been a moment that has cut the image."
"Most likely, to get the backlight,
"The kidnapper stopped the camera and closed the curtain."
"No, wait... what about this?"
"Something's stuck to it."
"Isn't that spider web stuck to it?"
"No, it wouldn't make any sense, in the position it's in."
This place...
I think I've seen it before.
You brat!
How many times do I have to repeat it to you, so that you understand it?!
Father!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
What are you doing?
"Coi, I almost had it."
"Now we can't move from here."
You've kidnapped her?!
The Renge?!
Ayumi, how are things going, at the theater?
Everyone is very nervous.
It's only an hour before the curtain rises.
What can we do, Conan?
(Girl: call)
-Sonoko?
-Get-me-out!
Get-me-her-out!
You're silly.
This is what you get for getting into strange places.
You could take it out yourself, the spider web.
But you know I hate spiders!
I hate them!
"Eh? You say you can't..., you can't take it off?"
"Sure! I get it!"
(Tamanosuke) That he faked the kidnapping?
And why should she have done it?
The Renge?
Maybe she had enough, with the story of the suitors.
What do you mean?
I don't quite understand,
but that she demanded money from those who had asked for her hand, surely...
She wanted her father to understand how she felt
comparing herself to Princess Radiant Night, right?
Yes!
I'm sure you're right, Ran!
But that doesn't justify doing something like that!
Hey, boy!
The place where the Renge is located is a warehouse, right?
Surely that's where it is!
Hm.
Yeah, it sure is.
Ah, wait.
Let's go, let's go!
Tamanosuke!
This place was left to the company
to store the costumes and props.
I'm sure the Renge also has the key.
Surely it must be here.
Shouldn't we tell the father and the police?
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Renge!
Renge, answer!
"I knew it."
Look!
Renge!
"At this moment..., the farce had ceased to be a farce."
"Finally, the real Renge had been hijacked."
"And I was under the impression that the culprit was...

"It was the person who had helped him in the fake kidnapping!"
I'm going to turn him in.
(He thinks) "Eh? And the Ran and the others? Where did they go?"
Very well!
(Man) Inspector, he's coming out.
"The kidnapping is still going on."
"And the curtain... it's gone up too."
(Girl) A long time ago, there was an old man who cut bamboo.
"Ran."
Let me do it.
Ran.
(Horns)
He screwed us!
But...
He won't escape!
We promise we'll find the Renge!
(Ayumi) "Conan, I've found it!"
(Think) "Renge, Tamanosuke, come back soon!"
And the next Conan:
"A kidnapping and a theater performance at the same time, (2nd part)".
