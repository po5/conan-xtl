This plan takes into account all contingencies.
We have prepared everything to make it look like an unfortunate accident.
I let you know that I have had the poison ready for days.
We will soon know if their blood is as red as ours.
Luckily next Sunday the museum will be closed.
Apart from us there will be no one else on staff.
That's perfect.
The sooner we do it, the better.
Seikanji, you must hurry...
because the deadline is approaching
to return that loan you borrowed, isn't it?
What do you say?
While you're on the subject,
they found out that the manager was taking money from the cashier's box
and at the end of the month they will take it out.
This from a manager
who bought volatile shares and lost the money.
So I am the only one
who is in no hurry to finish this matter.
Yeah, and what else?
As his ex-lover,
I'm sure you're worried that he might cut you out of his will.
and then leave you with nothing.
Come on, it's no use us fighting with each other.
We have only one common goal to accomplish,
and that is to get him to die in Jisaburo Izumi.
That is why we have gathered here today.
I would like to confirm it again, Moyon.
If we finally manage to kill in Jisaburo,
I propose that we split
half of your inheritance between the three of us.
Whoever manages to kill him will get 80% of it
and the other two 10% each to keep their mouths shut.
I have the feeling that I am the only one who loses out of all 3,
but I have no alternative.
Because if I try it alone and it goes wrong, I will lose everything.
On the other hand, if we try it all 3 together,
we have a better chance of succeeding.
Okay, so, it is agreed...
that we will implement the plan on Sunday.
"To find the perfect solution,
you have to crack all the mysteries and codes."
"A dangerous conversation in the museum of noh masks."
"What secrets are hidden behind the 3 masks?"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"Demons dance in the mansion of noh masks (part one)."
Oops, looks like the museum is closed.
It's true.
Never mind, it's an emergency.
(Woman) "Yes?"
I need to see the director, please.
"The museum is closed."
"I'm very sorry, the director is not receiving visitors today."
"You can call him tomorrow and make an appointment."
Excuse me.
Soc at Naruya Akaza, I had made an appointment with Mr. Izumi.
Aaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ah!
You must be Mrs. Mibu, right?
I haven't seen you for a long time.
Just a moment, please.
I'll open the door for you.
Hey!
What are you doing?
You can't come in!
I'm sorry, but as I told you, today is our day off.
It's all right, don't bother.
I've come to see the director for an emergency.
-The director?
-An emergency?
It turns out I just received a rather disturbing letter.
It says here that Mr. Jisaburo Izumi is... in danger.
Mm?
"Mr. Jisaburo Izumi's life is in danger.
The criminal is likely to carry out his plan very soon.
I would like you to take care of the case personally."
Why, there is no return address on the letter.
What should we do, Father?
This man named Izumi is very rich, isn't he?
If he manages to keep her from being murdered, maybe...
What?
Come on, come on, Ran!
If I stay out of it, it'll damage my reputation as a great detective!
Hey, but we don't even know if the letter is genuine or not.
I just feel like going to see the masks noh.
Eh?
So I've decided to come here to investigate this matter.
But who are you?

Oh, excuse me, here's my card.
Wow, is it really the famous detective,
Sleeping Kogoro himself?
Yes, I guess people know me by this name.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Look, Mr. Izumi and I have known each other for a long time.
How come you bring your children to investigate a murder threat?
Well, the creature wanted to get a closer look at the Noh masks.
I get it.
Your daughter has very refined taste.
Eh?
Ah... Thank you.
Who must have chatted more than usual?
We were just missing a famous detective today.
I guess we'd better postpone the plan.
Where's the director now?
At this hour he's always going to worship the household god.
That's why Mr. Akaza is taking them there.
Well... we can't postpone the plan anymore.
What's that?
Did you set a trap for him there?
We're not doing well.
Excuse me, can you tell me who is a household god?
In the old days every house
honored the ancestors at the north end of the estate.
Ah... So Mr. Izumi is a religious person...
Well, there are many people who are upset with him.
That's why he asks for protection from the gods.
Ah!
Here we are.
Hello, how are you, Mr. Izumi?
Mr. Akaza.
You've arrived just in time.
Hey, uh... And who are you, may I ask?
(Izumi) I'm used to threatening letters.
I'm not impressed.
Someone took the trouble to send it to my office.
I don't think it's a simple threat.
Out of the way!
We're on our way!
If these guys hadn't been here,
I would surely have been crushed to death by those logs.
Hurry, bring me another wheelchair!
Yes, sure, right away!
-Eh?
-No, not you.
-Yes, right away, Mr. Izumi!
-What are you waiting for?
Damn!
What luck he's had, the old geezer.
I can't trust anyone lately.
But I think I can trust you, my boy.
Because you saved my life.
And you too, young lady.
It can happen to anyone.
But you should be on your guard
and take some precautions just in case, don't you think?
You're absolutely right.
What... precautions would they be?
For example, what are those things there?
They are a "ju" and an "odoshi".
The "ju" is a braided rope similar to a belt.
And the "odoshi" is a part of the armor.
They must be very sturdy pieces, right?
Where do you want to go?
Oh!
A bee?
It's huge.
Oh!
It'll kill me!
-It's a wasp... butcher wasp.
-Don't exaggerate.
I was stung by one a long time ago and it was very serious!
"Oysters! I could die of anaphylactic shock!"
Oh!
Caram.
What?
There's another one!
Iaaah!
Bite me!
Has, has, has, has, has, has, has and has!
"Hey, that's my jacket."
How do you like my valuable collection, Mr. Sleeping Kogoro?
Gee, the masks are really splendid.
Do you find it suits me?
To add to the atmosphere,
all the museum staff usually wear noh masks.
This one is called "Kuwaemen".
Just bite it here and hold it with your mouth.
But, of course, when you open it, you can't talk.
You're right, it's a good way...
to maintain the quiet atmosphere of the noh to the museum.
The masks were created by a friend of mine named Kodo Matsumoto.
He got married and remarried a few times.
And I finally ended up taking care of him until the day he died.
You've always had a good eye for talented artists.
And in return he entrusted me
the exhibition of all his work after he died.
The accident of the trunks and the giant wasp...
What the letter said was true, wasn't it?
(Izumi) The museum used to be a mansion.
In fact, my grandfather had it built.
The only thing that remains now
is this typical Japanese fireplace in the center of the building.
This place is called "yokoza", and it's where the owner of the house used to sit.
Boy, did you know this?
What?
He what?
"It's raw!"
In the old days, by the light of the fireplace, people would tell each other stories.
In the firelight, the mask looks very white.
In Japanese it is called "omo-Shiroi",
which means "amusing or interesting".
Ah!
It is very interesting!
Up here, in the lattice,

some clemàstecs that were used to hang the pots were glued.
But since we don't use them anymore, we keep them in storage.
"The wooden fish of the clemàstecs
was considered a magical object to prevent fires."
"Oysters! Again!"
Coi of chestnut, it has gone to stop at the worst time!
It seems that all 3 of us have screwed up.
We thought... something else!
(Kogoro) Ooooh!
(Kogoro) Ooooh!
Is this our lunch?
As a thank you for saving my life,
I've had a caterer come over.
(Kogoro) Thank you very much.
I'm delighted to accept!
It wasn't meant for you in the first place.
It's the boys who saved my life!
He-he-he-he-he...
I have brought a small gift for you.
It's a washed rind cheese from Burgundy.
You've just returned from France, haven't you?
Then we'll open a bottle of wine.
How nice!
Ah!
The stench that this cheese makes is so intense
that they call it "the stink of God's feet".
But when you put it in your mouth, it tastes like creamy milk.
The way to eat it is to take it in spoonfuls.
Seikanji, Nagata, come and taste this delicious treat.
No, thank you very much.
Or would you prefer to confess that you are to blame for the 3 incidents
that took place a while ago?
-All right, if you insist so much...
-Eh?
What are you saying now?
Au, come, come.
Sit wherever you like.
If you eat with us, I'm sure he hasn't poisoned the food.
Hatsuho, would you be so kind as to try it?
I'll try it.
It's delicious!
I have no doubt about it.
So, Mr. Akaza, which of these two wines would suit you best?
You should try it first to find out.
Well, go ahead and have some.
Thank you, Mr. Akaza.
Excuse me.
Mm!
Yes, the taste has a deep... Ah!
I know this smell.
In this man have poisoned him.
"It is not possible. Who has done it and how?"
Nobody move from here.
Hey, you, where do you think you're going?
What do you think you're going?
I'm going...
I'm... call the police.
I'll take care of that.
You guys stay put for now.
Yes.
Ran!
Don't touch the cheese!
Father, I can't.
There seems to be no reception.
There's a phone in the kitchen.
I'll call the police.
Ask for Inspector Megure and tell him to call for me.
Understood.
Hello?
Police?
One of our visitors has died of unnatural causes.
Could you come right away?
No matter how much the police hurry, it'll take at least 20 minutes.
Will I have to stay all dirty and sticky until they arrive?
No, of course you won't.
-Yes.
-You're called Toba, aren't you?
Could Mr. Izumi clean up and leave the rest as it is?
Right away.
(Mibu) They said they'll come right away.
"The Moyon Mibu can't have put the poison in, it's out of the question."
"Mr. Seikanji and Mr. Nagata
have never gone near the cheese either."
"Miss Toba has tasted it and therefore....
at that time the cheese would not yet have been poison."
"They put it on afterwards."
"No, no one has had time to poison it."
"Then... maybe the poison wasn't the cheese,
but the butter knife."
Miss Toba, where was this butter knife?
Eh?
Every saucer of bread had one.
"Without knowing where everyone would sit,
it's impossible for the killer to have placed it for anyone in particular."
Uh... Yes.
Hey, man, we switched rooms!
This food is much safer.
Don't you agree, Mr. Mouri?
I completely agree!
Please be patient until the police arrive.
Eh?
Ran?
Where did the kid go?
I don't know.
Gee, I thought it was here.
I'm going to make Mr. Izumi some coffee.
-Thank you for your kindness.
-I'll see if I can find the child in passing.
"The call you made to the police seemed very strange to me."
"Eh?"
"But it's an internal phone!"
Hey, kid.
Are you there?
Kid?
Child!
"This woman..."
"This is...!"
Aaaah!
A mouse, a mouse!
How disgusting!
Oh, that I made you spill your coffee?
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me, Mr. Izumi is asking if the coffee is ready.
If you want, I can help!
I'll take it to him now!
No need, thank you!
"This time he didn't have time to put the poison in."

So, you think the killer had a motive to kill Mr. Azaka?
He always flattered me with a lot of enthusiasm,
but it seems he had shady business dealings.
Sorry if I kept you waiting.
I'm not ready to die like the Akaza yet, okay?
Please don't joke about it.
There's no need for me to suffer.
No one would be foolish enough to poison someone...
knowing that the police are already on the verge of arriving.
That's right, I hadn't thought of that.
Hey, Conan, that's... an internal phone over there, isn't it?
Wow.
The father is convinced that the police are about to arrive.
We'd better find a phone.
Look, here's one!
Do you have a problem, miss?
If you don't mind, I have to call the police right away.
A few minutes ago Miss Mibu already called them.
No, she didn't.
She just pretended to call them.
Oh, really...?
Ran, run away!
And you don't move either, kiddo.
(Kogoro)... and I said, "Aren't you going to drink it all?
Don't worry, I'll help you!"
(Door: turn the key)
(Nagata) It hasn't occurred to you that all three of us are accomplices, has it?
You will stay here until we eliminate Mr. Izumi.
Mr. Nagata is also one of them!
"Darn it!"
"Mr. Izumi is in danger!"

The inspector is really late.
He should be here by now.
I'll go to the entrance to see if they've arrived yet.
Ah, it's you!
That was a pity.
It's been a bit short.
Come on, father, you're doing very well.
"Don't miss the next episode:
'Demons dance in the mansion of noh masks (part two)."
