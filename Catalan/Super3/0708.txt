(Shinichi voice) "The first Sunday after summer vacation."
"We were going out to watch a movie with Dr. Agasa."
- (both) Eh?
-Ah!
It's two o'clock!
I just saw the clock strike two o'clock!
-People, you shouldn't knock, here!
-Oh, yes, lucky you.
Hey, hey!
Look up there!
Up that building!
-Oh!
-Let's see, come on, what's the matter now?
Eh ?!
-Mm?
- (Mitsuhiko) Are you fighting?
(Ayumi) What a danger, fighting up there!
(All) Aaaah!
He's thrown her off balance!
- (all: call out)
- (loud thunder)
(Shinichi voice) "To find the perfect solution,
you have to decipher all the mysteries and codes."
"A slow fall, a very strange phenomenon."
"An unthinkable mystery that moves time."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult, and he's Detective Conan!"

(Conan voice) "The slow fall."
Excuse me, is this the person who gave the notice of what happened?
Yes, it was me.
I came from shopping, I was walking here and....
-Ah!
- (loud thunder)
Aaaah!
When it happened, I immediately called the emergency phone.
Understood.
(Shinichi, thinks) "How strange."
-(Shinichi, thinks) "Eh?
-Can I tell you something?
-It wasn't an accident either.
-It wasn't a suicide.
Someone else pushed him off the roof.
-Are you sure?
-We saw it.
Hi, I'm Sakai from the emergency medical team.
Earlier I reported an accident, a person who fell from a rooftop,
but it's possible it was an assassination attempt.
Yes, that's right.
The victim is Mr. Masaaki Ogata, 37 years old.
He lived in Beika, downtown.
(Conan voice) Hey, miss, sorry to bother you.
You called the ambulance at ten minutes past two, didn't you?
- (all) Eh ?!
-Mm?
Yes, at ten past two o'clock.
The ambulance only took between 5 and 6 minutes
to get to the crime scene.
And right now it's exactly... 20 past 2:00.
Ambulances usually take between 5 and 6 minutes on average
to arrive at the scene after an emergency call.
A little rest is enough to know the exact time the girl called.
-Well, the numbers don't add up.
-Ah, now I get it!
We saw that man being pushed off the roof!
-And it was two o'clock.
-That's right.
Aha.
That means he's been falling for 10 minutes.
A very slow fall.
Because this building is only 5 stories high....
L-listen, Mitsuhiko, you mean it was that low, this building?
I don't think so.
I thought it was 5 stories high before.
- (Ayumi) Wait!
- (Genta) Hey!
Where are you going?
Hey, wait!
Not so fast!
Here's an elevator!
-What?!
It doesn't work.
-Yes, but look.
From what I've seen, it must have more or less fallen from here.
Ah, now I begin to understand.
(Ai) From the second floor down there are terraces,
and on the third floor there is a kind of gallery.
(Agasa) This means that, if she was pushed from here,
she probably first bumped into the railing of the gallery,
then stumbled on the terrace and finally fell into the street.
And that's why it took him 10 minutes to fall, right?
Poor guy, he must have tripped over a lot of things.
Let's investigate inside the building.
According to what that girl said earlier,
so far no one has come out of the building.
Yes, but that was 10 minutes ago.
She may have fled through the back door.
Of course, of course!
Maybe the murderer has left a clue at the back door!
- (Genta and Ayumi) Yes!
-Shall we go inspect it?
Hey, hey!
Where are you going so fast?!
(Shinichi's voice) All right, we'll go down to inspect the gallery.
(Agasa) Eh?
From the situation, I reckon it must be here.
(Agasa) Mm?
"Ogata Finance.

Wasn't that his name, the victim?
(Male) "The victim is Mr. Masaaki Ogata, 37 years old."
It must have been his office, this here.
- (door, open)
-And he made loans.
Hey, hey, what are you doing, Shinichi?!
The way the office is, the crime has been committed in here.
(Mitsuhiko) Eh?
(Mitsuhiko) Wow!
It took us so long to find the back door!
There's a chain on the door, so that means...
...the murderer couldn't have escaped through the back door.
- (all) Mm?
-So, where must he have fled?
They've been fighting for a while.
I don't know if it's a good idea, him coming in here alone.
(all) Huh?
A driver's license.
From a Ryohei Honda.
Considering it was on top of this couch lying down,
he must be the man the victim was fighting with.
This we can't know yet.
Surely he must be the killer.
Hey, hey!
Where's he going now?!
The emergency stairs!
I'm sure the murderer has climbed down these stairs
from the third floor and fled.
(Ayumi) Look, all of it here is full of mud.
(Ayumi) -That's very strange.
-Yes, but I don't see any footprints.
If the murderer didn't flee through the front door,
nor by the back door, nor by those stairs,
where could he have fled?
-He couldn't have fled anywhere else.
-There is no other place.
This means that...
...the killer must still be hiding in the building!
-We'd better tell Conan.
-I'm sure he's hiding!
-But, Mitsuhiko...
-No.
What do you want to do, Mitsuhiko?
That we're just looking for the hidden killer?
Mm-hm.
Mm, of having dragged him away.
These are marks...
And there are also blood stains.
Well, most likely what the killer did is drag the victim...
off the roof into the office.
Yes, and then pushed him back down from here...
Glasses!
They look like Ryohei Honda's in his ID photo.
Well, if they're here, on the handrail of the gallery,
it means that the victim, Mr. Ogata,
must have taken them off the killer at once
when he was pushing her off the roof.
Therefore, if it is so obvious...
that the glasses are from this end Ryohei Honda,
it means that we already have a culprit.
And we're good to go.
But if the murderer was planning to shoot again,
what's the point of dragging Mr. Ogata back to the office?
I don't quite understand.
- (door, open)
-Why would he do that?
(all) Why?
- (all) Oh!
(all) -Huh?
(all) Oh!
Are you the ones who saw Mr. Masaaki Ogata being pushed off the roof?
from the top of the roof?
I guess you already know that it shouldn't be, here,
even if he's with Dr. Agasa.
I feel very bad.
I understand that, if there were three of you,
Mr. Ogata was not an ordinary citizen.
No, Mr. Ogata was a well-known loan shark.
I'm sorry about that.
Chiba!
(Conan voice) We saw some glasses at the gallery handrail.
And here was that.
(Conan) What?
A driver's license?
Eh? (Conan voice)
"Ryohei Honda."
Ryohei Honda?
Looking at this license, it's clear that the glasses are his.
That's right.
He came here and had them with Mr. Ogata,
there's no doubt about it.
I'll tell the district police to take care of it.
Very well, then.
I'll go inspect the roof, if that's all right with you.
I'll take care of it.
We'd better tell the police that the killer is still in the building..,
rather than go looking for him ourselves.
We try to find out as much as we can first.
-I still can't forgive myself!
-Mitsuhiko...
If we had been a little more observant from the bus,
we would surely have been able to identify the murderer by now!
-Very well, then!
-But, Mitsuhiko... -But, Mitsuhiko...
-I'll go look in the basement!
-I'm going to investigate upstairs!
Let the search begin, then!
(Mobile)
Inspector Takagi, hello?
You've been unable to locate Mr. Ryohei Honda?
All right, you got it.
Mm?
Thank you, sir.
I'll take it from here.
It appears that he left his home around noon,
but he hasn't told anyone where he was going, and he hasn't returned yet.
All we know is that he ran into an old acquaintance in the street yesterday.

and that he has gone out to meet that person.
Don't you think that's pretty conclusive, with everything we know?
(Shinichi voice) Yes, but I still don't understand.
Why did he have to drag her here?
I don't see the point.
(Shinichi, thinking) "Oh! Oysters."
"A pair of wellies?"
What?
I don't see anything strange.
It's been raining all day.
It has today, but this receipt is from last night.
And according to yesterday's forecast, it was supposed to be a nice day today.
-It's not on any of the upper floors. -It's not on any of the upper floors.
-Nothing, it's not in here either.
Aaah!
You went too fast.
You mean you haven't looked everywhere?
- (Ayumi) Aaaah!
-Of course you did.
(Conan's voice) Who has made this scream?!
(Ayumi) What happened?!
-I was going to look in the basement!
-It was Ayumi!
-Ayumi!
Where are you?!
- Hey, Ayumi!
(Ayumi!
Ayumi, are you all right?!
Ayumi, are you all right?!
(Ay) Look, it's over there!
- (all) Eh?!
-I've... I saw a rat.
A rat?
Well, lucky it didn't bite you.
Ha-ha!
I'd rather say you're lucky the killer didn't catch you.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
It's impossible that in Ryohei even if it turns around here.
-Have they already found out who the murderer is?!
-Who is it in Ryohei?
Mm...!
Aaa... no.
I see there's only one car here.
Maybe it's Mr. Ogata's?
Can you see anything?
A pair of wellies!
(Shinichi, thinks) "Yes, and something else is suspicious too."
A shovel!
It's pretty obvious what these two objects suggest, isn't it?
Yes, it's becoming clearer and clearer.
Nothing, on the roof there was no clue.
- (tap: mana)
-Eh?
Is anyone here?
What happened?
Police!
Anybody here?
Who's here?
Is anybody here?
- (thump)
- (bottle: brittle)
Who is this Ryohei?
We want to know!
-Actually, we don't know anything for sure.
-You know too, don't you, doctor? -Oh!
-Oh!
- (mobile)
Soc in Takagi.
It's you!
Hello, Chiba.
What's up?
What are you saying?
That you've already... caught her?
(Chiba) "No, that the killer has caught me."
Hey! (Chiba)
What?!
The murderer caught you?!
I told no one to come here!
I just asked them to bring me a car so I could run away!
So, yes, it's really you, Ryohei.
So it's this Ryohei Honda?
In the end it was true that the murderer was still hanging around the building.
-So it was!
-Yes.
Why would he do something like that?
Do you have any idea?
Tell me why you did it!
Tell me why you've killed Masaaki Ogata!
Don't you remember who I am?
Who... who are you?
-It seems pretty good that you have amnesia.
-No, I don't remember... anything at all.
That I have amnesia?
(Shinichi, thinks) "Now I understand what you've done!"
How could you do something like that?
You're not this kind of person.
You changed a lot years ago.
Or do you also not remember
that I arrested you about 8 years ago for committing a robbery?
Years ago!
You were not alone.
I committed a robbery?
You committed it with another man you had just met in a bar.
But the only evidence of the other one was that he had a very hoarse voice,
and it wasn't enough to stop him,
so in the end you ended up going to prison alone.
But after you served your sentence you changed
and became a good person!
And not only that!
Later on, you took over your father's factory
and started to hire people with criminal records like you,
you gave them jobs in the factory
and you are going to take them in as if they were your family!
You mean you are a very good person.
-Aaa... I did all this?
-Yes.
-And so much!
How is it that a person like you,
now decided to commit another crime?
What was your relationship with Ogata?
(Shinichi, thinks) "This, what relationship was there?
Between this man and the victim?"
"Earlier they said that..."
...and that he still hasn't returned.
It is only known that yesterday he met an old acquaintance on the street
and that he has gone out to meet that person.
(Shinichi, thinks) "If so..."
"I got it, I know what happened!"

Ryohei, tell us what happened between you and the Ogata!
I've already told you!
I have no idea what happened!
Oh, oh, oh, oh...!
What happened?
Where am I?
(Ogata) When I regained consciousness,
it looked like I had a fight with someone in that office.
(Ambulance: siren)
Was it me?
Did I push it from up here?
I was afraid they would stop me.
But my head hurt a lot and I felt very weak.
At first, I decided to hide.
And when I thought I had to do something...
Nothing, there was no clue on the roof.
Is there anyone here?
What happened?
Police!
Anybody here?
Is it the police?
I didn't want to be arrested.
But... I don't even know what motive I had for wanting to kill!
Then we're all set.
If he doesn't know, no one else can know, I'd say it's impossible.
(Shinichi, thinks) "The only way to find out is for a good detective to solve it.
is for a good detective to solve it."
Why did I kill this man!
Can someone here explain it to me?!
(Agasa) Maybe you didn't kill him.
Do you know if there is a possibility
that you came to see Mr. Masaaki Ogata,
because he was an old acquaintance of yours?
An old acquaintance of mine?
Inspector Takagi, you should know...
whether Mr. Masaaki Ogata had a hoarse voice.
Yes, he had quite a hoarse voice.
Isn't your memory refreshing, Mr. Honda?
A man with a very hoarse voice,
you represent that you met casually about 8 years ago in a bar?
Is that possible?
About 8 years ago, a man with a very hoarse voice,
who-I met in a bar...
A-a man with a very hoarse voice...
Yes, it was him!
I hadn't met her because he was so changed.
But yes, that voice...
(Man, deep voice) Either you pay me the whole debt or your hair will fall out!
I hope that was clear to you.
And what are you looking at, eh?
I thought so, it's you!
It's true that 8 years have passed,
but the crime you committed has not prescribed.
And what do you want, that I am delivered now?
When you are redeemed from your sins
you can live your life without feeling guilty of anything, right?
He was trying to convince you to turn yourself in.
You see?
He's a good person.
-... but what he's done is...
-Yeah, but...
But how did you end up killing Mr. Ogata?
I-I have no idea, I don't remember!
(Agasa voice) It was the other way around.
You knew what Masaaki Ogata-san did 8 years ago.
He was the one who tried to get rid of you.
After killing you,
he probably wanted to take you to the outskirts of the city,
and bury you there.
He had everything ready, he told you to meet him in his office,
that was empty, because it was a holiday,
and there, he has begun to carry out his plan.
The problem is that she didn't manage to kill him,
and he ended up pushing her off the roof of the building.
So this means that when we saw them...
...the person who fell from the roof...
...was Mr. Honda.
Then Mr. Ogata was ready to finish the job...
...and dragged Mr. Honda into the office.
The proof is his jacket, which, if you look at it, is all scratched up.
Yes, but it was Mr. Ogata who was found dead on the sidewalk.
-I'll explain it to you now.
-How do you understand this?
At that moment, Mr. Honda had been hit so hard on the head...
that it had knocked her unconscious.
In fact, it had even given him amnesia.
Therefore, he had been unable to push Mr. Ogata.
And this means there is only one explanation.
Mr. Masaaki Ogata, having finished the dirty work,
intended to take the body and bury it, as he had planned,
but to do it properly, he could leave no trace to prove...
that Mr. Honda had been here.
Oh... Damn it!
I can't just leave it like this, all this.
Eh?
Where are your glasses?
Out here?
Eh?
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
I have to get them!
(Agasa voice) It was all wet and slippery.
And do you remember what happened, then?
-Oh!
- (loud thunder)
Aaaah!
That is, it's not that they pushed a person twice,
but first they pushed one and then another one fell.

All this within a 10-minute interval.
Therefore, this explains why it was such a slow drop.
Ha-ha... Ha-ha... Ha-ha!
It almost made me laugh and everything.
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha!
Ryohei, if that's how it turned out,
maybe it's true that you didn't do anything,
but only as far as Masaaki Ogata is concerned.
Now, you have attacked and you have retained the agent Chiba.
And that, we cannot deny.
Inspector, I don't...
Inspector...
Of course, of course.
Will you join me at the police station?
- (Genta and Mitsuhiko) Very much.
-Doesn't it make you a little sorry?
We've done enough for him.
What do we do, Conan?
Right now, we can't do anything else.
It is true that he has been scared when he has lost his memory,
but he's done what he's done, and there's no denying that.
Of course, I'm sure there's no one who understands him as well as he does.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry for what I've done to you.
No need for handcuffs.
Thank you.
I know you're here voluntarily,
and before we go to the police station we'll take you to the hospital,
to get this head wound treated.
(Shinichi voice) "In the end it turned out that Masaaki Ogata was not dead,
"And he was arrested for the robbery he had committed 8 years ago
and for the attempted murder of Mr. Ryohei Honda."

You've solved another very complicated case again, Dr. Agasa.
-Yes, indeed.
-You've done very well.
-Ah, yes, I suppose I did. -Ah, yes, I suppose I did.
Ha-ha-ha!
-And so much!
- (all) Huh?
-Oh!
(all) Look!
- (Genta) Ual-la!
- (Mitsuhiko) How cool!
-It just came out of the rainbow.
- (Ayumi) How beautiful!
It's because I knew we'd be here looking at the sky.
I hope no one falls, it would be the second time!
-I don't know why I congratulated him.
-And that should be funny?
Ha-ha-ha!
Now he doesn't deserve it.
What a way to finish it off, isn't it?
This is all we need.
(Ai) You always have to spoon it in.
What-what happened?!
(Man) It was the mock-up of the design of the construction site
that Mr. Murase had proposed to Mr. Inomata.
I think it would be logical to think that...
it was a homicide, rather than an accident.
Do we know what Mr. Inomata was doing in front of the pile of pipes?
(Shinichi, thinks) "This is..."
(Conan voice) "Don't miss the next episode!"
"Unidentified impact '."
