(Shinichi voice) "A mysterious character, in Komakichi Kurataya,
"has sent a letter to Kogoro
to tell him that he owes him a family treasure."
"The Ran and I have decided to accompany him to Yamaguchi."
"But the police have mistaken Kogoro for the accomplice of a thief
and arrested her."
"We have found out that Komakichi Kurataya.
"He is the pseudonym of a thief who stole some ancient coins
valued at hundreds of millions of yen."
"Fortunately, in Kogoro he has been released....
thanks to Asuka Natsume, a reporter for a digital newspaper."
"But it turns out that it was she,
who sent him the letter posing as Komakichi Kurataya."
"The Asuka wanted to commission him
"To investigate the theft of the coins,
but he had to do it without drawing attention to the culprit."
"Following a possible lead, we have left Yamaguchi....
and went to another city, Hagi."
"Suddenly..."
(Kogoro) Wow, this is paradise!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Apa, we can leave now.
(Kogoro) What?
Ran, ajupe't!
MHM!
Ep, don't touch this!
Hey, what are you doing...?
Ah...!
Oops...!
Hide session back here!
Oh!
What was that?
A feature?
Yes...
Are you all right, Ran?
He's escaped.
(Shinichi, thinking) "It seems to me that now in Komakichi Kurataya wants to kill...
Kogoro!"
"A new day begins with a splendid sun."
"It's the hour of love and mysteries."
"A gunman wants to kill Kogoro."
"Where will the ancient treasure of the Restoration lead us?"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brains of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The tour of the mysteries: the Bakumatsu Revolution (part of Haya)."
(Camera, shoot: clack)
What are you doing, Father?
Mm...
I'm leaving.
It's been too long since we've been standing around.
Yeah, but where do you want to go?
He thinks we haven't declared yet.
I posted the video on Asuka's news portal
because she was afraid that the culprit would kill her...
and I thought it would reassure her,
but now the culprit has taken it as a provocation.
Yes.
So...?
Asuka is not out of danger, she is also threatened.
Hey, Ran, we should warn Asuka as soon as possible.
-Mm?
- (mobile: ringtone)
Ah.
Hello, Asuka, it's Ra...
(Mobile: ringtone)
(cell phone: ringtone) Eh?
No, nothing.
I got the answering machine.
Come on, we can't waste time.
Let's see if we can find her.
Yes!
-Oh!
- (wheels: squeaking)
Again?
Where does he think he's going?
Can't he see they want to kill him?
I can see it.
And what's the problem?
You should know that we can guarantee your safety.
In other words: we can protect you.
No need, thank you.
I don't need to be protected.
Come on, Ran.
What's up?
Damn, what a pain in the ass...
-Mm!
-Don't get out of the car, okay?
Hey, father, how will we do it, to warn Asuka?
Don't suffer.
We'll wait for them to be distracted and...
- (all) Mm?
- (man) Inspector Takaji.
Mm?
(man) Mm...
Understood.
I'll contact headquarters myself.
You guys take care of our de...
Oh, shit!
The sleazy detective.
- (both) Yes!
-What are you standing around here for?
Look for them.
(Asuka) There's Haya's reverberatory furnace,
a remnant of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution
and a world heritage site.
During the feudal era,

reverberatory furnaces were used to melt metal and refine cannonballs.
and refining cannonballs.
In the 19th century, the young men of the feudal domain of Choshu?
devoted body and soul to building these iconic furnaces.
In the end, however, their efforts and dedication...
did not bear the fruit they had hoped for.
Although the passion of the young patriots of the Bakumatsu Revolution...
of the Bakumatsu Revolution,
who went to great lengths to make a dream come true.
(Mobile: ringtone)
- (mobile: ringtone)
-Mm...
(Mobile: ringtone)
-Asuka, it's me.
Is it okay?
- "Hello, this is Asuka."
Eh?
Ah, Mr. Mouri.
As you say?
Yes, I'm fine...
- "Has something happened?"
-What break!
The truth is yes.
A while ago I was shot with a gun in the middle of the street.
With a gun?!
But did they hurt you?
Are you all right?
Yes.
Luckily, I'm fine.
I'm sure the man who shot at me was in Komakichi Kurataya.
In Komakichi Kurataya...
Asuka, you're in danger too.
-Oh!
- "It's the reverberatory furnace, isn't it?"
Yes... I'm in the parking lot, at the bottom of the stairs.
"Understood. I'll be right back. Don't move, okay?"
Okay, I'll wait for you.
Eager, please.
Mm!
Mm!
Mm!
-Mm!
Mm!
- What happened? Asuka! Asuka!"
"Is anything wrong, Asuka?"
"Please answer. Asuka! Asuka!"
Asuka..., where is it?!
Asukaaa!
If you feel us, please answer!
What?
It's Asuka's cell phone!
This is...
A video call from Mr. Takarada?
"Oysters. And Asuka?"
- "Eh?"
-Mr. Takarada.
I don't know where she is, I just found out she's been kidnapped.
"It can't be."
On the phone she told me she was in the parking lot of the reverberatory furnace,
but when we arrived we only found her cell phone on the ground.
-Mm.
- "Mr. Mouri..."
"It seems to me that this was Mr. Fujiki's doing."
That lawyer, you mean?
"The Asuka suspected that he was the one
who was hiding behind the identity of Komakichi Kurataya."
If this were true, where do you think he would have taken her?
"I have no idea, but she explained to me....
"That she had met Fujiki several times
and that he always suggested they meet at Shizuka Park."
-Yes.
-Shizuka Park?
"It's where the ruins of Hagi's castle are."
"They are surrounded by a moat and a stone wall."
"She thought I was hiding the coins she stole from me in Fujiki."
So, Asuka could be there?
"I'll be right back to meet you."
"But it will take me a very good hour to get to Hagi by car."
Okay, we'll try to get there so we can.
(Shinichi, think) "I don't understand."
"How come Kogoro was shot with a pistol
and Asuka didn't?"
"Oh... Maybe he just shot him to scare him."
"Then..., why did he kidnap Asuka?"
"Because he wants to kill her?"
"And where did he take her?"
"It has to be a place where he can get rid of her without witnesses."
The ancient currency called "koban" contains almost 90% gold.
It is possible that they were melted down and made into ingots
to be able to sell the gold much more easily.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Won't he want to...?"
Hey, Ran!
Let me see Asuka's cell phone.
Eh?
I have to watch the old videos on her news portal.
It's here.
(Asuka) "To me, Beech reverberatory furnaces are a place of power."
(Asuka) "A place of power?"
"They are some constructions that the feudal lords of Choshu
tried to erect without prior design."
"When I go out for a walk,
"I come here often to feel the power of those men
who faced so many hardships."
(Asuka) "Ah...!"
"The foundry you employ is very close to here."
- "Yes."
- "Oi, Mr. Fukuhara?"
Eh?
Please stop.
I have to get off!
(Kogoro) Hey, what are you doing, kiddo?
You and Ran continue on to Shizuka Park.
I'll come later, when I've checked something.
(Kogoro) Hey!
Where are you going?
What did you say you want to check?
Watch out, ajupe't!
The police.
What?

Uh!
Blow, it's gone from well short.
What a rage!
We must act as if we've done something wrong...
We'd better hide, because that inspector...
Know that we can guarantee his safety.
In other words: we can protect him.
Mm?
Wait a minute...
This city does not fall under your jurisdiction.
Then why did you come to investigate, when I was shot at?
(Think) "What if that asshole... melted in Komakichi Kurataya?"
Mm...
(Shinichi, thinks) "Where is he? I have to find the foundry! Oh!"
"It's there! I hope I get there in time!"
(groans)
Ah..., ah!
Ah...
Eh?
Oh... (groans) Ah...!
Oh, Conan!
Oh, shit!
I have to stop the tape right away!
Conan, hurry!
Over there!
Stop it, hurry!
Endavaaant...!
-Oh...! -Oh...!
- (machine: clack)
Phew!
I've arrived in time...
(machine: clack) What?
Wait for me here, okay?
Remember he's carrying a gun.
Whatever happens, don't follow me.
(Mobile: ring)
Father...
(Mobile: ring)
Conan!
Where are you now?
Hello, Ran.
Soc with Asuka.
I've found her.
That's good.
How about you?
Where's your father?
"Really? I hope he's okay."
I lost sight of her, she just entered Shizuka Park alone.
Mm...
Eh?
It's Mr. Fujiki...
Mm?
And that fool of an inspector!
They were in cahoots.
Mm...
(Salvo: resounds)
Father!
Don't move..., you sleazy detective.
(Takaji) Huh?
Takaji!
I knew it was you...
Father!
-Huh?
-Don't lift a finger.
Hey...!
Eh?
-Punyeta!
Now he's escaped.
-Hey..., hey!
Well... I thought he was aiming at me...
At you?
Why the hell should I shoot you, you?
Huh?
Someone's pointing a gun at you from these bushes here.
Huh?
What?!
-So, the culprit is... -So, the culprit is...
-He's dropped the gun and ran away. -Hey?
(cell phone rings) - Huh?
- (cell phone)
Tell me?
Hey, you, kid!
Tell me right now where you are and what you're doing.
-Mm...
-Eh?
What are you doing?
Sorry to be so late, Mr. Mouri.
We were expecting you, Mr. Takarada.
You were right when you told me
that it takes more than an hour to come by car from Yamaguchi.
Yes, oh, so long.
But it doesn't matter.
What about Asuka?
Did you find her or what?
Eh?
What... what are they doing here, the police and Mr. Fujiki?
What... what does this mean?
-Huh? -Mr. Takarada...
-Mr. Takarada...
Did you know, that Mr. Fujiki was the lawyer of Yuichi Fukuhara,
the man convicted of stealing the coins?
What?
Mr. Fukuhara...
has reason to suspect that you might be in Komakichi Kurataya.
But... how do you want me to...?
He said he didn't agree with his late father's will.
His will was that the works of art and antiques
stored in the cafeteria's storeroom
be given to local institutions.
That's why he decided to steal the coin collection....
If he melted them down and turned them into gold bullion, he could sell them and make a fortune,
he could sell them and make a fortune.
Stop the cart!
You have no proof that I'm the man you're looking for.
I have no proof.
But I am convinced that, somehow,
you realized that Miss Asuka was becoming suspicious of you.
Yes, that's why he kidnapped her and tried to shut her up for good.
Inspector, don't you believe all this nonsense?
The robber shot me in the arm!
He did.
But the bullet barely grazed your left arm,
it was a very superficial wound.
It's very likely that you shot yourself
to impersonate the victim.
Wha-what nonsense!
You can't prove it.
-(Kogoro) Huh?
- (Kogoro) We have proof.
-I have no idea what it means.
-You've shot me twice.
The first time was an hour and a half ago.
And an hour ago you shot me a second time.
Say what you want, but I have an alibi.
I've just arrived in Hagi, you've seen him.
And I haven't moved from Yamaguchi until now.
You yourself have seen me in the garage of my house, when I called you.
Surely, you were at home when I took the video call?
Ah...!
It is true that he had a very flashy sports car behind him.
So, anyone would have thought that he was talking from his garage.

I don't know what you mean!
When he recorded with his webcam,
in Komakichi Kurataya he was disguised as a militiaman.
A flashy outfit draws attention away from the person wearing it,
that is, the culprit.
He has used the same technique to make us believe
that he was speaking from the garage of his house:
to divert attention with a flashy car.
Mm.
And where do you think it was, if not my garage?
Yes.
Ran.
What, Conan, are you ready?
I turn the screen.
"Mm-hm. We'll start whenever you're ready."
"Hello, Mr. Takarada."
"You said that the bricklayers in the building next to the cafeteria
were making noise from morning till evening."
"But when we talked to you on the phone a while ago,
you didn't feel anything at all."
"I noticed it because of that."
"I found out that you were not in your garage,
but that you were talking from inside a truck."
"He set it all up to make it look like
that he was calling us from the garage of his house."
"But, in fact, he had long since arrived in Hagi....
and he was talking from inside the truck."
"Oysters. And Asuka?"
Mr. Takarada.
I don't know where she is, I just found out she's been kidnapped.
"It can't be."
"And this is also where he took Asuka when he kidnapped her."
"Mr. Takarada..."
"I knew that in Komakichi Kurataya, the thief....,
...was you."
- (both) Eh?
-Bullshit!
Don't let it get away!
- (wheels: squeaking)
(both) -Huh?
Oh, shit!

(Birds: chirping) -Eh?
- (Asuka) Yuichi!
Asuka...
(Asuka) Welcome.
(Kogoro) Thank you.
(Kogoro) Wow!
I thought that Asuka and this Fukuhara End were just acquaintances.
You should look for another one, Kogoro.
(Kogoro) Mm!
You be quiet.
It's very good news,
that she's only served one year in the end.
I guess Asuka...
wanted to find out who was responsible for everything
before Fukuhara got out of prison.
Mm?
(Takaji) You're right, kid.
It seems that Mr. Fukuhara had sworn
that he would find the real culprit when he was released.
But Asuka wasn't willing to let him be in any danger.
So, I gather that you know all the details...
Asuka's plans from the beginning, right?
Mm-hm.
You've finally figured it out, you sleazy detective.
Watch your mouth, asshole.
You want to know who suggested Asuka to invite you to Yamaguchi?
-You?
-It was me.
I told her that at Kogoro Mouri,
the best detective in Japan by far..,
was the only one who could solve the mystery.
What do you say we go celebrate that the case is solved?
I invite you to try some noodles from Yamaguchi.
A good meal will make us forget our differences.
Mm!
Noodles are not enough for me to make peace with you.
There will be an open bar of schnapps.
Ah!
Then I'm sure we'll soon be good friends.
(Shinichi, thinks) "Oh..."
(Both) Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"An asshole inspector and a sleazy detective..."
"He-he-he! They make a good team."
You can say that again.
Oh!
What a fantastic place, Conan!
Ran, this reminds me of something...
Actually, there was a case... What was it?
It must be the Mary Celeste case, right?
You mean this one?
What do you mean!
The Mary Celeste?
Eh ?!
Oh, it can't be!
The lake has disappeared..., just like the other 5.
