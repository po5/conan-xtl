"We have traveled to Kanazawa to collaborate on an activity.
"To revitalize the city,
called 'Mystery Itinerary in Kaga Hyakumangoku'."
"Once there we made a test itinerary
visiting the various checkpoints."
Eh?
(Woman) Ah!
A thief!
Quiet!
Aaaah!
Fucking hell!
I'll get you!
You bastard!
"But later the thief has reappeared and attacked in Kogoro."
"Or so we thought,
because in the end it was all an act to film it with a hidden camera."
"But soon after..."
Eh?
Oh!
Miss Akiyama?
Harumi?
Harumi!
Hurry, send for an ambulance!
Right away!
Hey, you, stop filming!
This is no scene!
It's for real!
"This isn't a hidden camera? Then why did Miss Akiyama...?"
"It doesn't look like a robbery."
"And if it had been the indiscriminate attack of an assailant.
there should be more victims."
"That is to say, someone expressly attacked Miss Akiyama."
"And now I wonder what's going on, here."
"The lines of the hand are fuses,
the heart line lights the fire of deduction."
"The hidden camera case becomes real."
"In Kogoro makes a fantastic deduction to the footbath."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"Mysterious itinerary in Kaga Hyakumangoku (Part of Kaga)"
Oh!
Wait, Miss Akiyama's bag.
B-but that's...
Excuse me, is there anyone who can accompany her?
-Huh?
-Go, Ran.
It's better if you go.
Shouldn't her fiancé, Mr. Kuranishi,
instead of me?
We still have a lot of work to do.
Don't worry, you don't need to worry about anything.
We should continue to visit the checkpoints.
-I agree.
-What do you say?
Is that okay with you?
Yes, it's better than yes.
Mr. Kuranishi might be worried.
Please, Ran, take care of Miss Akiyama.
Check in for me.
All right, I will.
I have to go now.
"Maybe in Kogoro he's suspicious of some member of the group?"
"Is that why you've sent the Ran into the hospital, so that none of them can run away?"
Why did something like that have to happen?
Don't worry, now.
I'm sure she'll make a full recovery.
Don't you think we should report all this to the police?
No, I think it's better to contact the police...
when we've seen how Miss Akiyama is doing.
What's that?
Now why are you looking at me like that?
You don't need to suspect me, I didn't do it!
I'm only saying this because if we report an assault to the police, it could negatively affect this event.
could negatively affect this event.
Yes, I know, Mr. Tanimoto.
No one is accusing you of anything.
You can be calm.
When someone gets too upset it makes them look suspicious.
Shut up, shut up...
Eh?
Hey, Kogoro.
Do you mind if I take a look at the riddle cards
Miss Akiyama gave you earlier?
Mmm... These?
Yes, thank you!
Now I have to go to the washroom.
Hm?
"The cards that fell out of Miss Akiyama's bag...
are probably the ones she had prepared in the first place."
"Why did she deceive us,
told us she'd lost them and made new ones?"
Oh!
We continue with the news:
on May 6, 2010,
an elderly man living alone was assaulted in Kanagawa City on May 6, 2010.

and was robbed of 5 million yen.
"I get it! This is what happened!"
"It was probably him who attacked Miss Akiyama."
"But I don't have any evidence to prove it."
The next checkpoint is the last one on the itinerary,
but because of what happened to Miss Akiyama.
Akiyama we don't have the card.
So I will give you the name of the place.
We will go to Iroha Soan House, Yamashiro Hot Spring Resort.
(Tanimoto) And that's it.
With this one, we have visited all the checkpoints.
When the actual itinerary is made,
the participants will already have all the clues
to solve the difficult case that you will pose,
and using those clues
the real culprit of the case.
By the way, Mr. Mouri, how are you doing?
Have you come up with any interesting cases yet?
Well, you see... the thing is that I really... I guess...
How marvelous.
It's a very well-kept garden.
Hey, Kogoro,
back to the hidden camera footage.
If they're to promote the itinerary,
don't you think we should see them first?
What?
Hm?
Yes, you're right.
Please, can you show them to us?
Of course I can.
No problem at all.
- (Kogoro) Quiet!
- (woman) Aah!
A thief!
You bastard!
I'll get you!
You bastard!
(Kogoro) Idiot...
-No, I'm perfectly fine.
-Didn't you do wrong, Mr. Mouri? -You did wrong?
What a man... most insolent and repellent.
I don't think we'll have any more trouble, Kanazawa is a very safe place.
Mr. Tanimoto, how come you look directly into the camera?
Man, we must let everyone know that this is a very safe place.
(Man) Now you'll pay for this!
-(Man) Huh?
-Hehehehe...
(Kogoro) Stop it!
You're the thief who stole that bag before!
Harumi!
Hurry, call for an ambulance!
(Tanimoto) Right away!
Hey, you, stop filming!
This is no scene!
It's for real!
Hm.
Nothing's coming out.
How should it be, Miss Akiyama?
If you want, I can ask Ran right now.
Well, all the best.
Thank you very much for everything.
(Mobile)
Yes, hello?
Hello, father.
Well...
So the wound was not as serious as we thought.
(Cell phone ringing) Hey.
You'll need to stay overnight for observation,
and they need to do an EEG.
Oh, that's great.
I'm glad it wasn't too bad in the end.
Hm?
Kogoro, let me talk to Ran!
Hello, Ran.
What can we talk about?
"Conan!"
Hey, I don't seem to have much good coverage, you don't feel well at all.
Hello, can you feel me now?
Hello!
(Kogoro voice) Ran, I have to ask you to do me a favor, please.
(Kogoro's voice) Huh?
Is that you, father?
Yes, it is.
(Kogoro voice) Huh?
Hm.
Okay, if that's what you want me to do...
All right, I'll see you later.
Uh? (Chuckles)
Thank you very much.
Here, please.
Don't take the mobile again without permission!
(Mobile)
What's up, Ran?
What's new?
Eh?!
What are you saying?
That Miss Akiyama isn't in her room?
What?
Is it true that Harumi has run away from the hospital?
Yes, she did.
La Ran has left the room to talk to me on the phone
and Miss Akiyama took the opportunity to run away.
She left a note saying that she would make a confession no matter what happened.
and that's why she was going to Yamashiro.
So she's on her way here.
Kuranishi, have you tried to contact your promise?
I have.
But so far he hasn't answered any of my messages and he won't pick up his phone.
I am very intrigued to know
what is this important thing he says he has to confess.
Surely he must have seen his attacker's face or something.
Maybe it's better if we split up and look for the Harumi.
Excuse me, do you know where are the scissors that were here?
I have no idea.
IAAH!
They're over there!
Aaah...
Ran?
What's this?
Can someone tell me what happened?
Father called me to tell me to come.
He told me to dress up as Miss Akiyama to lure the offender.
Akiyama to lure the offender.
Oh!
Now don't think of anything.
Come in, Ran!
I'm a little...
And get as much rest as you can.
I'll get your cell phone and jacket for a moment, okay?
Hey, wait a minute, I didn't tell you what happened...
Aah!

I told you what?
Ah... ah...
Oh!
Kogoro, you'd better take off your shoes and socks, don't you think?
(Kogoro voice) Yes, it was me who told the Ran to come.
So where is the Harumi now?
She's in the hospital room.
Hey, Kuranishi!
Are you the one who attacked the Akiyama?
May I know why you did it?
Aagh!
If I may, I'll tell you myself.
Look, when the paramedics put Miss Akiyama on the stretcher...
to transfer her
I noticed that she wasn't wearing her watch.
"But until shortly before the assault, she was wearing it."
We're running a little short of time, so we'd better go to the museum of the 21st century.
XXI CENTURY MUSEUM.
As the watch was not found at the scene of the crime,
it was most likely taken to the assailant.
But why?
Then I remembered what Miss Miyazawa had said.
Miss Akiyama and I were secretly recording everything.
That is to say, that fat watch Miss Akiyama was wearing...
Akiyama...
must have had a small camera hidden in it that filmed everything, right?
You're right, Mr. Mouri!
Miss Akiyama's watch had a mini-camera built into it.
(Kogoro voice) Mr. Kuranishi, I'm sure after assaulting her...
you thought that the crime you had just committed...
might have been caught on camera, didn't you?
Isn't that why
that you made it look like you were taking Miss Akiyama's pulse
and actually took the opportunity to take her watch?
Hurry, call for an ambulance!
When Conan asked to see
the hidden camera recordings,
there was a danger that the images could also be seen at the moment when the assault
the moment when the aggression took place,
and how you took off his watch.
But unfortunately nothing was recorded.
Therefore, the last option that I had left and that I had to try,
was for the Ran to be the bait.
Kuranishi, was it really you?
Hm.
Why did you do it?
Miss Akiyama is your promise, isn't she?
She did it to prevent me
from talking about the incident that happened 4 years ago.
-Yes.
-To keep me from talking?
About the case of that old man who lived alone...
and was robbed of 5 million yen,
which was on the noon news today.
What does it have to do with that case?
What does it have to do, that case that happened 4 years ago,
have to do with the assault that happened a while ago?
It could be said that Ms. Akiyama tried to explain
Akiyama has been trying to explain everything to me
with the riddle cards on the itinerary.
The riddle cards?
Right after watching the news,
Miss Akiyama said that she had lost the original cards
and that she had to make new ones.
But she was not telling the truth and had not actually lost them.
In Conan she has picked up the cards
that had fallen out of his bag during the assault.
These are the original cards from the set,
and these are the ones he has written with the new riddles.
Oh!
As you can see, the three new riddles?
handwritten by her are very different
from the ones she had previously prepared.
When I saw that there was so much difference with the others,
then I thought that maybe they could include another type of message
that Miss Akiyama was letting us know.
Regarding the first riddle, we can read 10-5-6
but upside down it can mean 6 of the five, that is, May, 2010.
The ge and the sword can be read as "jiken",
which in Japanese means case or incident.
The case of May 6, 2010?
So... you were referring to the case that was in the news today?
That's right.
And as for the second code...
The bottom half of the diamond and the arrowhead are black,
and there's a plus sign just between these two figures.
When you put one on top of the other
a black star-shaped figure remains, i.e. "hoshi",
which in Japanese has a double meaning:
It both serves to refer to "star" and to say "guilty".
And the star and the chair form "Kura".
Then, the last enigma,
if you read the card without doing the calculation
is "ni" "shi" "san".
So, if we put all the information together we have:
May 6, 2010 the case,
guilty and Kuranishi...
Oh!
Hmmm...
There is no room for doubt

that Ms. Akiyama knew that you, Mr. Kuranishi, were the real culprit in that case, am I right?
were the real culprit in that case, am I wrong?
I don't know where she got that information,
but she didn't say anything to anyone all this time.
Now then...
What if it was a wrong accusation?
-It's true.
-It could have serious consequences.
It could even ruin the life of the accused.
If she didn't say anything,
an innocent person could be found guilty and convicted.
And since she wanted to avoid that, she decided to tell the truth.
And you, Mr. Kuranishi, would not agree?
and you tried to stop her from talking, didn't you?
Isn't that why you waited until we were alone to attack Miss Akiyama?
Oh!
Yes, why deny it?
"I warned the Harumi right away by sending her a text message."
That's why Miss Akiyama used the cards,
to inform me of everything but so that you wouldn't notice anything.
That's right;
I was very worried that the Harumi, at some point,
would end up telling the whole world.
"I was so worried that I didn't want to leave her alone for a moment."
But then, when she and I were left alone....
I made a decision, you know?
I'll explain everything to Mr. Mouri.
Eh?
Please, serve whatever sentence you're given and we'll start over,
the two of us together.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't go away!
Harumiiii!
That's why I've made it look like I was looking at Mouri and the others
and went with the director and the rest of the group.
And for the sake of avoiding prison,
you don't mind them charging someone innocent for what you did?
To avoid going to jail,
you were able to attack the woman you were going to marry.
Tell me how someone can be so selfish!
Miss Akiyama didn't deserve that!

"They were afraid that, because of what had happened,
the mystery tour activity would be cancelled, but..."
I'll do my best to make the itinerary happen anyway.
-I think it's perfect.
-I'm sure we'll get through it.
Here, this is the case I've written specifically for the activity.
Let me see it...
Mm.
Mmm.
Gee, I think it's very interesting!
I expected nothing less, from the great detective Kogoro Mouri.
The truth is that today, when I woke up,
I found it next to the cushion.
-Hey, don't mind me!
-What?
It's just that since I'm a great detective,
I have the ability to write these things down so easily...
that afterwards I practically forget I wrote them.
Ha-ha-ha!
"Hehe..."
Hehe...
Ha-ha-ha!
(snoring)
(snoring) Okay...
Come on, Conan.
Now go to sleep.
"Yeah, I wish..."
Hey, look.
Looks like Conan slept.
Wow.
Look how well the kids live, don't you agree?
Oh, shit.
-Who would these two men be?
-Come here.
Huh?
Undercover cops.
A notebook?
Must have fallen to the man who was escaping.
Yes.
