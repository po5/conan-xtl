The light of summer is the brightness of the past.
After tears, the legend of a witch!
We detectives have lost our way
and have ended up at the mountain witch's house.
Tonight something will happen!
She always discovers the only truth!
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is Detective Conan!

The road is cut off.
(At the same time) What?
Again?
It's been 17 already.
It's just that the roads in this area are very difficult to find.
There are a lot of detours and cut off roads
that are not even indicated on the map.
I've already told him it wasn't a good idea.
But he wanted to detour at all costs
to avoid the traffic jam on the highway.
The heat and the traffic jams are very harmful
for the engine's cooling system.
Besides, I thought, if we got lost, we could use the navigator on the mobile phone,
we could use the navigator on the cell phone
to find the right way back.
And did it ever occur to you
that we would end up in a place where there was no coverage?
Why didn't you install a navigator in your car?
If we had a good navigator,
it would guide us to the right road in no time.
I'm starving...
My navigator is still under development.
When it is fully finished, it will be perfect!
A great invention with all kinds of amazing features!
The thing is, we don't have any right now.
He-he-he-he-he-he-he!
We have to go back any way we can.
If we make a U-turn,
maybe we'll get somewhere where we'll have coverage again
and we can start finding cars or people.
You're right, you're right.
Let's get going!
Let's start over!
(clicking)
What a mess!
We have a flat front tire.
Where do you have the spare tire, Dr. Agasa?
It's just that the spare tire didn't fit all the junk,
so I had to leave it at home.
It's very strange that it had a flat tire,
because these wheels are new,
I changed all 4 of them very recently!
Fantastic!
The sun has already set and we have no idea where the hell we are.
We'll have to stay here for the night, guys.
(At the same time) What?
Now why are you guys so shocked?
You didn't want to go to the campground and sleep outdoors?
We've got everything we need to do that.
It's just that these... mountains are... a little scary...
(Mitsuhiko) Yeah, it looks like a ghost is about to come out.
Yeah, or the mountain witch that comes out in ancient legends...
and who they say eats lost people!
(At the same time) The mountain witch?
Stop it, guys.
This is a legend.
The witch of the mountain does not exist.
She may not exist, but her house does.
It's that one over there.
What's that?
Look!
That house looks very nice...
...that of the witch of the mountain!
No!
It's coming.
Don't be cowards.
This is impossible.
We're saved!
Looks like a pretty big house.
We'll ask them to let us stay the night.
(At the same time) What?
We have to sleep?
How strange!
You can't see another light.
It seems to be the only house around.
But what's such a big house doing in this lost corner of the mountain?
You're right.
It looks very much like someone inside is inviting us:
"Come, I'll eat you!"
What do you prefer, that we sleep right here, in the open,
or that we try to spend the night indoors?
-What do you want to do? -I am afraid!
But he thinks it's much more dangerous to sleep in the open, Ayumi.
We'll go to the mountain witch's house!
Haibara, Ayumi!
We will protect you in exchange for our lives, if necessary!
Thank you very much.
You mean you'll volunteer when the witch wants to eat us?

Eh?
Eee... We'll see, this...
Surely the thighs of Genta's, well basted with oil,
are much more tender than mine!
And I'm sure that from you will also come out a good broth!
What a pair!
(Agasa) Come on, boys!
Let each one take his suitcase.
(At the same time) Yes!
"The weapon of the witch of the mountain, (first part)
(Agasa) Gee, what a house!
It has a thatched roof.
(Agasa) It is true.
We must admit that it doesn't look like a witch's house.
Let's go inside.
They say that witches live in old and gloomy houses half demolished.
It is true.
They also say they carry kitchen knives.
Yes, those big kitchen knives.
(Woman: sinister laughter)
Do you talk... about a knife like this?
- (at the same time) The witch! -The witch!
You live here, madam? Yes, why do you say so?
That you would let us spend the night in your house?
It's just that we have a flat tire on the front of the car.
Is that so?
And what were you doing here?
(Agasa) We don't want to cause you any trouble, ma'am.
We were looking for a campsite,
we got lost and ended up here.
We didn't know what to do
until we saw, from afar, your house lit up.
Oh, really?
Well, you could have said it before!
Why are you carrying this knife, you?
When I heard your voices,
it had been a while since I heard your voices, it was the shed making canned vegetables.
I went out to see who it was in my house
and I heard you
you were talking about the legend of the witch of the mountain.
Around here, it's the only house there is.
We haven't seen any more light than yours.
Yes, this is the only one in this area.
The people who lived on the mountain moved to the city a long time ago.
a long time ago.
I can't offer you much comfort,
but if you want, come in and stay the night in my house.
Thank you very much, madam.
Does anyone else live in this house besides you, ma'am?
No.
I've been living alone for a long time.
Ah, it's just that I've seen two pairs of slippers and I thought...
These are the slippers of Shota, my grandson,
who left home 10 years ago because he wanted to be a cook.
Since then I haven't touched them, they are just as he left them.
If he wants to wear them, go ahead.
If he needs slippers,
there are a few pairs on that shelf.
It's not that I want to wear them, I asked out of curiosity.
There are some for Ayumi and Haibara.
There are also for you, Conan.
Thank you.
Wow!
Who do you think it must be, this guy?
I don't know.
It's my clean Shota.
How ungrateful!
Since he left home, 10 years ago,
I haven't heard from him again, nor has he come to visit me.
I'm sure he's become a world-famous cook...
and he must be paid a fortune.
But I'm not going to touch a single cent of this scoundrel's money.
of this scoundrel's money.
Look!
They are fish!
They also belong to my grandson.
He left me nothing but trouble and annoyance.
But these fish are quite fat!
Oh.
They've been alive for more than 10 years now.
Do you fatten them up to eat them?
-All you think about is food, Genta!
You're worse than the mountain witch!
Eh?
Oi, Conan?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Did something happen to you?
I saw... a face looking at us through the crack in the door!
What?!
Are you sure?
Who could be here at this hour?
Be careful, Conan!
Who are you, you?
And what are you doing here?
Hello, boy.
What is it, the mistress of the house?
Ah.
Yes, she is.
Can you tell her to come out?
It's me, the owner of the house.
We don't want to disturb you, ma'am.
Look, we've come for a walk in the mountains...
and we've come this far, until...
Turns out we took a wrong turn...
and we ran out of gas.
Would you mind if we stayed the night at your place?
Just for one night and that's all.
I assure you we're not thieves or anything like that, ma'am...
I call myself, Fuga Kahara.
My name is Akane Oba, senlyora.
My name is Raito Adachi.
I work in front of the public, I live in Tokyo, madam.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
And I am your public.
Please, ma'am, it's just for tonight.
I assure you.
All right, stay.
(What luck!

But... then she will never enter my house again.
How unpleasant!
Leave her alone, she must be in a bad mood.
I don't care!
I wouldn't go back into her house even if she asked me on her knees.
Don't worry.
And you, what are you doing here, standing around like a bunch of staphs?
Sit down!
We'd better not make this woman any more angry.
Run away!
If you hadn't gotten lost, we wouldn't be here now.
Excuse me, I didn't do it expressly, woman.
Let's stop arguing and go in at once.
(Agasa) You waiters?
You two work in a nightclub?
Yes.
Today, I work in a second-rate club...
and Raito is in a first-rate club.
Yes, it's just as you say.
And all thanks to the customers who trust me.
Oh!
Look, guys!
They're goldfish!
-They're beautiful! Yes, and there are quite a few of them.
-Wow!
A tamasaba! -Tamasaba?
Yes, it's this one!
The tail and fins resemble those of mackerel.
There are 12 fish of different species,
but you don't see this one very often.
Wow!
You really know your fish, Fuga!
I used to have an aquarium myself.
You are the king of fish!
I'll tell you about the rocks.
The transparent rocks on the right are quartz,
the stained rock on the side is little,
and the one you see on the left, shiny black, is obsidian.
It was used in prehistoric times, during the Jomon period.
I am impressed!
You guys are geniuses!
I would rather say you are pedants and blowhards.
They make a living out of it.
With these explanations,
they pretend to look much smarter than they are
because women flatter them.
They are the shame of their gender.
-Wow!
Are you serious? -Oh, really!
It's true.
-Excuse me, ma'am.
Listen, do you mind if I use your kitchen for a little while?
Why do you want it, you?
Look, as I was planning to take the kids camping...
and prepare dinner outdoors,
I've brought the ingredients to make some curry.
I'm very hungry, doctor!
Don't complicate my life too much,
so it occurred to me that I could make it myself.
No man will enter my kitchen!
What?
Give me the ingredients,
I'm perfectly capable of preparing a curry rice.
-Thank you very much, but... I'll help you!
The kitchen is not a place where children can play.
Come on, su!
(Ayumi) OK.
The truth is that I don't know how to cook anything.
Don't worry, I'll get my wits about me.
Before, my grandson used to make curry.
Where are the ingredients?
-They're in that sports bag you see over there.
What a big bag!
"No wonder he had to take out the spare tire."
(Genta) Ah.
I have to tell you that the curry was delicious, ma'am!
(Mitsuhiko) You like anything you can eat, Genta.
- (Ayumi) But you're right, it was great! -(Ayumi) That's true.
You and the children can sleep
in the room at the end of the corridor, on the right.
(Children) Yes!
Thank you very much.
The men will install you
in the room at the back, to the left.
And you will stay in this one here.
What? I can sleep in the same room as my roommates.
I can sleep in the same room as my roommates.
From the age of 7, men and women have to sleep separately!
Oh, really?
Where did you get this from?
You're a young, unmarried woman, and you have to behave decently!
-Does anyone know what "decent" means? - We are 7 years old.
Can we sleep in the same room?
I'm not a married woman.
He-he-he-he-he-he-he....
(Knife, sharpen: Chist)
(Chist, Chist)
"What will it be, this noise?"
(Chist, Chist)
(Chist, Chist) "It seems to come here. This is the kitchen of the house."
(Chist, Chist)
(Footsteps: approaching)
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?
But it's only 4 o'clock in the morning!
We... we should run away from here right now!
(Chist, Chist) What?
Hurry up!
If we don't get out... of this house..., he'll kill us!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Did you feel it?
-It was the voice of the girl from before! -It was coming from outside!
Akane, answer!
Akane!
What happened?
Akane.
Answer me!
-What happened? -I heard a scream!
Akane!
Akane!

We call an ambulance and the police!
Hurry up!
Yes... Okay...
Akane!
Raito!
Escape!
Let's get her inside.
Hurry up.
Yes, help me.
It's too late.
Her carotid artery's been severed with a sharp tool,
and she's lost a lot of blood.
(There's nothing to be done.
Oh.
Hey, boy!
Mind your own business!
Run away!
Oh, my goodness...!
A sharp tool, you say?
It could have been a kitchen knife, a meat cleaver, for example.
Who was it?
Why did he choose this moment... and what weapon did he use?
And why in this place?
A... a weapon in the middle of the mountain?
What... what do you mean?
It was the witch!
It looks like the police and the ambulance won't arrive for another hour.
-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! What's the matter with you?
-Why are you so scared? -Aaaaaah... It's nothing.
You mustn't think that I'm exactly...
the legendary mountain witch, do you?
Hey, Mrs. Tanaka.
Can I go to the bathroom for a moment, please?
Yes, of course you can.
I'd like to wash these bloody hands.
Where is it, please?
To go to the bathroom, you have to go out that sliding door.
When you get to the stairs, turn right,
it's down the hall, past the kitchen.
(Think) "The... the kitchen!"
(Man) Let's see.
If we put your statements together,
early this morning, at 3:58 minutes past 3:00,
they heard a woman's scream coming from outside the house.
When they went out to see what had happened,
they found this woman with her throat slit.
Yes.
Let's see... the victim's name was Akane Oba,
a young woman of 25 years of age.
She was the daughter of the director of a finance company?
Yes.
That's right, sir.
According to your statements,
when you went outside in the street,
there was someone next to the girl, who was already dead.
-Am I mistaken in any detail, sir? -Yes, it was me.
What?
You are the murderer, then?
No, and now!
When I heard the scream of the girl,
I was downstairs to go to the bathroom.
That's why I arrived a little before the others,
who were sleeping on the upper floor of the house.
Did you see anyone who looked suspicious when you reached the victim?
No.
I didn't see anything.
It was dark,
and at the time I was only thinking about helping the girl, who was injured.
Uh... By the way, what's your name?
My name?
Raito... Adachi, sir.
Raito Adachi, eh?
And you, what's your name?
Fuga Kahara.
Fuga Kahara.
Oh.
Wasn't there a Mrs. Yamada in this house?
It's Tanaka!
My name is Tanaka, me!
I'm Mrs. Iwae Tanaka, the person who called you.
Of course, excuse me.
It's true, you're right.
I should get used to write well
the names of the people who call us every day.
(laughs)
Do you think it will come out?
You two, Mr. Adachi and Mr. Kahara,
I'd like to ask you what you're doing at Mrs. Tanaka's house.
And you would also have to explain to me
what relationship you each had with the victim.
The victim was a regular customer at the nightclub where we work.
We are waiters at a nightclub.
Miss Akane told us
she wanted to go for a walk in the mountains
and we decided to organize a driving tour.
-Are you waiters, you? -Yes.
Yesterday, my partner took the wrong road,
we got lost and ran out of gas.
Mrs. Tanaka, very kind,
and told us we could stay overnight at her house.
Mrs. Tanaka, tell me who are your closest relatives.
I have no family.
I live alone since my grandson left home...
and left me 10 years ago.
Y... where did he come from?
The same thing happened to us as to these guys.
We were looking for a campsite, but we got lost in the mountains...
and we got a flat tire on our car.
And we asked him to let us sleep here.
We got to the house a little bit before they did.
So, you all say...
that you found yourselves accidentally involved in the case.
Yes, we could put it this way.
He-he-he...
Lack of fuel, a flat tire...
Let's see, your name is Conan, right?

It seems to me, my boy, that you should be seen by a good exorcist.
I am convinced that you have been possessed by some evil creature.
Inspector, do you have any clues as to who the murderer might have been?
You're right, let's get to the point.
Although it was raining at the time of the murder,
we found no footprints around the house,
and the murder weapon has disappeared without a trace.
In addition, no one has seen any suspicious individuals in the vicinity.
This means...
both the murderer and the murder weapon are still in this house.
Wait a minute!
Are you accusing us of having killed our client?
-It's normal, Fuga. -What?
Well, we're the ones who took her here, on an excursion.
Yes, but...
Don't worry, you're not the only suspects in the murder.
I'd like to thoroughly question
all the people who slept here tonight, one by one.
We'll start with Mr. Raito Adachi, eh?
Yes, look, this is the name I use to...
Stop it!
Why are you treating us like criminals if you haven't found a single piece of evidence?!
I think there's a misunderstanding,
I didn't say that you are criminals.
Calm down.
Calm down, Fuga.
I will not say absolutely nothing to anyone
until they find some proof, or until the murder weapon is found!
As you wish, but think that this attitude won't help you at all...
make a favorable impression on the police.
(Inspector) A knife with a saw, a knife,
a small axe and two kitchen knives.
(Inspector) Ah!
Mr. Agasa!
Can you explain to me why on earth you carry so many knives on you
to go hiking?
I have already told you!
I wanted to take the children to sleep at the campsite.
Let's see, you two say you are unarmed, right?
Yes.
You could see that earlier, when you searched us.
What else?
In this house there are 3 kitchen knives, a hoe,
a scythe, an axe and a pair of scissors.
You don't have any other weapons in storage?
-There's also my grandson's toolbox, which is the shed outside.
They must all be rusty by now.
It's... it's a lie!
What's that?
What are you saying, boy?
I saw something tonight.
I went to the bathroom
"And, returning to the room, I heard a very strange noise."
(Chist, Chist)
As the noise came from the kitchen,
I peeked through the crack in the door...
And I... I... I saw this woman... This one!
She's... she's... sharpening a kitchen knife!
"She was all disheveled...
"And she was sharpening a knife with a red handle!"
"She looked like a demon!"
But I've seen her with my own eyes, sir!
Maybe you thought you'd seen the mountain witch
and you got confused, boy.
You mean this knife you say you saw was the real thing?
"On the blade is an inscription that looks like a name. Shota?"
Last night, the water came up to here, where there is this mark.
How come the level has dropped so low?
"I got it! That's why I needed the hammer!"
Don't miss the next episode:
