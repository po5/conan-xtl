The water that flows has no form.
The wind that blows is not seen.
Cases, deductions, mean freedom.
The truth always comes out in the end.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is detective Conan!
I can not stop my love for you!

Everyone is worried about you.
They say that skipping school because of a fever
is because you have some sentimental problem.
Oh.
It's just a cold.
Wow!
These fever-rimmed eyes are super sexy, Ran.
I wish Shinichi could see them.
Huh?
Well, I'll start passing.
Take a rest, huh?
Huh?
You're leaving already?
It's just that... I'm afraid to be alone.
It's like someone's watching me.
Eeeeh?
You mean someone's spying on you?
What's that?
No..., it's not that.
Well, what is it?
Don't laugh, eh? Do you want to tell me or not?
Well, it's that... What is it?
I'd say it's the Cushion Boy.
Eeeeeeeh?
Eh?
What did you hear?
I'm sure it's on the other side of the door..., the Cushion Boy.
(Thinking) "Eh? On the other side of the door? Me?"
That's strange.
There was no one there, Ran.
But you felt someone coughing, right?
Yes.
So... what now?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Don't worry.
The Cushion Boy is just a little boy.
He won't do anything to us.
THE TRUTH OF THE HAUNTED BUILDING, (PART ONE)
(Kogoro) Ha-ha-ha!
The Cushion Boy?
If it's just a legend, dona.
Don't laugh.
By the way, doctor: how is Ran?
Well, her cold is completely cured.
She's in good health.
If she runs into a ghost, the ghost will be the one who'll come out of it.
By the way... where are the grandmother and the maid she had?
Ah, the grandmother and the maid.
They've already left for Aomori.
That's right.
Last time she already told us that she was being sent to a clinic in Aomori.
So, they're also going...
Yes.
I have to stay here for a few days...
to send patients to another clinic.
The management asked me to do so, and I couldn't say no.
Besides, I also have to testify in the trial...
for the murder that took place here a few years ago.
I have to confirm Inspector Mouri's deductions, right?
"It seems to me that Dr. Araide sensed my deductions,
"And he figured it all out."
He's very brave, to stay alone in this big house.
You're not afraid?
What?
Afraid of what?
Well... ah... Ah!
That some spirit will come out.
Are we there yet?
It's impossible for ghosts to appear,
at a time when science has advanced so much.
(Man) Of course they appear!
The only thing is that the poor in spirit...
don't see them.
In the building where I live, they appear every now and then.
Mr. Otonashi.
You're here again?
Didn't I tell you not to come here anymore?
Do you have a problem?
Mm.
There's no need to get uptight, now.
I've been coming to this clinic all my life and I'm not going to change.
Who is he, this old man?
Ah.
Well, it's... Mr. Otonashi, a former patient of mine.
There's no way he's going to the other clinic.
Listen, Mr. Otonashi, is what you just told us true?
That there are ghosts where you live.
Escort, Conan, enough.
Of course, of course.
You want to come see him, boy?
People who haven't made their peace with the world can't die at all
and are left wandering around here...
Where I live, there's the ghost of a girl.
(Kogoro) I thought she was taking us to a proper place,
and not to such a ramshackle building.
But, look, there's a nice park in front of here.
It's a very quiet place.
It is in this park that they found the body of that poor girl.
She was as black as coal, burnt to a crisp.
Is there... charred?
Besides, the owner of the construction site next door went bankrupt and committed suicide,

and since then the building has remained half-finished.
Before... there was a cemetery.
A... cemetery?
Let's go in, I'll finish explaining.
"Wow! It's an ideal place for ghosts to appear."
Father.
Hey, why don't we leave?
(We won't get anything good out of a place like this.
What a drag.
If you want, take a cab and go back by yourself.
If I go back home alone, I'll be even more afraid!
And Conan is so animated with the ghosts,
I doubt he'll want to go with me.
(Boy) Ooh.
That's weird!
I thought the ghost boom was over here.
I didn't expect to see any more onlookers.
Looks like we're in for a real treat tonight.
A... first-rate?
Sure, we'll have a great time.
They say they come out... when it's crowded, right?
(sinister laughter)
- (door closes) -Who is this?
"In Banchs. He lives on floor number 4."
He works in a model store.
He has a floor full of creepy dolls.
Father, please, marxem.
Eh?
What if a ghost appears?
(Someone flushes the toilet) Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
(Boy) Well better, woman.
It will be more fun.
It's been days that we are too quiet.
Let's see if suuuuuurt.
And who is this?
In Yotsuya.
He's at 2. He spends all day filming.
He has an apartment full of films that he shoots himself.
With his college buddies,
he made a scary eight-millimeter film
set in this building.
He never let me see it.
- (boy) It's not worth watching.
-Mm?
To make a movie about ghosts that don't exist
is the height of stupidity.
It's a capbuit.
Eh?
You're the one on floor number 1, aren't you?
I went upstairs because the toilet downstairs was occupied.
If that's why the ghosts want to be here, I don't care,
but don't make too much noise.
I have to have a job finished by tomorrow.
What about this one?
It's in Hotan.
He's a doctoral student at the university.
He's the only one of us who live here who hasn't seen ghosts.
Those of us who, despite having seen them, don't move out of the building,
we are Banchi, Yotsuya... and myself,
I'm up here, in number 5.
(Kogoro) Ooh...
So, the 8 tenants that were there,
half of them have left because of the ghosts?
(Kogoro) That's right.
(Kogoro) That's right.
It all started when I saw a glowing soul
in the building next door.
At first...
"No neighbor believed me,
"But then... the toilet water turned red,
"We began to see disturbing apparitions in the window...
"And when we were dozing,
"A spooky ghost would come out on the TV."
All kinds of strange things started happening.
Even the television and newspapers came on.
Aaaaah...
How come you don't move house, Mr. Otonashi?
Ha-ha-ha!
When you get to my age, there's nothing to be afraid of.
And I don't feel like leaving this apartment,
which is where I've lived all my life.
Well, make yourselves comfortable.
Ghosts don't come out until it gets dark.
Aaaah, well, I'm leaving.
Eeeh? Why does he miss you?
Hey, hey.
You in a hurry?
Come on, it'll be fun, woman.
Ah.
What a remedy...!
But only until 7, eh?!
(Woman: sinister voice) "Run away now mateeeeeix."
"Run away from here!"
"March! Marxaaaaa!"
"March away from here!"
(Eixorator shout)
Father!
Stop!
Father!
Father!
What is it, Ran? Did you see anything?
Yes... U... u... a horrible girl on TV!
Mm?
But you can't see anything.
Eh?
It can't be.
You mean you weren't dreaming, daughter?
No.
I assure you I wasn't.
Hey, hey.
Have you seen what time it is?
Did we all fall asleep at the same time?
Well..., I'm going to make a river.
Please wake up the old man and tell him we're leaving.
Oh, uh... All right, then.
Casum la olla.
What nonsense, that ghost stuff.
They've wasted our time.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What a mess of a toilet!
It smells bad and you can't see it!
It's full of butterflies!
La Ran is right: we'd better touch the two as soon as possible.
Eh... Father.
Can you... come?
Mr. Otonashi won't wake up.
Just a moment.
I'll be right back.
(Pulls the chain)
Mm?
Aaaaaaaaaah!
What's the matter?
B-blood.
It's blood!

The toilet bowl was full of blood!
What are you saying?
May I know what's going on?
What is it, so much noise?
The a... the a... the toilet water was blood.
Eh?
That's how the ghost appeared.
Really? What nonsense.
-What nonsense.
Someone must have dyed the water red to scare us.
Well, no.
You mean you have not pissed blood?
What s'empatolla ?!
It was when I knocked down the chain.
And well red, it was!
"A ghost that appears on TV when we were asleep..."
"Toilet water that turns red..."
"The only thing left to see is the ghost in the window."
Oh.
Mi-te!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Mite'ls.
Mite'ls!
Aaah... aaah...
What's the matter...?
May I know what this is?
Can't you see, girl?
The ghost is already here.
(laughs)
It's the ghost of the girl who was killed in the park... here in front.
Eeeeh?
Eh? (laughs) Huh?
She's... disappeared.
Of course she is.
Right. Right. Right.
He's a ghost for a reason.
Maybe he's come into this apartment and everything.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Eeeh?
It's going.
It can't be a ghost.
I'm sure it's someone who's climbed up the balcony
and got behind the window.
Au, get out of here, I'll check.
Wait a minute, here...
Eh?
Uaaaaaaaaaah!
It is impossible to climb.
There is no railing or balcony at this window.
A... it looks like that, doesn't it?
Besides, it wasn't just a shadow.
The winch was moving...
y... before you opened the window it had started to disappear.
It was like...
(Otonashi) It was like a body turning to ash, wasn't it?
(Otonashi) Huh?
Mr. Otonashi.
I've already seen it several times, that.
Now, that it's normal for it to turn into ashes:
I'm sure it's the... that remains
of that girl who burned to death 4 years ago, the Rui Tabuchi.
The Rui Tabuchi?
They will know who she was thanks to the remains of the driver's license.
They said the teeth... they also matched.
Surely, as they haven't been caught, the two who did it..,
they won't be able to die in peace.
The two who did it?
But... There are witnesses?
Yes.
According to the police report,
someone passing through the park saw them:
2 men staring impassively at each other as a body burned.
Look: on that electric pole down there is the sign.
It is the sketch of one of the 2 killers.
It's a guy with a very big scar on his cheek.
The other one was in the dark and they didn't see his face.
Now, before there was this murder,
the only one who lived in this building was Mr. Otonashi.
Oooh.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What, what's wrong?
Did you see her again?
You... you've got a... something up your sleeve.
Huh?
Ooh!
Ah.
It's a butterfly.
There's lots of them around here.
Must have come in through the window.
They're called by the light from the street lamps in the park where the murder happened,
and since it's right across the street, sometimes they come into the building.
Casum la olla!
No need to make such a fuss, for a butterfly.
Don't you see that we shoulder the phantasmagoric atmosphere!
Well, I liked the scream you made.
Be that as it may, don't make any more noise, please.
The apparition we saw in the window
was surely the reflection of one of us in the glass.
What fools!
Shrike.
It was a real apparition.
And so it was.
I have already told you that we would not get anything good out of a place like this.
Come on, Father, let's go.
Hey, Conan.
Don't you just love it.
Hey, Conan!
What are you doing?!
Hey, Kogoro:
when you flushed the toilet, was the cup really full of blood?
Whether it was blood or not, it sure was a red liquid.
Come to think of it,
maybe the water was dirty because of the yolk in the pipe.
Mm?
(sniffs)
That's strange.
It used to have a stench that would knock you flat on your back.
It must have been ventilated.
The door's been left wide open.
Maybe it is.
Mm?
This smell... it's alcohol.
Conan.
Will you do me a favor?
It's just that I want to know everything
so I can explain it at school, this ghost story...
that almost made the famous detective Kogoro Mouri fall on his ass.
(grunting)
Hey, Ran.
We're not leaving, though.
(groaning) Eh?
Why not?
Because there can't possibly be ghosts.
They're illusions.
Illusions.
The apparition we saw

was the figure of someone reflected in the window.
The blood in the toilet was yolk.
We have let ourselves be influenced too much by this gloomy atmosphere.
The girl I saw on TV too?
She came out of the screen.
It was a girl who was burning and screaming:
"Run away right now. Run away from here. Run away right now."
It was also an illusion.
Let's see...
At that time there was no program where an image like that could be shown.
But...
But there are other possibilities.
For example, that someone who lives in the building has put a video...
to make us believe there are ghosts.
-You mean me?
I'd say that's impossible.
I've looked at it, and there was no tape in the video at the time.
There's one thing that's even stranger to me, though:
how come we've all fallen asleep?
I'm sure it was a spell.
W... but what are you saying?
It's impossible.
(Thinking) "No one can climb on this railing."
"The building is surrounded by a very high fence,
"And on the other side there's a building under construction."
Conan.
What are you looking at?
Can't you see more butterflies coming in?
Ah, I was looking where it should be...
the shining soul that Mr. Otonashi told us about earlier.
Aah.
Right in the middle of that building, surrounded by darkness.
It was a reddish light, very weak...
From time to time it would turn a little bluish.
"What could it be?"
"The ghost that was on TV, I've got it."
"The red water in the toilet, too."
"Both of these things have a scientific explanation."
"But the appearance of the window and the glowing soul in front..."
"I don't know how to explain it."
"How did you do it, the responsible one?"
"Indeed, there is, of responsible?"
"And if there is, who is and why does he do it?"
And so much, I have seen them !, the red one AND the blue one.
Upstairs, in the room of a colleague.
If I turn off the light...
I only believe in things that have a scientific explanation.
(Kogoro's voice) Come on, we'll clear up the secret...
the strange phenomena that occur in this building!
And the next Conan:
"The truth of the haunted building, (part two)".
