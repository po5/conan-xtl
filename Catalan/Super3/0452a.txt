A giant wall blocks our way.
If we look at it with different eyes, it will be like a giant door!
As we wait impatiently for the play to begin,
the commotion of a ghost rises on Konpira's stage.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he is Detective Conan!
Atarashii no Sekai no makuake wa itsumo yake ni
Okubo de saisho no Ippo ga fumidasenai!
Saa, te wo nobasou...

Ah!
How wonderful!
How nice, that we can relax.
Ah... I'm so thirsty.
I could drink a beer right now!
Father, it's always the same!
Can't you see we've come expressly to Shikoku?
Here it's not the drink, it's the food!
(At the same time) Sanuki noodles!
I know, girls, but at least let me soak my throat a little.
Do what you want, but then I don't want to feel you mumbling...
because you fell asleep during the play.
On top of that, my dearest Tamanosuke has invited us,
we won't make him the ugly one!
I know we won't.
The Kanamaru-za theater,
where Tamanosuke and his people will perform the play,
is a very famous "kabuki" theater, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
A lot of people come from all over the country
to see "The Konpira Shikoku Kabuki Grand Kabuki Play"
that they stage every spring.
Oh!
Look at it!
Look at it!
Yes, it's amazing!
(Sonoko) I can't wait to see it!
THE GHOST OF KONPIRA
(Kogoro) This is the noodle restaurant that was recommended to you?
It's a private house like any other!
(Woman) Welcome!
(Woman) Oh!
This is wonderful!
A snack for the beer!
Father, these are side dishes for the noodles.
-Sorry to keep you waiting. Fantastic, we've got it here!
I'll leave the noodles here, take as many as you like.
Yes.
Mm!
They're so good!
Mm!
They have consistency, but they're very soft!
And what a homemade taste!
Yes, sir!
They go through the eyes, so good they are!
That's it, so I'll make a decision. A decision?
Yes, I mean over there, do you see?
(At the same time) "Duel of Sanuki noodles. Eat and walk at full pace"?
Au, here, use these sticks.
Come back when you come down later.
Thank you very much! Thank you very much, madam.
And why do we want the canes?
We're not grandparents.
(gasps)
But what the hell?
How many steps are there here?
Let's see, up to the top, where the main temple is, there are 785 steps in total,
there are 785 steps in total.
-What?
700...?... 85?
This is already done, and so much so.
We should have been told
that there was such a practical service from the beginning!
What?
Where is the father? He's over there.
Aaah!
Delicious!
The sake of this land is incomparable!
Father?
How do you plan to get to the temple?
Sorry, enjoy the visit to my health!
What?
For starters, the Kanamaru-za theater is right over there, right?
I'll wait here to unload.
Madam, another round!
(thinks) "What happened to the noodle duel?"
I've finally arrived.
It's not fair that they only carry you in a basket halfway.
Sonoko, you took so long!
If you were so lazy,
you could have stayed downstairs and rested with Father.
Hey, beautiful!
Don't compare me to your father!
Well, it looks like Konpira has a god protector of the sea.
That's true.
People who work at sea have a special devotion to this temple.
It's almost time.
Shall we go to the Kanamaru-za theater?
I was looking forward to it!
Things must be going well in my dear Tamanosuke?
Yes, and there is also the Renge.
Esclar, this is the problem.
Will that pair still be as much in love as last time?
"But my target will always be beloved Tamanosuke."
Sonoko, please!
"Everyone's pretty upset, here."
(Boy) Welcome.
(Girl) We appreciate you coming from so far away.
My goodness, this is hopeless.

Just look at them.
They are in love.
(Girl) Conan!
Hello, Megumi!
How are you?
Mm?
What's wrong?
You're not coming today with that group of kids.
Oh, the group?
They had things to do and couldn't come.
That's great!
I'm so happy!
Megumi, what's wrong with you?
Mi-te him!
This stru√ßot with glasses sweeps the girls away.
"Bad witch!"
Conan...
Come in, come in.
It's a crestfallen door, go alert not to sting in the head.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
A crestfallen door?
But what's this?
Uh!
That's too bad! Father!
Mr. Mouri, are you all right?
"He-he-he. I knew you would."
We're in the middle of preparations for the performance,
so we've got it all messed up.
Oh!
It's beautiful! Blow!
Right at this very moment, on stage...
we're checking that the trap door is working properly.
(Sonoko) The trap door?
(Renge) Yes.
It goes all the way up thanks to the efforts of some people.
(Tamanosuke) The actor comes out from that point and makes his presentation.
(Sonoko) The stage is moving!
(Renge) This is a moving stage.
As with the trap door,
some people push the structure under the stage to move it.
(Tamanosuke) As it was traditionally done.
From the section underneath, it is called a pit.
In the old days, the water drainage was not good,
those who worked behind the scenes had a hard time.
That's the flower path over there!
The actors come out of the bird house in the back,
they go through the whole courtyard of the audience
and onto the stage on the other side.
(Tamanosuke) In the middle of the path is the "supposed" or turtle trapdoor.
Just like the trap door from before,
it has a system that allows you to go up or down the path.
And then, just above the path of flowers,
there is this kind of crane that is called a "kakesuji".
It allows an actor to be suspended in the air.
It's amazing.
The ceiling is made of crossed bamboo branches,
we can represent the storms of cherry blossoms
throwing the petals from up there.
(Sonoko) It's amazing!
It's as if we have jumped back 100 years!
(Sonoko) Of course! But not 100 years, as you say.
In fact, this Kanamaru-za theater was built...
with the approval of the shogunate government in the Tenpo era..,
shortly before the defeat of the Tokugawa...
and is now the oldest kabuki theater in all of Japan.
For an actor to be able to perform in this theater is divine providence.
(Sonoko) And on top of that, you're in love, don't smoke.
Ahem... Sonoko.
Ah, I heard...
that today you're performing a samurai story
based on that phantom of the opera.
Yes.
On the magnificent stage of this kabuki theater,
a terrifying play of love and hate will unfold.
With a mysterious ghost who hides his emaciated and horrifying face behind a mask
behind a mask,
a beautiful princess of song and, last but not least, her lover...
And it won't be the one from the opera... but "Konpira's ghost"!
(Men) You are under arrest!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
(Men) Stop it!
You're stopped!
(Boy) Dear maiden, sing!
Sing for me, I profess you my love!
Sing for me, the angel of music!
Sing!
You must sing!
Oh, immaculate angel!
Splendorous angel!
Take my soul up in heaven!
You don't have to sing!
You have to react!
This is a demon!
A vengeful spirit!
Oh!
What a shock!
Excuse me, who is that man?
It's Tatsuhiko Rausu,
the person who's supporting the play we're going to perform.
(Think) "He's the sponsor?"
Rausu?
(Kogoro) From the Rausu Concern of Kansai?
I could have sworn I read it in the newspaper.
The president of the company died and they've chosen his son,
a boy too young, to be the head of the company.
Hello!
Oh, no!
What can I do?
It's so hasty...
I'm Sonoko Suzuki, nice to meet you!
-Renge, cheer up with the play. -Thank you!
Renge?
Eh?
I'll always be there to support you!
Thank you very much.
But in this play, I only play a small role.
Nothing important.

But the more I think about it, the more I realize that you should be the heroine....
and play the princess of the song.
-I'll make the changes right away and....- Mr. Rausu!
The only one who can make this decision is me!
the director of the company!
And not you, the sponsor.
And the ghost doesn't decide either, perhaps?
Exactly, sir.
"The ghost?"
So, you don't plan to follow his demands.
Of course not!
Well, I just wanted to see my childhood friend...
in a moment of glory, but well...
"Demands Change the heroine? Childhood friend. And the ghost..."
"This looks like... 'The Phantom of the Opera',
"Also called 'The Phantom of the Opera'.
"No, it's a close match."
(Think) "It's a childhood friend of the Renge? This means..."
...and openly express how you feel, Tamanosuke.
I mean how you feel about Renge, of course.
Because you like her, right?
Ra... Rausu!
Hey, if you're going at a snail's pace, I'll take her...
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
A love triangle? Sonoko!
(Girl) Director, if you want to change the main character,
I have no objection.
But what are you saying?
Stop joking, please!
Why do you think I wanted you to come with us?
That you don't realize?
That's right!
I've always been a big fan of yours!
The simple fact of stepping on the same stage as you makes me happy!
Thank you.
Oh!
How beautiful!
I think I've seen it somewhere.
It's Romi Karube.
She's a young actress who works in the theater.
My brother asked her insistently
for her to play the heroine.
When we thought she would give us a flat "no", she suddenly agreed.
Please excuse my rudeness.
Cheer up with the play.
Gee, it looks like... she hates me now.
Oops... I beg your pardon.
It's dark in here and I'm tripping over everything.
Someone put special light marks for the sponsor.
Marks? Maybe that's it.
That's some nasty tape.
It's a piece of phosphorescent tape.
See that?
There's another one.
You're a very clever boy.
In fact, they put these luminous marks...
so that the actors don't make mistakes
when it comes to taking their position on the stage.
Be that as it may, you've got nothing to do, girl.
They are too close together.
No problem!
It's perfect!
Because I found another menu.
Another menu?
(Think) "Mmmm.... We're finally starting rehearsals?"
"They're taking it all in their stride..."
"But it's so much, the only thing I'm interested in is my role."
It's so attractive!
Get out of the way!
Don't let them work!
Oh, excuse me.
Who let them in?!
You can't let anyone from the public in!
What a caveman! Sonoko!
Mr. Nabe, I'm sorry I didn't introduce you earlier.
This is Detective Kogoro Mouri.
-Detective...? - Kogoro Mouri.
The famous detective?
Yes, I'm Kogoro Mouri, the famous detective!
This is Ran, his daughter.
Pleased to meet you!
And then...
The boy I like so much, Conan Edogawa!
Eh..., hello!
And then...
I'm Sonoko Suzuki!
Nice to meet you!
I don't care who the hell you are.
I just want you to let us work in peace!
The old director was stricter about these things.
The father was the father and I am me.
But if he hadn't given me this job...
it would have been impossible for me to pay my debts.
Director, I am really grateful to you.
Guys, let's start!
(Guys) Yes!
(Nabe) And don't get in the way during rehearsal.
Au, let's start!
Renge, can you go to my dressing room and bring me the mouth elixir?
Yes.
Conan, you guys go to the audience patio.
Mm?
(Tamanosuke) Alert!
(Tamanosuke) Romi!
Did you hurt yourself?
Romi!
(Romi!
-What happened? -(Tamanosuke) Please!
(Renge) An ambulance!
Somebody call for an ambulance! -It's not necessary, Director...
Don't exaggerate.
It's nothing serious either.
Romi...
(Romi) It's just a scratch.
But this stage is famous
to have close contact with the public, I'll wear more makeup.
(Romi) Shit!
Let's not fuck around.
Who did this?
Who has done this animal?
Get out of the way right now.
If we don't get this structure repaired,
we won't have it in time for the play!
What a nasty man!
I'm sure he did it!

Sonoko!
-Come, we have to cure your wound. Romi, let's go backstage.
For the marks there,
it looks like that rope was cut with a knife.
Did the ghost do it?
-Don't be ridiculous!
That's just a bad joke!
So, how do you plan to explain this?
We'll be forced to change the heroine of the play.
-I won't allow it! -Huh?
The time has come to take up arms.
We can't let that ghost tell us what to do.
Oi, director?
Excuse me, I don't quite know what he's talking about.
Who is this ghost?
It's Konpira's ghost!
Well, it so happens that...
But the "Konpira's ghost" thing
was the title of this play, wasn't it?
Yes, that's why...
I got it!
It was the crystal chandelier!
"Just the wood!"
The crystal chandelier? Yes, Father.
In "The Phantom of the Opera", the play on which this play is based,
"A crystal chandelier falls
"on top of the actress who was to play the heroine."
"And that's not all."
The relationship that exists between one and the other is very similar to the approach of the characters in "A Crystal Spider".
to the approach of the characters in "The Phantom of the Opera"!
Now that you mention it, in Tamanosuke said....
Who would not accept the ghost's demands.
This is also identical!
In the play "The Phantom of the Opera"...
the ghost also demands that the heroine of the play be changed.
I would like to know what that means.
It seems to me that everyone is hiding something from us.
-I'll give you that.
Detective, you live up to your reputation.
Tamanosuke, at this point,
perhaps we'd better tell Detective Mouri everything.
Very well, then.
All right, then.
"At first, I thought it would be a prank by an unconscious person."
Oh!
(They call)
"He wasn't doing anything special either."
"He was just showing up with the intention of scaring people."
But then he sent us these 10 letters.
In all of them, he puts the same one.
What the hell is this gibberish?
"Win a large audience and they will put you to a heroic death."
"Konpira's ghost."
This "Win over a large audience" makes sense.
After all, we're talking about a play.
And that "t'apunyalaran in a heroic death."
also seems to be taken from a play.
Isn't it a coded message from those who play by pulling out letters?
-Noiet, you have very good eyesight.
"I'm worried it's too easy to understand."
Pulling out letters?
Sure, the "healthy" ones!
If we take these syllables out of this text,
you'll be able to read something!
Let's see...
If you look at the whole text in hiragana, it will be easier to understand.
This is the way to take out the "sano" syllables.
If we do it...
(Sonoko) It's amazing!
"Change the heroine... for the Renge"!
This is... a threat like a country house!
But if we obey without discussing what it demands of us,
we won't be able to perform our play!
That's right.
But if we don't pay any attention, things like the ones before can happen.
"This means it's not an innocent threat?"
"In this case, I highly doubt it will end here."
Director.
-I'll play it, anyway. -If you want to, fine.
If I left the play because of an incident like this,
I wouldn't be a real actress.
But please!
Mr. Mouri, does all this make sense to you?
Mmmm...
It seems that the threat shows no direct relation
with the fact that the structure of the lamps has fallen.
And we still need to investigate further
to determine if the signs on the rope are caused by a knife.
(He thinks) "That's true."
"Even if the police were to get going at this point,
"At this point, with respect to the work,
"They would have no choice but to leave the final decision to the director."
It's already decided!
The cast will continue as before.
I want you to give your best
at today's premiere and at tomorrow's premiere with the general public.
Dear maiden, come!
Sing and have faith in me!
Those who believe in me must not die!
Who are you?
I beg you to wait for me!
What are you?
Are you a god?
Or are you a devil?
That being is a devil!
I will punish you as you deserve!
Inhabitant of the world of darkness, world where the light does not remain.

You insolent and reckless young man!
To curse you tea is my desire!
If you look to snatch away my love, my victory,
I will show you the power of the world of darkness so that you will never forget it!
How exciting!
I knew it.
I'm sure the father has been drinking after coming to see.
"What was that girl looking at earlier?"
"This is..."
Ran, what's that?
(People: call)
(Man) Look, what's that?
Who's touching his nose?
What's wrong with him?
Are you not feeling well?
What's wrong with the voice?
"This is..."
-It's like it's...-...a frog.
What's happening
The same thing is happening!
It's like "The Phantom of the Opera"!
Don't smoke!
Damn, where did it go?
The curtain!
Unload the curtain!
Romi, come back on stage!
What happened?
What happened?
"This is the only way to get to him."
"But with all the audience in the theater,
"It seems that no one has seen that ghost pass this way."
"How did he do it to himself?"
"What's that?"
Brat, what the hell are you doing?
I just... I thought it would be fun to come up here.
This is not an amusement park!
Only authorized personnel are allowed up here!
Excuse me, please!
(Girl) Has someone changed Romi's mouthwash for something else?
Although it seemed that this was not her usual mouth elixir,
the curtain was going to rise at any moment.
and she drank it anyway.
It's awful!
Who could have done it?
-Are you serious? -Now that's the least of it.
The question is what we'll do with this play.
You played Romi's prompter, didn't you?
I'm sure you know the part by heart.
But I can't do it!
We don't have time to argue now.
The audience is waiting!
B-but... but...
Now we have the curtain down.
We'll raise it in 15 minutes.
Hurry up!
The ghost?
You mean the one in the play, don't you?
It seems that all the rest of the audience believes it too.
What about Conan?
"The bird house? This is like a maze..."
(Man) Fear not, maiden of my heart.
Who's there?
"I've had enough. What is this place?"
I don't know if I can play it, the role Romi had to play.
(Man) Don't worry.
"The ghost?"
(Man) I..., the angel of music, I'm next to you.
"There is no one. What was that?"
(Renge) When I met that being,
my heart was filled with joy.
But he is an inhabitant of darkness.
He is the being who made me a prisoner of darkness.
(Boy) Let's stop talking about the world of darkness.
I will lead you to the world of light.
I will always... be with you wherever you go.
Conan, where did you go? In the washroom.
Swear to me, I beg you.
Tell him I'm the only one you love.
I swear.
You're the only one I love.
You can't back out now.
Finally, I've led you here!
To this subway prison
where everything remains closed, where everything is annihilated by darkness!
I am not afraid of who you are or what you are like!
What frightens me is that deformed heart of yours!
The Renge is fantastic!
She is so good that she doesn't look like an understudy!
(Man) The premiere was a great success.
(Man) And that understudy actress is really splendid!
I can't wait to see the performance tomorrow!
This place is disgusting as hell.
What is the meaning of this?
Se... Mr. Nabe!
Don't move!
Don't move from where you are!
Yes and... Wrong!
It's not true!
I have not done anything!
It wasn't me!
