"The friends of the Junior Detective League
have taken advantage of the vacations to go to Kyoto."
-I'm so excited!
-We're finally in Kyoto!
I'm so glad.
We're finally in Kyoto!
If we're not leaving until tomorrow, how did we get here today?
That's easy:
we arrived today so we could go and taste the typical Kyoto food.
That's right.
Especially the sweets.
And we'll drink sake under the cherry blossoms.
No, no way.
Get his head out of his head.
If we've come to Kyoto,
it's not to drink liquor or to gorge ourselves on sweets.
We came here to embark on a cruise
and experience sailing on the Aegis Hotaka.
And if you and the girls have accompanied us, it is to take care of us.
While we're at it, let's make the most of it.
We can do both.
-Yes!
-Right?
(Think: Shinichi's voice) "He-he! To each his own."
"Of love and crimes there are always: they are repeated every day."
"The day before the Aegis cruise, something very strange happens."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"
Take me to the high, We never cry on.

"The mystery of the disappearing candy."
(Female) "To prevent the dough from snagging,
"Kyoto bird molds are painted with rice bran oil..."
-You'll see, when you taste them.
-Oh, boy, do they look good!
You'll be amazed.
La Ran tasted the Kyoto birds at my house
and she liked them so much that now she wants to try the chocolate ones.
"So that's what she came for."
What?
No way!
What's wrong with you, Ran?
I don't believe it!
No more chocolate birds!
Geez, Ran, it's no big deal.
You scared the hell out of me!
What are you talking about!
We came to Kyoto specifically to shop!
Isn't that the only store that carries chocolate birds?
No, you can go to the stores in Arashiyama, Shiokoji Street,
Shinkyogoku or Shirakawa.
What?
Are you serious?
The chocolate birds have disappeared?
The chocolate birds?
What do you mean, they've disappeared?
Yes, that's right.
But how could this happen?
You don't know?
-We really don't know.
This morning the confectioners of Umehara Sweets
took all the boxes.
40 boxes of red beans,
40 boxes of match tea and 40 boxes of chocolate.
Perfect, thank you.
Shall we put them on the shelves?
Eh?
Wow!
What's happened?
Where are they, the chocolate birds?
(Man) Eh?
They're gone?
Strange, a moment ago the boxes were on the shelf.
(Man) So much so.
What a strange thing.
Take them out of the drawer, please, the customers are about to enter.
What's that?
No way!
The chocolate birds have disappeared!
-Who did it?
Where are they?
-Hey?
I don't understand anything.
Now the confectioners have gone to get
a few boxes from the other stores.
(Man) Hey, we have a problem.
At Shirakawa and at Shinkyogoku, the boxes are missing too.
-(Man) Hey?!
-Hey!
I'm sorry!
At Uzamasa, the boxes have also disappeared.
And at Shiokoji Street they don't have any either.
What... what do you mean?
That the chocolate birds have disappeared from all 5 stores?
Yes, all the boxes have disappeared.
"It's very strange, that."
What's wrong?
Why are you making that face?
Mr. Mouri!
Now is not the time to go shopping.
We have a problem.
The candy that was here is missing.
Listen, you're lucky I'm a great detective.
-You're a detective?

-This case has no difficulty.
That's right!
It's the famous detective Kogoro Mouri, known as....
-The Sleeping Kogoro?
-What?
Myself.
I'm detective Kogoro Mouri, at your service.
Please, Mr. Mouri, you have to give us a hand.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to drink sake under the cherry blossoms.
Mr. Mouri, please, you must help us.
Come on, please.
It's a very serious case.
It's a very serious case, you say?
One thing...
What's on the ceiling, isn't it a security camera?
The camera starts recording when we open the store at 10 o'clock, there's nothing else.
The shelf where the chocolate birds are supposed to be
is not in the images.
Ah, yes, it's right in the camera's blind spot.
Look, this is when we realized that the boxes were missing.
Then we started looking for them all over the store.
What's wrong with you, Conan?
Stop the picture!
The girl in the pink T-shirt at the top left.
Isn't she a little strange?
Isn't she a bit strange?
You mean because she went straight to the bird boxes?
But in such a short time, it's impossible for her to have stolen them.
And when she came in, the chocolate bird boxes were already gone.
That's not what I mean.
It's cooled off today, hasn't it?
But this girl dressed like it's still warm.
(Woman) Oh...
(Woman) You're right, it's true.
Bah!
And what does it have to do with how she's dressed?
(Man) Oh, no!
I didn't expect... to find you here.
What a surprise, Mr. Mouri.
Mm... Who is it?
Inspector Ayanokoji, Kyoto Prefecture.
Good morning to you, Inspector.
What are you doing here?
Ah, today's my day off, and I took my friend out for a walk.
Ah, you understand.
But squirrels must go for a walk?
Ah...
Well, if you carry him on your shoulder, he won't walk much.
He's just in time.
It's a robbery, a job for the police.
I'll leave it in your hands.
Eh?
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
But tomorrow we'll have again.
Even though it's not 12 o'clock and they're already finished?
How can it be, so early?
You don't know how excited I was
to try the chocolate birds from Kyoto.
But why don't you make more chocolate birds?
We can't make any more because we ran out of all the chocolate we had.
The problem is that the chocolate we use, we don't make it ourselves.
It is a selection of selected chocolates from abroad.
Unfortunately, the next batch won't arrive until tomorrow.
We won't be able to taste the chocolate birds until tomorrow.
Oh...
No, it must be today, it's very important.
It's important that it's today?
Why is it important?
Today is the anniversary of the former owner's death.
Oh.
We've put the chocolate birds on sale to pay tribute to him.
(Woman) I'm so sorry.
We're out of them.
They're sold out?
How can this be?
And the worst thing... is that our customers will no longer be able to taste them.
(Cries)
(Ayanokoji) Can you confirm it?
Okay, then.
Thank you for everything.
I've asked one of my colleagues to go to Uzamasa's store
and ask them a few questions.
Do they also sell Kyoto birds there?
Yes.
He was told that the chocolate birds have disappeared,
and that someone saw a suspicious car parked in front of the store.
A suspicious car?
Do they have the license plate number?
It was a small pink car, but they didn't write down the license plate.
The color of the car alone is not getting us anywhere.
-Mhm?
- (woman) Listen...
A while ago, I also saw a pink car.
-What?
-What?
-Yes, it was right there in front of you.
-That you saw it too?
We saw it while we were looking for the missing boxes.
You saw it too?
Yes, it was parked in front of the store.
That's funny.
Now we need someone to write down the license plate number.
And why don't you call the other stores?
Huh?
If the thief is the driver of the car,
it's possible that someone at the other stores noticed.
Well, you can send the police now, Inspector.
Hey, hey, don't look at me.
If you think we need more men, you can call the robbery division.
I'm having a party today and I'm not going to work.
You're not very helpful, you.
I can go to the store on Shiokoji Street.

If we are careless, the thief will escape.
Eh?
Yes.
All right, I'll go to Shinkyogoku.
And you go to Shirakawa's store, okay?
I'm going?
Inspector Ayanokoji, you stay here until you hear from us.
What?
Me too?
All right, listen.
Have the Ayumi go to the Ran, at Genta, with the Sonoko,
and on Mitsuhiko, keep it on Kogoro.
Try to get the license plate number,
even if it's in pieces, and when you get it, call me.
-All right.
-All right. -All right.
And I'll tie it up.
It was a small pink car.
Ah. (Chuckles)
Yeah, it was parked right in front of the store.
And you didn't notice the license plate?
No, I'm sorry, I didn't notice.
You don't remember anything?
Even if it's just a number?
No, I don't. I'm sorry.
I think it was a Shiromi license plate.
Ah.
Thank you very much, thank you very much.
(Male) Yes, yes I saw it.
It was a Shiromi number, and I'm sure it started with 11.
-You say it started with 11?
-I don't remember anymore.
I can't believe they've disappeared from all the stores.
What do you think happened?
It could be the curse of the late owner of the company.
Eh?
Hello, Conan, it's Mitsuhiko.
We haven't been able to get them out much,
they only remember that the license plate was an 8 and that it was towards the end.
An 8 that was towards the end.
Got it.
All right, then.
A small pink car, and we have most of the license plate.
I think we can find the owner now.
We've already located the owner of the pink car.
Eh?
Her name is Mako Kawasumi, she's 22 years old and lives in Osaka.
Do you know her at all?
-No, it doesn't ring a bell.
No.
I've never heard it before, this name.
Be that as it may,
the vehicle tracking system
is already tracking the car's position.
Eh? (Umehara) Got it.
(Umehara) Got it.
Conan, take one.
What a bar!
Yeah, come on, Sonoko bought them for us.
I love the match ones!
Don't you?
When I discovered this taste, I was hooked!
Yes, but the late owner of the company didn't like it at all.
Hm?
Eh?
At first, they only made the red bean birds,
but the current owner introduced the match tea flavored birds.
Ah, like the match tea ones were successful,
now they've started making chocolate ones.
That's right.
But the Shinkyogoku confectioners say that....
If the owner had seen the chocolate ones, he would have been scared to death.
This is what I have been told.
For this reason, what happened could be...
a curse!
Aaaaah!
Don't scare me like that!
Ah!
Eh?
(thump)
Oh!
I didn't think you were too scared of ghosts, Ran.
He-he-he-he!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Inspector Ayanokoji!
(Ayanokoji) Ah!
Officer Kurumazaki!
Well done.
We found the car with the tracking system.
The camera on Marutacho Street recorded it 10 minutes ago.
That's near Shirakawa's store.
Yes.
I have... a photo of the vehicle.
-That girl...
-Oh!
The one in the pink T-shirt.
Mitsuhiko, are you still at Shirakawa's store?
Yes, I'm still here.
Mr. Mouri is sitting on the floor drinking sake and won't leave.
Ah!
Ha-ha-ha!
Aaah!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ah... Did you feel it?
Hm!
He got drunk again!
Wait, Ran, where are you going?
To grab it by the neck and drag it over here!!!!
Poor thing.
Geez, you can get ready now.
(Ayumi) Miss.
What are you doing with that?
Ah, the box?
I want to change it, because it has a water stain on it.
"Ah, that box..."
And the worst thing... is that our customers won't be able to try it anymore.
Hey, hey, hey!
Can you show it to me?
This...
is the bird box you've taken from downstairs to put on top of everything.
This is the bird box from Kyoto
that he wants to change because it has a stain,
and these are red bean birds that were in the front.
This one is a little stained too, isn't it?
When they've glued the seal on, maybe it's moved a little bit.
But the seal on the one you have taken
to put it on top is perfect.
Conan, but what does this have to do with anything?
"Maybe I'm wrong."
"Maybe it's an unimportant detail."
Mr. Mouri!
Come on, we have to get back to Conan and the others, please!

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha !!!!
Leave me alone!
There is no hurry.
This case is a waste of time.
Oh, is it?
A waste of time, eh?
Eh?
That's right!
A total waste of time.
Ha-ha-ha!!!
You should be ashamed of yourself.
When you work, you don't drink.
Ah!
No, you don't!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Ran, it's not what you think!
- (knocking)
- (Kogoro) Please!
(Kogoro) Ah!
(Kogoro) Ah!
(Kogoro) Ah!
The cirereeeer flowers!!!!
(Mitsuhiko: thinks) "MHM? That girl."
-Mhm?
-Excuse me!
Didn't she go to the Umehara stores?
The stores where they sell Kyoto birds.
Why is that?
Why do you say so?!
So that the chocolate birds have disappeared from all the stores.
Aaah...
Mr. Mouri, Mr. Mouri!
Mr. Mouri...
Eh?
Where is he?
He hasn't come back, though?
Ah... No, but he told us he'd be right back.
How'd it go, the investigation?
Ah, that's just what he said when he called me.
There's something wrong with the seals on the boxes.
MHM?
Could it be that...?
Hey, you're right!
Yes, you're right!
But how did you know?
Ah... I know because he told me earlier in Kogoro.
There's no doubt: he's a great detective.
Ah...
Mr. Mouri.
Ah...
Aah... aah... aah... aah...
Are you all right, Mr. Mouri?
Ah!
He's drunk and I had no choice but to soften him up a bit.
Maybe a little.
Don't suffer, I haven't hurt him.
"He-he! Serves him right."
By the way, where did he go, Officer Kurumazaki?
Ah.
A while ago, in Kogoro asked him to do you a favor.
Ah.
Mr. Mouri, what did you ask, Agent Kurumazaki?
(Kogoro voice) First I want you to tell me if you checked what I told you:
the boxes of red bean birds from the other stores.
Yes.
I found traces of rice bran oil on the seals of the boxes.
Eh?
Bran oil?
In the bakery we use rice bran oil with non-stick agent.
What is it, a non-stick agent?
Ah... It's an oil that is used to paint the mold...
before pouring the dough, so it doesn't stick.
But why is there oil,
the seals on the red bean boxes?
At the beginning there was none.
It has been expressly put there.
Before sticking the seals on the boxes.
40 boxes of red beans,
40 boxes of match tea and 40 boxes of chocolate.
Perfect, thank you.
Shall we put them on the shelves?
Eh?
"First you put 10 boxes of each flavor on the shelves."
But, in fact, the last boxes were not chocolate.
With a cotton swab, they rubbed the seals with rice oil,
and then they took them off,
and stuck on a red bean seal.
To the 10 boxes.
The first column of red bean boxes
they put it in the bottom drawer.
And in its place they put the ones with the changed seal.
No chocolate birds were brought in today.
Neither in this store nor in any other of the company's stores.
What?
-What?
-What?!
Mr. Mouri!
Agent Kurumazaki.
That's just what Mr. Mouri said.
In the refrigerator of the Umehara Confectionery workshop I found
the chocolate to be used for the birds in today's shipment.
Eh?
In other words, no chocolate birds were made today.
The only ones who could cheat us... are the company's confectioners!
What a ?
(They cry)
Why did they do it?
The former owner couldn't stand the tea birds.
Imagine if he had seen the chocolate ones!
Don't say "just for that"!
Just because of that?
You can't understand.
We didn't want the chocolate birds to start selling
right on the day of the owner's tribute.
But we didn't want to cause so much trouble.
Excuse us, please.

Mr. Umehara, are you sure you don't want to report them?
The former owner left me the trade of these two confectioners as an inheritance.
I'm taking over.

And now, what will you do with the chocolate birds?
On the day of the tribute we will sell neither chocolate nor will I find you,
out of respect for the will of our confectioners.
A while ago I ate a match tea bird and it was very good.
I am glad.
Ui.
Where is it, in Mitsuhiko?
Hey, guys!
Wow, Mitsuhiko!
Where have you been?
I'm sorry.
Do you know what happened to me?
What happened to me?
Why?!
So that the chocolate birds have run out of all the stores.
Aah...
It's true!
I have also been told that they have no part!
I've already been to 3 stores.
I've been all over the city!
Why have they run out?!
Ha-ha!
This girl reminds me of Ran.
"At that time, we couldn't imagine what would happen to the Ran.
who slept exhausted by the day's emotions."
"The next day, aboard the Aegis,
the curtain would begin to open on a terrible case."
Anyway, where would he have gotten to, Kengo?
Okay, we can all go together.
Aaaah!
It can't be.
It's impossible.
But he wouldn't die.
Eh!
What do you mean, he wasn't supposed to die?
What do you know?
"Don't miss the next episode: 'A rose among the vineyards'."
