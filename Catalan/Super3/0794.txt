(Man: heavy breathing) -Oh!
(Man: heavy breathing) -Eh?
-Amagui s.
-Aaaah!
-Oh!
-Iah!
I made it!
You give up already?
Eh? (Laughs)
Oh, man!
It can't be.
-Ah...
- (man) We stopped.
-Very good job.
-That's too bad! -You didn't sterilize the room.
You didn't sterilize the room.
20 negative points.
You brought the package into the room by yourself.
30 negative points.
You confronted the deli without authorization.
20 negative points.
On top of that, he did not detect the other suspect, 20 more negative points.
As a result, the package died.
Maximum number of negative points.
It is not worth to make the total evaluation.
In other words..., he failed.
How many times do I have to tell you, Mr. Mouri?
Here, you are neither a police officer nor a detective.
The only responsibility you have is to protect the life of the package,
not to defend the law or justice.
-You are absolutely right.
I am ashamed.
-Is that clear to you?
Let him prove it to me again!
I ask you please.
Yes, good attitude.
- (thinks) "Oh, that's nice!"
-Everybody in place.
(Shinichi voice) "We solve mysteries with sharp deductions."
"Love and cases have the same origin."
"Suspicious things happen during the filming of a drama."
"It's been a little while, bodyguard Kogoro."
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

Tiene, ave, drink this.
It's a coffee.
Yes!
And listen, couldn't you do something?
Yes?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Kogoro) Are you sure it's no trouble for us to travel with your caravan?
I can't let the bodyguard travel in another vehicle.
Think I might get killed next time.
Do you understand?
- (explosion)
- (wheels: iii)
You know that I have moved heaven and earth to have you as my bodyguard,
because, in addition to protecting me,
I would like you to put into practice your great deductive skills...
to find out who wants to kill me.
Of course, of course!
Of course, you can count on me.
And to this end,
I have been thoroughly trained by the security company
that works for your agency.
But why did they have to come?
They must be thirsty, right?
I have made it for everyone.
It's the special vegetable juice from the Ryo Haneki.
Yes, thank you very much!
Thank you very much.
Shooting is always a drag, but I'll have some free time here.
And I'm glad I found someone to keep me company.
We're happy, too.
We'll get to see how they film, and what's more,
we get to travel with the great actress Ryo Haneki!
Yes!
Right, Conan?
Mm-hm!
Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.
You must be tired, after such a long trip.
Thank you all.
We're looking forward to spending a few days here, Mr. Muto.
Thank you, Mr. Muto.
I hope you can relax.
Well, for starters, I'm going to "sterilize" this building.
(Shinichi: thinks) "He-he! Mm?"
Go ahead, Mr. Mouri!
No need to suffer, Mr. Mouri, you're already "sterilized" inside.
Eh ?!
But... but what are you doing here?
Ah!
You've come too, Mr. Dobashi?
I felt that you had taken a few days off
and I thought you wanted to spend it with your family.
Because... you have a daughter, don't you?
Don't suffer, I have an excellent relationship with my daughter.
Gee, what a coincidence!
(Shinichi: thinks) "Eh?"
I have one too, from daughter.
Mr. Mouri, don't lose sight of the fact that you have your final exam today.
I hope you'll stay focused at all times.
(Kogoro: thinks) "Yes, of course.
(Kogoro: thinks) "He won't let me miss a single one, this one!"
Knowing that I have the two of you protecting me, I feel very reassured.
I feel like a princess.
Yes, but a princess who has been on leave for a long time.
Oh, woman...

Mr. Dobashi, why don't you take care of Queen Sawazaki?
I already feel safe enough with Mr. Mouri.
Ha-ha!
He-he-he-he!
Ah... Please, Father.
Thank you, because I have enough to do with Kusumoto.
But I'm not... I'm not a bodyguard!
I was joking.
Ha-ha-ha!
Queen Sawazaki has a reputation... for being troublesome.
Yeah, they say she fights a lot with the film crew.
Besides...
We're from the same agency and we're always at each other's throats.
And we have a bad reputation.
But maybe the problem is me, not her.
I don't get along with anyone on the crew, and no one likes me either.
I don't know why.
That happens a lot to us actresses.
Nobody understands us.
-What do you say now?
-Maybe they don't want me here.
No one would watch this series without you.
Oh, by the way, one thing:
is it true that they want to... canceled for lack of audience?
No, no, they are rumors, don't pay attention.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I'm very sorry.
If in the end she's out of a job... it'll be my fault.
He takes advantage of all of us.
She gets paid way more than she deserves.
In fact, she's not as good as she looks and she's not as dedicated.
- (woman) Aaaaah!
-Come on, Isogawa, take it easy, man!
It's the Queen!
What happened?
-But, it can't be!
- "Sterilized"?
I can see that!
-What?!
What happened?
-Nothing happened to him?
Oh..., here we are!
A... atxim!
A... atxim!
What's wrong with him?
Are you all right?
Atxim!
Maybe that's why.
It... I feel very bad.
There are a lot of cats here who don't have owners.
I'll go back to clean the room right away.
Kusumoto, I'm allergic to cats.
You know perfectly well that I can't have them around.
I'm sorry, Kusumoto.
She's allergic to cats.
I explained it to Mr. Mouri, but I don't know why he didn't...
No, it was my fault.
I should have let Mr. Mouri do the checkup.
I'm really sorry.
-Not really.
-What's this?
Nothing happened?
I'm not what they call a "package," or whatever,
and I've discovered that I don't have maximum protection like you.
A-a... atxim!
Cheers.
You're both very pretty.
Yes, they are.
It's normal.
(Shinichi: thinks) "Looking at them like that, you'd never say they can't stand each other."
"They are very good actresses."
-(man) "They're very good actresses.
- (man) And... we cut!
(man) Very good.
Didn't we have a plan left on this one?
-You're so disorganized.
-Yeah, sorry.
I hope it doesn't keep me up all night.
-You're right. -You're right.
-It's not good for your skin.
You've got to watch it, because you're getting more and more pouty.
Mm?
Ahem, ahem!
Come on, let's continue.
(Queen) Good night, get some rest!
Tomorrow, when we finish the breakfast sequence,
we'll be filming at the lake.
Thank you all!
(Flushing the toilet)
(Shinichi voice) Mm?
"Who should it be at this hour?"
"It's the room... of the Ryo!"
(Shinichi voice) -Huh?
-It's over.
-Kusumoto!
-What's this?
Hey, stop!
It won't do you any good to run away.
(Camera: Shoot)
I've already called the police.
Don't tell me... it's about the transfer.
Yes.
I like to come to the recordings.
I don't know why you had to ask to be transferred to the offices!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Is that why you followed him everywhere to kill her?
-Huh?
-No.
It was the first time.
What I mean is...
there's a lot more people who have it in for you.
-Mm!
-Ah!
No!
What's the matter?
Oh, ah... father!
Ah..., wow.
No, I..., it's just that...
-Yes!
-What little wind? -What little wind?
-It's a very nice breeze.
-It's nice here, huh?
You mean they shouldn't suspend this shooting?
After what Ryo said that everyone had a grudge against him...
That's why Kogoro and others are keeping a close eye on her, just in case.
(Man) And... we cut!
(Man) -Perfect!
-Very good.
We change sequence.
Get the boats ready.
The weather forecast called for fog today.
It will be harder to handle the oars, so be careful.
What do you mean by this?
What do you mean by this?
As you can see, the mountains around us have a peculiar shape,
and the wind, blowing up and down,
creates waves that make navigation difficult.

Well, how scary.
Mr. Dobashi, you have a call!
It must be the results of the investigation.
(Shinichi voice) "The investigation"?
Mr. Kushizaki, the two extras can now enter the water.
Understood.
Conan, Ran, you can enter the water now.
Let's go.
Okay, okay, okay.
Mm?
Oh, look!
What's this? What's this?
What's the matter?
Eh?!
What a fog!
- "I'm the Arimura. We can't row!"
Is everyone all right?
And we've lost sight of the Ryo and the Queen.
No, it can't be!
Mr. Mouri, confirm that the package is okay.
"But... I can't row either. And I can't see them right now."
Father!
Father, are you all right?
"Don't worry, I'll take care of the safety of the package."
Listen, I've just received some incredible results...
from the investigation into the package.
It's quite possible he made the whole thing up.
"Huh?"
The production company has been considering terminating the contract for days now.
She seems to have found out...
and made up the killer's story
to attract the attention of the media.
-And that's not the worst of it.
- "It can't be!"
Worst of all... she thinks the Queen knows about it too.
The Ryo wants to kill the Queen!
"What do you say, now! Are you sure?"
Wait, Conan!
I'll row!
Impossible, the boat doesn't respond!
No, nothing at all.
Conan, do you see anything, you?
What is that noise?
What is that noise?
(Engine)
What is it?
(Engine)
This noise...
It's useless, the wind is pushing us!
(Shinichi, thinks) "I know, I get it!"
Conan, what is that?
MHM!
MHM!
Oysters!
The wind is pushing the boat.
This is...
Two boats!
It's the Ryo's boat... and the recording crew's boat!
(Cats) Mine!
Meow!
Ryo!
(Cats) Where is it?
(Cats) Mine!
Queen...
Mm?
Luckily, she just fainted.
I hope the Ryo didn't...
-Mm?
- (sliding)
All the boats have come to stop here.
Wait here, don't move, it might be dangerous.
No way, I'm going with you.
--Don't come any closer, Mr. Mouri.
-Oh, Ryo!
-Don't move from here.
-It can't be.
I was thinking about it.
Huh?
Mm?
(Cats) Mine!
(Conan's voice) Iii...!
Iaaah!
(Conan's voice) Kogoro, have you done wrong?
(Conan) Father!
-Mr. Mouri!
-Ammagueu session both.
(Conan voice) -Where is she?
Where is the Queen?
-Who the hell is that?
Who the hell is that?
It can't be!
You mean it could be her?
She made it look like she'd fainted and when I left...
No, no, it can't be.
You're wrong.
I don't see that girl capable of going that far.
Besides, how could she know that all the boats would end up being pushed this way?
Eh?
Ah!
Yeah, right, now I get it!
Ryo, trust me, right?
Of course I do!
He's my bodyguard, right?
Ah...!
Very well then.
Run, hide behind that big tree over there!
(Shinichi: thinks) "No, no, Kogoro, you haven't sterilized the area!"
-Iaaah!
-What?!
What the...?
Iaaah!
Mr. Dobashi?
Be, very good, Kogoro!
Father, did you hurt yourself?
I finally figured it out.
You surveyed the area before.
The direction of the wind in case of fog, the movement of the waves...
or where we'd end up if the wind pushed the boats.
You sterilized the area, come on.
He got here long before everyone else
with a speedboat that he must have had ready
and that he knew wouldn't affect him... neither the wind nor the waves.
That noise... it was a speedboat, then?
And all this was done to kill the Ryo.
He wanted to make it look like the Ryo had attacked the Sawazaki Queen..,
that she had killed me, and that, in the end, she had committed suicide.
And he said... something about an investigation.
I'm sure he made it up.
He asked someone from his company
to call him at a certain time.
The content of the call was not important.
It won't cost me anything to check it out.
Well, if everyone is here!
We were lucky to reach the island, but the fog has disoriented us.
-Did something happen?
-And we thought we heard gunshots.
What are you going to do, Mr. Dobashi?

You will have a hard time keeping all these people from talking.
A little over a month ago...
my daughter went to do a casting for a drama series
and they didn't take her.
She was so depressed that the next day she tried to commit suicide.
That day, the person casting the actors was her.
At that very moment, as a father,
I decided to take revenge on behalf of my daughter.
Wait a minute.
I didn't choose anyone.
I was not feeling well that day
and I asked someone else to take my place.
-It was me.
-Who... who was it? -Who... who was it?
-I've had enough!
- (both) Hey?!
I fell trying to avoid a cat... and I'm unconscious!
My God, how itchy everything is, how awful!
Eh?
Did you reject her?
Yes, I mean... if you want to get rid of someone, it should be me.
Maybe it would be a mistake, you know.
Your daughter misses you very much, she'd like to see you more.
-The Queen knows that very well.
-She's gone to the hospital to visit her at the hospital.
She's been to the hospital to visit you for at least three days.
What?
Did you know that?
It's typical of you, doing these things.
But you had no idea about that, did you, Mr. Dobashi?
You say you have a good relationship with your daughter...
and you're killing?!
I wasn't doing it for her!
I just wanted to have a clear conscience!
Isn't it true that you did it to prove to yourself that you're a good father?
Maybe he's a good bodyguard, I don't deny it!
But as a father he's a nullity.
Well, I'm no one to judge him either.
Father...
The same could be said of you, Mr. Mouri.
-You used me as bait.
-Eh?
-Aaa... well, it's just that...
-A bodyguard of a nullity.
You're dismissed!
You can go home now.
Aaa... yes.
And thanks for everything.

What?
It says that the Ryo has retired and set up her own business.
And it looks like the Queen will be the first actress
with an exclusive contract to her agency.
Oh, see this?
Ah!
But, Father, didn't she tell you that she was sending you away?
I have decided to accumulate more experience
and become Yoko's personal bodyguard.
(Think) "How are you!"
(Shinichi: thinks) "He-he-he! It will never change."
(Girl) Aaaah!
(Shinichi, thinks) "He's in danger!"
(Conan voice) He's taken the Ayumi!
Where did you come from?
What's happened?
I'll catch up.
Stay here.

(Conan voice) Don't miss the next episode:
"The secret of the missing young wife".
