Oh!
Let's run! Wait!
Ran!
Hurry up!
Let's see if we catch him! Yes.
I'm coming!
Whew!
How nice!
I can finally sit down!
I'm so dead!
If it were up to you we would have bought everything.
Don't complain, you bought this branded bag.
I really liked it!
So you're happy, right?
Well, that's good, girl.
Now I can sleep for a while.
Wow, what a bar! When we arrived Wake me up.
The case of the disappearance of the mysterious grandfather...
(Alarm)
(Warning: female voice) North Station.
(Female voice) Oh!
Are you all right?
Ah... ah... What bad luck!
What bad luck!
Look at this.
I've nailed it to the panxa.
Oh!
Excuse me!
Mmm?
Wait a minute, aren't you Detective Mouri's daughter?
Aaah... Yes.
Y... And you?
My name is Shitara, Jukichi Shitara.
You haven't heard it, this last name, have you?
Shitara?
That's how it's spelled.
It's a very nice name.
My name is Ran Mouri.
It's very humid today, isn't it?
Yes.
With this rain...
It's spelled like this.
See?
Oh!
Wow, what a great character!
I actually wanted to go see your father, one of these days.
To take him on a case?
Yes.
I have to talk about a matter that can't be discussed over the phone.
Yes...
By the way, we haven't arrived at Muromachi Hospital yet?
The hospital stop?
Well...
It's the one that makes 4.
I'm even further away.
I'll let you know when we get there.
Don't suffer.
You're very kind.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Ran!
Ran!
Come on, wake up!
Sleepyhead!
We're coming.
What's up?
Ah... Yes...
I asked you to wake me up, and it was the other way around!
Wow!
And the Muromachi hospital?
Well, it's been a long time since we passed it!
And that grandfather?
Has he come down yet? He has?
Yes, woman, that grandfather.
What was his name?
Yes, Mr. Shitara.
Who is he?
The gentleman who was sitting next to me! No idea!
I haven't seen him.
Of course you didn't!
As you were sleeping... Why do you ask me?
You mean it wasn't a dream? A dream?
(Thinking) Maybe yes, I dreamt it.
Ran!
Do you know if that grandfather went down to the hospital in Muromachi?
He was wearing a cap and a cane... I don't know...
A lot of people get on and off at that stop.
Well...
Ah!
How nice!
Here we are!
Shall we stop somewhere to eat?
What's the matter?
Well, he makes me suffer.
What is it?
Cab!
Come, Sonoko!
Come on, let's go!
Hey, Ran!
Okay.
What do we do now?
You tell us! Well, ask.
What's wrong with Grandpa?
It's that... he makes me suffer.
I've seen him from somewhere, but I don't remember where...
Besides...
I actually wanted to go see your father, one of these days.
I wanted to give my father a case.
Mmm.
Well, let's go there.
In Beika's diary?
On the other side.
(Woman) Jukichi Shitara...
There's no one by that name.
Neither on the outpatient list nor the inpatient list.
Well...
It's weird, isn't it?
He told you he was going to the hospital, didn't he?
I think so.
Maybe he came to visit someone...
No.
I checked the visitor's list and there's no Shitara.
Aren't you suffering too much?
If you want to talk to your father, he'll be in touch tomorrow.
Maybe he will.
And if not, surely you have imagined it all.
So, you don't believe me, do you?
(Kogoro) An old man who has disappeared?
That's the only thing I can think of.
Sonoko says I think too much, but something doesn't add up.

What if we ask Inspector Megure to look for him?
He won't, will he? Of course he won't!
Either you think too much or you're half asleep.
Maybe yes, I have dreamed it.
(Think) Mm?
A floppy disk?
Where did you get it?
Eh?
What is it?
I don't remember buying it.
Maybe it's from that grandfather on the bus.
But... why did you...?
Mmm.
You can't open it.
Eh?
Without the password we can't open the file.
What a setback.
It's got.
"Confidential. Forbidden to take it with you."
(Thinking) You get the idea, that it can't be opened easily.
Can't you do anything to find out the password and see what's there?
Mmm... But it'll take me a while.
You're in a hurry, aren't you?
We'll go to the bus depot
to see if we can find what we've taken.
Maybe we'll find some other clues.
Understood.
When I've opened the file, I'll call you guys back, okay?
Thank you, doctor!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Very good.
Thank you very much.
The bus company told me that bus is still running.
Very good! Very good!
Let's go! Just a moment!
Why do you need me, in all this business?
What's that?
It's just that Conan says that if you come, we'll remember everything better.
Wow, that's all you want me for... Please, Sonoko, help!
Now that I had already taken a shower and was so relaxed....
(Think) Why are you following us, this car?
Conan!
Why aren't you looking ahead?
Look, this car, Ran.
There is none!
Come on, your looking forward!
I already told you at noon.
I don't remember anything, that grandpa.
I'm sorry, Miss.
Well, well...
Maybe you have forgotten something in the place where it has been.
Shall we look at it?
Yes, we looked at this.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
It's not the same bus.
The one this noon wasn't going well.
He must be fixing the workshop.
Come on, let's go, Ran!
Wait a minute, aren't you...?
Someone asked me where a girl named Mouri got off.
Why did they ask?
That's a bad joke!
Who asked her?
Let me think... a man wearing a trench coat and sunglasses.
Wow!
Ah... that man...
Do you know who he is?
But... why?
Hurry up.
Let's try, Ran!
(Think) "A grandfather who disappears. A confidential diskette...
"A man with sunglasses...
"Something's going on here!"
Wait a moment.
One moment, please!
Hey, you can't come up here! We've left something behind.
Hey, listen!
Look, it's this seat here.
I was sitting here.
Grandpa sat next to me.
Don't you remember anything else?
Ah, yes, I do!
The last name!
The last name? He wrote it on glass with his finger.
As it was fogged up, you could write on the glass.
But you can't see anything anymore.
Can you see it?
It wasn't just a dream!
But what are you doing?
I do not understand anything at all.
(A teletransmissor sounds)
Yes?
Hello?
Have you opened the diskette?
That's right.
What's on the diskette... is a kind of double list.
A double list?
You know Beika Construction, don't you?
Well, it was taken from the accounting department of this company.
There is the official list and the unofficial one,
which is where the names of politicians who have accepted bribes appear.
and the shareholders' meetings that have dealt with blackmailers.
Of course!
That grandfather, they were after him because he had this list!
Aah... aah.... What bad luck!
The man with the trench coat and sunglasses was following him.
And when he realized he was being followed, he put the diskette in your bag.
And besides, he knew I was Detective Mouri's daughter.
Come on, let's go!
We must look for her! As if it were that easy!
We have no idea where she has ficat.
She went in the diary!
After I left the diskette in the bag, it went in the diary!
Of course! No!
Let's see, let's recapitulate.
The man with the glasses asked the driver where you got off.
Therefore, from the beginning he already knew that Grandpa didn't have the diskette!
That's why he was looking for you, because you were sitting next to Grandpa!
That's right.
Therefore...
the man with the glasses has kidnapped Grandpa!?
Ran, call Kogoro and Inspector Megure!
Where are you going? To the place where Grandpa came down.
I'm coming too, Conan.
No!
They're looking for you, Ran!

Don't move from here.
Okay.
All right. Good night.
Good night. Good night.
Can we call, please? Yes, of course.
Let's see, the card...
Here, hold on.
Molt well.
That's not it!
Can you hear me, father?
Do not fall asleep!
Hip!
Yes, yes... I hear you...
Oh, no.
Just at such an important moment.
What, is he coming?
There's no way.
I'll call the inspector.
For such a low price, it's not bad at all.
O... Wow!
Yes.
I'm calling from the bus company's offices.
E... Listen up!
Some guy has taken the other girl!
(Phone: Agasa) Shinichi, it's me.
What's up, doctor?
The Ran told me that Sonoko has been kidnapped.
They've taken it with a car.
Coming out of the bus depot to the left.
It'll be this way.
Please turn around!
What took you so long?
I couldn't wait to do it.
(Thinking) "It's strange. We should have found it by now."
"On one side is a factory wall."
"And have you turned left?"
Please turn right there.
Does this street have an exit on the other side?
No, there are only warehouses here and you cannot go through.
To get out of the street you have to turn around.
(Thinking) "So, the Sonoko must be near here."
"It was Beika Construction."
"Just a moment."
"If a double list like this is discovered,
it wouldn't just be Beika Construction that would be hurt,
companies that have done contracts would be splashed."
On the list comes out of the Ryujin Economic Research Institute?
Wait a minute.
Yes, it is.
They have siphoned off a large amount of money.
Thank you very much, doctor!
(Man) Shrike!
You've got the wrong girl!
-Eh?
Was it the other one?
-Look what a fool you are!
(Knocks)
As I was carrying that bag I thought....
-Go back to him and take the other one!
-D'a... -All right, brother.
This time don't make a mistake!
Understood.
What do we do, of these two?
If they don't have the diskette they're no good to us!
Get a move on!
What's the matter?
But who is he, this kid?
In Conan Edogawa... Private detective!
What t'empatolles?
"The two men belonged to a group of racketeers
related to the Beika Construction Company."
"Mr. Jukichi Shitara had worked for many years at the company,
and after thinking about it, he copied from the corrupt list."
Sonoko!
Ran!
Ran!
I've been so scared!
That's it, Sonoko!
It's all over!
It's all over!
"The next day she got down to business
the investigation of the Beika Construction Company,
thanks to the denunciation of a brave grandfather who had worked."

DETECTIVE CONAN
I can't get it out of my head.
I've seen it from somewhere, Grandpa.
You don't remember though, Ran?
What a rage.
Yes.
Actually, he worked at Beika Construction.
Maybe you saw him on TV or in the newspaper.
Maybe I did...
Here you go.
Sandwiches, an iced coffee and an orange juice.
Bon appetit!
Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, I must have been confused...
(Grandfather) No, no.
Do not get confused step.
It's him! Eeeeeh?
"Mr. Jukichi Shitara was a regular customer
of the coffee shop below Detective Mouri's office."
What's wrong, Ran?
Are you all right?
That man with the sunglasses, I've seen him from somewhere.
From where?
Where have you seen him from, Ran?
Think about it!
