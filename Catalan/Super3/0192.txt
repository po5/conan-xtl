The water that flows has no form.
The wind that blows cannot be seen.
The cases admit all kinds of deductions.
Finally, the Ran and I have a date.
A dinner with an extra plate.
He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!

(Off) "A gang of robbers shot at me.
"While we were exploring a cave."
"I needed a blood transfusion and the Ran volunteered."
"That's why I decided to tell her the truth,
"but Haibara pulled a gun on me."
"And then, on the day of the high school party,
"During the play, someone in the audience was killed..."
"When the black knight took off his mask."
He has committed a very daring and reckless murder....
Who... who are you, my boy?
Long time no see, Inspector Megure.
It's me, Shinichi Kudo.
A DANGEROUS RETURN: Shinichi IS BACK!
(Ringing: ding-dong)
(Intercom) "Yes?" (Ding-dong)
"Yes?" (Ding-dong)
(Ding-dong)
(footsteps: approaching) Oh...
Take your finger off the doorbell!
I heard you a while ago!
Ah..., Shinichi, you know what you have to do, today, at school?
Yes, woman, the same as last year.
It's time to clean up after the party, isn't it?
I'll be right back.
Just a moment, I'll be right back.
(Thinking) "It's him, the usual Shinichi. It wasn't a dream!"
"He's really back!"
Aren't you happy, Conan?
Oh, Conan!
Conan?
(hums)
(laughs) That's something else!
I like it, my body.
(Ouch) Don't get used to it, that's why!
Ha... Haibara!
Who do you think you are?
I guess you think you're a big shot, don't you?
If the Ran hasn't found you out, you can thank me.
You owe it all to my antidote
and the voice transformer, which allows me to impersonate you!
You promised you would only talk to her for a few minutes.
And now, you expose yourself to everyone! Ah... Sorry, man!
But when I solved the case, I couldn't control myself...
Besides, I didn't expect that the antidote would allow me to go back to the way I was.
You know what I mean... He-he... Mm.
Uh... I did wrong, maybe?
Thank that friend of yours from Osaka.
He took it upon himself to warn everyone
not to say a word when you fell.
He told us to keep our mouths shut and we listened to him.
I don't know if he convinced everyone,
but I guess we'll just have to keep doing the paperwork and keep an eye on the Ran
until things get back on track.
Hey, Haibara, can you explain why you are doing this for me?
I know positively that the antidote is yours.
Don't you want to take it and get your life back?
You're a donkey...
I help you simply because if it's discovered to you...,
it goes without saying that I also receive it on the rebound, that's how it is!
And think, my friend, that what you have taken is in the testing phase.
I will not take it until I have seen what effect it has on you.
Oh, by the way... What do you want now?
Would you mind not talking like a girl, when you play Conan?
It does something, you know?
Oh, does it?
Well, I like it.
Ecs!
Gross!
You left me standing so still!
Who knew you'd be the gentleman!
You didn't even know the script...
It takes courage to go on stage.
If you improvise one more line, you'll ruin the play.
(Think) "Sonoko, bad piece."
Remember that the knight picks up the princess and gives her a passionate kiss!
Until then, not a word!
And what did you think?
The what?
The play, you mean?
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
Not the play, the princess!
Not for nothing, but I'd like to know.
Ah!
You looked fantastic, with the costume!
Eh?
"The dress makes the figure."
You looked very pretty.
(Mocking laugh)

Should I take it as a compliment?
Look, it's on Conan!
(Mitsuhiko) Congratulations for getting out of the hospital!
(Mitsuhiko) Hey!
Hi, guys!
How's this?
(At the same time) Wow!
Ah, hello...
(At the same time) Huh?
Who is he, this guy?
(Conan voice) Dr. Agasa's neighbor, he goes to high school.
Ah, the one from the haunted house.
By the way, the Ai is cold and won't come.
- (Mitsuhiko) Wow... (Genta) Did you see yesterday's game?
Of course I did!
It was fantastic!
(Thinks) "Not long ago, I was one of them."
"You should see how time goes by. It's all like a dream."
Shinichi!
Run, we hasten selected.
We'll be late!
Don't dawdle.
(Conan voice) Hey, my legs are short.
What? (Voice: Shinichi) Ah!
(Voice: Shinichi) Ah!
Don't worry... It was a joke.
A joke?
Well look, it's not funny.
You're old enough, man! I tell you it was just a joke.
(Hey, Kudo!
You just got back and you're already bragging about your couple?
(Guys: laugh) Donkeys, I'm not bragging about anything!
No, of course not... By the way, the new English girl looks like a train.
She's from out of town and has a body...! Does she really?
Hey, you still have to tell me something.
What's that?
Well... the important thing you were going to tell me.
Ah, it's true.
Look... (whispers)
(whispers)
Eh?
You're a bunch of... gossips.
More than gossips!
(Boy) Mrs. Kudo, help us, your husband is crazy!
(Think) "This evening at 8 o'clock."
"At that new restaurant in the Beika building?"
Sure you can afford it?
It'll cost you a kidney.
Don't suffer.
He-he... I have my father's card.
You're a bad son! A bad son, me?
They are bad parents,
they go on a trip and leave me alone!
(laughs) You and Conan look so much alike!
Yes?
Didn't you know that his parents are also away?
Ah... Ah, yes?
You know what?
(laughs)
Sometimes I think that maybe...
Conan and you are the same person.
Sometimes I imagine that you're in some kind of trouble and you have to hide...
and that's why Dr. Agasa...
prepares you a kind of drug that makes you small.
(laughs)
It's ridiculous, isn't it?
He-he... Just the wood.
It's funny, but... now that you're here,
when I look at Conan I'm convinced he looks like someone else to me.
And of course, because he is, woman.
(Think) "Someone disguised as me..."
And then?
Aaah...
What did you want to talk to me about?
Eee... Well, well look...
Mm?
I, I wanted to let you know...
(Man) You're not going to the party, sir?
No, I'm not feeling very well today.
Say hello to everyone for me
and remember to keep them in business!
Go, man!
How come it's so dark in the hallway?
Sir!
I've taken the liberty of asking you to dim the lights to make the surprise.
Ah, you're right.
Greet everyone, eh?
(At the same time) Yes, Mr. President!
Excuse me, could you tell me which room is the party?
Miss...
The party is the Italian restaurant, back there.
Go on, go on.
Hello, Mr. Oba!
Excuse me selected, I'd like to talk to her, if you don't mind.
Of course I do... But the party will start soon.
Don't be too long.
No.
My love...
- (laughs) -You're late, Sakurako.
It was before 2/4 of 9, the date, remember?
Forgive me!
It took me a long time to get ready.
Tell me one thing: have you told him about us, to the father?
Of course I did!
I thought he'd be angry, but he was fine with it right away.
He says he trusts me and knows I'll take care of you.
Then we can get married, dear?
Yes, but first I want a reward for being so brave!
Like now..., like a good kiss.
Mm?
(clicks and shouting)
Hey, come on, the party's gonna start!
2/4 of 9, right on time.
But before you go..., here you go.
I want you to open this.
Oh, what is it, what is it?
-A necklace, pink pearls. (clicks)
It matches these earrings you're wearing.
Thank you very much.
It's the least I can do.
Think that for me, today is an important day,
the day we get formally engaged.
You knew all this just from looking at the plate?
You're a real Sherlock Holmes! Of course I am.
So, what is it?
What is it, what you wanted to tell me?
Eh?
Ah, what... Well...
Ouch!

I know it's not easy, but...
be a man, come on, and speak up for once.
Eh?
You want me to leave you the class notes to make up for it?
What?
Ah, no... wasn't that it?
I was so convinced I made photocopies.
Oh, you were?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...!
As a matter of fact, it was...
I didn't know... how to tell you!
I did!
It's not that!
I... I...
Look, Ran, if I invited you to dinner, it's because...
there's... there's something you should know.
And... it's that...
that...
Well, look...
(Women: call)
Eh? What happened?
They were screaming.
Don't worry, these girls must have seen a beetle...
Woman, you mustn't worry.
Somebody come here, hurry!
-There's a corpse in the elevator! -Have the police been notified?
All right, look, what I wanted to tell you is that...
(There's a gun!
They've killed a man with a shot in the head!
In fact, it's...
Don't be polite.
Oh!
I know you're dying to know what happened.
Well...
Shinichi, I don't do like others, who run and hide...
Go on, go see what's going on.
Mr. Detective.
What are you waiting for?
Wake up, I'm still changing my... thinking.
Ra... Ran...
Thank you.
I won't be long.
Mh!
-Enrere, gentlemen, stand back, gentlemen! - (people: whispering)
(Takagi) It's Mr. Taiji Tatsumi, 58 years old...,
president of a video game company.
They have found her, they are workers of his company.
They have seen the body when they were going up in the elevator
to go to look for something they had neglected.
What was it?
I understand that it was a bouquet of flowers that they had to offer to the party
on the occasion of the company's 20th anniversary.
Tatsumi's offices occupy the 24th to 36th floors of this building,
and apparently, this is his private elevator.
Mr. Tatsumi wasn't feeling very well
and wanted to stop by the office before going home.
His clothes are torn to shreds,
the killer must have searched him to steal his money... Mm?
Come to think of it, didn't we have a similar case some time ago?
Did we?
Yeah, man, yeah, it was just when I was starting out.
A young man in an elevator who... When you were starting out, I was a kid.
Forgive me for interrupting, but I doubt it's a robbery.
Yes, sir, it was exactly like that... What?
I think that an armed robber looking for money
would have taken the victim to a much more secluded location.
If what the robber wanted was to frisk him after he was dead,
anyone entering the elevator could have found him,
and that was too risky.
Besides, what burglar stops...
to undo the victim's shirt buttons?
Isn't that right..., Inspector Megure?
Ku... Kudo!
Xxxxt!
Don't say my name, sisplau.
Here we go again!
What are you doing here, may I ask?
I came to have dinner with Ran.
Damn, how many teenagers can dine in an upscale restaurant?
In fact, today I had a reason to come...
Father!
Father!
Oh... Father!
Father!
(Man) Mr. Tatsumi.
Nooo!
Who could have done this to you?
When we said goodbye here a while ago, he was fine.
So you're the last ones to see him alive?
Yes, all 3 of us said goodbye to him at the elevator door, Inspector.
And shortly after that the lady arrived.
We reviewed the speech of the evening and went to the party.
Has anyone else entered the elevator, in this interval?
No, no one.
Could you tell me what time it was? Let's see...
2/4 of 9.
We felt the party was starting and I saw the clock.
But you don't wear a watch, Miss.
But I clearly saw the... Oba's watch
when he touched my ear!
He touched your ear?
Yes, he did, sir.
He gave me a present right here.
He said, "It's a pink pearl necklace."
"It matches the earrings you're wearing."
(Cries) Oh, my God... Oh, my...
Sakurako...
Excuse me, Inspector,
we have to go back to the party and report what happened.
So do we.
Miss...
Inspector Takagi... Mm?
Doesn't it all seem a little strange to you?
Eh?
Well... I wonder if you've really seen the watch.
You take me for a liar?!
Of course, I've seen it!
I guess the gentleman misses it.

because when they arrived they saw everything very dark, didn't they?
But as you see, the hands of my watch are phosphorescent,
they look good.
It was Mr. Tatsumi who asked me to turn down the lights
because he wanted to make a surprise.
It still doesn't fit me.
I want to feel it too.
One moment, then.
What's so strange?
Look at this.
If you touch the earring like this, you can't see the watch, right?
Ha-ha!
But you can see it if I touch the other earring, right?
Why do you think I would expressly touch your right ear?
Did you look at it?
It's obvious!
Because you can only see this earring.
That's why I've...
And why not with your right hand?
Wouldn't it have been much easier?
If we don't think that she had it occupied with some other object....
(He thinks) "What could it be, that so important thing he wants to tell me?"
"I can't think of..."
"And I don't think..."
Are you sure you haven't put on weight since the last time?
(Thinking) "Maybe I have... My clothes are getting tighter..."
"But you wouldn't invite me to dinner to tell me that."
Excuse me, miss.
Would you mind waiting for my partner to come back, please?
He left when he heard the scream.
He's a detective, you know.
But he won't be long, don't suffer, okay?
No, of course not.
Ah... What are you laughing at?
Don't be angry.
It's just that the old sommelier once spoke to me
about a couple like you
and it reminded me.
Apparently, you sat at the same table...
that was more than 20 years ago.
In that case he was also a detective,
and when he came back to the table after solving a case,
he called out to the entire restaurant.
Get ready! Get ready for what?
Because he will propose to you, woman!
What?
I wish you a lot of luck!
(Think) "Of... Propose?"
"Where's it going to stop...! He wouldn't... ever, that."
"No way."
Are you implying that I had a gun on the right?!
A gun?
I haven't talked about any gun, as far as I remember.
You had one, perhaps?
Inspector!
Who the hell is he, this little boy?!
Well, well... It's...
Although it doesn't look like it, I'm a policeman, just graduated!
Oi, Inspector? Yes...
Excuse me, it seems that you suspect Mr. Oba, you people.
But he can't have done it,
because he fired the father right here... with the others!
And then he was with me.
Surely you haven't been separated?
Only when I went to put on the necklace that he gave me.
"I spent 2 or 3 minutes in the bathroom while I was touching up my lipstick."
"But during this time we were talking; he couldn't have done anything!"
Inspector!
We found a pistol with a silencer and a bullet casing!
Where was it?
In the building's garbage bin.
So the killer could have dumped it in any landfill.
Let's see, is there a dump on this floor?
Yeah, near the toilets.
Oh, I get it.
He got rid of the gun without interrupting the conversation.
Come on, let's go!
I see that you are very interested in killing me.
Then explain to me how I was able to kill Mr. Tatsumi
when he got out of the elevator.
You know I was with her the whole time.
And if I had shot him,
logically, I would have left some powder up my sleeve, right?
May we check it out, Mr. Oba?
Of course we can.
Yourselves.
Accompany me, sir.
Taoru...!
About it..., excuse me for asking.
(Do you remember if they kissed in front of the elevator?
Eh?
Wh... who's seen us, maybe?
No, but my mother always said...
that a woman only touches herself up with lipstick...
after a kiss or a meal!
Would you mind telling me how she hugged you, miss?
Well, he... held me with your arm, like this.
You must have been on your back in the elevator, right?
Yes... yes, as a matter of fact, yes.
Have you been meeting secretly for a long time?
Yes, and we were meeting again tonight.
Hey, what... what are you doing?!
I am very grateful to you!
You helped me a lot, believe me!
Ah, one last question, if you don't mind:
were the earrings you're wearing also a gift from Mr. Oba?
No, sir!
I liked them very much and I bought them this afternoon.

They are not Mr. Oba's.
Well, understood.
Thank you very much.
(He thinks) "I wasn't wrong: it was him who shot the victim."
"Mr. Oba is the culprit!"
Look, his fingerprints were on the bag!
Of course, of course they were!
It's quite obvious, because I touched it, you know?
Anyone could have done it.
What?! Hey, Kudo, what's wrong with you?
What now, you're an investigator?
Well, that's good.
Well, now we open the door to the truth!
"A dangerous return: the place of promise."
