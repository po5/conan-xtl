DETECTIVE CONAN
The threat of the monthly gift
(Ayumi) Ran, do you know Shinichi Kudo?
Do you?
Yes, I do...
He's so handsome!
How exciting, having such a famous detective friend!
He can't be your boyfriend, can he?
Of course he isn't! Of course he isn't!
And why are you getting involved, you?
Ah, look... because...
He's your boyfriend!
What are you saying... In fact.... we're just...
Come on, guys, leave me alone!
Hello, father!
What happened to Shinichi?
He hasn't called me lately.
He must be working on some very complicated case.
It didn't take him that long to solve a case.
No matter how difficult it was.
Maybe Shinichi...
...has lost that gift he had.
Yeah!
What's the matter?
Oh!
Oh!
Ouch!
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel so bad, little...
Are you all right?
My name is Ogawa.
For two years now,
every month I receive a toy and an envelope with money.
The sender uses a false name and address,
and it gives me a very bad feeling.
Toys and money?
Do you have a young child?
Yes, a 5-year-old son named Yuuta.
Ah... and how much money do you send him?
One million yen every month.
They've already sent me 25 million.
25 million!? 25 million!?
Eh?
In Yuuta is happy to receive the toys,
but I don't like them, the money, and I haven't touched them.
Don't suffer, I'll keep them for myself.
What are you saying, Father!
It was a joke, Ran.
Hey, do you have any idea who it might be?
Well, no...
It's not one of your patients? Is it?
A patient?
Right, because you're a surgeon, right?
Yes...
Maybe a patient you saved thanks you in this way.
Ah... but...
I said, I, who am a surgeon?
How did you know this, Conan?
It's very easy.
I knew it from the indexes!
The index fingers?
Isn't there a mark diagonal to the fingers?
When surgeons operate,
they use the index fingers
to hold a very thin thread to sew the wounds.
That's why they get a mark.
Is, is this true?
Ah... well, yes, I had an operation this morning.
But I find you very observant, my boy.
This nano talks a lot of nonsense.
Conan, that's a very clever observation!
You seem to be... you seem to be in...
I'm sure you do gymnastics, don't you?
A girl gets these calluses if she works out on the parallel bars.
(Think) "It looks like Shinichi!"
"But it can't be!"
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaai!
How is it possible?
And look... I got this just today.
Apart from the money, is there any other suspicious detail?
No, normally, the money they send me
come in an envelope with the toy.
But today...
Eh?
A letter?
"You have the 25 million. Now I'll come and get it."
But what does this mean?
I have no idea...
Why don't they have stripes, these boxes?
What stripes?
Well, these lines.
The bar codes!
Eh?
Yes that's weird!
No box like that!
Nowadays you can't find them anymore, these toys.
And some of them are worn out...
That's true.
Some of these toys arrived to me crushed or broken.
So, this person sends you used toys
or toys that he had bought a long time ago.
In addition to the money.
But why does he do that?
Surely...
...it must be a joke in bad taste.
A joke, in bad taste?
(He thinks) "No, it's excessive, for being a joke in bad taste."
"No one sends that much money without a specific reason...
and this letter..."
Mr. Mouri, this is a good deduction.
Yes, of course it is!
(He thinks) "No, it has not been deduced by the father..."
"In Conan directs all his steps."
"It could be..."
"Could it be that this child was...?"
This letter is the only clue we have to the sender.

Maybe the sender wants to buy something from Dr. Ogawa?
I say this because the letter can also be interpreted that way.
Now that you mention it!
I have a painting at the hospital that my grandfather gave me.
It could be worth as much as 10 million yen.
Of course it is!
The sender probably wants me to sell him that painting!
Shall we go to the hospital and take a look at the painting?
Maybe we'll find out more!
(Kogoro) Okay, let's go!
It's huge, this hospital!
The first day I came here I was just as surprised.
I was transferred here from a village hospital.
-Dr. Ogawa, another cop. They brought you back this year.
An ipomea?
In this cold?
It could have been grown in a greenhouse.
-But it's also a gift?
-Yes, from the same sender.
But this plant only comes to me once a year,
today, February 19.
The flower could mean that the sender is a woman?
The meaning associated with the ipomea is... "short-lived".
He had an affair with a woman, two years ago?
But what does it say?
Of course he didn't!
Well, it's your son's birthday, maybe?
No, it's in December.
Why don't you look at the patient reports for the last few years?
It could be a patient related to the date of February 19.
Sure... What would you let me see, doctor?
Patient reports are confidential...
You'd be doing me a great favor.
I suppose it's unavoidable.
I'll show them.
Thank you very much, doctor.
What do you think?
These are the reports of the patients I've been taking these past three years.
Mm.
Unfortunately, there's no clue we can use.
-And we don't know who wants the frame. -No.
He wants to see?
Yes, I do, Doctor.
He's on display in the patient waiting room.
Conan, are you coming to see him?
I think I'll wait here.
Ah, very well.
Please don't touch anything.
Of course I will!
It's a painting that patients like very much.
"Conan!"
"This is very strange, he's not behaving like a child."
"Like that time..."
This dog must bark at all strangers, right?
"And that other time..."
If he had never come here before, how did he know this was a lighter?
"It was as if Shinichi was talking!"
"Ah... Of course!"
"That day when Shinichi disappeared...
...he appeared in Conan as if he had replaced her!"
"It could be..."
"Could it be that that child was... in.... Shinichi?"
"I don't know how...
but I have to find out..."
"I'm going in."
Hello!
You shouldn't touch these reports without permission.
What are you doing here?
Have you found out something else? Of course I have!
Flowers come to you once a year, right?
It seems to me that the sender of the mysterious toys
must be a former patient of Dr. Ogawa's.
The gifts started arriving two years ago,
and he's been working here for three years.
He must be a patient from the last two years.
There are 8 people related to February 19.
People who had a good operation, people in hospitals or discharged.
When flowers or gifts are sent, it is usually as a token of appreciation,
however, the greenhouse ipomea and this letter don't connect.
Wow, that's great, that you thought of all this!
You must be by force... you must be Shinichi!
What are you saying?
I'm right!
I'm right!
You are Shinichi.
But what... but what the hell are you doing now, Ran?
But my name is Conan!
You scared me.
(Thinking) "Too bad! You know it's me!"
"If those men find out that I'm Shinichi Kudo,
they'll come after me again!"
"And if they came looking for me,
everyone around me would be in danger!"
"I must get it out of their heads."
Look, it's a "Game-Boy"!
And it's Yaiba's adventure!
Catch Yaiba!
Charge this devil!
What fun!
"How he dissimulates! Now he's making me think bad even more."
"I'm sure it's Shinichi in Conan."
"But this isn't a fiction movie."
"Wait a minute! If it were true..."
Ah... Conan, maybe you like someone?
I do... and I can't get it out of my head!
Could it be that Shinichi guy you were looking for a while ago?
That's right!
Ever since I was little, he always laughed at me,
he was so sure of himself and wanted to be a detective,

but when I need him, I can count on him.
I'm in love with Shinichi!
Oops... the game's over.
Hey, Ran, you want to play?
Eh?
You like these games, don't you?
Yes... Yes...
I hate them, you feel me!
Don't want to confuse me, now!
Oh, well, you don't like them... Then I'll keep playing alone.
Eh?
(Think) "Tomoya Ogino?"
"The doctor said his son's name was Yuuta."
"Normally, you put your name or your favorite character's name."
"Tomoya Ogino?"
"Sounds familiar, this name."
"I got it!"
"It's this one!"
"Tomoya Ogino. 5 years old!"
"She died after Ogawa performed emergency surgery on her
on February 19!"
"You have the 25 million. Now I'll come and get it."
That letter could mean..."
Ran!
Hurry up and send for Dr. Ogawa!
What? Hurry up!
We don't have much time!
"I'm sure!"
"The way he talks... "The way he works things out...
That's typical Shinichi."
"I'm sure!"
Have you figured out who the sender is?
Really?
I'm sure it's the parents of "Tomoya Ogino".
Tomoya... Ogino?
She died 3 years ago from appendicitis!
He can die, from appendicitis?
Yes, Mr. Mouri, if it is discovered too late.
In this case, it was already too late when the child arrived,
but his father didn't want to accept it...
But what's the point of sending him things?
If the operation had gone well...
It's not a gift and it's not toys....
they are the toys of Tomoya Ogino, who died 3 years ago!
The sender hasn't stopped sending memories of his son to the doctor
along with his resentment!
The plant is to commemorate the anniversary of his death.
The letter means that Mr. Ogino will kill his son on the same day.
My God!
Where is he, your son?
My wife is going to pick him up from the nursery.
Let's go and let her know!
What?
Someone has come for her!?
(Woman) I've been told that her father has gone to pick her up.
It's not you!?
No, it can't be!
(Think) "This is very serious! We must find in Yuuta..."
Where is it, the nursery, doctor!?
3 corners from here, it's prop.
It can't be far.
Run, Conan!
Come on, Conan!
It has, jester, a gift for you.
Wow!
Thank you very much!
And listen, sir, you'll take me somewhere fun, later?
Sure, very soon I'll take you...
the place where you are in Tomoya...
"Where are they, where are they?"
(Think) "Tomoya... you must feel very lonely, up there,
but I'll send you a little friend... right now."
It's him!
Yuuta!
But what's he doing?
"It can't be!"
"I have to act!"
Up!
He's done it in Conan, that!?"
(Ogawa) Yuuta!
(Ogawa) Hey!
Hello, father!
Yuuta!
Don't move!
You know what will happen if you move.
Mr. Ogino, so it was you...
That's right, it was me!
Tomoya Ogino's father, who killed you with his operation!
It was not a medical error!
They took him too late.
You don't know how it feels.
You don't know how it feels, a father who has lost his son!
All I had left were the ashes, and the 25 million insurance money.
And I was sending him all that money!
That's right!
The money, his favorite toys
and the Ipomea that he loved so much.
Now he will know how great is the sadness of losing a child!
Please! Please don't do anything to him.
Please do not do anything to him, to my son!
Mati'm me instead of him!
Let my son be... Let him be...
Ah, of course!
You are the gentleman who sent me the toys!
Thank you, sir!
I have them all very well taken care of.
T... Tomoya...
(Cries)
T... Tomoya...
Did he say something you didn't like, my father?
No, it's not that, little one.
Me, the one who did something terrible.
I knew it from the beginning, that it wasn't a medical mistake.
But it seemed to me that it was the only way to...
...the only way to...
Forgive me, little...
Ran, come on, call the police!
Wait, don't call the police, please.
You almost killed your son...
Let's forget everything.
Let's forget it.
Oh!
Very well, then.
Mr. Ogino.
Don't worry...
I fully understand how you must feel...
because I'm a father, too, before I'm a doctor.

How fortunate that things finally worked out.
Why did he spend two years sending her money and toys?
Surely Mr. Ogino expected Yuuta to be 5 years old.
Like in Tomoya before...
Oh, right!
That's a pretty good deduction!
Eh... But I'm just a kid, I'm not really sure.
I forgot to do something!
Go on home!
But what's gotten into you, now?

DETECTIVE CONAN
I'm here!
Where did your father go?
For a drink.
You're hungry, aren't you?
I'll fix you something.
My P.E. teacher in Kishida is getting married soon...
Mm... that gorilla, huh?
And how the hell would you know, you, what my teacher looks like?
Ah, Ran, it's just that you always called gorilla, gorilla...
Don't lie!
You looked a little weird, but I see you're Shinichi!
No, and now...
Come on, come on!
Tell the truth!
Shinichi!
(Phone)
The phone...
Let it ring!
(Ring) But maybe...
(Ring)
(Ring) What a pain in the ass they are!
I'll be right back!
Detective Mouri, say.
Who is it?
(Adult voice) Hello, Ran, did you miss me already?
Shinichi!?
Just kidding...
Hey, hey... You've already forgotten my voice?
Geez, you're heartless, Ran.
(Think) "Shinichi's Coi..."
Doctor Agasa, Ran's about to find out who I am!
Call her with my voice.
"You'll get me in trouble."
Hey, Ran!
How do you feel about me, Ran?
I'm a fool!
I was so wrong!
It's nothing!
But listen, Shinichi, you mean you don't talk like an old man?
Are you kidding?
(Thinking) "I'm already saved..."
Wow!
What nice pictures!
I like them very much!
Look, the colors are beautiful!
What is it, this expression?
What did you see on the label that scared you?
