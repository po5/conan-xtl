The dangerous summer story of the Sonoko, part one.
Perfect!
But Sonoko, what were you photographing me?!
Your ass while you were putting on your bikini, beautiful!
Your ass at a delicate moment!
What are you going to do about the picture?
Well, when Shinichi comes back from his trip, I'll show it to him!
He'll be so excited!
Shinichi wouldn't be so frivolous to be happy with such a photo.
Conan, you think so too, don't you?
Eh?!
Ah, yes!
Children don't understand these things.
(Think) I want to get my body back soon!
You're a stranger, Sonoko!
You won't stop poking at me!
You're not in hock.
It's just a little revenge.
(Thinking) Why?
That I've hurt you?
Don't you know, Ran?
What's the point of spending 3 days on an Izu beach?
You wanted to come and catch some kid like always.
Fair!
Besides, I've concocted the evil plan of the good girl!
What's this?
What's this?
The destinations of our trips are always my mansion
or luxury hotels!
"She's a flower that's out of my reach!"
And to make the kids feel safe, we'll sleep in an old boarding house.
Ah, you meant this?
(Thinking) It doesn't make sense...
However... However, to me...
Sonoko.
Inside the train that we took for coming...
And last night, while watching the fire castle...
And also on this beach...
All the boys who come here are coming after you, Ran!
And I'm sick of it!
No, that's not true, Sonoko.
It's all right.
I took a picture of you in your underwear yesterday,
I'll show it to Shinichi!
Stop the cart!
You've gone too far with this!
I won't forgive you, I'm sorry?!
It was a lie, I didn't take it.
You're incorrigible, Sonoko!
(Think) Too bad... it was a lie?
Sorry, girls.
Are you free now?
Do you mind if we all go to lunch together?
It's on me.
Yes, yes!
With great... pleasure.
I'm sure you've noticed her too.
Au, take her away!
She's in her prime!
Sonoko!
But don't do anything strange to her.
She's engaged to someone else!
Well, the one I was inviting to lunch... was you.
(Thinking) "No!"
You did it, Sonoko!
You look great!
"It's impossible!"
"With Sonoko, this situation is unthinkable!"
"I'm sure there's something."
"There's something fishy going on here!"
"What's wrong with me! Where do I get so many worries?"
Let's go, shall we?
I'll stay here with Conan for a while!
What?
Blow!
So you study at Beika University, Michiwaki?
Your father studied there, didn't he, Ran? Yes, he did.
(Think) "He looks for boys and more boys,
and when push comes to shove, it's backwards!"
Michiwaki, how did you end up here?
Because of a love disappointment.
My girlfriend left me in a terrible way.
I had a depression and thought that looking at the sea maybe....
Then I found an angel.
If my intuition goes the right way, you will be the goddess of my salvation.
So much... so much like goddess...
-The beer.
Thank you for waiting. -Ah, thank you.
Sir, I beg you not to throw the ash on the floor,
it's hard to clean up afterwards!
Ah... Yes.
A waiter with a bad temper.
This waiter, haven't you seen her somewhere else?
Of course, he's the son of the man who runs the guesthouse where we're staying.
Since it's a vacation, he helps them.
How do you know these things?
As he was staring at us, I asked him.
But how come he's a waiter here and waits tables?

This must be from the same owners.
Than Kawara Guesthouse, I mean.
Eh?
So, you stay at the Kawara Guesthouse?
Yes, yes we allotgem.Ã‰s very close to my hotel!
Do you want to go to dinner at a restaurant by the sea?
-I'll come to pick you up with a car, right?
But promise me that you will not leave your camera.
Why?
It is seen that on the beach of the side a crime was committed.
A crime?
Yes.
It must be about a year ago now.
It was a murder case.
They stabbed to death a young brown-haired girl.
(At once) Murder?
Yes.
It seems that while she was on her way to the restaurant,
she was involved in an incident and was murdered.
The investigation is still ongoing.
Since that crime,
customers have forgotten the events and the restaurant is very successful.
The funny thing is that this girl liked the restaurant
and still goes there.
Even though she goes ?
In the photographs taken in that restaurant,
the ghost of the victim of that horrific event appears!
(Think) What nonsense...
And I wanted to check if you can take pictures like these.
L... listen, what do you say?
There are 10 pictures left, the reel, but...
No!
I forbid you to take it!
But if we show them to Shinichi maybe he'll find out something.
Besides, we can show him the picture you already know.
What did I tell you?!
He doesn't even know who it's been taken?
With his powers of deduction, he'll figure out right away who it is.
Go for a walk! Deductive ability?
-Her boyfriend is a detective! -Wow, that was it.
-By the way, what kind of photo is it? -Well, look...
Sonoko!
The fried noodles!
We have customers waiting.
Eat it quickly, please.
What's gotten into him, this waiter?
He seems to have a grudge against us.
Why don't we let it go, about the restaurant?
He's making me come in here.
It's all right!
The ghost in the photographs is just a rumor.
Surely the ghost in ten to be fed up, of the restaurant coi.
They have found another one in the forest on the side of the track!
Another what?
A corpse!
They've murdered a brown-haired girl!
I'm leaving for a moment! No, Conan!
Conan, wait!
With his curiosity he starts to make the line.
She's been stabbed to death in the stomach.
Just like a year ago.
Yes.
As far as we know, she was also a tourist.
What's the approximate time of death?
Last night between 8:30 and 10:00.
After the fireworks.
Huh?
Last night at that time, we were passing by, right?
Yes, you're right.
I'm scared...
Don't be a donkey, nobody wants to kill you.
I have brown hair too!
What makes me sure I won't be the next one to be killed?
I don't want to... I don't want to die in a place like this...
I've got a lot of things left to do...
Sonoko...
Nothing will happen.
As long as you're in Izu, I'll protect you, angel!
Well, we'd better choose another place for dinner.
Yes... And without the camera, right?
Of course, without!
Wait for me at the guesthouse entrance at 7 o'clock.
(Think) I'd put my hand in the fire that this man was the restaurant.
-So, until then. -All right!
We'll wait for you impatiently!
Oh...
We'll come back to change it for you.
Yes.
(Man) Eeei!
Ran, Sonoko, it's you!
Did you come to Izu?
Yes, we came to the beach.
So, Detective Mouri, too?
No, this time there were 3 of us.
Three?
Good morning to you.
Are you the gentleman of these two damsels, Conan?
You have to protect them properly.
Girls, be very careful!
A turbulent crime has taken place.
Yes, we'll keep an eye out.
Well, I have to go.
Give my regards to detective Mouri.
Yes!
He looks lively, but he doesn't seem to be succeeding.
If your father had come, he would have solved the case right away.
(Think) Detective Yokomizo is much more competent than he was at Kogoro.
Ah!
It's started to rain!
I don't know if it will be long, in Michiwaki.
Au, don't be impatient.
Heroes are always a little late!
Enough jokes!
You're embarrassing me!
Why did he take it out, this umbrella? Maybe it's because we use it.
Could it be that this boy is interested in the Sonoko?
Bandarra.

Everyone is after you!
That guy is too sinister!
You're right too, like you have in Michiwaki....
Don't be like that, you're making me turn red....
Ah.
I forgot my wallet in the room.
Wait for me, I'll be right back.
I'll go get it.
Ran, what's bothering you?
That guy with the glasses, I've seen him somewhere else.
You've seen him in this boarding house, haven't you?
No, I don't mean here.
Somewhere quite different...
Is this true?
Remember.
Where do you think you've seen her?!
Sonoko, what are you doing?!
Don't tell me you're changing.
Sonoko!
What happened to you?
A strange man attacked me and climbed out of the window.
(Think) And the traces of the escape?
I was so scared!
But why did he attack you?
I do not know.
When I opened the door,
that man was rummaging through our luggage,
and suddenly he was attacking me!
(He thinks) will the luggage go?
Maybe underwear!
How disgusting!
What did he look like?
You've seen his face, right?
I have not had time to see it l'hi.
And the room was dark.
But how do you know it was a man?
When he thrust at me, I stuck my tooth in.
He had a hairy arm.
Sometimes you're scary.
What happened, how come he doesn't have the lights on?
Michiwaki!
The car got stuck in the middle of the road.
I came running, but I'm late.
How did you know we were here?
I asked the owners of the guesthouse.
(Think) "The wet shirt... and the mud-splattered pants."
"What if it was him?"
Excuse me Michiwaki.
Can you take off this shirt?
I want you to show us your arms, please!
Conan, man!
Should I have something on my arm?
(Think) It doesn't have the Sonoko's bite!
Are you satisfied now, kiddo?
Yes.
Has nothing happened, ladies?
There's a bandage on it!
What happened to his right arm? Ah... I've had it done before.
A drunk customer bit me.
And when did this happen?!
Answer me! Hey, I don't think it was him.
The man who attacked me was hairier.
You were attacked?
A man came in through the window and messed up our luggage.
and when Sonoko came in, he attacked him.
But when we arrived, he ran away without taking anything!
He was probably a thief.
We have already encountered this.
Why didn't you tell us anything?
We told you.
We told you to keep everything locked up.
Besides, at this hour,
standing in this line to show off with your belly button in the air, what do you expect?
You look like you're crying out to be attacked.
These cloths don't suit you.
You're overdoing it!
I like these clothes!
Whatever you wear, you will always look attractive.
In kimono and bikini, too!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm changing rooms.
I'll put you in one we have free.
Of course, if you want to spend the night here, we don't need to talk.
Grano... thank you.
And avoid going out, I recommend that you dine in our dining room.
That man could be waiting to attack you anywhere.
What do we do, Ran? Well... let's stay here for dinner.
It's finger-licking good.
They cook very well!
We could've had dinner yesterday, too.
If I'd reserved a table,
we could have served you even better fish and seafood.
Of course, we will not charge you for the dinner.
In return, we would be grateful if you would not spread rumors,
such as that this is a dangerous guesthouse.
We will not spread them!
We will not say that underwear thieves appear wielding knives!
Knives?
That's right!
The light filtering through the door has been reflected.
A knife was shining!
(Thinking) "It can't be."
"What if it was done by the same killer of the girl they found?"
They say that in Izu, a year ago,
they stabbed a brown-haired woman.
"But if that were the case, why should he kill the Sonoko?" he asked.
"Because she has brown hair? That would be ridiculous."
"Wait..."
"From what she said, the man had rummaged through her luggage!"
From the things in the room,
what's most related to the case is...
"The camera!"
"It could be that there were some photos related to the case."

Sonoko, the man who attacked you stole your camera?
It was with the luggage.
But the film compartment was open.
Did he steal your film?
No.
He had already taken it out before I came in!
As the photos were finished,
I thought I'd look at them at dinner, and I took them to be developed at noon.
Look at the photos!
Will you let me look at them?
Yes.
You have them.
Wait, wait, wait!
It's all right!
I've taken yours out and put it in a safe place.
Sonoko, you always do that!
Don't scare me, man!
Do you know all these?
There are pictures of couples galore.
The Sonoko, until she didn't find you, she was in a bad mood
and took pictures of couples just to mess with you!
Ran!
(Thinking) "That's strange..."
"There aren't any photos out of the ordinary, nor does the victim come out."
"Besides, yesterday we passed by the place where the crime happened,
but Sonoko didn't take any pictures."
"How did the killer think
that Sonoko had taken a photograph of him that couldn't be seen?"
"Why ?!"
"I'm worried about the words Sonoko said this noon."
With his powers of deduction, he'll figure out right away who it is.
"And if at that time the murderer was the restaurant?"
"But something so simple could mislead him ?!"
Tomorrow at noon I'll take you home, won't I?
What if tomorrow morning we go to the haunted restaurant?
Let's go!
In the morning I won't be afraid! Eeeeh?
But without the camera!
Yes.
Okay, girl!
(Think) "Is it my imagination or is he watching us permanently?"
"And the man with the glasses that the Ran has seen from somewhere worries me."
"Besides, the Sonoko's attacker..."
"That guy... is he really a common thief?"
