What's in the heart is a mystery.
Stars and snow shine for both.
The snow falls in silence.
A terrifying armor comes out of the darkness....
It looks like a child, but it has the brain of an adult and it's Detective Conan!

(Male) In the era of civil wars,
the commander Hidetomo Okikatsu suggested to his lord,
the tyrant Genbu Ohara, to stop oppressing his people.
But this infuriated Genbu
and ordered that the Okikatsu clan be annihilated
without contemplation.
Desperate, Hidetomo put on his armor,
killed Genbu
and then committed suicide by slitting his own throat.
It is said that the spirit of Hidetomo back by the world of the living
and that everyone who sees him meets an untimely death.
Today, we celebrate the Okikatsu festival here...
to appease the spirit of Hidetomo Okikatsu.
For your information, the straw hat represents the armor...
and the helmet he was wearing on Hidetomo when he took his own life.
Ayyy... Having the hot springs on that mountain,
what are we doing, here looking at this boring representation?
But it's so fascinating!
What do you think.
(Man) This year we celebrate
the five hundredth anniversary of Hidetomo's death.
Please relax and enjoy the evening.
(Kogoro) Yes, thank you.
Ran, you must have enough, right?
We should move on to the spa.
(Boy) Excuse me...
I just heard that the hot springs hot spring spa
is closed due to the snowfall.
(Boy) What?
Are you sure?
Father, what are we going to do now?
We'll have to find somewhere to spend the night.
I haven't seen any inns in this area.
Excuse me, maybe I can help you.
Down the road is the Daimon residence.
I'm on my way now, if you'd like to come with me.
Ah, thank you.
THE TERRIFYING LEGEND OF THE NIGHT OF THE SNOWFALL, (PART ONE)
Are you sure it's a good idea for us to come?
Yes.
In fact, it's better if you come with me.
The patriarch of the Daimon family is the president of Daimon Industries.
Caram.
It's a well-known company.
He's a man who will do anything for money.
He's a tyrant.
He and his eldest son are always arguing like cat and dog.
And the wife is always partying.
His divorce is imminent.
You know a lot of things, you.
Sure, I'm his second son.
At Yoshiro Daimon.
It's been a while since I've been home.
It's an impressive mansion!
Caram.
They must be very rich people.
What? Not at all.
Aaah...
(Yoshiro) I'm home now.
You look very nice.
Yoshiro, what have you come?
Say!
Are these manners?
It's been 5 years since we've seen each other.
Oh, welcome, sir.
Step inside, please.
Hatsuho, you stay out of this, understand?!
(Kogoro: wring his neck)
Yoshiro, let's see: who are they, these people?
I met them at Hidetomo's party.
They haven't found any place to stay.
You come here without telling us anything, and on top of that you bring strangers into our home.
Excuse me, I haven't introduced myself... I'm from Tokyo and...
(Man) What is it, this commotion?
Father...
Yoshiro, you're back at last.
You make me very happy.
Good evening, Father.
And you, aren't you that famous private detective, in Kogoro Mouri?
Yes, that's right, sir.
The detective?
Kogoro Mouri?
I'm a great admirer of yours.
This must be fate.
Please spend the night at our house.
Hatsuho, arrange the guest rooms...
for Mr. Mouri and Yoshiro.
(Hatsuho) Yes, sir.
(Hatsuho) Please follow me.
You and your family can be here.
Mr. Yoshiro, your is at the end of the hall.
You can go into the garden through the back door.
It's very nice, everything is white.
Please take a walk.
Thank you, we will.
Please excuse my brother and his wife,
they have behaved in a very rude manner.

You don't have to apologize, it's us, we have come unannounced.
Excuse me, miss, could you tell me where the toilet is?
Ah, it's over there, at the end of the corridor.
The voices?
At the end of everything.
The light switch cost to find, so I'll accompany you.
Thank you, that's very kind.
I'll make you some hot tea so you'll be in tune.
No need to worry.
What I'd have right now is...
Then we'll make some both.
Sake.
Ah..., yes, very well, thank you...
Father, no t'embalis, voools?
Look, the sink is here.
Thank you, thank you.
This house is very big.
Yes, it is.
What's over there in the back? These are the family rooms.
At the end of the hallway is Mr. Kazuki's music room.
Opposite is the kitchen.
And next to the kitchen is the back door to the house.
You can go in now.
Lest you wet yourself.
Yes!
You have an impressive mansion.
It's a real honor for me to be in a place like this.
No, it's just an old house.
We must always be making repairs.
Sir, the lady says to excuse her,
that she's not feeling well and is retiring to rest.
Again?
Precisely when Mr. Mouri is here.
Don't worry about me.
I don't think the mother is up for many dinners.
Kayoko!
What's wrong with it?
It's better that they know.
Every year, when the anniversary of Hidetomo's death comes around,
my mother-in-law stands in front of the altar and starts praying at midnight.
Once I heard her
and I thought it was sinister, which is no small thing.
This day I go to bed and cover myself with the sheets.
Mother is in delicate health,
you could be more considerate of her.
Kazuki!
Don't worry about your mother.
Instead, worry more about your work.
Ah.
Is the food to your taste, guys?
Yes, it's great!
And the rice is also delicious.
We are in the habit of preparing rice on a traditional stove.
It's the first time I eat rice cooked like this.
Toasted rice is very good.
By the way, Father, about the appointment of the new president...
We are having dinner now.
We'll discuss this later.
Yoshiro, tell us what you do for a living now.
I'm a guitarist, father.
Stop this nonsense and come home at once.
It's about time you helped me in my business.
Yoshiro.
What kind of music do you play, guitar?
Ah... well, flamenco.
Really?
I'd really like to feel you play!
Mr. Mouri, excuse me.
Can I have your autograph?
I'm a fan of yours too.
Are you serious?
With pleasure.
(laughs) What a thrill!
Yes, isn't it?
(Thinking) "How happy they are..."
Hatsuho, thanks to you, the atmosphere in this house has become cheerful.
Ah, I don't let myself get overwhelmed.
How long have you been working here?
A little over a year.
Your family is very old and I have to remember a lot of things.
That in two flights, maybe?
Yes, but here I want Yoshiro's.
You also want my autograph?
Of course I want your autograph.
After all, one day you'll be a famous guitarist.
-I hope so.
When you become famous, autographs are the last concern.
-As an example, myself.
Ha-ha-ha.
-I'll keep that in mind.
Gee, are you left-handed, Yoshiro?
Yes.
(Genichiro) What do these figures mean?!
I gave you the benefit of the doubt and waited until the last moment,
but it's been a waste of time.
I can't leave you my charge.
Father, your methods are too aggressive.
I did not ask for your opinion.
Then who will you put as president, instead of appointing me?
Father and my elder brother are made of the same stuff.
I came home today because I wanted to settle things with my father.
Sort... things out?
Father wants me to be one of the company executives.
But all he thinks about is money,
and he doesn't even try to understand other people's feelings.
I left 5 years ago because I hated his insistence.
(Kogoro) He seems to have had enough.
Next month I'm going to Spain.
And I don't plan to come back until I'm a top-notch guitarist.
I may never see my father again.
I wanted to try to get him to accept the path I've chosen.

(Door, open)
Yoshiro, that's what you'd like us to believe, right?
But you've come back to take control of the company.
What t'empatolles?
If I had wanted to do it, I would not have left.
-Ah, you mean? (Genichiro) -Madam...
(Genichiro) What are you, these screams?!
All of you together are driving me crazy.
I'm going back to the room.
Ah, I almost forgot.
Mr. Mouri, I'd like to show you something.
Look, that's where I live.
Wow... it's a very nice house.
In the main house there's always fighting,
so I spend a lot of my time here relaxing.
Wow, that's fantastic!
This armor does respect.
Yeah, you're right.
What do you think of it?
It's impressive, isn't it?
It's the armor of Hidetomo Okikatsu.
(All) Eh?
So, it belonged to the hero of the party!
And you're the owner!
(Woman) This armor is cursed.
Tatsuki.
What are you doing here?
The spirit of the warrior Hidetomo still haunts this land.
Everyone who sees him will die an untimely death.
This is because Hidetomo's feet are not cold.
Please put these socks on him.
Stop it!
Stop it, that color!
How can you talk to me like that!
Every year, when the anniversary of Hidetomo's death comes,
I pray and make offerings to him as penance
for the frightful despicable way you have of doing business!
Don't ever speak to me in that tone again.
Tonight it is 500 years since he died in Hidetomo.
Tonight something will happen.
Mr. Mouri, I have decided to postpone the conversation with the father until tomorrow.
Ah, very well...
Now that we have time, how about some local sake?
I think it's great.
Yoshiro!
Mother, I thought you were asleep.
Yoshiro, Hidetomo must have taken you home tonight.
You're the only one who can protect this family.
Take this.
Mother... has been collecting all these items.
Allow me.
"December 10, 1996,
"Kenichi Saegusa, president of Saegusa Industries commits suicide."
"Behind this suicide is Daimon Industries,
"which used unethical methods
"to bankrupt the company."
These are the father's methods of doing business.
But he can't be sure this is true.
He must have already seen the armor in the father's room.
Yes.
The man... who committed suicide was the previous owner.
What? Today is December 10th.
Today is December 10th.
The anniversary of that man's suicide.
That's right.
They left his factory abandoned and now it's falling apart.
Some people have seen his ghost.
Scary, isn't it?
The anniversary of the death of Hidetomo Okikatsu
and the owner of this armor is on the same day?
It could be the curse... of the armor.
It's just a coincidence.
We enjoy our drink in the middle of this beautiful snowy landscape.
Oh... it's stopped snowing already.
It's so beautiful.
It would be wonderful if the snow could fall on our hearts
and cover everything in the same way.
I've already made up your beds.
You can go to bed at any time.
Thank you, Hatsuho.
Father, you must be tired from driving so much, you'd better get some rest.
Hey, wait!
I'm going to get something to drink.
I meant water.
(Kayoko) If your father dies, you'll get the inheritance.
(Kazuki) Yes, but I think it'll take a long time for him to die.
(Kayoko) -You're right.
-I don't understand why Yoshiro suddenly came back.
He won't leave Japan.
What he wants is to put your father in his pocket.
But it wouldn't be a problem
if you were automatically appointed president.
What do you have to say?
You married me for the inheritance.
How can you talk like that?
If tomorrow you have a hangover and we have to stay, I'll get pissed!
Hey, Conan!
La Ran is in a bad mood, let's go to sleep.
Father, massa calls.
Au, come on, Kogoro.
Let's go to sleep.
Will you go back to sleep in the music room?
You prefer music to me.
Hatsuho, bring me a cup of coffee, please.
-I'll be in the music room. -Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.
(Clock: 12 o'clock)
(Dong, dong)
(footsteps)
Ah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Appease your anger.... appease your anger...

(Girl: called)
Lord Daimon is... is death!
What's the problem?
-Master Daimon is dead! -Are you sure?
I want the children out of here. Conan, come here!
-Hatsuho, is there a problem? -Master Yoshiro... -Master Yoshiro...
Your father was in the room and...
My father?
-Father! -Don't come in here.
He seems to have been stabbed in the chest with a sharp object.
He died instantly.
Kogoro, look at this.
What?
The armor is gone!
And the saber too!
It seems that Mr. Daimon has been killed
while drinking a glass of brandy.
-Oh!
(Cries) -Who has done it?
(Thinks) "Eh? Even the socks..."
This is the only entrance this place has.
And besides, there are no footprints leading this way.
"What's this?"
"Got it."
"The roof and the plants in the garden have cast a shadow over the footprints.
"And that's why no one's seen them."
"A sheet?"
Where are you going, boy?
Why do you always have to be in the way?
There's a very big footprint over there.
It doesn't look like a human footprint.
What the hell does that mean?
You see it?
What bigger footprints.
At Hidetomo...
(All) Hey?
They're from in Hidetomo.
I saw it.
I saw it walking outside at night.
However, the curse didn't fall on me.
It fell on Genichiro.
It seems that these footprints are heading
toward the back door of the main house.
We'll go back to the house the way we came, very carefully,
and check where they're headed.
Has the killer passed this way?
-In Kazuki! -Huh?
She said she was coming to listen to music, but I haven't seen her since.
Mr. Kazuki.
Mr. Kazuki!
Can you enter from somewhere else?
No, just this way.
Bad lightning.
We'll have to break the door down.
What is it, Mr. Mouri?
-Let me through! -Don't come in, please.
The spirit of Hidetomo was enraged.
Oh, my God.
Kazuki!
It's the curse.
The curse of en Hidetomo.
"No, this is no curse. But who and how the hell did this?"
This room was locked.
How could it possibly have happened?
I knew it, I knew it would happen.
It is the curse of Hidetomo.
This armor has awakened Hidetomo's spirit
to punish my husband for all his dishonest business.
And it also wanted to punish Kazuki, the heir of the family.
"Eh? So that's what it was. I get it!"
And the next Conan:
