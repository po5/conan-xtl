(Thinks) "Boy, it sure is late."
Aaaaah !!!!
"Oysters."
"You didn't notice."
Eh?
"Come on."
Eh?
My God, what happened?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Did you do it wrong?
What happened?
Thank goodness nothing has been done.
Yes, indeed!
Because this man has fallen off the roof of the building.
-What?
-It was about to crush him.
Well, it seems to me that he hasn't done himself any harm either.
He calls himself Sadao Fukurokoji.
How did he fall off the roof?
I think he tried to commit suicide.
Suicide?
He went to the bar a lot, and when he'd been drinking he always said...
I can't do anything right.
Let's see if I die for once.
And things like that.
A little more and I'll be killed by a suicide?
It seems unbelievable,
but bad luck always follows me.... hehehe!
Hehehehe!
There are people that it happens to them, this, it's true.
Hehehehe!

"A moving target."
But you can tell it was a suicide attempt.
It's not a case for the Junior Detective League.
I know, but we'd like to see the scene anyway.
After all, it happened on our turf.
- (yawns)
-Exactly.
It's down the road.
Eh?
What are you doing here, the research division?
What's he doing here?
It's that kid, look.
So the kid... turns out to be Conan.
It's a good thing you came.
We wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
It wasn't a suicide attempt, then?
No.
Yesterday was a holiday and all the doors were locked.
The only way to get up to the rooftop
was to use the emergency stairs, but it's just that...
Mr. Fukurokoji was so drunk that he was unable to stand.
Therefore, he could not climb the stairs alone.
No, no way.
Someone carried a drunk Mr. Fukurokoji up the stairs to the rooftop.
up the stairs to the roof and then threw him off the roof.
Well...
It was an attempted murder.
We ruled out attempted suicide.
We figure the culprit blended in with the crowd of onlookers
and fled.
I wanted to know if you saw any suspects.
Roger that.
Could I go up and look at the roof?
Maybe it'll help me remember something.
(Mitsuhiko) It would be from here, from this point.
Yes, because this piece of railing is clean.
(Mitsuhiko) So what?
What do you mean?
(Ay) That this piece of railing doesn't have that much dirt on it.
So that it brushed against the victim's clothes when she was thrown over.
"But why did the assailant go to so much trouble
to carry him up on the roof and then make him fall?"
Because he wanted to make it look like a suicide, no?
There are much easier ways to do it.
On this piece here there are also marks.
(Takagi) Oh!
Well, maybe...
the assailant first tried to throw him from here,
but he must have put up some resistance
and in the end he ended up pushing him from there.
I don't know if a drunk can resist much, really.
Hm...
(man) - Eh?
- (man) Inspector!
Mr. Fukurokoji says that he was so drunk last night
he doesn't remember anything.
He also says that he considers himself a loser in a competitive society
and that he's sure there's no one who loves him badly.
Mm-hm.
Be that as it may, someone almost killed him.
We'll look for clues and find out where he went yesterday and what he did.
Surely the assailant found him in some locale.
We got it.
You don't seem very convinced.
It's just that... there's something...
That man!
Yes, it was right there.
Here, at this point.
Here he almost crushed me, can you believe it?
Gee, you're right.
Bad luck follows you, man.
What's the matter, man?
Your friend is explaining to you how unlucky you are?
Ah.

You are the child of yesterday.
He is Daisuke Yukigaya.
It is a great honor for me to have him as a friend.
Au, don't say that, that, you are an exaggerator.
I have to go now.
See you soon.
It happened to be nearby and he took the opportunity to come and see me.
He's a very efficient worker,
good sportsman and comes from a very rich and distinguished family.
He looks very confident in everything he does.
We work together, in the same company, but he is very different.
One day he told me that so far he had never failed in anything he had set out to do.
in anything he had set out to do.
What does this mean?
That there are perfect people in this world?
Wow.
What must it be like to have nothing go wrong?
Everything must be fine until you hit a snag.
Compared to him, I'm a total disaster.
Yesterday he also had the bad luck to pass right by here.
In fact, he wasn't passing by, he was waiting for someone.
I received a love letter from an unknown woman.
And it was probably because of all the commotion,
but in the end it turns out she didn't show up.
A stranger asked you to meet her?
She told me to come here at 8 o'clock.
At first I waited for her at the front door.
But then my watch stopped.
Ah.
My battery's dead!
What time is it?
I think there's a clock over there.
The time, the time...
"And I came here, from where I could see the clock well."
"And then that man fell."
What bad luck I have, isn't it?
Hehehehe!
Eh?
First it was here.
And this is... the other point of the railing with marks.
What, Conan?
What's the matter?
Inspector Takagi said that the victim had put up resistance
and that, for this reason,
the first place from where they wanted to throw him down was another one.
There is another reason.
What's that?
-Huh?
-What?
It could be that the assassin's target had moved to another place.
"The assailant wanted to kill Mr. Fukurokoji...
"And to make it look like Komatsu had been involved by chance,
and thus kill them both."
You mean he had planned to kill two birds with one stone?
In this case, everything would fit.
The criminal lures Mr. Komatsu with a love letter,
takes Mr. Fukurokoji up on the rooftop
and the only thing he has to do is to throw him off the roof.
In other words, the aggressor is someone who hates Mr. Fukurokoji...
and also Mr. Komatsu.
There is someone who hates her, right?
Is that so?
Me?
Hehehehehehe!
No way, no one loves me badly, me.
Could you show us the love letter you say you received?
Eh?
It makes us a little envious.
We have not received any and we would like to see it.
I thought the letter might give us some clue about the offender.
Still... "I have always been attracted to you,
"because, although you've always had bad luck,
you've never lost your smile.
I would like to meet you one day.
I'll wait for you on the 13th at 8 p.m. in front of the Beika 1 building.
I am a woman who has always secretly admired you.
See you soon.
How is it that she took the letter seriously and went,
if it is not even signed?
-No.
-It's true.
It's just that I like a girl, although she doesn't pay much attention to me, to say the least.
And I was hoping it was her, that's why I wanted to believe it.
Well, there's something I don't understand.
"Postscript.
Above all, don't forget to bring the letter the day we meet, please".
To get it back, right?
Why would you say that?
Because it's evidence.
But I wouldn't have been able to get it back either.
If the plan had gone as planned, there would have been an uproar.
I don't understand why I had to write it, then.
(Guts: snoring)
Eh?
I'm starving.
Shall we eat?
-I'm in.
-Huh?
Okay, well, hands everyone.
I'll treat you to a children's menu.
He's not a bad person.
However, there is someone who wanted to get rid of it.
It's here.
Sakiko is great.
She's a very cheerful and nice girl.
-The one you like but she doesn't listen to you?
-Is this the girl?
Is it?
Co... how did you know?
Hehehe!
-I can't take it anymore.
How well we've eaten!
I come here to eat practically every day, here.
Do you also work nearby?
I have it very close to work.
That friend of yours that we saw a while ago...
In Yukigaya, you mean?

Uh... Come to think of it, it's been a while since you've been here, hasn't it?
He used to always come here for lunch, too.
Excuse me, I have to go to the washroom.
I think you know something about that, don't you, Sakiko?
Eh?
Have you noticed?
Did you?
About 6 months ago Mr. Yukigaya asked me out.
How about Sunday we go to the movies together?
Hm?
But I said no.
And since then he hasn't come around anymore.
Just because he didn't want to go out with him?
He must have felt very uncomfortable.
But if Mr. Yukigaya is so handsome, how come you said no to him?
Because I can't stand people like him,
who are always so sure of themselves,
who think they have it all.
Totally agree.
On the other hand, I think Hitoshi is very cute.
Eh?
And, besides, one day he explained to me that he believes in God.
He says that if bad things always happen to him,
it means that someday a very good one will happen,
because he says that God is never unfair.
And I find that admirable, that he believes in these things.
Mm-hm.
Oh, wow.
I'll bring you desserts and drinks right away.
It's not unrequited love.
At Sakiko's, she likes Mr. Komatsu, too.
And, apparently, everyone here knows it.
I think he's the only one who hasn't noticed.
Mr. Komatsu is a bit absent-minded.
I think I know who it was.
You do?
It's a Yukigaya thing.
He said...he came to see Mr. Komatsu
because he was passing nearby, right?
I'd understand if it's been a long time since he's been in the neighborhood, but...
But he comes every day in the world, so his work is also nearby.
Yes, that's a bit of a strange excuse.
He's probably come to see Mr. Komatsu
to check if he knew or if he suspected
that he was responsible for the incident.
Besides, if he is the culprit,
it makes all the sense in the world that he would ask Mr. Komatsu
to bring the letter he had written to him.
But the assailant not only wanted to kill Mr. Komatsu,
but also Mr. Fukurokoji.
That's why I'm not a hundred percent sure, that it was him.
But if his name comes up again during the police investigation,
then... then I'm sure it will.
What do you mean by that?
That you've already investigated and have any suspects?
It seems that last night Mr. Fukurokoji went to a bar
and had a lot to drink, and he started saying the usual things,
that he wanted to die and everything.
But all of a sudden, a man came up to him.
I want to die.
Yes, I want to die too.
Do you really?
You think like me.
-Another one!
-Let's have another drink.
And, according to witnesses, they left the bar together.
We've also learned that the suspect was wearing old, worn-out clothes
and his hair was disheveled.
Is he very tall, this man?
It doesn't look like him.
He had an athletic physique.
Physical build is something you can't camouflage.
-Looks like we got him.
-That's true.
But, in fact, we've come to the conclusion...
that this person has no connection to the case.
Eh?
When we talked to Mr. Fukurokoji...
Well, now that you mention it, we hit it off right away, it's true.
But I'd say it was the first time I saw him.
That's right.
The first time?
It would make sense if you'd had a fight, but...
Hm.
Well, goodbye, Conan.
Can't be sure, though, can we?
The physical build was similar,
but we don't have a motive for the attempted murder.
-He's not the man we're looking for.
-And they'd just met.
I get it!
The man didn't mean to kill two birds with one stone.
What's that supposed to mean?
What was his motive?
Don't tell me that you're considering an unthinkable situation?
An unthinkable situation?
From a person like him, I wouldn't be surprised.
You said you wanted to talk to me.
What's it about?
I asked her to come, just like you asked me to.
What's that?
Sakiko.
Mr. Yukigaya, I understand that you do everything well.
You must be great.
Hm.
Ah... Man, I wouldn't go that far.
That's precisely why it must have tasted so bad to him
when you asked Sakiko to go out with you
and she said no, right?
-What are you getting at?
-Huh?

Is it true, what he says?
That's why he came up with a plan and carried it out.
Eh?
Mr. Komatsu...
It was most likely Mr. Yukigaya..,
who wrote you that love letter.
And he also pushed Mr. Fukurokoji.
-Eh?
-Huh?
He pretended to be a woman and sent her that letter.
Yesterday, when she left the bar with Mr. Fukurokoji,
who was totally drunk,
she made him go up to that rooftop
with the intention of dropping it on Mr. Komatsu.
He had lured it up here with the letter.
But in the end he couldn't kill him, even though it was his intention.
He wouldn't do it, something like that.
Why, why should he want to...?
Why should he?
Let's see, can you explain to me what I would gain, me, by killing in Komatsu?
What you wanted was to make Sakiko suffer.
-To make me suffer?
-You've got it right.
If your plan had worked,
neither Mr. Fukurokoji nor Mr. Komatsu would have gotten out alive.
I'm sure
that if Sakiko had seen that letter she would have despaired.
Komatsu would have died that way
because a woman had seduced her.
Excuse me.
I know this man.
Hitoshi!
Why? You're an idiot.
You're an idiot, why?
You wanted to see her suffer, you were dying for it.
This was your goal, wasn't it, Mr. Yukigaya?
That's why you asked Mr.
Komatsu that everything had the letter on it,
because it was an essential object
to cause Sakiko even more pain, right?
Oh!
Really?
Eh?
But...
If I had died carrying a letter written to me by a woman...
-Let's see if he realizes it once and for all.
-So that Sakiko should...?
-Eh?
-Huh?
Oh!
You did all this
because when you asked me out I said no?
Heh!
I couldn't forgive him for turning her down.
Especially a man so sure of himself,
who hadn't had any setbacks.
But, wait a minute.
Why did you want to kill Mr. Fukurokoji, too?
Anyone would have done well.
That's why you have no explanation.
If I had dropped a brick or any other object,
the police would have considered it a premeditated crime.
Therefore, he had to drop a person.
Even the police wouldn't think it would occur to them to think
that someone could use a human being as a weapon.
Yes, they would.
As a weapon?
He dropped Mr. Fukurokoji to kill Mr. Komatsu.
He used it as a weapon.
-Huh?
-Huh?
He was looking for someone who was useful to his target
and ended up finding Mr. Fukurokoji.
As he always said he wanted to die,
no one would be surprised if he had thrown himself off the building.
They would have thought he had decided to commit suicide.
Can you tell me what sense it makes
that people like him live among us?
In fact, his presence in this world is unpleasant.
Yukigaya, but what...?
Mr. Yukigaya, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
That's all.
You told us to come at 4 o'clock, didn't you, Conan?
Didn't you say half past 4?
By the way, what's over?
He practically just confessed
to the attempted murder of the two men.
Hm.
He's all but admitted it was him.
But without evidence they can't...
I mean, they can't accuse the culprit of anything.
Hm.
And because she's an exceptional person,
she hasn't left any trace or any incriminating evidence.
It seems to me that you are wrong.
From the first moment to the police we had this evidence,
but until now we still had no one to compare it to.
Hair?
Yes.
They were on Mr. Fukurokoji's jacket.
Maybe they got caught when...
Would you mind giving us a sample of your hair, Mr. Yukigaya?
That can't be right.
I left proof... in that bastard's jacket!
Even if these hairs you have are mine..,
think I have a thousand ways to justify it.
Hm.
But of course, I wouldn't do it, something so unpleasant.
Because it wouldn't be like me, to end things in an unsightly way.
Hahaha!
Daisuke...
But what's wrong with him, this man, now?
Oh...

Tell me well!
We've seen a case of bad luck turning into good luck.
-Good things are long overdue.
-Or a gift from heaven.
In the end it all turned out well.

No.

I got it too, now.
