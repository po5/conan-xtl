"Detective Conan" will reach the tenth anniversary and we are heading towards the eleventh!
It won't be long before the sun sets.
The doctor will meet the first love of the color of the gingkos?
He looks like a child but has the brain of an adult and is Detective Conan!

"At the doctor's house a letter appeared that he had received 40 years ago."
"It was from his first love,
"and it said that they could meet every 10 years at the place of their memories."
"A numerical code seemed to indicate the place where they were to meet."
"Coincidentally, we were on the appointed day 40 years later,
"And based on deductions, we went to the zoo."
Guys, we have to look hard!
Yes!
I'm sure it's in here!
It sure is!
It's Dr. Agasa's first love!
Guys, a little attention.
Guaita.
Can those numbers have anything to do with it?
The numbers that are on the plates with the names of the animals.
(At the same time) It's the flying squirrel!
(Ayumi) Doctor, there's someone!
It looks like it's waiting for a person!
A FIRST LOVE OF THE COLOR OF GINGKOS, (SECOND PART)
(Ayumi) Doctor, there's someone!
-It looks like she's waiting for a person!
She's not wearing any hat, but there's no doubt that it's her.
Au, you'll see her after 40 years.
Be brave.
Yes...
Excuse me... to disturb you, are you...?
Oh!
Oh!
Is that you, Hiroshi?
(At the same time) Eh?
A man?
Long time no see.
Did everything go well?
Excuse me: who are you?
Oh!
Don't be like that!
You've already forgotten me?
You often came to my house to see the hamster I had!
Don't tell me.
You are in Haruo de cales Chono?
What a joy!
You remembered me!
You didn't recognize me, did you?
That's logical.
When I went to school you were a brat 6 years younger than me.
What a thing you have!
Yes...
We seem to have made a mistake.
And listen: how come you're here today?
I'm here because I have a date with my boyfriend!
He loves rodents like squirrels or mice,
that's why we're meeting in front of the flying squirrels.
We've got the wrong person again?
But if it's somewhere in the zoo, we'll find her sooner or later.
Wait a minute...
We're in no condition to talk this quietly.
It's only an hour before sunset.
We'll have to get the Kogoro or the Sonoko to crack the code for us, won't we?
Can you get in touch?
Kogoro will be in the middle of the concert, so it's impossible with him...
And the Sonoko must be with the Ran, and with her yes, but...
Then call her, please!
Or they won't meet again for another 10 years!
(Thinks) "It won't do any good, but gee..."
(Mobile)
Yes, hello?
Ah, it's you, Conan.
Yes, although we're queuing up to buy Fusae's exclusive designs.
The Sonoko is here with you?
She's not here right now because she's gone to get hamburgers.
Ah... If she's not here, it's okay, bye-bye.
(At the same time) What?
He says he's not here.
No... it can't be.
Ran!
I got the burgers!
Hm.
Eh?
They were calling you?
What?
You married?
No!
It's not true!
It was Conan!
He called me Conan!
Yes, really!
Now in Conan I was wondering about you.
And what did he want?
He wanted to talk to you about something.
He said that if you weren't there, nothing would happen.
The trick?
It's not necessary.
Relating to that brat never leads to anything good...
But it's strange.
How come, you want to buy something branded?
Ah, it's nothing important.
I promised a person that I would buy something for him.

It was a long time ago, and we promised each other by holding our little finger.
(Megaphone: woman) "Miss Kinoshita, Miss Kinoshita,
"Dr. Agasa is waiting for you."
"Please go to the nocturnal animal ward."
Oh, dear.
Looks like he didn't come.
Is that so?
I appreciate your help.
Mm.
It was... it was the last resort we had.
Oh, Doctor!
You still don't remember?
-Wasn't this zoo a special place for you?
No, today is the first time I've been here.
What?
The girl on the postcard didn't come to the zoo?
No... But she really wanted to go.
From the beginning we didn't get the place right.
Well, you should have said it before.
I'm sorry, it's just that you are trying so hard that I was afraid to stop...
But I am satisfied.
Your memory will remain intact.
Yes, intact and just as beautiful as the first day in my heart.
And I wouldn't want him to see the way my head is, no, not at all.
(Mitsuhiko) Au, shall we go, already?
(Mitsuhiko) Oh!
(Mitsuhiko) Oh!
"Have, the hat."
"No! Don't look at me! Please!"
Badly done.
He must have fucked you good.
Doctor, what's wrong?
No, it's nothing... I remembered what his hair looked like.
His hair?
Yes, yes, he had black eyes,
but the color of her hair was different.
Rather than light brown, they were...
Blond.
I guess his father or mother was a foreigner, right, Conan?
That's why she always wore her hat pulled low.
"She didn't want to be left out because her hair was different."
I understand her perfectly...
because when I was in the United States they made me all colors...
just because I have an oriental face.
-Re-really?
-Huh?
So, you...
Yes, my mother was English.
Didn't I tell you?
Ayumi, let me have the postcard for a moment.
What's that?
Conan, have you found out anything?
-Conan.
"If we look at this code here,
"The meaning of these numbers may be..."
Dr. Agasa, did that girl's house have any pets?
Did they?
Yes... When she was a little girl, it looks like they had a dog.
But since it bit her hand, she told me they no longer had one.
Wait, wait, wait!
Conan, what happened?
(Thinking) "So, don't tell me.... Don't tell me this is it!"
"Then that's it. Right!"
"The meaning of the code is this right here!"
"I've got it, for sure."
"The place where she's waiting for her is one we know perfectly well."
"She's there!"
(Mitsuhiko) Eh?
You got it?
You know the place where she's waiting for her, the doctor's first love?
Yes.
If you try to decipher it....,
you'll see that it's a place we know very well.
-And what place is this?
-Us too?
5 strokes?
In Genta it was 5 times a week.
Every day I look at the pastry shop in front of my house...
I go to the grilled meat restaurant...
Say the answer at once, we are in a hurry!
It will only wait until sunset.
Don't be impatient!
By car it will only take 20 minutes to get there.
First, we have the back code of the postcard...
that indicates the place.
This 4.163, the 33, the 6 and the 0, which refers to an animal.
Eh?
And what does it mean?
It was neither the donkey nor the flying squirrel.
It's not the name of an animal.
It's the sound it makes, Genta!
The sound?
It's the number of letters in the sound of each animal.
The number of letters each animal's sound has?
Which animal has a sound with the 6 letters that the code says?
-The "cric-cric" is 8 letters.
-Cats make "meow", 3 letters.
This is the sound of a tiny animal: an insect.
Crows make "crack", 4 letters, and horses "hiii"....
In English, the mouse makes "squeak".
The mouse?
Didn't mice make "CRIE"?
Fixeu's-well.
It also says it to the explanation of the flying fox.
In English, the flying foxes make "squeak", as do the mice.
The parent was a foreigner.
And we can't be sure, but maybe he spoke English, no?
It happens to have 6 letters and that may be it.
-I get it.
-Of course you do.
That's true!
But there's no guarantee that this sound is what the mice make.
This is true, but the memories of the doctor,
has to do with animals...
Ah... I know!

The hamster!
So, the place where she waits for it is at Chono's house,
where she and the doctor were going to see the hamster often!
But the place of the code is supposed to be a place where I pass by very often.
-Besides, I've already told you.
-I don't know where it is, this house.
Wait, don't worry.
I waited for you there 20 years ago.
This is only the solution to one part of the code.
But we still have the animals of 4.163 and 33!
Is there an animal that has a sound with so many letters?
It means that you are thinking
the numbers 4-1-6-3 and 3-3 separately.
4-1-6-3 y 3-3.
A dog makes "woof", so it wouldn't match what we want.
The 3-3 could be min-min... and we'd already have half.
Wait a minute!
Could it be a chicken and a dog?
In English, the hen's sound is transcribed "cock-a-doodle-doo",
and the dog, "bow-wow",
and the number of letters would match.
"Cock-a-dodle-doo"?
But don't chickens do "co co"?
That's how it sounds to Americans.
This chicken thing sounds like elementary school.....
and the dog was at Chico's house, right?
Besides, she really liked taking care of the school chickens,
and the two of them were in front of Chico's house.
But we still haven't cracked zero.
Are there any animals that don't make noise?
It's not that it doesn't make noise, it's that there are no animals there!
I've got it.
It's in his house!
His parents had stopped having animals at home!
Then, the zero refers to the Kinoshita.
But to what place the ten wait?
You can't wait for him to 4 different places at the same time, can you?
Let's see, put these 4 places in order and connect them, come on.
Let's see... first... first, the school.
-Los Chono.
-The Chico.
The Kinoshita.
-from school,
-To the park...
-...the gingkos!
-... under...
(At the same time) In the school park under the gingkos!
Yes... She is probably waiting for him there.
Unless her feelings have weakened in these 40 years.
Hey, Conan..., there is nobody here.
That's strange... I'm sure she must have been here.
Well, it's only natural he's not here.
It's a promise from 40 years ago.
Doctor...
Eh?
It's stationary, though.
Yes, this white car.
(Ai) This morning it was standing here when we went to look at the rabbits.
-(Ai) I'm sure he's been waiting for her inside this car since this morning!
-(Ai) Yes!
-Come on, let's go take a look!
Wait, wait, wait!
There's nobody inside.
Maybe she's gone to get something to eat.
No... It's not that...
Although there's a hot coffee he must have ordered from a restaurant.
It looks like he finished eating just now.
Besides, there's plenty of food.
I hope you won't be too disappointed, if she's put on weight, will you?
How pretty she is.
I hope it's not that one over there.
That would be a pity.
-You've waited 40 years, haven't you?
-Doctor, what are you doing now?
Well, it... it doesn't mean it has to be her.
Au, go over there right now.
Excuse me, uh...
Fusae.
(At once) A... a man?
Hey, Billy, would you mind leaving us alone for a moment, please?
We understand.
No need to fuss.
Excuse me.
Uh... (clears throat) About that...
You have very nice grandchildren, you know?
Ah, well... About that, excuse me, but they are not.
This morning we happened to be passing by this street
and I stopped to look at this gingko tree.
I thought it was so wonderful that I came back here again.
Don't you like gingkos?
Ah, well, the truth is that I like them very much.
(Thinking) "Eh? Wait a minute."
"I could have sworn that this girl..."
(Girl) "Hello, girl."
"Girl, are you waiting for a person too?"
"No. It's just that I forgot my umbrella..."
"And I've taken shelter here until it stops raining."
"Ah, is it for this reason? Then you have it."
"I give you my umbrella."
"But if you give it to me, you'll get wet."
"That's all right. I feel like getting wet today."
"Then we'll do something."
"In exchange for the umbrella,
"You, when you grow up, you'll buy me a designer bag...
"And you'll give it to me as a gift, okay?"
"It must have the symbol of the gingko leaves."
"I'm not famous yet, but I'll strive to be."
"You promise?"
"Yes."
"Yes!"

"Hey, Ran! What are you doing?"
"Shinichi! Thank you very much for everything, ma'am!"
"If the woman from that time is this one here..."
"Yes, she's the one who made the promise to the doctor 40 years ago."
-Yes.
-Well then, goodbye.
My husband is starting to get jealous.
I'm sorry about that.
Doctor, how did it go?
-That was your first love, right?
But, doctor...!
Are you sure you want to leave, Fusae?
You've finally found the man you've been waiting for 40 years.
Yes... In the end I didn't tell him who I really was.
But it's only natural that I don't,
because... because he's already been able to raise a happy family.
If he knew that this fool has been waiting for him for 40 years...
I'm sure it would be very painful for him.
Gee, you seem to know him very well, this man,
even though it's been 40 years since you've seen him.
He, one day when my hat flew off....
"No! Don't look at me!"
"My hair... it's strange. They're not like those of the other children..."
"Are you sure?"
"I like them..."
"See? They're as pretty as gingko leaves!"
Surely... surely, he must have forgotten by now.
Forgive me, Billy...
You're just a friend of the man whose mother remarried...
and I've dragged you to join me every 10 years.
If I had told you no, my wife would have been mad at me.
She's a big fan of your brand.
But... today was the last time I asked you.
Can we go now?
Really... are you sure?
Do as I say... We're leaving.
Okay, then.
I like them madly, though, the gingkos!
Billy, something...
What do you want?
Maybe I'll come back... to ask you to come here for 10 years.
No... Surely it won't take that long to find again.
Gee, that was a tough code with a vengeance.
When a person thinks of one, they do it as they feel like it at the time.
Besides, when she came up with it, she was going to primary school.
He did it with a childish, buggy mentality.
Eh?
Oh, right...
Hey, you're a child too.
But Dr. Agasa's first love was a very pretty woman!
Yes.
(Think) "I've seen my gingko."
Doctor...
You're corny.
(At the same time) Kinoshita.
Although I like gingkos madly!
Stop it!
Don't laugh at the big ones!
No!
(Scoffing) Kinoshita.
I like gingkos madly!
(Ayumi) Who lives near that house.
-A white baseball cap?
- (at once) It's on Keiichi!
Do you deny it outright?
In Keiichi says he didn't leave the house yesterday or the day before yesterday.
"Why does he want to hide it?"
And the next Conan:
"The Junior Detective League and the four brothers (Part 1)."
("Thanks for everything")
