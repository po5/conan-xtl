(Kogoro) Ya.
Yes.
Of course.
Yes.
(Kogoro) Okay.
(Kogoro) Okay.
Of course, of course.
Yes, I'll gladly accept your offer.
What? Yes, of course you do.
Yes, of course you do.
Hey, Ran, what offer are you talking about?
From what I've sensed, you've been asked...
to go teach at "The World's Most Useful School".
What's that?
That's pretty cool.
(Thinking) "I can't believe it."
" 'The World's Most Useful School' is one of the flagship programs
of the Nichiuri Television network."
By the way, how much will I get paid for my intervention?
How much?
If it has to be like this, let me think about it.
"You can't just say no!"
What?
The Yoko Okino will be a member of the jury?!
Of course I will!
Of course I'll come!
I'll gladly come!
The money?
I don't give a damn.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Oh, Father.
"I see they didn't have much trouble convincing you."
"We'll melt the fog that surrounds love and crimes
to see them more clearly."
"Unbelievable: Kogoro is going to give lessons on TV!"
"The truth always comes out in the end."
"He looks like a child, but he has the brain of an adult and he's Detective Conan!"

"The most useful school in the world, (part one)."
Now I think this one is too flashy.
Maybe Yoko would have preferred the plain tie I always wear.
"No matter how much I change my tie..."
(Man) What are you doing?
Are you sleeping or what?
I don't know what you're waiting for.
Go faster.
Ah... Yes, excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Have you seen her?
That's the famous enka singer Shinra Kimijima.
That's true, but he looks very demanding and very unfriendly, doesn't he?
But think that Shinra Kimijima
is not only demanding of others:
He is especially so with himself.
That's why after so many years he's still the king of enka music.
"I can tell you're an expert on oldies music, right?"
Eh?
Hello, good morning, Mr. Mouri.
Long time no see!
Mr. Kamisuwa!
Last time was in Hiroshima.
Have your wounds healed?
Of course they have!
I'm all healed up.
So you'll be participating in the program today, Mr. Mouri.
Of course I will!
I suppose our producer has already told you about it,
but we'd like you to give us a lesson on how to protect ourselves against petty crime.
on how to protect ourselves against petty crime.
That's right, and since my name is Kogoro Mouri... I will give you a master class!
You must be Mr. Kogoro Mouri.
-It will be a pleasure to work with you, too.
Soc in Yoshinari Hashimoto, the assistant principal.
(Door: knock)
This is where you are to wait.
Come in.
Eh?
I'll make the introductions.
This is Mr. Mouri, who will give the first lesson.
Mr. Satoshi Yamazaki will give the second lesson of today's program.
Good morning, my name is Kogoro Mouri.
Good morning, Mr. Yamazaki.
Here is my card.
Puffed rice manufacturer?
Wow, I thought it wasn't made anymore.
I thought they didn't make puffed rice anymore.
Yes, it is.
My father left me his factory as an inheritance,
and it seems that kids today still like puffed rice.
I'll show you how to make it later, my boy.
And this other gentleman is called Kentaro Honma and he will give the third lesson.
-How do you do?
My name is Kogoro Mouri, and I'm pleased to meet you.
I'm in the business of appraising art and antiques, but I don't carry cards.
It's too bad for me.
About that... Ahem.
I don't see Yoko Okino.
She hasn't arrived?
Yes, but she's in the jury waiting room on the eleventh floor.
What?

Isn't it here?
Aaaaah...
"What did you think? That they would put them together?"
Soon I will come to pick them up
to rehearse a little bit your interventions.
In the meantime, here are bentos for lunch.
Wow!
Yoko's waiting room is on another floor.
Well, look, I'm going to say hello to her.
What?
With the bento and everything?
Where should it be, the jury waiting room?
I don't understand, Father.
If you just want to greet her, why did you take the lunch?
What a question!
If I took the bento, it's because I plan to eat with her.
When I saw that pair upstairs, I suddenly lost my appetite.
I thought you'd tell me that.
"Of course. And that's why we took the food too."
Yes.
Yes.
All right, okay.
- (Kogoro) Let's see... - Eh?
I wanted to ask you
where is the waiting room where Yoko Okino is.
(Kogoro) Oh!
Aren't you Conan, you?
(Kogoro) Oh!
Mr. Takikawa!
What's the matter?
You know him?
Yes.
He's a professor at the university and a friend of Dr. Agasa.
I'm here for a meeting to talk about a program we're going to do.
And what are you doing here, Conan?
Mr. Mouri will give a lesson
in a program called "The most useful school in the world"...
and we've come to accompany her.
Ah, very good.
By the way, Miss Yoko Okino hasn't arrived at the studio yet.
What?
Not yet?
Well, goodbye and all the best.
She's not here, though.
This is bad luck.
Do yourself a favor.
Instead of thinking about her,
you should think about the main presenter, Mr. Sakai.
Eh?
That's right.
I'm leaving right now.
"With the food up and down."
(Kimijima) How about this?
Wow!
I think it must be an object of great value.
Aren't you impressed?
I'm not at all surprised.
It's a very old Chinese vase, from the Qing Dynasty.
-From the Qing dynasty? -Yes, sir.
It was created during the reign of the sixth emperor of this dynasty,
the great Qianlong, a lover and protector of many arts.
(Door: knock)
Yes, come in.
Ah... Good morning, I am Kogoro Mouri.
I've come to greet you, Mr. Sakai.
Oh!
Excuse me, but could you come later?
We're having a very important conversation right now.
"I see that Shinra Kimijima
must also be on the jury for today's program."
Sorry to have interrupted you.
What a coincidence that we found you here, Mr. Kimijima!
We were just talking about you a moment ago.
Ha-ha-ha!
I guess you weren't supposed to say nice things.
No, on the contrary!
The first record I ever bought,
which was when I was still going to school in short underwear,
was the one with his very famous song
"Men must have courage. Attack me if you dare".
I see you have good judgment.
You just won a few points, Mr. Mouri.
"Now it turns out you're a fan of en Kimijima."
Well, Mr. Kimijima, I'm off, I have to get ready for the show.
Well, well, well!
If you have to go...
-What, do you like Chinese vases? -Huh?
-Well, I'll see you here for a while. -Okay.
You can get ready now, this man won't stop talking.
Oh.
All right, then.
Au, bye, huh?
What, are you coming with me?
(Kogoro) Huh?
(Kogoro) Well yes, it's a very good song.
It explains very well what it's like to be a real man.
Mm.
(Kogoro) Yes, it does.
(Kogoro) "My goodness! This pair are made for each other."
Wait, you want me to help you? Shinobu.
Can't you see you keep the guests waiting?
Hurry up and serve the tea.
Yes, yes, master.
Right away.
I didn't want to hurry you.
Mmm!
By the way, now that I see that vase,
I imagine that a piece like this must be very valuable.
Yes, I just brought it...
for Mr. Honma to make an appraisal during his lesson.
Who is this Mr. Honma?
Ah, yes!
It's that unpleasant one we met upstairs.
It's true that Mr. Honma is not very nice, to begin with,
but when it comes to valuing art objects,
there aren't many better than him.
By the way, remember Mr. Hanamura?
that expert who was recently exposed
in a case in which he was also involved in Kaito Kid?

These two experts are like night and day.
There are many people who admire Chinese porcelain of this era,
so the value of the pieces is always very high.
In this case it's between 100 million yen
to 160 million yen as the maximum value.
How many million yen?
What? No way!
Aaaah!
How can this be?
What a million yen!
"In fact, I recently heard on the news...
"That at an auction they held in Britain..,
"A vase that was also from the Qing Dynasty
sold for 57 billion yen."
"Such a valuable object would make even Kaito Kid go crazy."
"But it seems to me that porcelain vases don't interest him."
(Men: talking at once)
What a thrill!
This is where they record "The World's Most Useful School".
Oh!
It's just like on TV.
Sure, woman.
Although I expected her to be older.
They say that on TV everything always looks older.
Yes, it's true.
Father, don't you look at the script?
What?
I don't need a script. Why do you say that?
This is the machine for making puffed rice?
The second lesson today
is about making puffed rice the old-fashioned way.
The art of turning rice, wheat and corn...
into a sweet treat.
It says it right here.
Hey, how does it work, the puffed rice machine?
I'd rather not explain it now, to keep the intrigue going.
"This is a puffed rice machine?"
"I guess it's one of those that do it by decompression."
"The grains of rice must be closed in this container.
"At very high pressure,
"And then the pressure is suddenly lowered...
and this makes the big ones burst."
"I had not seen any of these machines up close."
(Kimijima) Good morning, Mr. Honma.
Just think, I am putting myself in your hands today.
Today's third lesson is about the valuation of works of art.
And you will also talk about the technique of making forgeries.
We have gathered a few fake works and a few authentic ones,
and we will ask Mr. Honma to examine and appraise them.
The ones above this table
are the forgeries brought by Mr. Honma himself.
The authentic one is a vase of Mr. Kimijima;
that one.
What do you think of this?
Look at it.
It's a nice piece, isn't it?
Let's see.
Let me feel it.
It's perfect.
-May I know how you got it? -Ha!
Well, well, Mr. Honma!
I see it's an interesting piece.
Please don't say any more.
Keep the appraisal for the program.
Of the forgeries you have taken,
we have chosen these 3 to make the program.
As you wish.
"Now I understand."
"Here's why Mr. Kimijima
has brought his valuable vase into these studios."
The presenters have arrived:
Mr. Sakai, Mr. Ueda and Mr. Arita.
Good morning, everyone.
I am Mr. Sakai.
I hope we can all make a good program today.
I'm Mr. Ueda.
Nice to meet you.
And I'm Mr. Arita.
Good morning to all of you.
I am pleased to meet you, presenters.
Nice to meet you, too.
Yes, we're all here, we could start.
First we will rehearse a little bit each lesson.
We'll go in order and we'll do Mr. Kogoro Mouri's lesson first.
-Ah. -Good morning, everyone!
Ooooh!
That's her!
It's Yoko!
Ah!
It's really Yoko Okino.
Yoko, you don't have to do anything at this part.
If you want, you can come later.
I know, but I was looking at the script in the waiting room...
and I saw that the first lesson was Mr. Mouri's.
What do my ears feel?!
Did he really come to see me specifically?
Ah... Yes, I wanted to say hello...
Come on, let's start the rehearsal, then.
You can tell me what I have to do right now.
A-a-see.
Let me look at the script.
To begin with, tell us a little bit about self-defense techniques.
Yes, right now!
The father's in high spirits, huh?
"If he keeps this up, he won't even last the rehearsal."
He's here too, Conan and Ran? Yes.
We came to watch.
-I've been running so much, I'm sweating.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? What do you think you're doing?
Oh! You can't take pictures without permission.
Don't you know that?

Just... I-I-I-I...
Hey, you!
Did you take pictures of Yoko Okino?
Hey, Father...
I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm a big fan of Yoko.
Well, if this is true, why don't you respect her?
"How strong!"
A big person like you should know that you don't take pictures on the sly.
Shame on you!
But listen, you didn't have to break my cell phone.
It's not right.
I'm going home.
Listen to me.
Wait a moment.
Please, please.
Mr. Yamazaki, don't take it like that.
Don't worry, Yoko.
We'll fix it.
I'll go wait for you there.
Okay, okay, okay.
Mr. Mouri, please continue your rehearsal.
Okay, okay, okay.
Mr. Kimijima, make it easy for us, huh?
I'll buy you a new cell phone,
but please do me a favor:
learn your lesson and don't take any more photos on the sly.
It's very bad for me.
(Kimijima) What are you saying?
You don't have to apologize.
You savage!
Mr. Kimijima's vase, the 3 forgeries...
Let's see, what else do we need?
Hey, I've been told that there's a very valuable vase around here.
-I want to see it. Hey, don't touch it.
Is this it?
Can't I take it?
No, you can't pick it up and you can't touch it without gloves.
-Yes, just a little bit. No, I said no!
No!
Well, now we'll start the rehearsal of the second lesson.
-Mr. Yamazaki, go ahead, sisplau. - Yes.
My goodness, that Kimijima is really tough.
Fortunately, we managed to get Yamazaki to calm down a bit.
Yes, I was afraid we wouldn't be able to record the program today.
But he did a very bad job of photographing Yoko Okino on the sly.
Well, I'm about to.
And now!
You're leaving, Mr. Honma?
This doesn't interest me at all.
That's what he says.
What happens is that he's afraid.
What?
He's afraid?
-Miss Okino, take this maça. -Yes, okay.
And now pour a very strong one here, please.
What's that?
What's that for?
Just watch and shut up.
I don't know, but I think you'd better cover your ears, Ran.
I can't ask why?!
Everybody ready?
Come on!
Aaaah... I've gone deaf.
Wow!
So, does it work?
Hey, how did you know, Conan?
It's just... I saw it on a TV report.
(Shinobu) Wow, what a loud noise!
I didn't expect it.
Neither did I.
Listen, I wanted to apologize for what happened in the waiting room.
Mr. Kimijima scolded you because of me.
I'm sorry for that.
Don't be sorry.
You don't need to apologize.
(Kimijima) Don't make me repeat myself.
Yes.
Yes.
I already told you that you didn't have to worry.
Mr. Kimijima is very strict, but he is the best teacher there is,
and I have great respect for him.
This girl looks very worried.
I know that because her name is Oki and I call myself Okino,
there seems to be a special connection between us.
We have met before in these studios and we always talk.
Why does she always go with Mr. Kimijima?
Maybe she is his disciple?
Yes, he teaches her, and besides,
he's the one who gave her the name Shinobu Oki.
Now I understand why she has a name typical of an enka singer.
Poor thing!
She has been working for a long time to make her debut, but she can't make it.
The other day she even told me that, since she had no talent, she would let it go and become a singer,
she would let it go and go back to her hometown.
What a pity! (Runners)
-Mr. Kamisuwa, we have a problem. Now what happened?
What happened?
Mr. Kimijima's mug is missing?!
Eh? What does it say?
"That Chinese vase is missing?"
I don't know how it happened.
Nobody saw anything, but it's gone.
(People: whispering)
(People: whispering) What is it?
Something has happened here.
I don't understand how it could have disappeared.
While rehearsing the first lesson it was here.
-Isn't it true, Mr. Arita? -Yes. -What? -Yes.
Yes.
-How do you know? -No... it's not important.
I don't understand what the hell happened.
I do understand: someone has stolen my vase.
Let's not be hasty.
Although...
I want to know right now who stole my Chinese vase!
Say, Mr. Sakai, was it you?
Pepe-why should I have stolen?

Why should I have stolen?
Well, because when I went up to show it to him,
I saw that you were very interested.
Master, please calm down.
"Assuming it is true that someone has stolen the vase,
"During the whole rehearsal I haven't seen anyone leaving these studios
with a bag or suitcase big enough to hide the vase inside."
"This means that the thief is still with us, now," he said,
"And that the Chinese vase that's gone missing
must also be somewhere in these studios."
But I know
Namida wo koraeteru su Zutter.

Mr. Mouri has the solution!
I'm sure you'll find the vase, Mr. Mouri.
Yes, I will find it, of course!
I'm sure this man is hiding something.
I'm leaving this cricket pot.
"Does he know something we don't?"
Today's recording is cancelled.
(Kogoro voice) One moment, please!
It will be dismantled later, the set.
First we must solve the case.
Don't miss the next episode:
"The most useful school in the world, (part two)".
