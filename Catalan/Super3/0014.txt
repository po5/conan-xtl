"My name is Conan Edogawa."
"I used to be Shinichi, a young detective,
until they made me drink a potion that made me shrink."
"Today's case is of a secret code."
"There is only one truth!

DETECTIVE CONAN
A very mysterious message
(Genta) I can't!
I can't!
Come on, come on!
They're here, they're here, look!
I've got one!
I missed it again.
We've caught a few, right?
Yes.
This place is fantastic!
I'm really hungry, come on what time is it?
It's one o'clock now.
Shall we start eating?
Hey, what's this?
-It looks like a remote control. Where are they making it go from?
A rifle!
A group of men.
There, on top of the building.
Hey, Conan!
Let-let me see.
Come on, boy!
There's nobody there now.
Sure, that a man shot with a rifle, Conan?
And that man touched the balloon from here?!
He's a good shot!
Maybe he was just practicing, Conan.
Or he was training for something.
He was training?
And he was forced to.
Forced?
The other two were pointing a gun at him.
What are you saying now?
What are you doing?
I'm looking to see if they've left any clues.
These are numbers!
Yes, it must be a message
that must have been left by the man who fired the rifle.
A message?
He noticed me.
He saw me looking through the binoculars.
We thought it might mean, all these numbers.
Anyway, I'll have to explain to Inspector Megure.
Are you sure you touched the balloon from here?
Yes.
I saw him point the rifle at it.
And they left this calculator behind.
Listen, it could be that the man had kidnapped it...
and taken her here.
It looked to me like she was being forced to shoot.
There's nothing we can do because there's been no report.
And I don't see any evidence that a rifle was fired.
What's that?
Please take a better look.
In the river.
The bullets must be over there.
The remote-controlled boat, it'll be there, too.
Sorry, guys, but it's a vacation,
and many researchers are out of town.
We'll do one thing: I'm going to analyze this calculator.
How's that sound?
All right, I'm off.
Give my regards to Mouri.
Well... He didn't believe a thing, this inspector!
What does "an idyllic dream trip with the Heisei Express" mean?
It's misleading advertising!
What a rage!
I don't get it!
Of course you don't!
So this is no message.
Someone must have neglected it there.
Nano's pussy!
Do the inspector came on a holiday!
Enough, father!
If it were true that that man was forced to do shooting,
and that he left you a message,
what do you think he would tell you?
The day and the place where he should shoot.
Or perhaps a clue as to where he is being held.
Like those secret "wanted" codes, right?
I know one, 3135134.
313 means Moe;
513, Larry and 4 Curly.
So, the targets would be these 3, right?
Not funny!
The number 162 could correspond to a hotel room number.
Or maybe, it could be...
It could be highway 162.
And what do the numbers 3135134 in front of it mean, then?
I may be wrong, but they could be to disguise 162,
in case the criminals saw it.
And if it were...
Come to think of it, the shape of the river is like the shape of a street
and the flow of water, like traffic.
(Think) "National Highway 162!"
"Kyoto?!"
"Too far."
"It must be by the metropolitan area. And it must be a general highway."
Yes!
Saitama District Road 162!
That's good!
You've figured it out!
We're counting on you tomorrow!
With me?
Why me?
Do me a favor!
Why do I have to rent the car myself? Because we don't have a driver's license.
Hey, isn't he a detective, this man?
Well, he should have a car.
But he has no money.
It seems to me that he doesn't drive very often...
Put your seat belt on.
Listen, kids... what...?
You look at the road!
The curve is different.
It's not here.
And it's not here either.
It's not here either.
It doesn't look anything like it.
It is not here.

What if we let it run, guys?
The shape of a river can't match the shape of a road.
You said that "the river's current resembles the traffic on a road"!
This, I said?
Anyway, there are no more curves in the shape of that one.
We might as well turn and... Oh!
Oh!
There are works.
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Where are you going, Conan?!
(Thinking) "Is this..."
"This building is also on the national 162."
It's here! You're right!
-I'm sure! -Conan, you've found it!
What?!
You found it?!
Come on, inform the inspector that Conan has found the place.
Why me?
Because you are a famous detective, and the inspector trusts you a lot.
Very famous, eh?
Mmmm, how you know how to brush me off, Conan.
Anyway, I guess I'll...
...I'll give him a call.
(Phone)
Megure, say.
Ah, Mouri, it's you.
You've got great timing!
Come to headquarters!
And take Conan!
Eh?!
I have to tell you something that can help us.
A policeman who was on vacation and his girlfriend have disappeared.
Look, it's this man.
Inspector!
It's the sniper!
I thought so.
I've had the fingerprints taken off the calculator
and confirmed it.
Koichi Yamabe, he participated in the Olympics in the shooting event.
An Olympic shooter?
It is likely that in addition to Yamabe, his girlfriend has been kidnapped.
She is said to be Eri.
She must be held hostage to force in Yamabe to kill someone.
Then, in Conan he saw a shooting test.
It must be exactly what you were saying, Conan.
But we can't do anything if we don't know when or where they want to commit the crime.
-If you're referring to the building... (all) -We know where it is!
(all) -What?
What do you say?
He's right, it looks a lot like it.
It could be here.
Very well done, children!
Inspector!
Me, I've led you here!
But we still don't know the day or the time.
Yes, you're right.
About one o'clock you shot the balloon, right?
That's right!
The time must be one o'clock!
But what day?
There are two hostages.
We won't solve anything, here, chatting!
They will surely commit the crime tomorrow!
Bravo!
I'll prepare all the troops for tomorrow!
But Conan, what's wrong with you? Ah... Nothing, don't worry.
(Think) "Surely it corresponds to the 162nd road, this number?"
"It would be logical for that man to add the place and the day and the hour."
"It is necessary to be."
"No matter how much I rack my brains, I don't understand what 3135134 means."
Until he believes you the order, let no one lift a finger.
-Entesos. -Okay.
There's a helicopter with a sniper team on the riverbank.
If they want to do it at one o'clock, they'll come around 12 o'clock
to prepare the action in orderly fashion.
There's still an hour to go... patience.
You see, inspector, the children have invited themselves.
Do not get out of the van no matter what!
Let me sit down...!
(At the same time) We already know, heavy!
No... not this shouting!
There are 30 minutes left.
What will happen?
The criminals do not appear.
Maybe, this time you've made a mistake, Conan.
-What?
-It can't be, that!
This is what we get for believing
the imaginations of a child who wants to be a detective.
Shut up, father!
I think it was... 3135134162, right?
3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1...
Mitsuhiko, let me have that. Tea.
"Sure... now I get it."
You saw it, Conan, it's upside down.
Is that so?
Yes, it is!
Here you can even read the numbers upside down.
What nonsense are you doing?
Look, 162 is 291.
And the other numbers can be letters.
Let me see, let me see.
2-9-1... Hei a-y.
Looks like a word.
Eh ?!
Heisei... Mmmm, yes, it sounds very familiar, this word.
Remember that magazine you were reading yesterday.
The Heisei Express!
Probably, the abductee wrote this message
because we read it backwards.
And 291 is the 29th at one o'clock! What are you saying?!
This is the message we were looking for.
This resource should have come to him while they had it closed.
Inspector!
Quickly!
Hurry up!
Go get the helicopter!
Oh, yes, you're right!
(Megaphone) "Gentlemen passengers, the express train from Tokyo to Heisei

Will be coming out shortly on track number two."
Thank you very much, sir!
-Miss!
-Yes, say?
Father, go, your, that train will set off!
Calm down, boys.
It goes like silk.
In the first car, the front seats.
It's time.
What is it?
Where is it, Conan?
Hey, hey, hey!
What a ?!
It must already be to the helicopter!
But what?!
How did you get up here?
We won't make it in time if we don't hurry.
Let's go!
Here, put this on.
It's fat.
Ah!
We're already on the track.
Come closer and follow it northbound.
Three minutes to go.
And we haven't even reached the curve!
She's coming.
Hey, if you do anything stupid, your girlfriend will die!
Only one minute to go! Inspector!
Look over there!
Over there!
It's them!
Come on down!
What's the matter?!
What's the matter?!
Don't think!
Hurry up!
Shoot!
You bastard!
You'd better calm down, or I'll kill her!
Wait a minute!
You could play at Yamabe! Yes, sir.
(Think) "It's not windy!"
"Helicopter at 5 meters."
"Level... medium, I think."
"Distance, 30 meters."
Get ready!
That's it!
What are you doing?
It's dangerous!
Fuck you!
You bastard!
Game over!
Surrender!
-Koichi... -eris...
How fortunate that your helmet fell and touched the delinquent!
Don't let it fall on the way back!
Yes!
(Thinking) "I'm not very lucky..."
Thank goodness nothing happened to you!
-Why are you going to your?
-We have to do things together!
Hello, Conan!
Sorry, excuse me.
Hello...
Conan!
I'm sick of you always sneaking out!
-You're all right, you're all right! -You're all right! -Dolent!
Now you'll see!
Vineeee!
(Tune from "Step by Step")
DETECTIVE CONAN
The criminals we have arrested
had been members of the "devil tigers" gang.
Last year they imprisoned its head and some members
and the organization was disbanded.
It was a very effective action.
So, you were after the prosecutor?
He was returning from a trip with his family.
The motive was revenge.
Once again, congratulations, Kogoro!
Man, it's no big deal... it was easy...
He thinks he did it all himself.
But maybe now we'll convince him to take us on vacation.
Where do you want to go?
To an amusement park!
(He thinks) "Gee, it's not easy at all, playing the role of a child..."
Aaaaaaaah!
There's a dead body!
The corpse... it's gone!
-It has disappeared! -But how can it be?
Come on, let's go home!
Wait, please!
We've seen her!
Sure, and I've been a fool to believe it, Conan.
No, the corpse is here... for sure.
A clue to the next episode: pick up the phone!
