We now come
to the main attraction of today's auction!
An internationally famous treasure of mankind!
The long lost believed
"Sunflowers"
of Vincent van Gogh!
What's the deal with these sunflowers?
I thought they were burned during the war?
I ask you to be quiet!
We will explain it to you in more detail in a moment.
During his stay in Arles
Van Gogh made several paintings of sunflowers.
This is the second painting in the series.
For a long time it was said that it was painted in 1945
during the war in Ashiya, Japan,
But last year a work of identical composition was discovered in Arles.
The opinions of all the experts who were consulted showed,
that this painting was undoubtedly painted by van Gogh himself.
by his own hand.
So, ladies and gentlemen!
Breathe new life into these "Sunflowers" now!
We start the auction of Vincent van Gogh's legendary
second sunflower painting
with a starting price of $10 million!
They start right at 10 million?!
And it will go up in increments of 100000!
If I had that kind of money, I'd fly into space with it!
20 million from a phone bidder.
20.5 million from an internet bidder!
50 million dollars!
- Well, that's... - A famous buyer of famous paintings!
100 million dollars!
Didn't you hear me? 100 million dollars.
I bid 100 million!
100.1 million? Is anyone offering $100.1 million?
Damn it... Who's the old man with the moustache?
- What do we do now? - Never mind.
It gets critical at 200 million.
Well, then...
200 million dollars!
- There's Suzuki! - Here! $200 million!
Uh... Unless I misheard,
number 705 bids $200 million...
That's the famous...
Mr. Suzuki!
The Internet bidders haven't come yet...
Hey, Uncle Jirokichi! You're shocking everyone!
I don't like to waste time shopping.
D... you call this "shopping"...
We don't have to wait for the Internet.
Three hundred million dollars.
I bid 300 million dollars!
That's the hammer price, the hammer price!
The winning bid is 300 million dollars!
- Before our interview with... - Conan-kun, it's starting!
- Hurry! -... "Sunflowers," which sold today at a record price....
What have you invented this time?
- It's not a robot, is it? - Turn it on, Professor!
- Let's get started then. - Yes, with pleasure.
Why hasn't
this work of art not come to light until recently?
Because it was believed
that the painting was lost during the Second World War.
Lost?
But... Maybe the painting is a fake?
No, they just kept saying it was lost.
Take a look at this.
An article from last year.
A painting was discovered near Arles that was thought to be a van Gogh.
was thought to be a van Gogh.
I remember.
It was found in the attic of an old farmhouse, wasn't it?
Yes. It was this very second sunflower painting.
Come on, let's get started!
Whoo-hoo!
I brought one as big as possible.
We push the buttons here...
I wonder if grilled eel will come out?
I don't think that's possible.
Couldn't the picture be a fake?
Well, experts are always very careful in such cases.
Before the auction, the painting was carefully examined.
The result was that the same canvas was used for the painting
as the other van Gogh paintings from Arles.
Better than grilled eel? An extra portion of it?
Why does it have to be eel?
Look, it's ready!
- Nanu? - Still a melon. - Another failure?
The best is yet to come.
Kamen Yaibâ!
- Oh! - Wow!
It's Kamen Yaiba!
- Really cool! - How did you do that?
What are you doing, Professor... You have more important things to invent...
...a fake Ashiya?
Yes...
This possibility exists absolutely.
In addition, the hypothesis is now also being put forward again,
that van Gogh painted not seven,
but eight sunflower paintings.
The ones auctioned today and the "Ashiya Sunflowers"....
According to this thesis
one of the two could be a copy painted by van Gogh himself.
Does it happen that a painter copies his own works?

Right. Three of the seven "sunflowers" that still exist today
"Sunflowers" are copies
- and each one was made by van Gogh himself. - Van Gogh is nice...
But do show some interest in the professor's work....
It's quite a work of art.
- And the critics seem to like it. - Done!
Oh, the press conference is about to begin!
We are now broadcasting live from New York the press conference.
We would like to welcome Jirokichi Suzuki, who has sovereignly secured
for the "Sunflowers",
for a few words of comment.
I am very pleased that I have succeeded in making this purchase at the highest price ever for a work of art.
for a work of art as planned.
So the purchase at a price of $300 million was planned?
That's exactly how it is.
I did all this just to
to hold a "Sunflowers" exhibition in Japan.
An exhibition?
The van Gogh sunflowers scattered all over the world
van Gogh sunflowers scattered around the world, our Suzuki Group wants to gather them all together
and display them in our Lake Rock Museum at the exhibition
"The Sunflowers that Yearned for Japan" exhibit.
We're announcing that today!
Miss Suzuki. How many paintings are we talking about specifically?
So the award today was part of that plan?
Yes. We planned it all this way,
to announce our exhibition at this venue today.
And we will gather seven "Sunflowers", including those acquired today!
counting them!
What, seven?!
Even the most powerful Japanese corporation can't do that!
Do not worry. The project is already well advanced.
We have already contacted museums and
and private owners of "Sunflowers" all over the world that we are planning to
that we plan to show the "Sunflowers" together.
And these have informed us
have already given us firm assurances that they will cooperate with us.
that they will cooperate with us.
In addition, we have
assembled a team of seven experts
to guarantee perfect preservation and transport as well as safety.
Seven experts?
These are the "Seven Samurai" that I have
have assembled for today!
These ladies and gentlemen are your "Seven Samurai"?
That's right. They all belong to the elite of specialists trained in the Netherlands and
France trained specialists. These are the places
where van Gogh worked.
From left: Responsible for history and appraisal of paintings,
Ms. Natsumi Miyadai.
It is an honor.
Another painting expert is
responsible for restoration and conservation:
Mr. Kôji Azuma.
Next, the person in charge of planning the exhibition:
Ms. Keiko Anderson.
My name is Keiko, very pleased.
The transport of the paintings is led by
Mr. Taizô Ishimine.
I am Ishimine.
And the exhibition concept and presentation
and presentation will be Ms. Kumiko Kishi.
I will make this exhibition a success.
And as the person in charge of security, we were able to get
Commissioner Charlie from the New York City Police Department.
I will protect the "Sunflowers."
Uh... You mentioned "Seven Samurai" earlier...
But there are only six people standing here.
The seventh is responsible for security
after the paintings arrive in Japan.
His name is...
Kogorô Môri!
Of all people, the old man is the Seventh Samurai?
Probably because "Kid Killer" is pretty sure to be in on it too, right?
Really?
- Good luck, my dear Kikuchiyo. - Oh! How great!
Sonoko-neesan is on TV!
It's true!
- Let's watch it, come on! - Yes!
Will you exhibit your "Sunflowers" too,
if you can't get all seven paintings together?
No. We'll do the exhibition only with all seven.
- But then... - Don't worry.
I have been dreaming about this exhibition for a long time.
And there is no dream
that I can't make come true!
D... that's not...
Kids card!
- What's wrong with him? - He's got a gun.
Get security!
Put the gun on the ground!
Didn't you hear me? Put the gun on the ground!
Oh, no?!
- Hey, you can't see anything! - Something seems to have happened.
Kid-sama!!
Kid!
Freeze! Or I'll shoot!
What's going on?
Stop or I'll shoot!
Stop or we'll shoot!
We've got the Kid on the 103rd floor corridor!
Kid!
Put the gun on the floor! Quick!

Good. Now, very slowly, raise both hands.
And kneel there.
Can't you hear? Hands up where we can see them!
Kid-sama!
Good, that's it.
Slowly. Keep it up.
Wha...?!
Stop right there, Charlie!
Damn it! That miserable Kaitô Kid...
He must have gotten away.
There was a commotion, but no one was hurt.
- The police... - What? It's over already?
Did the Kid steal the Sunflowers?
That's strange.
Isn't the Kid usually after jewels?
I only caught a glimpse of him...
But was it really the Kid?
There seems to be some trouble?
Wha... what are you doing here?
I heard the Kid was after the Sunflowers.
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to help you out.
DETECTIVE CONAN THE INFERNO'S SUNFLOWERS
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was with my friend Ran
at the amusement park,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on it,
I didn't notice the man behind me.
He was administering a poison to me.
When I awoke...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised me not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked what my name was,
I spontaneously said: Conan Edogawa.
In order to track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father is a detective.
By the way, there is another person besides the professor,
who knows who I really am:
Ai Haibara.
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She originally once belonged to the men in black.
To escape from them,
she swallowed the same poison as me
and shrank as well.
And also...
Kaitô Kid and his henchman...
We still have a score to settle with them.
To my honor as a detective:
This time I'm going to catch those guys!
I'm small, but my mind isn't!
No case remains unsolved!
There's always...
one truth!
Our plane will soon be landing
at Haneda Airport shortly.
Please stow your carry-on luggage for the landing
under your seat or in the overhead compartment
or in the overhead compartment.
This is the secured dummy.
You seem amused?
My uncle is happy about every colleague
who Kid-sama also tricks.
What?
But is it really okay?
Even the flight attendants are only allowed in here in case of emergency.
But this boy, you just let him...
Yes, yes. That boy is a master detective and a representative of Japan.
You have nothing to worry about.
What if the Kid were in disguise?
Her stature is similar...
You're really a little over-worried.
Watch me closely.
See?
What the hell do you think you're doing, dude?
Charlie don't trust you, boy...
Why does that Yank have to fly with us anyway?
He was only supposed to protect the painting until we got to the plane.
So he doesn't need to come to Japan!
In fact, my contract only covers protection in the States.
But now,
now that we know that's where the Kid's headed, I can't just...
I can't just abandon him.
And that's exactly why I chose you as a samurai.
Protect the Sunflowers...
Yes. You can count on me.
If Kid Killer gets involved..,
we'll be out of the frying pan and into the fire.
Natsumi-san, are you okay?
J... Yes... I feel a little sick...
Then you'd better walk around the cabin for a while.
Come on! Sitting here is not good.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
To the toilet.
Really! Why did he take such a flashy plane..,
when the Kid might be after her?
We in the police also advised him not to attract attention, but....
Apparently, it's not just transportation, it's advertising.
You should have stopped him, Inspector Nakamori!
Do you really think that old man still listens to me?
Well, it can't be helped...
So?
So that's what they're coming back in?
Are the Sunflowers on this plane too?
Really. Why do you always have to follow us around?
It's not his fault!
Jirokichi-san insisted that Conan-kun come along.
He didn't?
After all, Conan-kun is the Kid Killer!
Really... Don't be so silly and superstitious!
Just don't move around, okay?

You're just like a little encore, right?
Yahaaa...
Run! Take good care of the little brat, will you?
I always do...
Who's that? Excuse me...
Ah, Sonoko?
Oh, Ran?
We're about to land, but
but I wanted to tell you something great first.
It's supposed to be a surprise,
so I'm not supposed to tell you, but...
Yes... Yes...
What? Shin'ichi is with you?!
N... just because Shin'ichi is also on board with you, doesn't mean I have to...
Sonoko, is Shin'ichi with you?
Yes, he was sitting over there until just now...
What was that?
- Sonoko! What's going on? Sonoko! - What's wrong, Ran?
Well... I heard screaming and then a huge crash!
What?! Inspector Nakamori! Come here!
- Something seems to have happened on the plane! - What?
- We haven't heard anything yet... - Did the Kid...
It's really not working.
Ailerons and slats on the right wing are not responding!
Then don't.
Stop number four engine immediately.
- And losh the flames! - Yes!
A man?!
This is tower. Engine 2501, roger.
Runway A is clear. Can you make it?
This is aircraft 2501. We're trying.
Clear the area to be safe!
All clear. Message to all aircraft!
Check fuel and clear area immediately!
- Hurry up! We don't have time! - Yes!
- To all machines... - Damn...
Even if they make it here...
They'll overshoot the runway!
I hope they make it!
Ladies and gentlemen, due to engine problems...
we will be descending to an emergency landing altitude.
Double check to make sure your seat belts are secure.
15000 feet!
10,000 feet!
Okay!
K... Kid-sama?!
What? Kid? Where is he?
Where is this Kid, damn it? Where is he?
- Kid, he says? - Did the Kid show up?
- Hello? Hello? Commissioner Nakamori, emergency!
The plane's really in trouble!
It's about to attempt an emergency landing on runway A!
- An emergency landing? - Shit! You can't see it from here!
- Is the Kid responsible for this? - Conan-kun!
Sonoko! Please answer me!
Sonoko!
Uncle Jirokichi, don't!
Please wait, General Counselor!
It's too dangerous!
But the Kid is here! That means the Sunflowers are in danger...
Our plane will now make an emergency landing.
Due to an explosion, the controls are no longer responding.
Therefore, the landing will be very difficult.
Pray that we land safely.
Good. Let's go.
- Good! Next! Hurry up, hurry up! - To Gate 8! Hurry!
This is not a drill!
The machine won't stabilize!
- Don't give up! Try it again! - Yes!
Run! Help...
Out of the way, out of the way!
Is that her?
There! There she is!
She's staggering!
No chance. She's too high!
This doesn't look good at all...
Damn it...
Do as I say!
Reverse thrust!
We'll risk losing control!
- I don't care! Concentrate on stopping! - Yes!
Reverse thrust!
W... w... Excuse me?
All passengers are requested to follow the pers...
Not good... It's going to collide!
Stop! Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!
Please stop!
That was close...
Shin'ichi... Sonoko...
This is the tower. Machine 2501, do you read me?
No. 2501, please respond!
Engine #2501!
This is flight 2501. We're sorry, but...
but we've taken another runway on our own.
But are you all right?
Yes. We managed to avoid collision.
We're all right.
Commence rescue and recovery.
Roger.
- You all right, Bengel? - Yes, I'm fine.
Well, well! That was really incredibly close!
Yes.
One wrong move and it would have been a disaster.
He's right.
But for the Kid to do that...
What's that?
It can't be...
Kid?!
Shit! He won't get away!
Hey! Kid! Where's the...
Kid's flying away with the painting!
- What?! - Really?
Shin'ichi... Sonoko...
Sonoko! Are you OK? Where are you?
Calm down, Ran. I'm fine.
Thank goodness.
Did Kudô-kun contact you?
Kudô-kun contacted you?
Shin'ichi? No, not yet. Why?
I see...
What about Shin'ichi? Isn't he with you?
Well, it's like this...
Kudô-kun has disappeared!
Hey, kid! That place is off-limits!
Damn it... Where did he go?

Hey! Wait up, kid!
Who's that? Now of all times?
The person you are trying to reach is not available.
- Speak at the tone. - Oh no... Shin'ichi...
Please pick up!
I'm sorry, Ran. But I'm stalking the Kid right now!
I'll call you later!
Thank God...
Shin'ichi...
Where is he? Where is he?
You can't escape me!
Fly!!!
Damn it!
But...
When the Kid jumped down, he didn't have the "Sunflowers" with him!
I only lost sight of him for a moment.
He must have hidden them somewhere there!
Indeed!
I could not organize better tools
better tools on the spot.
That's okay. For now, we just want to find out if it's damaged.
Then we'll get started.
Yes.
I hope it's just dirty...
If there's the slightest damage.
the dream of the exhibition is over.
Inspector Nakamori!
- Here! - The Kid was actually filmed by a camera on the roof!
An hour and 15 minutes ago, he flew right overhead.
At that time, he still had the "Sunflowers" with him.
Yes! But why did the Kid leave them on the building?
The second sunflower painting is bigger than you think.
Probably the air resistance was too great to get away with it.
He was going to get it as soon as the dust settled, but
the three-headed man saw him.
Ah... but it wasn't me who found the picture.
Shin'ichi said he saw the Kid hide it.
So...
where is that high school detective now?
That he's never around when the Kid shows up...
- It's like he's the Kaitô Kid himself! - I don't think that's possible.
It's true. An hour and fifteen minutes ago
a call from Kudô-kun.
That's when the photo was taken, right?
Crap. You actually think he was in America.
That's not important.
More importantly, why did the Kid come by here at the airport?
I guess he wanted to know what happened to the plane.
You often hear that murderers...
return to the scene of the crime without attracting attention.
But this...
Listen to me!
Don't lump him in with murderers!
Wake up.
That guy almost killed you!
I can't believe the Kid would do a thing like crashing a plane.
I don't like the idea...
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. We're done here.
The work was contaminated by the smoke..,
but there's no need for restoration.
Oh, really?
Then we had a narrow escape.
Thank you for your efforts.
You will now have a lot to do.
I'm really glad it came back so quickly.
Yes.
If it had been exposed to the burning sun for any length of time..,
the UV rays and heat would have done some serious damage.
Way to go, Three Cheese Boy!
That's why they call you the Kid Killer!
But I'm telling you, it wasn't me!
This is what the financial power of the Suzuki Group is capable of: the giant vault...
"The Iron Badger"!
The painting should be safe in here.
But Kid-sama has cracked the Iron Badger before!
Rest assured. We've improved it since then.
Right, Lupin?
[SINGING]
Good. Check to see if everyone has left the vault.
Yes.
All in order.
There's no one left inside.
Good.
The Iron Badger... activating!
WILL BE LOCKED
According to an investigation by the police and the Ministry of Transport
traces of a bomb placed in the cargo hold
traces of a bomb placed there.
The mechanic responsible has disappeared;
a search is on for him.
The other painting owners
are now reluctant to lend their works.
IS THE EXHIBITION IN DANGER?
Pops, don't you have to go to the meeting?
No! But the Great Race is today!
Well, well...
- That's why he's playing hooky? - What if they fire you?
They won't fire me, the master detective!
Here. This came in the mail.
I see. What's this?
Letters...
Maybe they're fan letters!
Conan-kun!
Sonoko asked me to come to the meeting, too. Do you want to come with me?
I'd love to, but...
I made a date with the others to go to the museum.
You did? Then don't.
But tell me...
Did Shin'ichi contact you by any chance?
No, he didn't.
He really could have told me he was in America.
And he hasn't contacted me since Kid's pursuit...
Ran...
Conan!

We're coming to get you!
Let's go, Conan-kun!
J... Yes!
Hurry up!
Professor! We found Conan!
Haibara-san! Looks like we're ready to go!
All right, I'm going.
Take care of yourself. Have fun and see you later!
Ran!
What's wrong?
We have to call the police right away!
It's the Kid!
One of the letters had Kid's card in it!
"Tonight
I'll come back for the left
of 'La Berceuse' (the first copy)."
That wretched Kid! So he still hasn't given up!
As you know,
the owners have now begun to hesitate
whether they want to lend their paintings for the exhibition.
In order to regain their lost confidence,
I have decided
to install a Kaitô Kid alarm system in the museum.
Miss Natsumi's suggestion to set up surveillance cameras,
camouflaged by sunflowers has already been implemented.
Please let me know if you have any other good ideas.
Of course, the cost is not a problem.
Yes.
Our mission is to make the exhibition succeed.
We'll gather our ideas and pass them on.
All right, thank you very much. Charlie.
You will support us, won't you?
Of course.
This guy may call himself a "master thief,"
but in reality he's a killer who'll do anything.
No... He's a terrorist!
What do you know about it?
Someone else could be responsible for the bomb!
Then please tell me,
who else besides the Kid
and for what purpose?
Sir! Could you spare a moment?
What is it?
I'm sorry,
but Inspector Nakamori wants to see you urgently.
- Very well. Put him on. - Yes.
It's me. What's up?
Yes.
All right. It's unthinkable that the Iron Badger is cracked,
but I'll check it out right away.
We interrupt this session.
- What happened? - What's wrong?
Is it because of Kid-sama?
Yes. It seems that Detective Môri...
has received a new message.
And what did this message say?
"Tonight I'm going to get the left
of 'La Berceuse' (the first copy)."
That was all.
Does he mean...
...the left one in "Triptych"?
And the "first copy" is....
Please stay here and stand by.
Mr. General Counsel!
According to this message, the Kid isn't after our "Sunflowers."
"The left of La Berceuse" and "the first copy"...
refer to the painting that van Gogh painted as the fifth.
And the "sunflowers" painted as the fifth,
are at the moment,
as you all know, are here in Japan.
The Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Museum of Art....
- Museum? - That's where you can look at paintings!
I am excited!
Thank you for visiting us again today!
- I've never been to the museum! - Me neither, me neither!
Wah, we're so high up!
- Amazing, isn't it? - Look! You can see the Bell Tree Tower!
It's true!
Aren't you guys here to see the "sunflowers"?
Oh yeah, that's right!
Okay! Come on, let's go see the "Sunflowers"!
Hey! You can't run in the museum!
Come on. Are they really interested in the "Sunflowers"?
It wasn't them who wanted to see that painting so badly.
Right, Professor?
Yes... We must prepare well for the exhibition "The Sunflowers that yearned
who longed for Japan".
He really follows every trend.
But I really didn't think that even you would come.
Shouldn't you be at the meeting?
Come on, they've got six samurai there.
The question is, what is the Kid up to?
The fact that he's interested in anything other than jewels..,
is very strange.
And that's why
you want to take a look at these "sunflowers" he's targeting?
Yes.
Maybe if I learn more about them, I can
I might be able to discern
what Kid's motive is and predict what he'll do next.
Oops, it's over here already?
- Which are the "sunflowers"? - Oh! There they are!
Which ones are they? Which are the "sunflowers"?
The ones in the middle, of course!
- They're beautiful! - Really great!
But tell me, what's so great about them?
Hey, you there!
Be quiet or they'll throw you out!
Please excuse the noise.

It doesn't matter.
Oh!
So this is the fifth sunflower painting by van Gogh?
Hey, Professor!
Really a wonderful work.
Ah, I beg your pardon.
Don't bother.
Now we've seen the sunflowers.
- We're done already? - Yes.
Good, then let's go buy souvenirs!
Oh yes, oh yes!
- Come on, let's go, Professor! - Yes, yes...
Really. What did they come here for?
More than the sunflowers.
you seem to be interested in something else, don't you, young lady?
Forgive me for speaking to you...
But you remind me of myself, how I used to be....
I see...
Do you come here often?
Yes. Every day.
So you like van Gogh's "Sunflowers" very much...
Yes.
But not these "Sunflowers"...
Here it is.
Everything seems to be okay.
Uncle, what's going on?
- What are you doing here? - What are you doing here?
Perfect timing, Threepio!
- Join us. - H... did the Kid...
- Yeah. Next thing you know... Next thing you know, he's got it in for... - Mr. General Counsel!
Don't talk like that around here!
Oh, I beg your pardon.
As you can see, there's no problem right now.
Anything more would disturb our visitors here,
let's go to the boardroom for the more detailed discussion.
- You are right. Let's go back. - Haibara!
I'll stay here with the old man.
You go back with the others, okay?
And...
I know.
I won't tell the kids.
Yeah. Thanks.
He trusts you, huh?
It's not what you think between us...
It is.
You have the exact same look I had seventy years ago.
It's like he's saying...
in the flower language of those sunflowers:
"I only have eyes for you."
But if you keep looking at him..,
you will surely regret it one day.
Just like me...
It's only when you've lost something that you realize how important it was to you.
Just like those "sunflowers"...
Haibara! Let's go!
Where's Conan-kun?
He left already.
He had something to do.
- Again? - That's what Haibara says, but really...
Thank you for your warning.
I act in such a way that I don't regret anything.
Too bad you didn't have more time, Professor!
That's all right. Now I'm looking forward to the exhibition even more...
Kiyosuke-san...
TONIGHT I WILL...
Why would this say
that the author is targeting our museum's "Sunflowers"?
in our museum?
"La Berceuse" shows a woman painted by van Gogh,
rocking a cradle.
And no sunflowers.
Well... more important are the words immediately following it:
"the first copy...
And "the left one" probably refers to the "triptych".
Triptych, you say?
The term refers to a group of three paintings or scroll paintings.
We are quite clear about that.
More importantly, how does "La Berceuse " become "Sunflowers"?
Well, that...
Why again?
Really...
- Pull yourself together! - Let's leave this
Mr. Kôji Azuma, who deciphered this announcement.
Yes, good idea. Azuma, that's all right with you, isn't it?
J... yes!
Let's assume, as Detective Môri said,
as Detective Môri said, it's a triptych.
Hang "La Berceuse" in its center.
Then hang to the left and right of it...
...the "Sunflowers"!
Exactly.
Van Gogh even sketched this in a letter
to his brother Theo, so there is no doubt.
If you arrange the paintings exactly as in this sketch,
one must hang the following "sunflowers" on the right and on the left:
On the right: the third or the seventh painting.
And on the left: the fourth, fifth or sixth painting.
And the picture on the left
as well as the first copy of the "Sunflowers"
correspond to the painting
that hangs here in this museum.
I see.
It seems that the perpetrator is indeed targeting our "Sunflowers".
But what would you like us to do now?
Kid's announcement refers to tonight!
You must take the painting to a safe place immediately!
But we can't do that right away...
Good. We'll explain to our visitors that we're closing early today.
Thank you for your support.
PREFECTURAL POLICE
Good, keep it up! Slowly. That's it.
- And keep going until you reach the box. - Isn't there anything we can do to help?
Well...
Ishimine really lives up to his reputation.

That he can make it that far in just 30 minutes....
One more hour until sunset.
- I guess we'll actually make it. - Yeah, we're gonna make it.
That's it. That's it. Slowly. Yeah, that's it.
Isn't there anything we can do to help?
Well, uh...
Bring the lid of the box
while we wrap up the painting.
All right. Natsumi!
- Let's bring the lid. - Yes.
Let me help.
No, wait. We'll help them.
Mr. Ishimine does not want outsiders to get directly involved.
But thank you very much for your offer.
B... please.
Good. On the count of three, we'll lift it up.
We're done.
- All right, thank you. - Here's the lid.
Ah, thank you.
- We'll do the rest. - Shouldn't we start checking the vault?
You're right.
Can we take some time to do that?
Charlie-san is right.
Since the Kid is planning to do it tonight..,
he's bound to steal something from the vault.
Oh, sorry!
No problem. Carry on.
Yes.
Wait!
There's something on the bottom of the lid!
Hey there, brat!
We don't have time! So shut up!
But there hangs something like a map!
- Lift the lid again. - Yes.
It's a map! Could this really be...
Natsumi-san, please bring it to us.
Here.
No doubt about it. It's from the Kid.
"I received the 'sunflowers' with thanks. Kaitô Kid."
He received them?
But the "sunflowers" are here!
Is that all?
Is that all it says?
- Yes... - What does it mean?
Were the "Sunflowers" here perhaps already...
...a fake?!
That the Kid was lying about when he did it?
Yes. Knowing the Kid as we do, it's hard to imagine.
No... Something's not right here.
The guy is and always will be a thief.
He'll stop at nothing to steal.
Even murder.
So, what's the story?
If this is a fake, it's very well and carefully done.
It's difficult to make an accurate assessment here on the ground.
Ah... I see.
Would it be possible for us to keep the work for a while?
In my workshop, a precise assessment is easily possible.
Agreed.
If there is any suspicion that it has been secretly switched,
I'm sure my superiors will allow it.
That won't be necessary, Mr. Director.
What do you mean?
How dare you?
D... that's the Kaitô Kid!
I see! This review itself is a trap by the Kid!
These "sunflowers" are genuine without a doubt.
I guarantee it.
Kid! You miserable... You tricked us!
Don't, stop!
Mr. Azuma! Ms. Miyadai! Are you all right?
Yes. But the "Sunflowers" are gone!
Get the Kid!
- What?! The Sunflowers are...
Wait! Kid!
Nakamori here! Kid escaped with the Sunflowers!
- He'll probably show up on the roof! Watch out! - Roger that!
Kid spotted! On the highest part of the roof!
Oh, no! He's getting away!
If only I had a gun...
Kaitô Kid has fired several flying objects!
We've lost him!
What?! Go find him!
Is that him?
He tricked us!
Where is that guy?
Not a chance. Too late.
Damn it... What kind of guy is this...
He did it in the evening as announced!
This is the card
The Kid put it in the breast pocket of my suit.
"I'm selling you the 'Sunflowers'...
for the advantageous price of 10 billion yen.
Why don't we meet in room 1412 of the Tôto Plaza Hotel in two hours?
Take the money, all used bills,
from the boxes and put it on the bed.
If you can't do that, the deal is off. Kaitô Kid."
Ten billion in just two hours?!
So the Kid was only after money from the start!
But why did he change like that?
There must be a reason.
Or is he... not the real one?
Our museum
it's impossible for our museum to collect 10 billion yen...
There's probably only one person in all of Japan..,
who could do such a crazy thing.
All right, I'll do it. I'll raise the money.
- You will? - But on a few conditions.
If we recover your "Sunflowers",
you'll lend them to us for the exhibition.
Of course! If we recover them this way,
I'm sure my superiors will allow it.
And will you then also try to find the owners

of the remaining five paintings?
Agreed. I will do my best!
- Good. - Then the negotiations are over.
- And we'll go to the hotel immediately! - Yes, sir!
And you come too, please, as soon as you are ready!
J... Yes.
You're going ahead to the hotel, too, Charlie?
No. I have to pick up something important.
Something important?
Yeah. Something I need to catch the Kid.
All right. But be back no later than the drop-off time.
Don't worry. Until then, I'll be sure to...
Uh... I'd like to ask you one more thing, if it's possible...
What is it? Go ahead.
There's someone
I'd like to invite to the exhibition.
And who is that?
An elderly lady who, since the "Sunflowers" were exhibited
she's been coming here practically every day.
This lady was also here today, wasn't she?
Yes, she was.
She must have deep feelings for them.
She doesn't dignify anything else with a glance,
but looks with sad eyes
all the time only at the "sunflowers".
Agreed.
Ah... Thank you very much!
It's me. I need said object after all.
Are you sure?
In our country, it's a crime just to have it on you.
I don't care.
I can't just let a plane bomber go free.
All right. I'll get it right away.
Thank you, Mark.
Please have it in the parking lot behind the ToTo Plaza Hotel in one hour.
All right.
Entrance lobby here. Nothing unusual.
Emergency stairs. No suspicious persons in sight.
Damn it...
- There won't be enough time. - Sorry.
What about surveillance?
There are guards at all entrances and exits.
It's no use if he's already in the hotel.
We won't make the same mistake again!
There's no way we'll let him get away.
- Hurry up! - There's no time.
Bring them in one at a time!
- Get them up here. - Hurry up!
Uh... Can we really negotiate with him under these circumstances?
We'll have to follow Kid's instructions willy-nilly.
But please don't contact me again unless you have to.
If he discovers us, everything will go down the drain.
J... Yes, of course.
But why
do we have to put all the money out there?
We don't have a choice! The Kid told us to do it.
Kid! Shut up!
Jahaaa...
Do you want to see the monitors?
J... yes...
Wait a minute.
Good.
Thank you very much. You're really nice.
I just want your support.
I've witnessed your insight and acumen.
They really don't call you Kid Killer for nothing.
D... that was just a coincidence.
Besides, I'm only in elementary school.
I have an open mind.
If you see anything, let me know.
Understand?
Yahaaa...
An amount as large as 10 billion yen...
would normally be transferred abroad.
The fact that he's asking for it in cash
must have some significance.
W... what?!
The media showed up?!
What do you mean? We were the only ones who were supposed to know about the handover.
Yes, but this place is suddenly crawling with newspaper and TV reporters!
In the parking lot, the situation is already out of control!
In front of the left entrance they start with live broadcasts!
I'm standing right in front of the Tôto Plaza Hotel.
Kid is only interested in the second and fifth picture according to the explanation....
Damn... That miserable Kid!
Is he trying to cause confusion with the media onslaught?
Inspector Nakamori!
If the Kid called the media himself,
it won't jeopardize the handover.
Yes... But we're running out of time!
Let's stop trying to get the money out.
We have no choice. Only two minutes left.
Just leave the lids open, that's enough!
Withdraw from the room!
Mr. Director! We'll stand by across the hall.
A... a... uh...
Please remain seated there!
Hurry up!
But it's really incredibly hot in here....
Can't I open the window?
Please bear it.
Kid couldn't just come in the door.
Yes...
All the teams have withdrawn.
Good, very good.
Everybody! Stand by until you receive further orders!
Roger that!
We're dealing with the Kid. He must have arranged something.
I've got to find it before the exchange.
What is it? Something's wrong.
Something's different than before!

Oh no! That's it!
Shit!
He's got the master key...
Damn it... No more time!
Come on, let's go!
Kid Killer!
What happened?
Come on, get in!
Explain.
The water level in the director's bottle has risen.
Probably the air pressure in the room has risen.
What's this guy up to?
I don't know.
But we've got to get the pressure back down, or it's going to be...
exactly what the Kid wants!
Hey, hey!
What are those two doing? They're gonna blow the whole thing!
In 20 seconds, the hand-off begins!
Shit! It won't open!
The higher pressure presses it against the frame from the inside!
How dare they, on their own...
Nothing can be done.
There are ten seconds left. We'll go on like this.
Five seconds left.
Four seconds,
three,
two,
one,
zero!
But what...?!
- What's that? - Is that the Kid? - Did he show up?
Okay! It's opening!
Kid!
Damn... That miserable Kid...
It's the Kid!
So it's true that the Kid and the Suzuki Group are negotiating!
He escaped!
Are you all right?
J... Yes.
Did the Kid have the "sunflowers" with him?
I... I don't know...
Charlie-san! There!
Look, above the bed!
How dare you! You've made a mess of...
Charlie! What's the matter with him? What about the Kid?
He got away.
What about the Sunflowers?
Don't worry.
They're intact.
They're the Sunflowers!
He brought them back?
Yes. But the money...
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Well done!
We're about to hold a press conference.
General Counsel Suzuki!
You were victorious in the confrontation with the Kaitô Kid. How do you feel?
No one need fear the Kaitô Kid!
The owners of the Sunflower Paintings can rest easy!
What is it?
It just worked out too well....
The world-famous "Sunflowers"
have been saved for the second time from the infamous
Kaitô Kid.
- The project planned by Jirokichi Suzuki... - Look, there!
I really want to see that exhibition!
Ah, the one with the sunflowers?
The van Gogh sunflower paintings from all over the world are now being
are now arriving one by one here in Japan.
Our guests today: Jirokichi Suzuki,
general advisor to the Suzuki Group and
and the mastermind behind the exhibition "The Sunflowers That
Yearned for Japan," as well as his niece Sonoko!
- Who is this? - Didn't he fly into the Akashi Bridge on the airship?
The exhibition takes place in the "Lake Rock Museum".
This museum is unknown to me...
The museum was built
was built especially for this exhibition.
I see. But that's interesting!
In order to create an ideal environment for the world-famous paintings
and to guarantee their safety,
we had to rethink our plans.
We are now listening to Miss Suzuki's explanations
to recordings introducing the project.
For the Lake Rock Museum we have
converted a dripstone cave that belongs to our Group.
The complex has eight floors;
on each of which is an exhibition room.
So on each floor you can admire at your leisure one of the
one of the seven sunflower paintings.
And when
the visitors have gathered on the lowest, second floor,
the "sunflowers" distributed on the floors
the floors are all transported to the eighth exhibition room by means of a special elevator.
to the eighth exhibition room.
While waiting for the elevator to the roof of the complex,
you can then see how the seven paintings appear
side by side.
I see!
So you don't look at all seven at once,
but only after you have
each of the paintings again.
And the safety precautions are also perfect.
If something is wrong, the sensors report it and the paintings are automatically
the paintings are automatically placed in waterproof and fireproof containers.
In this way, they survive a fire or flood unscathed.
And in the event of theft, the crime-fighting system is
the crime prevention system is activated
and all exits are locked.
Even if Kaitô Kid were to mingle with the visitors,
he cannot possibly escape from the museum.
And visitor safety is also taken care of.
The elevator to the roof of the complex is never blocked and minimal lighting is
minimum lighting is ensured at all times.

The museum has an independent emergency power supply?
Yes.
There are pictures of this as well, please take a look.
Water is pumped from the lake in front of the museum
is pumped into the tanks on the top floor.
If necessary, due to the difference in altitude, electricity can be
electricity can be generated by means of hydroelectric power.
This will bring visitors up to the roof and at the same time
the "sunflowers" to the evacuation container via a special
to the evacuation container on the lowest floor.
That's incredible! Absolutely perfect.
An impregnable fortress to protect the "Sunflowers"....
That's right.
The only opportunity to protect this treasure of humanity,
the seven sunflower paintings, at the same time, is at
at "The sunflowers that longed for Japan"!
Uh... The number of visitors is only 100 people per day
and the exhibition will last only one month.
So when does the ticket drawing start?
- Right now. - What, really?
You can take part in it right now on our corporate website.
It starts worldwide at the same time,
so the competition is astronomical!
Don't miss out on this opportunity, will you?
Ah, I've got a blank!
NIETE
I thought we'd win with the professor's connection!
What a bummer! We all have a loser!
Professor! What does the screen show when you win?
The photo with which one has registered is registered,
and an ID number and a PIN number are displayed.
If you then enter these in the registration mask,
you will later receive your ticket.
But you know exactly what to do!
You didn't...
That's right. I have won.
What an awful laugh...
Please, Professor! Give me the ticket.
I want to go there so badly!
- Me too! - Me too!
No way, bätsch!
That's rather childish, Professor.
Indeed, Professor!
- Childish! - That's childish!
Oh dear...
If you really want to, we'll have a quiz!
There are three possible answers, so you're all only allowed to give one answer.
Yes!
- Yay! - You're really great!
All right,
the bet is on!
What does the sun-loving sunflower
on the flower field üüüberhaupt not?
One: "Spider".
Two: "Snake...
Three: "Scorpion...
In other words: "spiders", "snakes" or "scorpions".
Exactly. That's why it's...
Wait, shh... You two mustn't answer.
- I know it! - I've got it too! - So do I!
It's number three, the scorpion.
- What?! - That's not true, Genta-kun!
But scorpions are poisonous!
- There are poisonous spiders and poisonous snakes, too! - What, really?
Spider! The correct answer is number one: "Spider."
Why is that?
- Because "spider" means "spider." - Huh?!
In Japanese, both "spider" and "cloud" are called "kumo"!
And the sunflower loves the sun, so it
it doesn't like the cloud that gets in the way of the sun!
Well, I'll be! The poison had nothing to do with it?
That means...
I'm not giving my card to anyone!
That's why
we'd all like to watch "Sunflowers" together.
Isn't there anything you can do?
Please!
- Please! - Please!
Agreed.
Whoo-hoo!
Can we really?
However...
you will support us even more than before.
Good luck, Mr. Kid Killer.
Counselor General Suzuki!
We should continue the meeting.
Ah... You're right.
All right, kids! I'll walk you home!
Yes!
Uncle Jirokichi, don't forget to buy tickets for Ran and Shin'ichi-kun!
Yes. Ishimine!
Please go ahead.
Contact me when the schedule and route of the cars are set.
Yes.
How will the paintings be transported to the museum?
If the museum security system is perfect,
the greatest risk is in the transportation.
You can rest assured.
We provide a large number of wagons as dummies.
Only I know which transport cart is the real one.
I see. If that's you, I'm not worried.
But...
If you want to use it, remember...
There is not a single life in this world..,
that you can just take.
I'll keep that in mind.
But if you always strive for ideals, reality will betray you.
Just like Kaito Kid in this case.
Hey, kid! What are you doing? Let's go!

Everyone is waiting for you!
Yahaaa!
Aaagh-baaagh!
Someone doesn't like me...
Excuse me!
Sir, there's a delivery for you, with a letter.
Ah, thank you.
Who do you think sends things here and not to the office?
Shut up, Lupin!
Oh, you're just too spoiled.
You... you can't... Kid?!
Please show me.
No doubt about it.
A card from the Kid!
And this?
Seems to be some kind of gift.
What's the matter, Lupin?
Mr. General Counsel, step back!
That's enough, Lupin! Come back!
What?
Smell and inflammation...
Phosphine?
A flammable substance!
Everybody out of here now!
Are you all right, Charlie?
Yes.
It's safe again.
Notify Inspector Nakamori immediately.
J... Yes, sir.
Are you really sure?
This incident has endangered lives.
If we inform the police, the exhibition
will have to be postponed or even canceled.
In fact, Charlie-san may be right.
Good, agreed.
You all will also not tell anyone about this incident.
Do you understand?
- J... Yes... - Good, I agree.
Oh, yeah,
Good boy, Lupin. You got that right!
- We owe... - Charlie-san, let's lock the room.
Yes.
Kaitô Kid... So you're finally showing your true colors.
Now I'll show no mercy.
That's it! That's it!
And stop!
How many more dummies will he send out?
Tell me... What do you think about what happened earlier?
What do you think?
Kid's motive.
If the exhibition is canceled, the second and the
the second and the fifth paintings of the Sunflower series will be
removed from the museum.
Another chance to steal them.
Is it just that?
Then he could just wait until the exhibition is over.
Why do you think he's in such a hurry, this Kaitô Kid?
TERPENTIN
Dear audience!
Thank you for visiting our exhibition "The sunflowers that longed for Japan" today!
who longed for Japan"!
Now let the man who had the idea
for this exhibition, open it with a few words!
Good. All of you who have been lured here by the mysterious magic of the "Sunflowers"!
Are you ready?
Good, then I want to
the exhibition "Sunflowers,
Longing for Japan" exhibition!
We will now begin the admission process.
Please line up with your card.
Excuse me... My name is Ran Môri.
Please show me your ticket.
There are six of us.
Thank you, that's fine.
Please go that way.
- We're the first ones! - Wow!
Ran, hurry up!
They're all together, aren't they?
- Yes. - Please insert your ticket into the control machine.
Please keep your ticket in your hand.
R. MÔRI, C. EDOGAWA, A. HAIBARA
Is the entrance working as planned?
Yes. The exhibition environment and
security system are both working properly.
Good. Then everyone except Gotô
- please return to your posts. - Yes!
Hey, wait a minute!
Can he handle it by himself?
Don't worry. It's all automated.
Besides, there should be as few people
as few people as possible in this room.
Well... You're right again.
- Oh! - Well, what's the matter?
Ah... nothing...
You really are a restless fellow...
What am I looking at? Even that detective is here!
Gotô! Is there anyone acting suspiciously?
The first group has just entered the exhibition room...
with the first sunflower painting.
But one person has gone straight to the second painting.
Let me show you.
Strange! To start the tour at the second picture!
Can you zoom in a little closer?
Gotô?
Right away.
What's wrong? Is she crying?
I think she really wanted to see the second picture, which...
Mr. General Counsel! That's obviously not the Kid.
Back to normal surveillance.
Yeah, you're right.
Go back.
Yes.
Oh! They're beautiful!
But it looks like they're imitations.
Real flowers would wither here.
Imitations, all right,
but they should smell a little better.
Strange... The idea of flowers came from Natsumi-san,
but she didn't say that they should also smell...
Oh, let's look at the second picture instead!
The one that is owned by our group!

- Great idea! - Come on, let's go! - Yes!
Surveillance cameras?
So they're installed everywhere like this...
Conan-kun! What are you waiting for? Let's go!
J... Yes!
- Look, here they are! - They sure are!
- Wow! - Ah... I've been wanting to see those!
Run!
Hurry up! It was Shin'ichi-kun!
No?!
Shin'ichi...
Sonoko! Where is he?
I lost track of him.
Was he really here?
If you ask me like that...
- I didn't see him clearly... - Are you mistaken?
I hope it's true...
With the security measures at the entrance...
Baggage inspection and x-ray screening
will not permit a disguise.
That leaves only one method for the Kid...
He has to pretend to be me, since our facial features are very similar.
What's this note?
A card from the Kid!
He's really impersonating me!
Are you okay?
He's not here either.
I'm sorry. I really mistook him for someone else.
Ran, Sonoko!
- Conan-kun! Be quiet! - Take me to the surveillance room!
This is a map of the Kid! He's already here at the museum!
The Kaito Kid is...
But what does it mean?
If you want to connect it to the "Sunflowers"...
On some sunflower paintings there are also 15 flowers, aren't there?
The fourth, fifth and sixth picture
show 15 sunflowers each.
Then there is also a painting with 14 sunflowers?
No, not that I know of.
Yes, there is.
According to a thesis the "14 sunflowers" are the same
as the "15 sunflowers".
Van Gogh writes in a letter to Theo
of his painting with the 15 flowers as one with fourteen.
So if we assume that this is the number of flowers,
what do the numbers and signs after it mean?
There is also the thesis that if van Gogh
considered the flowers as 14, they are a symbol
for the twelve apostles of Christ as well as Theo and Gauguin.
Exactly! That must be it, for sure!
What do you mean by that?
Look at the card again.
According to the thesis, "11 people + 1 person" means.
"the twelve apostles of Christ".
And "+ 2 persons"
means "Theo and Gauguin".
Put them together and you get 14 persons.
And if van Gogh considered the sunflowers as 15,
we can use for the place
"+ 1 person" put van Gogh himself.
If this interpretation is correct,
the question is, what do these two formulas mean?
Why did Kid-sama write such a difficult announcement letter?
Before, the question is: Is the card an announcement at all or not?
Never mind.
Let's ask this question to the writer himself,
after we've caught him and put him in jail!
We'll lock the Kid up in the museum. Please help us with this.
J... Yes.
Gotô! Have all visitors and employees leave the complex.
- Yes. - But...
the museum has not been open for an hour!
If you do, there will be a riot!
Calm down.
On the first day, you never know what's going to happen, that's why
we've only invited people from the group and acquaintances of Sonoko.
Mr. General Counsel!
We'll take care of security as planned.
Good. I'm counting on you,
my Seven Samurai.
I see! You had an emergency scenario worked out!
Good. Let's proceed as planned.
When one of us leaves his post,
he contacts all of us.
All right.
Something unexpected has occurred in our exhibition.
Please all proceed to the elevator
and remain calm.
I'm sure it's the Kid's fault!
So it's time for the "Detective Boys"!
No.
This time the Kid is very dangerous.
You must stay with me at all costs.
Yes...
How's the evacuation of the visitors going?
Smoothly.
If there's a problem,
it's with the exit controls.
X-ray screening is unnecessary.
Tell people to leave as soon as they get their luggage.
Hey! If you do that, the Kid'll get away!
Don't worry.
You know as well as I do that the Kid won't run away..,
when he's got the loot right under his nose.
Yes, he'll probably stay behind inside the complex.
And that's why we're gonna... seal off the entrances and exits...
and lock him up here.
The fact that he came to the museum means:
He's not wearing a disguise right now.
nor does he have any magical gadgets with him.
Under these circumstances, I can certainly defeat him.
My twelve friends, whom I trust implicitly..,
will remain here in the complex.
Twelve, whom he can trust...

I see.
He calls the 12 apostles not "12 persons"
but "11 persons + 1 person".
Does that mean that...
Uncle Jirokichi!
These 12 people whom you trust,
isn't that the same number as the Christ people on Kid's card?
I wonder all the time why Kid didn't write
didn't write "12 people"....
Was one excluded from her circle of friends?
Would that be... not Judas?
Judas the traitor!
Then maybe the Kid is trying to tell us
that there's a traitor in our midst.
You mean someone else is after the painting?
General Counsel Suzuki!
I want to examine the profiles of your Seven Samurai again more closely.
Perhaps someone wants to disrupt the trust
between us and the security system.
Keep it a secret that we'll check them again.
Good. Then at least the investigation won't hurt.
- Get on it. - Yes.
Visitors and employees have left the museum.
Good. Lower the partitions at once.
Yes, sir. Close the partitions.
Please go on! Keep moving!
Visitors and museum employees are streaming out of the complex in droves.
What happened inside the museum?
The visitors don't seem to have any information either.
Only in the server room and the power plant
the surveillance is a bit more scarce.
But only we involved know about these places.
Do you want me to try?
Charlie here.
Checked all the tightly manned locations.
No sign of the Kid anywhere in the complex.
Copy that.
There's no one left in the building.
Get back to your posts.
It's getting close.
Damn it.
Wait, Kid!
ATTENTION: HIGH VOLTAGE DO NOT ENTER
Damn it!
What the...?
- A power failure? - It's all good.
Fire up the emergency power!
- Yeah! - Sunflower monitors first!
I know!
Turn on the monitors!
Everything's okay! The paintings are intact!
Good.
Turn on this monitor too!
Megure sent us information.
Right away.
The power is back!
Gotô! What's going on?
There were problems in the electricity control room.
The lights, main elevator and surveillance cameras
are no longer working.
Reinforce security at the 2nd and 5th paintings immediately!
So the Kid really did stay behind in the complex.
No! The Kid may not be responsible for all this.
I beg your pardon? What do you mean?
A suspicious person has turned up in the Seven Samurai investigation.
But that...
In Arles, where Van Gogh painted the Seven Sunflower Paintings..,
six months ago, this person's twin brother died.
Since he had a bullet wound in the chest and
his right hand showed traces of gun smoke,
the police assumed it was suicide.
And who was this man?
Kôichi Azuma.
Azuma, you say?!
Yes. The brother of Kôji Azuma, the restorer in charge.
It wasn't suicide. I killed Kôichi.
Look at the monitors of the "Sunflowers"!
There, on the second monitor!
A... Azuma!
But why? They were brothers!
Because after finding the Sunflowers of Ashiya.
the Sunflowers of Ashiya he'd been searching for..,
he had a change of heart.
The Ashiya Sunflowers, found?!
What are you saying!
This painting was lost in a fire during the war!
This does not correspond to the facts.
On that day
of the air raid on Ashiya,
the whole town burned, a true picture of hell.
My grandfather was a carpenter on the estate of the man who
of the man who had bought the painting.
To save the "Sunflowers"
which were firmly attached to the wall,
he rushed alone into the burning mansion.
Azuma-san!
Madam!
Azuma-san!
- What... - Stay away!
Oh no...
Miss! Take care of the "sunflowers"!
Nooooo!!! Azuma-san!
Watch out!
Miss, we have to escape!
No!
Azuma-san!!!
Even if we lose this war...
The "Sunflowers" must not be stolen...
Azuma-san...
- Azuma-san!!! - Miss! Please hurry up!
I wish that these "Sunflowers"...
in the Japan that is to come, in a museum,
as Master Mushanokôji...
described it to us...
by people
from all over the world...
Our father told us the story over and over again.
Even after his death

we continued to search for the painting.
The only clue: the words of the servant
of the servant to whom Grandfather gave the painting.
The servant's words?
To avoid confiscation by the GHQ,
it was, according to him, apparently
it was rescued to Europe disguised as a forgery.
Then... Are the "sunflowers" that I acquired...?
the... the "Sunflowers of Ashiya"?!
They are not burned?
No.
My brother and I finally found them.
The "Sunflowers of Ashiya", hidden in the attic
of a farmhouse in Arles.
But
triggered by the long-awaited discovery of the "Sunflowers",
my brother had a change of heart...
The "Sunflowers"
should now remain in van Gogh's beloved Arles.
Otherwise, he would rather destroy them right there on the spot!
He betrayed the wishes of our grandfather and father.
I bore him a grudge for that.
It came to the quarrel and
and by chance a shot was fired from the pistol...
I shot Kôichi by accident...
Kôichi...
- I... I... - Run away...
Kôichi!
You should run away.
But...
Go away!
When I heard about the exhibition, I became involved in it...
as a scientific advisor.
Thanks to that, I was able to witness the return
of the "Sunflowers of Ashiya" to Japan.
And my grandfather's wish came true.
That is why I planned to volunteer after the end of the exhibition.
This is happening a little sooner now.
I see.
Inspector Megure of the prefectural police is coming here.
So you're turning yourself in?
Yes. Of course.
But I'm not the suspect you're talking about!
Wha... what are you saying?!
Hey! The sunflowers are burning!
Don't distract me.
But they're really burning!
- Oh, no! A fire! - Quick, put it out!
Hey! What's going on?
What do the heat sensors in the flowers say?
They're showing abnormal readings.
It is indeed a fire!
Can't we put out the fire?
No! The fire suppression system is down!
Then we have no choice.
Everyone, evacuate!
Gotô! Open the partition on the roof!
Yes!
Let's go. Everyone, follow me!
Conan-kun, let's go!
J... Yes!
Hurry up! The flames are almost here!
I know.
Just a little while longer...
All right, let's go, kid! Come on, hurry up!
Come on! This way!
- Come on, come with me! - Yeah...
Conan-kun, hurry!
Are you all okay?
Yes. We're all fine.
Conan-kun, are you okay?
Yes. But more importantly:
The "Sunflowers" too?
Don't worry. The program ran as normal.
But the second and fifth pictures are...
Don't worry, kid.
No. I wasn't mistaken.
I'm sure they were still there.
I have to do something right away.
Otherwise the second and fifth pictures will burn!
What on earth...
- I don't care! Land! - Yes, sir.
According to Commissioner Nakamori's message, they're taking Azuma to the back entrance.
Here we are!
Hurry!
Commissioner Charlie handed Azuma over to me.
But tell me, what's going on?
There's a fire in the museum. Please lead the evacuation from the air!
I will.
We'll back you up.
Yes, sir!
Conan-kun?
He's not...
Damn it!
This isn't good at all... I have to hurry!
- If I don't, I'll end up with the "Sunflowers"... - Kid!
You... Did you come back?
More importantly, the other picture!
Is everything all right with the fifth picture?
Yes. The stopper on that one came right off...
But this one is stuck somewhere.
If we don't get it off soon, the paint will melt.
Get out of the way, Kid.
Wha... Are you crazy? Don't!
These are the "Sunflowers"!
A treasure of mankind!
So?
You were aiming at me!
We don't have time for this!
- It's not working. - Damn...
- I can't believe how sturdy Grandpa made this thing. - Conan-kun!
Shin'ichi!
So you're actually here! Hey...
Are you listening to me? We have to get out of here as soon as possible!
Ran!
We need your help.
What do you think?
The Sunflowers are stuck!
We'll have to smash the wall to get them out.
But we can't do that!
You can do it, I'm sure!
I'll try. Step back, Shin'ichi.
You too, Conan-kun.
We're counting on you!
Ran!

- Super! - We did it!
Good! Quickly! Let's save...
Hey, Ran!
Wait a minute...
Now what? The escape route is...
Don't worry, Ran. Step back.
Jii-chan, can you hear me?
Stay calm! Don't panic...
- and keep walking calmly! - Understood.
There's no danger!
Run!
Run!
Hold on to me!
Don't let go!
Oh no...
What was that?
It looks like water is flowing out of the storage tanks!
Does that mean the fire's been put out?
Hey!
Where's Conan?
- Well? Isn't he here? - Wasn't he with you?
Ran isn't here either! Where is she?
Really! Where did they disappear to, now of all times!
Until recently, they were right behind us!
I can't reach them.
Maybe they went down before us.
I'll go and look for them!
Yes! Thank you!
Come on, we're going too!
Yes!
Kudô-kun... You're not...
- Are you okay? - You should be taking care of Ran.
Ran! Come here!
She's okay. She just swallowed some water and passed out.
Look! There!
The water flow is decreasing!
I guess all the water has gone out of the storage tanks.
Are the sunflowers okay?
Go to them!
Tell me, did you know what the culprit was planning?
Yes... If the sunflowers in the corridor were the fuse, the
the tube corridor could also serve as a water channel.
That means...
The perpetrator is the one who suggested to put sunflowers in the tube corridor.
Ha, so you finally figured out who the perpetrator is, huh?
Come on, let's get out of here,
Let's get out of here.
Hey!
How are you gonna get out of here?
We'll climb up the tube corridor..,
to the top floor by the entrance.
Maybe we can go up through the elevator shaft.
And what was your original plan?
- Huh? - To get out of here!
I'm sure you were counting on something like this.
If I could fly to the prepared exit at the back of the cave..,
I'd be out of here in no time.
But with the girl and you.
I don't think I can reach it.
Kid...
But tell me...
If you knew what he was up to, why didn't you...
...why didn't you...
I knew about it
because I stole the plans from his computer.
But he could have had accomplices.
Commissioner Charlie discovered me..,
...when I tried to stop the blackout, and he chased me.
That's when I came up with the mysterious announcement.
I thought you'd solve the mystery faster, but...
I'm sorry!
Wait a minute. I'm preparing for our escape.
I'll see if we can get out through the elevator lobby ahead of us.
In the meantime, get me whoever did this, all right?
Okay.
It'd be stupid to fall for another lame trick.
Yes.
Good. I'll leave you to it. I'll leave this to you!
Shin'ichi...
Hang in there a little longer, Ran.
Not good... Because it took too long to put out,
the air pressure in the cave is lower than expected!
Let's get out of here, it's going to collapse!
The gate is opening. Please be careful.
The gate is opening. Please be careful.
Good! The "sunflowers" seem unharmed.
One, two, three, four,
five, six... Strange! There are only six pictures here!
What are you saying?
Indeed! One of the seven is missing!
What does that mean?
ACCEPT
Huh?! The second sunflower picture...
The "Sunflowers of Ashiya" are not here!
Oh no!
Why? Why are the "Sunflowers of Ashiya" not here?
Don't worry!
That voice...
Is that you, Shin'ichi Kudô?
Yes. The "Sunflowers of Ashiya" were stored
in their container earlier.
You again!
Acting up again!
Please hear me out first!
Because I have the fifth sunflower painting and
the "Sunflowers of Ashiya"
from the traitor among you!
So there really was a traitor?
Yes.
But do not worry!
I now know who the Judas is.
We've already arrested Kôji Azuma.
You're wrong. Mr. Azuma wasn't the traitor.
In fact...
Kôji Azuma has no motive,
to burn and destroy the second sunflower painting.
And when the sunflowers started to burn,
he was talking to all of you.
That may be true, but...

But there can be no traitor among us!
Yes! We are like-minded people who protected the "sunflowers"!
That's right.
Kaitô Kid whispered to us about the traitor.
To trust the words of that thief..,
is simply ridiculous!
Yes, it is!
Let's be glad that the Sunflowers are unharmed!
Are you serious?
Miss Natsumi Miyadai?
You lit the fuse on purpose.
What do you mean by that?
Because your goal was,
to burn the "Ashiya Sunflowers" and the fifth of the paintings!
Your goal from the very beginning
to destroy those two sunflower paintings.
Please don't talk nonsense!
Why would I do such a thing?
All right, I agree.
Let's go through everything point by point.
Thanks to the commotion Kaito Kid caused at the auction..,
security has been tightened.
you no longer had access to the "Sunflowers."
So you gave up on destroying them in America.
Before transporting them to Japan
you bribed one of the workers
and had him plant a bomb by the cargo door.
But even that was prevented by the Kid, and you changed your destination
from the second to the fifth sunflower picture.
The Kid noticed this immediately and
sent an announcement to Detective Môri, which further increased his vigilance.
He had disturbed you twice now.
To forestall him the next time,
you pinned a forged card of the Kid's
under the lid of the box
and suggested that you take the painting to your studio.
So the Kid played the bad guy to protect the "Sunflowers"?
That's not true! Those are just your fantasies!
That's right.
Natsumi loves the "Sunflowers" more than anyone.
Unthinkable that she would do something like that!
Yes. And why would she want to destroy only two of the paintings?
The reason why she
only wants to destroy these two pictures is actually still unknown to me.
Quite a great show of evidence!
Well, let's ask Natsumi-san directly about her reason later.
Let's get to the main topic.
Natsumi-san,
I heard you suggested that the sunflowers be placed in the museum's
in the museum's tube corridor. Is that true?
J... yes...
You took advantage of your position to obtain turpentine
turpentine, which is often used by restorers,
poured it into the gutter with the sunflowers and then
then used it as a fuse.
The traitor just used my idea for his own purposes, done.
Stop treating me like a criminal with vague arguments!
like a criminal!
I see...
I would have liked you to turn yourself in voluntarily.
Do you want definite proof? I'll show it to you later.
On your computer is a plan
for the destruction of the second painting in the "Sunflowers" series!
I guess there's no point in deceiving you anymore.
So you've joined my team..,
to destroy the fifth Sunflower painting and
and destroy the Ashiya Sunflowers?
Yes, I did.
But that troublemaker named the Kaitô Kid showed up,
has thwarted my plans.
That's why you planned to go here, where it would be more difficult for Kid
it would be more difficult for the Kid to disturb you...
and burn the two paintings.
Yes.
But I didn't want to make such a big thing out of it.
I just wanted to take advantage
take advantage of the power failure and get rid of the "Sunflowers of Ashiya"
and the fifth painting.
But then the suits also got in the way.
I immediately strengthen the security on the
second and fifth painting!
But how were you going to get rid of the "Sunflowers"...?
- If you touch them, the security system activates! - That was easy.
All I had to do was spray phosphine on them.
Phosphine?
A chemical that self-ignites at room temperature.
So it was you who tried to kill me?
I see.
Without a patron, the opening would have been delayed...
or perhaps the exhibition would have become impossible altogether!
But why?
With bad luck you could have died in the fire earlier or
or the explosion in the plane, you could have died yourself, Natsumi!
Because I...
because I love van Gogh's "Sunflowers" so much!
I'd rather die,
than to let these fakes hang next to van Gogh's
"Sunflowers"!

There is no truthfulness in your words and deeds.
That the fifth picture
is genuine, but essays from the Van Gogh Museum
and the Art Institute of Chicago!
Van Gogh and Gauguin
shared the canvas on which they painted.
There is no better proof!
As an appraiser, you should know that.
A... but...
You said you'd rather die,
you would rather die, but
the explosion was triggered just before landing.
And also with the fire earlier
you calculated the escape route and time exactly before you set it.
N... well, that...
If you are indeed prepared to die,
why didn't you stay behind and stop the Kid from putting it out?
You're just
a criminal looking out for your own convenience!
And certainly not an art specialist.
You're really...
Hold out your hands.
She loved van Gogh's paintings too much,
...so she believed herself more than the real thing...
and got involved in a crime...
You seem to have closed the case.
Yes. And you? Can you get up there?
Alone, yes.
What do we do?
Are you going for help?
No, I'd rather not.
That could only make things worse here.
Shit!
You okay?
Yeah. But how long is it gonna hold?
It's a miracle it's holding up at all!
If there's even the slightest leak,
air will rush in from the outside and the whole thing will collapse.
Kid!
Could you fly with Ran alone?
- Don't tell us... - Could you or not?
Which one? Tell me!
Probably yes. But I don't know if I can keep flying
and at the same time
and avoid this rockfall at the same time,
is not certain.
Ran!!!
Kid!!!
Take care of Ran!!!
Damn! He's going supercoo...
There's still a way out.
With my little kid body...
Shit... If this keeps up, we'll fall!
Where's the exit?
Is this it?
Go!!!
With this body
I'll fit into the shaft for the "Sunflowers"!
Damn it...
The Sunflowers of Ashiya!
Oh no! The water tower is...
Hurry! We have to find them!
This looks bad...
Look!
They weren't
not still in there...
Phew, that was close!
It was hanging by a silk thread...
Shin'ichi...
You came to save me...
Yes. Everything's fine now.
Yes...
Where are you going, Haibara-san?
- I saw the Kid and Ran-san fly! - What?!
- Really? We'll see about that! - Yeah! - Sonoko!
Haibara-san saw Ran and Kid fly!
- What, Ran and Kid-sama?! - Where?
What, Kid, you say?
Damn it... There's no way out over there either.
There's no way out...
I'll die by the side of the Ashiya Sunflowers!
This can't be happening...
You made it out of there, I hope,
Detective...
Ran! Where are you?
Ran! Where are you? Ran!
Oh! Ran!
Are you okay?
Dad...
Ran! Are you okay? Are you okay?
Shin'ichi saved me.
That's not true! The Kid saved you!
Really - huiiii - with the hang glider!
Don't you remember that?
That's right, I...
Then... it wasn't Shin'ichi, but the Kid?
But what about the kid? Where is he?
Wha... Isn't Conan-kun here?
No. The Kid was just holding you.
Oh, no!
Then Conan-kun's still...
- No? That's not true, is it? - Oh, no...
Damn it!
If nothing happens, I'll drown in less than a minute!
I might be able to move it with my ball..,
but I'll still drown...
That's it! Sinking!
That there's so much water coming in here,
means: I am already deeper than the surface of the lake!
If I mess up the sequence of the collapse with my ball..,
the pressure balance is destroyed and
I should be carried along with the surge
into the lake!
Okay! I will make it!
Five, four,
three, two,
one, zero...
- Conan-kun! - Conan-kun!
What are you waiting for, Conan!
Please come out, please! Conan-kun!
Damn it! What's he still doing!
Conan!!
Ah... Don't worry.
Conan-kun will definitely...
Please... Come out...
Conan-kun...
Just a little more...
Just a little more...
Ah! Something's coming up!
The sunflowers!
Oh! So they're still intact?
I put the picture in the container with Conan-kun!

Conan-kun must be around somewhere!
Please! Come with me and look for him!
- Conan! - Conan-kun! - Are you there?
Conan-kun... Where are you? Conan-kun...
Conan-kun!!!
Ran...
There's something coming up!
Yes, it is! There, behind the painting!
What? Where?
Wait, kid! And up!
- Mr. Môri, is he all right? - Conan-kun...
Way to go, Three-Kid!
Just as I'd expect from my Kid Killer!
Are you okay, kid?
You did a great job protecting the Sunflowers!
Bravo!
Really. Stealing my thunder...
There's something I don't understand.
You'll explain it to me.
Why did you know the killer from the start?
I got a job offer by voice mail.
I was to steal the second and fifth sunflower paintings.
I see.
You're so good at disguises..,
that you can tell who they belong to
you can tell who it belongs to.
But why was it necessary for you to hinder the perpetrator?
What good did that do you?
I wanted to show the "Sunflowers of Ashiya" to someone.
Show someone?
At that time,
amidst the blazing flames of that air raid,
a carpenter entrusted the "Sunflowers" to a girl.
And she saw him die... I wanted to show them to her.
Why do you know about this past event?
Because a man who was there from A to Z told me about it.
The man who was
lived in that mansion as a student boarder.
The man who saved his first love
from the fire, asked me to do it.
He wanted to show her the "Sunflowers of Ashiya..."
I see.
With that, all mysteries are solved.
Aren't you going to arrest me?
Aren't you going to arrest me?
I'll let you go for this time.
Oh, you wouldn't have what it takes to catch me.
Look at it this way: I'm doing it out of respect for the man..,
who has cherished his unrequited love for so long...
and turned to you with his request.
I misjudged you,
Commissioner Charlie.
Thank you, the same to you.
