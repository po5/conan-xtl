car no. 4 fixed!
Roger.
This is car 2. Locked!
Car 2, roger.
Car 3. Fix okay.
Car 1. Locked.
Roger.
Commissioner! All cars are in position!
Good.
Assault team! What's the situation?
As you suspected: All security systems disabled.
And the diamond?
Gone. The display case is smashed.
This is Team B.
There's no one on the emergency stairs. We're moving up.
You don't have to muffle the voices. Use your voices to chase him up!
Roger that!
We're going through the operation again!
No matter where he jumps out, the four jets will blow him...
to the Tsukishima River!
Then all we have to do is fish him out like a wet cat.
He won't escape us today!
But will he really let himself be blown away?
He could use the playing card gun!
Their ammunition is hard, but they are playing cards.
The air current will affect them.
He hangs on to his fluttering cape and fires his pistol....
Looks cool, but his weak point is the wind!
Kid! Kid! Kid! Kid!
Inspector!
There he is, there's the Kid!
- Everybody in position! - Yes, sir!
Oh yes, I got the diamond.
Who's that?
Operation Kid's Capture: Start!
All cars, start turbines!
Kid's heading east!
Cars 2 and 4: Go to plan B!
We got him!
Ha, Kid's too surprised to fly his kite!
50 meters to the Tsukishima River!
Tsukishima River fishing party: reel him in!
Kid fired a handgun!
Kid fired a... Handgun...?
Kid escapes in a pleasure boat! He's going up the Tsukishima River!
Where are the helicopters?
We didn't provide any!
The Kid... shot?
How dare you..,
to put such a huge net here!
MISSING
We can't track him!
DO NOT GO
DON'T GO!
Stop right there, Kid!
You can't get away!
He's not gonna let that stop him, is he?
Whoops...
Zantetsuken...
I see...
Why didn't you say so?
Lupin III!
LUPIN III.
DETECTIVE CONAN
His name is Lupin III.
Adventurer and globetrotter.
What he wants, he gets.
A phantom master thief!
His partner: Daisuke Jigen.
A professional who draws and hits in just 0.3 seconds.
A dutiful gunslinger.
DON'T CALL ME DAD!
Goemon Ishikawa the Thirteenth.
A master sword puller who can beat anything in two.
And dangerous if you tease him.
And there's someone else:
The enigmatic young Fujiko Mine.
Is she a thief or a spy?
Even Lupin doesn't know.
She gives him trouble every time. Why does he bother with her?
Lupin has a weakness for cute girls.
Or so it seems.
That's high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When he was at the amusement park with his girlfriend Ran,
he allegedly witnessed bad guys in black making a suspicious deal.
And he was so focused on it,
that he didn't notice the third man behind him.
This man administered a poison to him, and when he awoke....
What a surprise!
That's when his body was supposed to have shrunk!
So if it becomes known that Shin'ichi Kudô is still alive..,
his life and the lives of his friends will be in danger.
So he has decided not to reveal himself.
He calls himself Conan Edogawa
and has moved in with his friend Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
All right, then don't. I'll ask Kid-sama then.
K... "Kid-sama"?
Kaitô Kid.
- Don't you know him? - Yes, I do.
Also known as the "Moonlight Magician."
And the kid's still in high school!
Oh, how great! What school does he go to?
Which high school is it? Please tell me, Lupin!
I stole him as a kid, as requested.
Good evening, Lupin-kun.
Your show has been quite impressive.
If you already know that, it'll save me some trouble.
Deactivate the bomb immediately.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
I beg your pardon?

For the sake of a woman, would you do what you are told?
Can you be trusted?
It was just a test?
I'm sorry.
But you were recommended to me by a certain gentleman...
He said you were the only one capable of stealing the Cherry Sapphire.
Thank you very much.
And? May I assume that I passed?
Of course you can.
Contact me as soon as you have the Cherry Sapphire.
Then I'll deactivate your bomb.
Oh, one more thing...
tracing this number is a waste of time.
That's what it looks like.
Where are they tracing the call?
Up until now, it's been coming from somewhere in the mountains of China.
Now it's coming from a satellite over America.
Ah, I give up. And I'll be honest with you:
I can't do anything stupid with you.
And I'll remember..,
that I'm dealing with Lupin III.
SAFETY FIRST
Well?
It's been chopped clean off!
How do you get it so clean?
Even the bulletproof carbon coating inside.... Really scary.
So this one suits you better after all, huh?
...and then throw it in the bucket? Really incomprehensible.
I guess he just wanted to kick up some dust.
I can't believe that such a large-scale operation...
Conan-kun's watching TV all the time... He looks depressed.
That's what happens when you always want to do everything on your own.
It was Goemon who did him in, wasn't it?
You see reports everywhere
that Lupin III is in Japan.
And Goemon is Lupin's accomplice, right?
So they're here in town?
All right, we're coming to the much-anticipated quiz question!
- What? - Another stupid corny quiz?
- We're not in the mood. - And don't yearn for it.
Kids, at least make a little effort.
- We really can't do without a quiz! - I'm really looking forward to it!
I hope I guess it!
Oh, you're so transparent.
There's even a whiteboard for it today!
I've been waiting for this!
- You're the greatest! - Turn it this way!
I am!
WHAT ARE LUPIN'S FAVORITE BEANS?
Among these four types of beans is one that Lupin likes very much.
1. SOYBEANS 2. AZUKI BEANS.
Well, do you know which one?
3. FIELD BEANS 4. GREEN PEAS
I'll give you five minutes to think.
FIVE MINUTES ARE UP
Well, did you figure it out?
Too fast!
It's all the same if you eat them.
But, Genta-kun! Think, or the bean won't work!
It's No. 3, the field bean.
Oho? And why?
All the others are alkaline foods, but the field bean...
is one of the acidic foods, isn't it?
Acidic foods?
Yes, and?
Aha!
A master thief...
...pisses off the police!!!
LUPIN III. TURNS SOUR
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Are you looking for a fight with me?
TUMULT AT THE AIRPORT ON EMILIO'S ARRIVAL IN JAPAN!
Early this morning, Italian pop star Emilio Baretti arrived in Japan!
He is an adventurer and globetrotter.
For us to meet a second time....
Oh, great! Emilio is going to give a concert in Japan, Conan-kun!
Emilio Baretti, the "singing young nobleman"!
"THE YOUNG NOBLEMAN" EMILIO ARRIVED IN JAPAN!
He is also super popular in Japan!
-my little brother! - Your what, please?
- Did you see? - I did.
A stunner, right?
Yes, a real stunner.
Is she the manager?
She's really pretty, isn't she?
Oh, yeah, she is!
They're just kids, but boys will be boys...
To be beguiled by a beautiful woman...
I just say, "no comment."
From Haneda back to the studio!
Ha, there's a great superstar visiting us, huh?
I'm sure of it!
That was Daisuke Jigen!
- Even you, Conan-kun! - Huh? What's that? What? No!
- He's the worst! - I don't believe it.
Now listen!
- You were looking at her! - No!
The mistakenly stolen diamond.
And the projectiles fired at the crane.
By mistake, you say?
Is that even possible?
That's Lupin for you.
Dressing up specially as the Kaitô Kid...
CENTRAL FOR ANTI-LUPIN MEASURES
and stealing a diamond he didn't even want...
No doubt about it. A challenge to us...
Fighting message!
...is definitely not.
He's making fools of us as usual,
- Inspector Zenigata? - Yes, he is.
This time, he's after a jewel called "Cherry Sapphire."
You know him, Takagi-kun?

The only Interpol investigator who specializes in Lupin III!
Hello. My name is Zenigata.
Commissioner! Does Lupin always make such silly jokes?
Yes.
I guess we'd better think a little around the corner.
How do you know he's really aiming for that "Cherry Sapphire"?
Yes! Maybe he's fooling us again!
From his email.
He's... He's e-mailing you?
Yes. I can't answer him, though.
They're pen pals!
- Do you want to see them? - Yes!
Take it easy.
Tell me, Commissioner Megure, can I borrow a few?
I'd be happy to, but I don't know if they're suitable...
I am! Can I join the search for Lupin?
Actually, that would be Investigation Division 2's job.
But Inspector Nakamori has been temporarily suspended.
He made a mess of things in Tsukishima.
So...
- That's why, for once, we're going to be Department 1's... - Me!
Here, me!
I... me, too!
To think that I can actually participate in the capture of Lupin....
You see, Lupin-san is Sato-san's first love...
Takagi-kun!
I see. So that's why you enlisted right away.
No! The reason I enlisted isn't because I'm so clueless!
It's okay.
Arresting your first love...
So you don't want anyone to take him away from you?
I'm counting on you.
Inspector Zenigata...
I'm giving it my all!
In a way... I love Lupin too.
COME ON...
Absolutely ridiculous! Parking his car here...
He's looking for a fight with traffic cops? He's in for it!
But the number can't be verified. What do you mean?
The license plate is probably not just a fake.
There are really dubious organizations...
Really, mega-dubious!
Mega? Is that how you say it nowadays?
What? You don't think so?
So you parked the car here?
COME TO THE TRAFFIC POLICE ON THE 2ND FLOOR! GRRRR
And the car was from Interpol....
This argument doesn't work with our traffic police.
That was the Miyamoto/Miike duo.
I'm going to the traffic police!
You'll probably get a fine...
MÔRI DETECTIVE
Sonoko?
Yes, hello? What's the matter, Sonoko?
On TV? Now?
YOUNG NOBLEMAN EMILIO ARRIVES IN JAPAN!
Yes, we're watching.
I'm going to see him tomorrow after school!
That's right! Emilio!
The real thing!
I know which hotel he's staying at!
What, really, really? How do you know that?
With our information network, it's a piece of cake!
Piece of cake, you say...
But personal information...
- Don't worry. Okay. - Shh!
So that's where?
Okay! See you tomorrow then!
Ah, but his manager is also beautiful, huh?
What are you saying!
Oh, that Sonoko.
We can discuss homework tomorrow, too!
Are you going to see Emilio?
Really.
What a pretty girl!
He's on Genta's level...
DETECTIVE MÔRI
I'm coming too!
What?!
TÔTO-BANK
Is such a thing really absolutely necessary?
It often escapes by helicopter.
Often... That is, you want to shoot it down?
But is that really safe?
Should we rather put the stone somewhere else...?
It's better if we don't show too much activity.
Because the more we move, the more chances we give Lupin.
Good thinking.
We're going to the vault.
- Yes, sir! - I'll also...
Wah... That's some vault!
Did you contact the owner of the Sapphire?
Yes. We also asked him if he'd like to move it...
if he'd like to store it somewhere else temporarily,
but Mr. Eishin Wakagomo said:
There is no need.
I have full confidence in the Japanese police.
They enjoy quite a lot of confidence...
We will catch him, for sure!
Just leave it to us! Right, Sato-san?
Hey! What...
Guys! Let's get together and do our very best!
Yes!
Please be quiet, this is embarrassing.
Five minutes to the announced time of action!
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE IN EFFECT
All streets are now sealed off, no vehicles allowed to pass!
To everyone outside the bank: communication on channel B from now on!
TÔTO-BANK
Has Lupin ever been late with advance notices?
No.
That means... One minute to go!
And he must already be around here.
Yes. Perhaps he's smuggled himself in among us in disguise.
W... who...?!

- Satô-san, please don't! - Don't move!
- Or I'll shoot. - Ah...
He doesn't have to be human.
E... he can turn into something else...?
He can change?
What if his disguise was that vault door?
I'm sorry. I just... I was just trying to ease the tension.
I was hoping it would bring a smile to your faces.
It's after one!
And, uh... nothing's happened yet.
Did he change his plan because of the tight security?
If he's after something, he'll steal it.
That's him, Lupin III.
But that means... he's already in the vault?
In movies, gangsters often dig under the vault...
and then rob it!
Is there a camera in there?
When it comes to lockers, privacy is important to us....
Let's take a better look just to be sure.
There's not a hole anywhere to be seen here.
Thank goodness!
A... but... Maybe the Cherry Sapphire is the only one that's already been....
You mean it's already gone?
D... that can't be... This can't be true!
You carry both keys with you?
Yes. Eishin-sama gave me his.
It's still there. The Cherry Sapphire is safe!
It's three minutes past the announced time.
Could it be... Could it be...
that your clocks are all three minutes fast?
Wha...?!
It's only one now?
I see. At that moment...
...Lupin, as Takagi-kun, set all of our wristwatches ahead three minutes!
Right, right, absolutely right!
Right on time. So I'll take him, Father.
Every once in a while, you have to recharge.
Farewell, my first love!
Ouch! Ouch ouch ouch!
You're breaking my arm! Ouch ouch ouch!
You kept your bargain as usual!
And now the cute girl has caught you. Be happy!
Father... that's mean.
Taking advantage of the fact that I can't use violence against women!
Well... Put it back...
Lupin III!
It's 1:02.
I'm arresting you for theft!
Excellent!
You're almost too good to be a simple detective!
Uh... Sorry to spoil your fun...
Yes? If you make a move, I won't hesitate.
Lupin! She's really scary.
I put some silver stickers behind your watches.
Are they still there?
A sticker?
Yes, it's still there, but...
My own invention: Britzel-Britzel stickers!
Even a little stronger than stun guns.
Sorry, girl, but I'm giving you these back.
You can't escape me!
Are you serious, daddy?
Here's seconds.
Sorry, girl, to drag you into this.
You miserable...
...father! You're not a zombie.
If I go on, it'll be dangerous for her.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Lupin...
You're scaring me!
FOR THE FIXED INVESTMENT OF YOUR ANNUAL PENSION: TOTO BANK!
Lupin! Lupin's in the vault!
NO ENTRY FOR UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS
He's disguised as Inspector Zenigata!
Lupin's here!
He said so himself!
Yes, go ahead, get in!
You idiots! Not me!
Ow-ow-ow! Time out, time out!
Lupin's come into the bank! Lupin's...
There's Lupin!
That's the real one!
A third has been arrested.
A fourth showed up in front of the newsstand!
I don't think that's the real one.
- I'm from the TV! - You can't do that.
Command center! How can we recognize the real one?
A Lupin specimen spotted in Beika Park. It's very trusting.
There's a squad in pursuit at the north portal of the station!
I'm out of masks...
BEIKA STREET
Lupin is turning onto Beika Street! Send men to the south entrance!
Please forgive the disturbance!
Is business good?
Are you selling well?
Not "oops"! "Fish"!
Octopus! Octopus! Ink!
It's a bad world, isn't it, Grandma?
Such a nice boy! Shall I introduce you to my granddaughter?
I'm not allowed to fool around any longer!
Damn it!
We totally fell for his game!
What do we do now? Should we call for more reinforcements?
On the contrary. Call off the search here.
He's not here anymore.
A... but where...
My watch is burnt out. I really liked it...
What's up?
We lost track of Lupin!
Thieves really need sturdy legs!
I just love playing tag...
There, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there!
If you don't use a car or a helicopter,

it had to be the train station. But it can be sealed off in no time.
It's too far from the bank to the next subway station.
At least that's what I thought.
Before I found out
where the air vents and maintenance entrances were.
You're really something, girl. I'm about to fall in love.
But you'd better get over it. I really need this thing.
Wait!
Let's play again when the paralysis is gone!
The passageway should lead
to the maintenance tunnel of the power plant...
- What was that? - Personal accident 100 meters from Beika West Station!
Are you okay, Sato-san?
Takagi-kun!
Luckily, I got here in time.
Don't be so reckless!
W... How dare you do that in such confidence!
Which one of us let Lupin... by Lupin?
Yes... I'm sorry. I was careless. I was careless.
Really...
I won't leave your side again.
You won't?
Wha... Handcuffs? Huh?!
You're Lupin. You're not acting like Takagi-kun.
Oh, I've been found out?
Hey, wait up!
Lupin!
Huh? What's wrong?
Did you hear Inspector Satô's voice, too?
Huh? You just imagined it.
I'm sorry Dad's still...
It doesn't matter. As long as he doesn't want to meet Emilio.
But it's his manager, right? Anyone can fall for that.
Here we are, Miss Ran!
HOTEL SAKURASAKU
Come on, stop it already.
It brings back memories, doesn't it?
Oh, it wasn't that long ago!
That's right.
Wait here. I'll call the manager.
She'll just call him...
I'm the famous detective Kogorô Môri,
who solved the murder of the Princess of Vespania with aplomb.
What are you doing?
- My assistant called you. - Assistant...
What is he doing?
He's not just going to suddenly...
He might.
It's okay.
Mr. Môri, this is not the place. Follow me.
Yes, that's right.
What is this?
What is this?
What do you think you're doing?
Let's go.
Never mind.
Hey, wait!
Interpol or no Interpol!
A misdemeanor is a misdemeanor!
I don't care who the owner is, he's paying for the tow truck!
We're talking about precious government money!
Let him pick up his own car! I'll put a dent in it!
The keys are in the car?
Behind the sun visor. How cliché Western!
Senpai! Takagi-san's in the back seat!
What? Why is that?
What are you doing?
The others are waiting in the conference room.
Oh dear, did I keep them waiting long?
I'm really sorry.
Turn to your left, please.
All right!
It's this room right here.
Oh, this brings back memories...
Hello, hello!
- Knock! - What's up? What came out?
No, it's nothing.
Wha... Inspector Shiratori?
Môri-kun?
Superintendent!
What are you doing here?
- How do you do? - Is he here? Is he?
Commissioner Megure, who is he?
Ah, don't worry. This is...
DETECTIVE AGENCY MÔRI KOGORÔ MÔRI, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR
...the best detective in all of Japan.
Kogorô Môri, at your service, Miss!
Ah... yes, thank you.
Well?!
Excuse me. I'm his daughter, Ran Môri.
I'm his assistant, Sonoko Suzuki!
Just "Sonoko" to you!
Like one, like the other.
The fact that Inspector Megure is here means...
I see.
The receptionist thought the old man was here because they called him.
What happened?
Nothing that concerns you.
Superintendent...
"Takagi is unharmed. But the Cherry Sapphire is..."
Lupin?!
Lupin!
Fujiko!
I was so worried!
- They didn't hurt you, did they? - No, they didn't.
- But I was so scared... - Oh, my!
And what a tasteless collar they've put on you!
They really have no style!
Let's get this over with. Give the goods to Fujiko-kun.
You're impatient, aren't you? Don't you like chatting?
Oh, take it easy!
Why don't you leave the guns where they are?
Why don't you think about where we are?
I don't need the box. I'll just take the Cherry Sapphire.
Come on, what are you doing?
It doesn't look like it's been tampered with.
I'm really sorry.
You hooked up with them?
This thing is well made, isn't it?
But it's not real.
And...
I'm sorry, but you're not getting it either.
That's okay, right?
Weapons down.
Wah, that's Fujiko-chan as she lives and breathes!

I would like to say, but this time you were a little too naive.
Huh? Why?
The explosive collar is definitely real.
Isn't it?
Deceiving a weak woman... That's the last straw!
If you want him so badly: there!
So, what are you going to do?
Would you like to see my head and my body separate?
You seem to have doubts about my taste...
This concludes our deal.
As soon as we're safe, we'll get it from you.
If the stone is a fake...
Don't worry. It's the real thing.
What if it wasn't?
That wasn't another test, was it?
No.
That was the last time.
I'm giving you the car.
And the coat inside.
Thank you very much.
I guess we won't see each other
we won't see each other again.
HOTEL SAKURASAKU EXIT FIRST FLOOR
This is the organizer of the concert in Japan, Mr. Luciano Carnevale.
Nice to meet you.
And this is...
My name is Claudia Bellucci.
I'm Emilio's manager.
I know...
Why we're here...
Commissioner...
Should we tell them?
It may come as a surprise, but Môri-san can be trusted.
The "surprise" part wasn't necessary. But I can help you.
It's like this... This morning, Emilio received this.
That's...
That's... that's...!
This... What does it say here?
You've made it exciting... But you can't read it, can you?
It looks like the old one.
Scraps of newspaper with words on them... Italian?
"Cancel the live concert. Or Emilio's life will be in danger."
Oh no?!
It's a threatening letter?
"Or else his life will be in danger," you say?
Who touched the letter directly?
I didn't touch it.
Emilio and I touched it.
So if we find any other fingerprints on it, they'll be the perpetrator's.
If it was a perpetrator who left his prints..,
we'd be in the clear, wouldn't we?
Let's call it off.
I don't want to! Let's cancel the concert!
Calm down, Emilio.
Don't act like it's so easy!
We have already invested huge sums of money in this concert.
For us the renovation of the stadium was finished earlier!
And of course all the tickets are sold out!
You know yourself that we can't cancel now!
I beg you, Lupin! If you don't,
this is going to explode!
If you really love me, then take the job!
Oh, please, stop bullying me.
Why don't you say it? "It's your own fault."
No. The thing I want to scold you for is yet to come.
Fine, don't. I'll just ask Kid-sama.
Well...
Do you understand?
Get what?
That there's only one person in this world who can protect you...
And who is that?
Lupin.
That's right! Now, sit back.
No, don't!
Why not?
Hurry up and run!
Or else...
If I can go to the other world with you, that would be the greatest!
That bastard...
He'll be sorry he betrayed me!
Fujiko, give me back my clothes...
Was it right to let her go?
If we'd killed that woman..,
Lupin would've come after us.
That wouldn't be good now.
We must get our hands on it. For our homeland.
It's not public knowledge that Emilio-san...
is staying at this hotel.
Only the concert crew and some of the hotel staff knew about it.
But it could still be an outside culprit.
Enthusiastic fans
do everything possible to find out where their idol is staying.
Presumably, it's just a silly prank.
But plainclothes officers will monitor the situation at your side....
I know who the culprit is!
What, really, Môri-kun?
Yes, sir!
This threatening letter was sent by...
Lupin III!
Lupin?
Are you serious, dude?
A petty thief who's been causing a ruckus here since the day before yesterday.
He sensationally steals a jewel, only to throw it away again.
Probably because he didn't like it.
The phone call just now
was about Lupin stealing another jewel...
wasn't it, Shiratori?
What's wrong with him? He's a razor-sharp analyst!
Indeed, we've just learned that.
But does it really have anything to do with the threatening letter?
Lupin's motive for canceling the concert
to cancel the concert and steal a valuable jewel...

This is...
This is...?
...Claudia-san!
He intends to give you the jewel when you are completely depressed!
To give?
That's right!
This guy wants to try to seduce you!
You are in danger here! You have to come to my house!
Emilio!
Don't worry. I'll stay in my room.
We haven't signed yet...
Let's go, Sonoko. Now's not the time for that.
Conan-kun, come too!
Yeah...
What about Mr. Môri?
- Forget it. When he gets going... - That's right.
We'll put a guard on this floor.
Isn't Emilio as safe?
He's got a real reliable bodyguard!
You sure know your stuff, young man!
I saw him on TV!
Conan-kun?
Yee-ha!
He has a trustworthy bodyguard?
A charismatic instructor who can train a certain army...
...three times stronger...
three times stronger with his training alone!
Wah, dad, you're really great!
Excuse us!
There was a pastry shop downstairs, right?
Yes, it was! You have a great memory!
- Shall we eat there? - Good idea!
- One floor above the lobby, right? - Yes.
What's up? Conan-kun?
Hey! We're leaving you here, peck!
No, please don't!
Come on, let's go have some fun!
Wha... off... but...
The peck has grown up to be a great man!
Sonoko! But that's...
A miracle has happened!
Sonoko!
SMOKING AREA
Hey, wait a minute!
Now, at this moment,
Emilio is holding me by the shoulder!
And we're running together!
Wait! Please wait!
Hey, stop!
Ah... I'm sorry.
Listen, Sonoko! Think hard.
Aren't you going to ask if I'm okay first?
Let's go back. He can't go out right now.
Why not?
Why can't he go out? He got a threatening letter!
If anything happens to him...
The letter was just a joke.
How can you say that? It said his life was in danger.
- I didn't see it. - Stop it!
You beat the strongest bodyguard in Vespania!
Don't exaggerate.
Anyway, there's no enemy within 10 kilometers!
Sonoko...
There... Let's go there!
Yes! Wherever you want!
Ah... There'll be thunder for sure!
You want to pollute your lungs?
This is the only place in the hotel where you can smoke and drink.
Hello, master detective.
Young man, this is...
Ah, I've come to fetch Papa!
Oh, yeah? Would you like some juice?
An iced coffee, please.
Coming right up.
What's wrong?
You're not the only one who drinks iced coffee all year round.
What are you up to in our town?
Oh? So you're here as Shin'ichi Kudô?
Please.
Please taste this lemon tart, too.
Wah, thank you!
You poor thing...
Stupid.
Your favorite word is "jerk"?
- And "I have to go to the bathroom"! - Why are you taking notes?
Is your bladder that weak already? You better get that checked!
It's not!
You got it? Adults can be scary.
So you're threatening me.
Oh, don't worry about it.
As long as you keep your nose out of it, you'll be fine.
Tell me...
It's in your notes, too,
that when I'm threatened, I get more motivated?
Paaah, that's too tedious for me.
I'll eat the cake.
- You just called me dad! - Do you realize that now?
- It's me. - What's up, Ran-neechan?
- Emilio's gone? - You're with Emilio?
Excuse me? You're not with him?
Sonoko's with him too.
We're all looking for him.
We'll go upstairs and then come back.
- Tell Papa and... - Confiscate that!
Don't! Give it back to me!
Hey!
You seem to be having fun.
Yeah. All right.
Your call...
Ah, yummy!
They seem to be at Emilio's.
Looks like it.
Where are they?
I don't know.
Let's make a grown-up deal.
I'm leaving!
Okay, okay!
I'm crumpling my notes!
Here, look, I'll throw them away! Okay?
Dad's apologizing.
That's fast!
Unbelievable.
I don't know if this is a good idea...
Where was the bodyguard?
It's no use now.
Let's search the area too.
The cops are gone, right?
Yes, but the private detective is still here.
Is he looking for him too?
Yes.

What a useless bodyguard.
I'm really sorry.
But as soon as my business is done, I'm leaving anyway.
If there's anything, it's here.
Oh, what a beautiful evening sun!
And a dream guy too!
Ran! You're frowning.
No way! Everyone looks kind of suspicious!
Come on, let's go back now!
Is it...
I'll look around here too.
He even changed his shoes.
It's me.
It's not in the hotel, as I suspected.
Yes. It must be somewhere in the concert material.
What's wrong?
Don't pretend.
Didn't you say you were going to the tower?
I'd rather go with you, Dad.
I'd rather go with you, Dad.
So a bodyguard has a spare key?
I didn't steal anything. You gonna arrest me?
"Possession of a firearm" will do, won't it?
Okay... Out of paternal goodwill, I'll tell you something.
This thing really has nothing to do with you guys.
So leave us alone, okay?
Your answer?
Will not.
Tell me...
Yes, what do you want to know?
Do you have Italian newspapers?
Ah, I'm sorry. In our hotel there are only English newspapers.
- Do you need them right away? - No, no, not necessary. Thank you very much.
Uh... Excuse me...
What is it, darling?
I have to go there for a moment...
N... go ahead, see you soon!
Yes? You take a lot of time...
What? Why do you mean?
Yes.
I know about the Lupin job.
The Cherry Sapphire was stolen.
It was in the vault of the ToTo Bank.
Is there anything special about this gemstone?
Not really. There is nothing special about it.
Nothing like that to be found.
But Lupin even announced the theft.
I got it! The owner of the gem!
Bingo! You're finally catching up with Kojima-kun and the others.
Catch up? What?
Oh, no, they're...
...eager to do it again.
Even more than usual.
Since early morning they inspect empty houses,
overgrown lots and basements.
Do they want Lupin's hiding place...? If they found it, they wouldn't need the police.
- They found it. - They didn't?
Eishin Wakagomo, the owner of the Cherry Sapphire.
Lives in a bank vault,
SHITAYAMA MOTORS
in a bankrupt repair shop?
And I also recently had the shutters in front of the entrance redone?
What, they found out that much?
- The professor eagerly joins in. - Oh, Professor...
I can't stop them.
It's dangerous! Keep them there until I get to you!
Come on...
Let's catch Lupin and go to Hawaii!
Yee-haa!
Forget it.
- What's wrong? - I wanted something else!
Emilio's manager and his promoter.
Yes.
Yes.
Got it. I'll check them out.
So? What are you do...
Selfish.
Was he there?
No.
- Do you think he went back down? - He only pretended to go in.
I didn't take my eyes off the door.
He was trying to lose us from the start.
Why?
- I don't know. Anyway, let's go find him. - Yeah.
EMERGENCY EXIT NO TRESPASSING
NO ADMITTANCE
Are you sure it's Emilio?
- There's no one here.
Believe me, it's him.
Do you really think Emilio is alone?
Have you seen Emilio?
And you are?
I'm part of his Japan tour team.
So it was really Emilio!
Oh, you're so pretty!
...he said! So I went to get an autograph card!
During working hours...
Wait, you can't...
You can't go in there!
Call the boss!
It took a while.
I'm sorry, sir. I have to buy a ticket.
Here.
Yay! You're so nice!
Don't make fun!
What are you doing, Emilio?
Ran-san!
You're not supposed to come up here.
- Stop this nonsense! - Stay there!
Please tell me why you're doing this!
The concerto... I don't want to give it
I see... You are exhausted, aren't you?
You must be allowed to rest.
I can't.
As long as I'm around, the concert won't be cancelled.
A... but this...
This is not normal!
No concert can be more important than a person's life!
If these people don't cancel it,
then I will... then I will...
Anyway, I beg you!
Please come away from there.
We're the only ones
To go up at this hour...
I hope they're still up there.
I haven't heard anything else from her.
Tell me, do you have a safe house here in town?
I don't think so,

They answer you everything, just because you let the child hang out.
So you do have one!
Why does it always end like this?
That's...
You can't do this!
I'm begging you! Talk to me!
Tell me...
Tell me what's wrong!
I don't...
Emilio...
Hold on to my arm!
Ran-san! I'm...
Don't worry!
Can you get there with your feet?
Yes!
Ran!
Sonoko...
Stop whining!
Ran Môri is amazing, okay?
I'm going to pull you up!
One, two...
No!!!
Sonoko?
Ra...!
Hey, dude! Can you open this?
- Is she the girl hanging there? - Yeah.
- Washer thickness? - Two times 10 mm.
- How big? - To jump through.
Twelve shots.
Run! Don't let go of Emilio's hand, okay?
I'll beat you up, Emilio!
Putting my best friend in danger like that!
How dare you!
I'll beat you up until you're not a dream anymore!
S... Sonoko...
Will you do it?
Sorry, Sonoko...
But, um... I'm...
no strength left...
Run!
Run!
Run!
Ran-neechan!!!
Squirt!
Conan-kun!
Yay!!!
Thank you so much, Conan-kun!
Super! That was absolutely awesome, peck!
I'll give you a hug later!
I'll pass on that one.
Me... my lord! What are you doing?
What am I doing here?
Saving lives.
I told you, nothing happened, don't worry.
You've not only put yourself
but also the people around you in danger.
Are you sure you realize that?
Think about it, okay?
Would you...
help us?
Don't worry.
The concert won't be canceled.
Then it's all right.
It just seemed to me
your little pop star was a little too cocky.
If he stands out too strangely,
it might interfere with our transaction.
You're calling me just to tell me that?
You're taking an unnecessary risk yourself, aren't you?
Yes.
The time and place remain the same.
So Claudia-san knows too...
Yes.
Or rather... She worked with him from the beginning.
This secret transaction...
What's going to happen...
I don't know.
When we're on stage the night of the concert....
I'm sure she'll...
This whole thing started after Luciano became your promoter, right?
Yes. That's when everything changed.
My songs... my performances...
The attitude of the TV stations.
Before, they ignored our demo tapes.
But most of all... Claudia has changed.
She was so happy.
And loved my songs more than anyone else.
You thought that if the concert was canceled, there would be no transaction.
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to jump off.
I'm sorry I misunderstood you so much.
I'm sorry for slapping you.
I understood. You meant it, for my sake.
I'm sorry. I still had it on me.
Right.
It's Pops!
Yes?
Yeah. I know. Listen, uh...
He's with us.
Oh, don't shout so loud!
Look at this piece of paper.
It was in your room.
You found it in my room?
Don't hide it anymore.
There are no Italian newspapers in that hotel.
And Claudia-san understood the threatening letter without suspecting anything.
That means..,
that "K" didn't accidentally detach itself from the threatening letter.
That's right.
If it had come off when it was opened, it would have been noticed.
There were fine scratches on the table. You used a cutter, right?
In Italian, you don't actually use the letter "K".
I'm destroying the evidence now! Or am I not allowed to?
Good hotels don't throw away the trash from the rooms right away.
Hide the newspaper and cutter when you get back.
Glue was there, too.
Japan's police are smart, so watch out.
Even earlier, on the tower...
Who are you?
Conan Edogawa.
A detective.
Is that one of his sayings too? Should I steal it?
Somehow... you're incredible.
A lot of fans are waiting for you. Make the concert a success.
I'll stop the transaction. And
I'll catch all the bad guys.
Oh!
We've been looking for you!
You shouldn't be out walking around right now!
We were so worried about you!
Do you realize how many people you've caused trouble for?
Thank you so much.
If you hadn't found him, who knows what would have happened....

That's all right. Searching for missing persons is part of my craft.
Emilio...
Don't think that people will deny you any...
I'm sorry.
The joy of being in Japan made me overconfident. I regret that.
Please forgive me, Claudia.
These are not empty words. I'll prove it to you at the concert.
I'll make it the best concert I've ever given, Luciano!
I'm going to the tour team.
The show meeting is tomorrow.
I want to apologize to them for the excitement.
S... right.
That's a good idea.
Môri-san!
What did you say to Emilio?
Well, what you know as an adult...
SHITAYAMA MOTORS OIL
It's me.
We should give up the safe house.
The peckish friends of said peck might come to visit uninvited.
What do you advise me to do in this case?
They have turned off their cell phones. Are they with you?
They went to bed early to be fit tomorrow. The professor is already asleep.
Are they...
Probably, yes.
The peck is pointing his finger at me right now.
Are they...
It is indeed you.
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY!
We've admired you for a long time!
Welcome to Japan!
I am incredibly excited!
CHICKEN EGGS
Here, a little something for you!
Please!
They're delicious!
- There's nothing suspicious in them! - Taste!
Very thoughtful of you.
Super! Everything is going according to plan.
Once he's asleep...
...we tie him up.
With a double knot.
And then we'll...
BRAVO, DETECTIVE BOYS! LUPIN ARRESTED
I'll make some tea.
Are they asleep?
Without arousing suspicion.
But why do I have to hide?
One should not accept drinks from strangers.
They're great "detective boys" to me!
Let's inspect what they're carrying.
You take them off too?
Don't say "undress"!
Oh, Fujiko-chan!
Unfortunately, this is where we part ways.
Thanks to you, I'm out of a job as a bodyguard.
So we don't have to stay together any longer.
Take care.
Ugh! You're going to do terrible things to my friends!
Pah! Just keep trying that number!
I just don't go for it every time! I'm an adult.
A thief!
Shit! If you yell out like that,
- I react automatically! - Look!
Information about Luciano-san has come in.
Are you listening?
The Italian Mafia?
According to information from my headquarters...
they're planning a huge transaction here in Japan.
Lupin will be there?
Presumably, yes.
That sounds unusually unconvinced by your standards.
Does anything strike you as odd?
It's just too contrived.
Does he want the jewel? Or does he want to thwart the transaction?
You mean none of this is like him?
It's not the type of person he'd associate with.
So he has a favorite type?
How did you do?
I looked into it. But it's no longer necessary.
No longer necessary?
You don't plan to press charges.
It was strange from the start.
That guys who plan a transaction would call the police on their own....
There's someone among them who wants to disrupt the transaction.
Let's find out.
What are these toys?
These are all really great things!
The work of a master craftsman.
To give something like this to little kids...
No sane adult.
Well? What are you doing, Fujiko-chan?
Escaping?
What am I going to do? Smash those guys.
What brutal language you use without hesitation...
It's dangerous to go alone.
Who says I'm going alone?
Did you ask your friends again?
I did.
What friends?
All of them.
There'll be a world war.
Don't worry.
I won't get in your way.
And I've asked my friends to use only ordinary weapons.
How is that supposed to reassure us?
Have you done any research?
I told you, I won't get in your way.
Fujiko!
Put the kids inside. I'll take them home right away.
What? Are you going somewhere?
I'm not staying in a place this shabby.
I'll just get my weapons.
Let's leave it at that.
I'll ambush the merchandise.
At the concert hall?
Yes.
Once you've informed Zenigata and the police, pull out.
Your detective work is done. That's my second warning.
There's no third.

I promised to prevent the transaction.
At all costs.
Tell that to Lupin!
AGASA
Good evening.
Fujiko Mine...
What should I do with them?
They might catch a cold outdoors.
I'd like to leave them here...
Can you promise to come with me?
DETECTIVE MÔRI
EMILIO: JAPAN TOUR ORE STOLEN FROM VESPANIA?
Emilio Baretti, the "singing young nobleman"!
Tomorrow we can finally hear him sing!
Okay, that was good.
Now the interviews with the fans who stay here.
A transaction in a place where so many gather....
Very well thought out.
Once the concert starts, all eyes are riveted to the stage.
Luciano is also said to have had a say in the remodeling of the stadium.
A walk from the understage to the band's dressing room....
During the concert there is no one there.
- What about the security cameras? - We hacked them.
Do you have any idea how dangerous that was?
If it wasn't for sleeping pills, you'd be dead!
This only happened because you left without me!
Professor!
Ah, sorry...
I'll get Haibara out somehow.
Yes...
You're all grounded!
Yes...
It's all going according to plan!
We're not going to be dissuaded!
Haibara managed to sneak in!
Will Conan-kun be surprised?
As soon as Ai-kun contacts us, we'll leave!
Yes!
You're serious.
Yes?
Yeah. It's okay.
She's making me feel really comfortable.
No.
I'm not gonna tell the kids the right place.
There's just no stopping them.
Whose turn is it? The little boy? Let me talk to him!
I haven't seen him since our submarine trip!
- He hung up. - Why?
I guess he doesn't want to think about it.
He doesn't want to think about it. I didn't do anything to him.
What are you doing!
You're so cute!
Tell me, have your breasts shrunk too?
Or were they like this when you were Sherry-chan?
Of course not, what do you think! In reality, it was much more...
No! I can't jump on that!
Listen... Let's get together and finish that remedy!
The apoptoxin you had in mind...
And what do you want to do with it?
Of course, I want to use it myself to rejuvenate myself!
Eternal youth is the dream of all women!
Then I'll sell it and get rich!
Please don't disappoint me.
What I developed wasn't some dreamy miracle cure.
And you weren't like that before.
A woman who wraps all men around her finger with her woman's weapons,
and who just storms off until she's bagged her prey;
a burglar who never looks back.
Once a woman becomes obsessed with youth, that's the end of her after all,
Fujiko Mine...
Yes...
This one's too small!
Let's start over, more fog!
All right!
That looks good!
The team is working together even better than usual!
Everyone is surprised by Emilio's motivation.
Yes.
After that, we're going back to Europe.
There's a little break, too.
Is the transaction taking place in this room?
What's going on?
Are you suddenly interested?
Or...
Is it your silly sense of justice?
Môri-san!
I apologize for..,
for asking you so cavalierly!
But don't be!
I choose my cases according to my values.
Tomorrow is the day! And today you won't sleep a wink.
Now I don't really matter anymore.
I'll drink some wine and go to sleep.
Because in you I have a reliable guard!
Count on me. Claudia-san will...
Clau...?
Ah, no, wrong! I'll be keeping a close watch on
I'll keep a close eye on Emilio-kun.
Claudia-san?
Ah, Ran-san...
So you can't find any peace?
No.
Until this room is filled with spectators tomorrow,
I can't rest.
Even though the concert has been sold out for a long time?
I still dream about it.
How I run around in an empty hall all alone.
Running around?
I sit down here and there and play the visitor.
Maybe because I don't want Emilio to notice me.
Well, it's just a dream.
No, it was reality.
Look.
We always hand out flyers with the next concert dates.
That used to be my job.
Sometimes we didn't even have thirty spectators.
Was it very bad?
Oh yes. We didn't have any money!
And it hurt me to be so powerless.

And not being able to do anything at all for Emilio....
Claudia-san...
FOR MEMBERS ONLY
Welcome.
Nothing has changed here.
I got everything you ordered.
Even the still unused Walther?
The grip and trigger spring are custom made.
It is light as a feather.
Your good work is also unchanged.
The money is in the case.
As for the money...
Talk to the guest in the séparée first.
I see... No wonder I didn't feel any presence.
I'm not a ghost.
I can't believe you're still in Japan.
You did get the Sapphire, didn't you?
Ha, the King is, as always, perfectly informed.
Your actions are always newsworthy, even outside of business.
So, what's up?
Why are you here?
A first-class ticket to Naples. Will you fly home with it, please?
- Is there a hidden camera? - No, there's no camera.
Don't touch Luciano's assignment.
I know I'm doing something I shouldn't.
But this thing is off-limits. And I want to be fair to you.
- Is it a woman? - Nope, a kid.
Did you do something wrong?
I think you're getting the wrong idea.
And even if it were true, I haven't done anything wrong.
Of course you'll get something.
What's this?
Raw photos of Yôko Okino.
Wha...?!
And...
An embarrassing photo of Fujiko-chan.
Okay.
All right, guys! Let's go!
I have to go to the bathroom!
I have to go for a minute!
And I'm guarding the side of the stage.
That means... I'm sitting here alone.
Emilio!
It's strange.
Lupin is nowhere to be seen. Neither is Luciano.
The last picture of Luciano...
is this.
That was 30 minutes ago.
Where's that?
The door also leads to the basement. But no car has left the parking garage.
Look!
The corridor to the basement has been extended!
What?
For VIPs. That's why they ordered silence.
We had a raid on the construction company!
MAXIMUM HEIGHT: 2.2 M
MAXIMUM HEIGHT: 2.2 M
Did you see me?
No, not even in front of the corridor.
We were deceived. Next door is a normal street.
Wait a minute.
What about the cameras out here?
Where you are...
No. Your car is the only one not showing.
But you might be able to see which way they went.
The estimated time...
The cars that passed by...
But that's...
Co... Conan-kun!
What's that?
He's not answering.
Is that boy always like that?
He seems even more enthusiastic than usual.
Or am I the only one who feels that way?
Where are you...
Are you using science and technology. I, on the other hand...
I rely on my intuition at critical moments.
I see... So he knew.
Emilio trusted you, Claudia-san.
And he said he wished you would stop doing bad things.
TOTAL BILL: 51,600 YEN
BILL - Uh...
CASH DEPARTMENT
Twenty radishes, a box of cabbage....
Oh dear, he even broke the cash register!
Hello? This is Takagi, who botched Lupin's arrest, is suspended, and now has to
and now has to calculate the damage all by himself! What can I do for you?
I've also written an apology.
What are you saying?
Is Inspector Takagi in?
Oh, it's you? What's wrong?
More bills.
Take care of the rest!
Hey, stop! You can't do that!
In such cases, Inspector Takagi is the right choice.
He always believes you!
Ai-chan is mean! Why is she telling us a false location?
Maybe she's being threatened
and had no choice but to tell us the wrong place?
Let's save her, quick!
Conan-kun said he'd get her out.
First we have to meet Inspector Takagi.
Let's catch them all!
Yes!
What's wrong?
You need my computer all the time.
Are you sending them false information?
I don't want them to be in danger.
So you're a talented traitor?
Just like your old organization...
But don't worry about it.
For women, betrayal is an accessory.
You're going out?
You can go.
The burglar who has men wrapped around her finger says..:
If someone betrays me, I won't forgive him.
Are you coming? But it's incredibly dangerous.
FORMER HANEDA AIRPORT MAINTENANCE AREA
This is the first time we've met in person, isn't it?
It's an honor, Mr. Luciano.
My name is Alan Smithee.
Alan Smithee?
That's his partner in the transaction?

Luciano mentioned this name once.
Did he say where the transaction was taking place?
No, so far he hasn't told anyone.
I see. So it was imported as a spare part here into this airport....
It's considered "not yet imported into the country."
But even if it were checked.
they wouldn't find anything suspicious.
What is it?
A keyboard?
The one you want...
is this. I was free to process it, wasn't I?
Then we too will do as promised....
This is
the promised Cherry Sapphire.
Sapphire?
What is this?
Is this a joke?
What are you saying?
Really. Covering up a shady deal like this...
You're a real pain in the ass.
What?!
I told you I'd catch you next time.
You're really full of energy...
But dad told you to give up being a detective.
Yes, he did.
So you betrayed us?
Pah! You fired me, didn't you?
This is your special last chance...
If you give it up, I'll let it go.
I'm not stupid enough to turn a blind eye now.
You've never fired a gun before.
I'm sorry, but..,
but I was thoroughly trained in Hawaii.
You set me up! What's with this jewel?
We were set up.
Do you know a man named "Kein Gejidasu"?
"Kein"? Who's that?
I don't know him!
It was my fault...
"Kein Gejidasu", huh?
You got it?
You detective nerd...
I'm amazed you found us here.
Shall I tell you how?
Later.
Never mind. Get rid of them.
This is your gig!
Secret technique: Tornado counterattack!
Goemon! You're doubling the risk right now!
Unskilled.
No time for self-criticism.
Get out of the way!
Once again, I have slain something unworthy...
I've been in business longer than you!
Lupin! I'm taking you in!
The brakes aren't working!
- Put your hands in the air! - It's over!
What, there's more!
Not bad, Jigen! You've gotten better!
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me either.
Obviously. But then who was it?
Freeze!
I got you, Lupin!
I'm Jodie Starling with the FBI.
We're taking the liberty of detaining you.
What?
A shooting at Haneda?
The former maintenance facility also serves as a parking lot for private jets.
They were about to take off again.
Areas A, B and C: all clear!
In view of our enemies: Stay on guard.
Why did the FBI show up now?
I called them.
I'm not going into a dangerous situation without a plan.
Shit. I can't aim at them. He's deliberately getting in the way.
You see, we also do what we want in Japan.
We liked the idea of handing you, an international fugitive..,
to the Japanese police so they'll owe us.
Jodie-kun, arrest him.
Got you.
- Keep quiet. - Jahaa!
Wait!
You better not touch him.
You never know what he's carrying.
Son of a bitch.
Both hands behind your head. And kneel down.
Yes.
I'll let you sleep for now. And that's guaranteed.
You really are an unsympathetic peck.
- You miserable... - Stop it!
You can shoot me if you want. However...
Even if you hit my head,
I'll still pull this trigger.
Give the case back.
Nobody touches it.
Get as far away from me as possible.
Or I'll shoot him!
Okay, okay! Just be cool.
Isn't this your chance, peck?
Ah, Alan-san!
The money! It was agreed to exchange it for the money!
- Pilot, do you read me? - Yes.
- Turbines start. We're about to take off. - Roger!
Take the bag. The money's in there.
- Bring the car around. - J... Yes, sir!
Here Satô. We'll be there in three minutes! Keep the gate open!
W... What are you doing here, Takagi-kun!
Wah! Shit, that's not good...
Don't let them get away!
They're about to overtake us!
We've got Inspector Takagi!
We've got Inspector Takagi!
But I'm telling you, this is not good!
Civilian car: Clear the way!
Do you have a car?
You think we're gonna sneak up on them in a car?
A helicopter's been requested.
They'll get away...
They're... They're aiming at us, aren't they?
Lower your weapon. They won't shoot.
Start the car.
We're about to take off like this. And ignore the tower.
Oh, dear. My poor little Alfa Romeo...

What do we do now? Chase them on foot?
- How am I supposed to... - Lupin!
Fujiko-chan!
- Who's that? - Fujiko Mine.
Chest measurement: 99 cm, waist measurement: 55 cm, hip measurement: 88 cm.
She's also an international fugitive.
Finished already?
Not at all! The main show is just beginning.
First Lupin, and then the FBI....
And they both backed off for your sake.
Boy...
Who are you?
Why do I have to steer?
Would you rather shoot? Don't worry, we'll be done in a minute.
H... hey, wait, wait, Fujiko-chan!
The peck's on board too!
I don't care!
If you want to shoot him too, I'll crash the plane!
Then you'll tell me? The secret of the medicine...
All right, then.
- Then we don't need it! - She's throwing it away!
I'll take it.
Step on it!
Up!
Well?
Could it be that...?
My bike was a Harley too. Do you mind?
- Keep an eye on the kid. - Yes, sir!
We're ready. Get going.
They're whining.
GB 27! Stop at once! There's another plane approaching!
- JNA 301, abort the landing! - GB 27! AR 27!
You don't want to...
I'll stop them at any cost.
If I hadn't come with you...
V1 reached.
Take off.
We're jumping!
Gear up!
Gear up.
JNA pilot, do you copy?
Keep going. We're taking evasive action.
Rescue to maintenance area. There are multiple casualties!
Why won't they let us in?
I guess they can't.
We have an inspector here!
Don't say that out loud.
- Tell them... - I'm so glad! Are you sure, Ai-chan?
- Yes, I'm sure. Yes. - Show your badge!
Conan-kun...
flies with what?
Ouch... He flies like a hangman!
He sure does. I almost fell off again.
What?
That was really very nice of you, peck.
Why do you produce such an incredibly exciting arrangement?
- Please? - Don't change the subject.
The fact that no one was killed in a shootout like this...
You were responsible for the way the FBI set up, weren't you?
Keeping the balance of power so no one got hurt badly.
Wah, that's annoying.
If they'd just kicked each other's asses, it would've been a done deal!
That's what you were aiming for.
And it would have worked out perfectly!
Will you leave the ending to me?
Don't get mad if it doesn't go according to your ideals...
It's in our hands now, commander!
Yes. Now even Jiranba
will be able to fight.
Oh dear! You really have a hard head!
You idiot!
Give him up. This is his fate.
I don't think we're even now, okay?
Okay... I can smell the seawater.
We could have crashed.
We owe the pilot a debt of gratitude.
You guys did a great job controlling the plane. I'll take over.
The throttle's working.
Tail's hard to steer.
Okay, we're good.
Peck!
Oil pressure is zero. But the engine has a backup system, right?
I'm surprised...
Who... are you really?
Stop talking. He is...
Shin'ichi Kudô.
High school student and detective.
You're a high school student...
You still have everything in front of you...
can do anything...
Also in my country
there are many young people who...
His country is treated like a colony by its neighboring countries.
With overwhelming military power.
What is his real name?
Alan Smithee is a pseudonym....
Doesn't matter if he stays Alan Smithee to us.
Launch order?
The Jiranba ambassador requested it.
But I'm telling you! There's another boy on board.
Get me Chief Superintendent Matsumoto.
We're going to Hajijô Island.
Let's fly back and you turn yourself in.
The FBI is there too...
Don't be silly.
Peck... If you fire that, we'll crash.
I can fly it myself.
Don't make jokes.
Even I'm wearing a seat belt and taking this seriously!
You get the radio and radar fixed.
Yes, yes.
After I fix it, will you inform Vespania?
That's interesting. When did you realize?
I realized early on that the transaction might involve Vespania ore...
early on.
Daisuke Jigen was handling dowsing rods in the hotel.
He was looking for Vespania ore, wasn't he?
He showed it to me once in Vespania.
What was he thinking...

But surely that's why it didn't have to be Vespania ore?
Not yet, no.
But when they opened the case, he checked to see if it was real.
Who? And how?
Daisuke Jigen pointed microwaves at it.
And despite the small amount, the light went out.
Do you want to hear everything?
Fine by me. But maybe that'll be your last conclusion.
That cheap kid's trick doesn't even need a real conclusion.
This Eishin Wakagomo, who entrusted the bank with the Cherry Sapphire,
and also the name earlier in the transaction...
Do you know a man named "Kein Gejidasu"?
"Kein?" Who is that?
EISHIN WAKAGOMO GOEMON ISHIKAWA
"Eishin Wakagomo" and "Goemon Ishikawa"
and "Kein Gejidasu" and "Daisuke Jigen" are anagrams.
NO GEJIDASU DAISUKE JIGEN
Really. Couldn't that have been done more elegantly?
Even the Detective Boys have seen through "Eishin Wakagomo"!
And marched into your house, brimming with confidence.
That's really mean.
Jigen and Goemon really had their heads screwed on...
The cherry sapphire Goemon gave to the bank..,
you deliberately stole it.
The condition for the transaction that Daisuke Jigen, as Kein Gejidasu.
to Alan Smithee was also the Cherry Sapphire.
He also recommended to Alan Smithee a thief for the Sapphire: Lupin III.
So from the beginning, you weren't after the Cherry Sapphire,
but to get to Alan, who was behind the
Vespania ore stolen by unknown persons.
Then to find out who he was planning to buy this ore from.
And finally to steal it himself.
I thought to myself, "If the Cherry Sapphire is yours, Lupin,
it's probably tagged with a transmitter.
I picked up its signal...
and that's how I got to the place of the transaction.
But did Fujiko Mine
...teamed up with you to get the ore back?
It was all over the net that it had been stolen.
Dumbass. Why would I retrieve stolen stones?
It wouldn't earn me a single yen.
Yet
you tried to get them back.
But why?
Who cares? We don't play guessing games.
The reason is:
It's Vespania ore. To protect it,
the former Princess Sakura gave her life.
That tomboyish tomboy princess, the daughter of
of said Princess Sakura, must have asked you to do it.
If only you had found out sooner that Luciano had stolen the ore,
you wouldn't have had to come to Japan and shoot up the place.
I let things slide on purpose.
So I could meet a cheeky little master detective.
Don't bullshit me.
It's working again for now.
Thank you.
It happens a lot, doesn't it? The "you know too much" scene.
In our world, image means everything.
Lupin III helping others...
You have to remove the safety from your Walther to make that kind of joke.
Mood killer.
Eagle One to HQ.
Final code: 1-0-2-7! Please acknowledge.
AIR DEFENSE COMMAND CENTER
Confirm final code.
Launch permission is granted. Repeat:
Permission to launch is granted.
Officially requested by the State of Vespania?
ROYAL HOUSE OF VESPANIA
If we don't manage to get it back....
What then?
Destroy it before it can be taken out of Japan.
You could have foreseen that!
You were unpredictable!
If you pretend to be a kid, I won't stay at home!
Can't you take a joke?
Here she comes!
Full throttle!
- We got chaff! - Drop it!
Here's the plane from Jiranba! Eagle, come in!
Target has dropped intercept chaff. Missile missed.
We have received official demands from Vespania and also from Jiranba.
Deploy an AAM-10.
Roger that.
The next one is serious.
Defending is no longer an option!
This is the Cherry Sapphire.
I cut it from a rock myself!
But that's...
Did you cut it from that stone?
Yes, Fujiko had it.
It's also made of Vespania ore!
- High-voltage switchboard in the cargo hold! - Okay!
...not just for stealth technology,
but can disable all electronic devices.
If one of these falls into the hands of a military state..,
...the global military balance...
...global military balance will be destroyed!
Is that it?
DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE

What's up, peck? Come on, quick!
Shit...
They've got us in their sights!
Pull up steeply! Then hover and sink again!
In that case...
Hang on, peck!
A little more!
I just...
Now!
...a chance!
- The controls! - What's that?
Abort mission!
Eagle One, do you copy? Abort mission!
There are civilians on board!
Abort the mission now!
Eagle One, do you copy? But, sir...
The target is crashing and emitting strange lights!
A boat?
This is Eagle One.
Parachute detected! I see them!
Point 0-9-2-5!
Parachute confirmed.
They've spotted us.
They're not firing now.
So what? The Navy's gonna show up next?
With the FBI in tow.
I didn't go that far.
No. I can't trust you.
- Drop down! - Ouch! Hey, that hurts!
- Hey, my arm! - You miserable octopus. Octopus!
Encore!
Encore!
Emilio! Emilio!
Were you watching?
Yes. You were great.
Will you stay with me and watch?
Go on stage.
That's where you belong.
Encore! Encore!
Let's go!
Yes... yes.
I see. Then it's all right.
Commissioner...
Thank you for letting me watch to the end.
Did anything happen?
I beg your pardon?
Oh... In the end, everything sinks to the bottom of the sea.
I hate this pattern.
It's really creepy. What's with all this nasty hissing?
You're the one who's hissing.
It tickles a little when you do something good for others, doesn't it?
It's like a thief forcefully breaking open your heart.
Idiot.
D... this submarine...
Does it bring back unpleasant memories?
Hi! How are you, my little one?
What's wrong with you?
Oh... I don't like small spaces.
I couldn't agree more.
I knew it. You're tough.
Haibara? You're in on this too?
What's that supposed to mean!
If it wasn't for me, you'd have burned to death in Haneda.
Yeah. If she hadn't accepted my request, I'd have shot her.
Request?
What are you talking about?
Hey, wait a minute. Are you going to betray me?
For women, betrayal is an accessory.
Isn't it?
What are you talking about?
SLEEPING SPRAY
Emilio! Come back soon!
Thank you, Conan Edogawa.
A lot has happened.
But he has such loyal fans who support him.
He'll be okay.
What do you think Lupin and his friends are doing right now?
Who knows...
They'll probably be aiming for the treasures of a foreign land again.
Here comes a thief!
You really are naive.
I'm not going to come to Japan and leave empty-handed.
What's that? And where is the treasure?
Huh?
I already helped myself. Kaitô Kid.
I'VE HELPED MYSELF BEFORE. KAITÔ KID
Lupin, you're under arrest!
Aren't you?!
You can't escape me!
But I didn't do it! Believe me, father!
Who's going to believe you?
Kid, you bastard, you'll pay for this!
In that case...
LUPIN III VS. KAITÔ KID
THE MASTER THIEF DECIDER! SUMMER 2020 IN THEATERS
This is a joke, all right?
