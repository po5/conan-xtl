CONGRATULATION
CONGRATULATIONS OPENING OF THE TOTO LINE
Now Lord Mayor Asakura
will give a speech.
Dear 13 million residents of Tôkyô
and railroad fans all over the country.
Thank you for your patience.
OPENING
The city's subway line no. 15,
the Tôto Line, is open!
A threatening letter? To the mayor?
Yesterday afternoon
it arrived in the mail at his home.
There is no return address on it.
Because of your four years of arrogant government...
...heaven will punish you.
Arrogant government?
His first term in office
has a good reputation after all.
Well, everyone feels differently.
People who are discontented without any reason
or angry.
Yes.
It's like Shiratori says.
Tomorrow, Mr. Asakura will be at the opening ceremony of the Tôto Line.
We will
keep an eye on him there.
In any case, be on the alert!
The mayor has boarded the train.
BIG SPACE EXHIBITION
The exhibition is sure to be awesome!
There's even a spaceship simulator!
I want to try it out!
Only one person is interested in something else.
You're thinking about..,
You're thinking about what Môri heard from the inspector, aren't you?
The threatening letter to the mayor.
Yes.
I hope nothing happens.
Eh?
KKB NEWS
- Yes, that is true. - Yes.
This is the new Yamate tunnel.
This tunnel meets
the Tôto Line.
Yes,
it runs right under the railroad line.
About a kilometer long.
This is the curve.
After that, we're parallel to the ToTo Line.
What's wrong, Conan-kun?
Nothing...
Wasn't there...
...a person?
There wasn't a car or a motorcycle.
And he was holding something.
About...!
Professor!
Stop the car!
What?
A bomb!
There's a bomb in the tunnel!
Eh? A bomb?
A bomb?
A... but...
I can't stop here.
Conan-kun!
Is the detonator on?
Damn it!
Megure here.
Kudô here.
Stop the train now!
There's a bomb about to explode!
A bomb?
Takagi-kun!
Stop the train!
It's a bomb!
Eh?
Ouch.
An earthquake?
No, that's...
The train's coming out.
It's the ToTo Line!
Kudô-kun...
Oh, no!
There's a turn coming up ahead!
- Stop, stop! - Stop the car!
Stop the car!
Are we saved?
Are you
hurt?
I'm... I'm fine.
Thank you.
THE 15 MINUTES OF SILENCE
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran..,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on it,
I didn't notice the man behind me.
He was administering a poison to me.
When I awoke,
my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive,
my friends...
and I will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised not to reveal myself.
Ran asked what my name was.
So I said, Conan Edogawa.
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father is a detective.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
These are my classmates now.
Genta,
Mitsuhiko,
Ayumi.
They form the Detective Boys
with me as an unsolicited member.
And...
This old man is Kogorô Môri.
Explanation unnecessary, isn't it?
These are Professor Agasa's inventions.
He develops for me
one unique device after another.
The ball-shooting belt.
One press of the buckle
and a ball pops out. Super convenient.
My new gem is this high performance snowboard.
Step on the gas pedal
and it goes even without a slope.
Of course, it also has a turbo motor.
By the way,
besides the professor, someone else knows
knows my identity.
Ai Haibara.
Shiho Miyano, actually.
She belonged
to the Men in Black organization.
But something happened
and she wanted to die.
She swallowed this poison, after which her body shrank.
And so Haibara, who now lives with the professor,
and I live the life of first graders.
I am small, my mind is not!
No case remains unsolved!
There is always only one truth!
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
Plastic explosives were used.
There was a timer,
which was operated by a remote control.
Now about the timer. According to the testimony of Conan Edogawa,
who saw the perpetrator,
he didn't turn on the timer until he was sure the train was over him,
that the train was above him.
The train was traveling 60 km per hour.

From the stopping bay, where the perpetrator was standing,
to the bomb was 250 meters.
Consequently
the timer was probably set for 15 seconds.
Without the emergency braking of the train driver, the explosion would have
would have hit the train full on,
which would have ended in a catastrophe
catastrophe.
Who said,
that the train had to be stopped?
Huh? Well...
An employee of the police.
That's all I can say.
All the passengers, including Mr. Asakura,
were unharmed.
Commissioner,
please keep my involvement confidential.
I don't want to make more enemies through work.
Work?
He's a high school student.
What's more, thanks to Conan.
...there hasn't been a single car..,
...that's ever been damaged.
It's really a miracle.
That Conan Edogawa,
why did he think of a bomb?
Kogorô Môri, who was here, told him..,
that the criminal could use a bomb.
Huh? Me?
A master detective!
Um.
Did I say something like that?
Mr. Môri,
a few words please about the perpetrator.
This attack
on the mayor,
which was also intended to destroy his new showpiece,
the new municipal subway line,
is inexcusable!
What do you currently know
about the perpetrator?
Unfortunately, the aforementioned stop is not
captured by the surveillance cameras in the tunnel.
We assume that the perpetrator used the emergency exit
and escaped via the federal highway above ground.
But so far
there are no eyewitnesses.
Conan testified that he did not know anything
about the perpetrator's appearance, age or gender.
We at the police
assume that the motive for the crime is
Dissatisfaction
or anger over Mr. Asakura's policies.
and are investigating in that direction.
That is all.
LIVE POLICE HEADQUARTERS PRESS CONFERENCE.
This was live from the police headquarters.
How now? Finished already?
They didn't say a single word about the Detective Boys.
How boring.
Let's play a game! Come on!
That's a good idea!
Ho... whoops.
The search for the culprit seems to be
difficult.
This threatening letter,
maybe it was just meant to disguise the real motive?
Huh?
Camouflage, you say?
Professor,
the mayor
used to be Minister of Transport.
During that term, he is said to have
he is said to have razed a village in Niigata
and built a dam...
Yes, I remember.
That was the Kitanosawa Dam.
At that time, Minister Asakura
went to the village in person,
prepared a deposit sum
and pleasant replacement land,
and stayed there for a week.
He talked to every villager,
gained their trust
and they agreed to the relocation.
It took three years to build the new village,
It took him five to build the dam.
This unprecedented pace was a great achievement.
Yes,
that's how it was.
Nevertheless, there was
someone who was against it right to the end.
Exactly! If the anger about the construction of the dam
is the real motive of the perpetrator...
Is the perpetrator a villager
or a participant.
It is only one of many possibilities.
Next Sunday, the relocated village will hold a celebration
will hold a celebration of its fifth anniversary.
The mayor wanted to attend.
But the incident made him cancel.
I understand.
You want to go to that village and investigate on the spot.
Yes. Professor, would you drive me there?
Where are you going?
- Take us along too! - It's always Conan, isn't it?
Weren't you just playing?
If the Professor's going, I'm going too.
Haibara...
He'll get overweight without my supervision.
Don't worry.
He's already overweight.
Soon it'll be our turn.
This is so exciting.
- It's so cold! - But the snow is soft.
It's fantastic!
Good. Let's slide again!
- Yes! - Yes!
The kids are having fun.
Yes,
right.
Yeah. It's a good thing we brought them.
Well, they're okay...
Come on, Ran!
Mo... Wait a minute, Sonoko!
Menno, don't push.
I'm sorry.
Oh man, why Ran and Sonoko too?
On top of that...
There it is.
The legendary outdoor pool.
Plus...
A mixed bath!
I've dreamt of such an open-air bath!
Will there be sexy ladies waiting for me
or pretty girls?
Well then.
There's one!
Oops.
Ahem.
The water temperature is lovely.
So under the open sky

Snow contemplating being in a hot spring,
has style, doesn't it,
young lady?
VEGETABLE BROTH FRIED DUMPLINGS
SOUP
What are we going to eat?
- It all looks delicious! - Oh!
The takoyaki are great!
The squid too!
Isobeyaki is delicious too!
- Good. We'll eat one at a time! - Ahem.
First, a quiz.
Huh?
What food goes best with a stand,
that is located in a place with Powder Snow?
First.
Sweet potato.
Second.
Rice with seaweed.
Third.
Squid.
Fourth.
Octopus balls.
What is powder snow?
It means powder snow.
Powder snow?
Powder snow... Powder... Flour...
I got it!
The octopus balls!
Huh? Why?
Because only the balls contain flour.
I often make these with my mother.
Besides, in Kansai, they're called dumplings,
Kazuha told me.
- I see. - But wouldn't that be too easy?
A little more tricky...
I'm sorry it's not tricky.
Then here's a question from me:
Which dish of this goes best with the professor?
The answer is none of the above. All of them are fatteners.
Too bad.
The
wasn't a quiz after all.
Then we'll go
go eat!
We'll eat for the professor, yes!
Let's go too.
Yes, we'll eat for you too.
What about you two?
- I pass. - Me too,
I'm going for a walk in the village.
I'll go with Conan-kun.
No way! You and I will have tea.
A map of Kitanosawa?
Yes.
And a guide from the dam, please.
Yes, all right. Wait a minute.
You, Yamao,
one of the ski resorts has been shut down.
Yeah, I heard earlier.
There were too many avalanches.
Thanks for waiting.
The map for Lake Kitanosawa.
And of the former village of Kitanosawa on the same scale.
Well,
my buddy is dying to know
where his birthplace is submerged in the reservoir.
I see.
Let's go.
Yes.
Not good.
Hey, isn't that a stun gun?
Oh,
you know your stuff.
For self-protection.
For an insurance investigator in Tôkyô...
is often in a sticky situation.
Outside the house, I always carry this with me.
Well, thank you.
So, here I am.
Um,
the map of the village and the guide to the dam.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
The guy..,
who was against the dam until the end...
Eh?
Does he live in the new village too?
Why do you ask?
Oh, this is
Research work for school.
What grade are you in?
First grade.
In that case
you'd better choose another topic.
For example... Look. In the lake Sawajiri near here
there are a lot of swans right now.
LAKE SAWAJIRI SWAN LAKE
You'd better watch the swans.
A hot spring feeds the lake,
which prevents ice formation.
Yes well, I'll think about it.
You don't tell a child anything.
Hah, I feel sick.
Here's your medicine.
Thank you very much.
Take it, it'll make you feel better.
And your overstuffed belly.
You had to eat ten plates of octopus balls out of sheer wantonness.
It wasn't that much.
That wasn't praise.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What grade are you?
First class!
So, first class...
Yes...
THANK YOU LODGE KITANOSAWA
That was really delicious!
Yes, it was.
Eel on rice would have been even better.
But
you've already eaten so much for lunch.
Genta-kun has an iron stomach.
There's room for more!
Oh, yeah. Let's buy a souvenir for our teacher!
- That's a good idea. - I wonder if they have eel cookies.
Oh, boy. He's going to eat...
Conan-kun, are you coming?
Yes.
I'm going back to the room.
SNOWSHOEING
Snowshoeing.
At Lake Sawajiri...
Hello, miss!
What is it, my boy?
Does the snowshoe hike
go past the dam?
Well, if the participants wish, you pass by there too.
Are you interested in the dam?
Well, yes.
What are we going to take?
Those bear-shaped manjû!
No, owls are better!
They seem so intelligent.
BEAR MANJÛ
Hm...
Ai-chan, what do you think is good?
A... Handle cup?
I LOVE SWANS
I love swans.
I love Shiratori!
I LOVE SHIRATORI
Huh?
What is it, Shiratori?
- Got a cold? - No.
I won't get sick
as long as the culprit is free.
Hm...
HAND-KNIT
I wonder if I'll make it to next winter?

Tell me Ran, what do you think of this?
What, me?
As a gift for Makoto-san!
Oh, why not? It's cute.
It looks a little like you.
Yeah, you think so?
What about you?
Eh?
What do you want?
Well, a present for Shin'ichi-kun!
Don't bother.
He won't be home anyway because of some investigation.
If you let him run around without a collar..,
someone else will put a collar on him.
A collar?
Am I a dog?
Well,
Actually, Makoto-san is also loose.
Um,
maybe I should call.
Hehe.
Oh no!
Hello?
Ah, Shin'ichi?
Where do you think I am now?
Eh?
In Niigata-ken, in Kitanosawa village.
We're at the Snow Festival...
Oh, wow!
What's the matter?
The lighting is incredible!
Plus, it's snowing. It looks amazing.
I'd love to show it to you.
Well,
if it's that great,
I'd like to be there.
What do you want me to bring you?
Eh? Well...
It doesn't matter.
"Doesn't matter" doesn't mean anything!
Say what?
All right, then. What is it?
Lots of things!
For example, Manjû in the shape of a bear.
A wooden owl.
And a cup with a picture of a swan.
Swan...
What is this?
Then the owl.
It's good. The owl it is.
I don't know when I can pick it up.
Put it in our living room.
Menno,
you have to come home sometime.
Yes, I know...
Where are they going at this hour?
Hello, Shin'ichi?
Sorry, I can't leave right now.
See you later, okay?
Ah! Shin'ichi!
Oh no...
Just in case...
Oh no!
Oh dear.
These are...
The things I mentioned.
Then the owl.
Is Shin'ichi
about...
That's fast!
- I always wanted to ride that. - This is really great.
It's amazing! It's like a roller coaster!
- It's great! - There's more!
- Hey, Genta-kun! - That's dangerous!
Don't worry about it! Leave it to me!
- Genta-kun! - Look ahead! - What?
You, Genta-kun. Could it be that we've left the compound?
Huh? You think so?
It's forbidden to drive on public roads.
What? Seriously? Then let's turn back.
Hey, you guys still alive?
Kinda.
The snow was like a pillow.
Not good, right?
We can't get it up by ourselves.
What are we gonna do?
It won't stop snowing.
And it's much too far to walk.
Cars don't seem to pass by either.
Don't worry!
We have these after all!
Oh man, these kids.
Do what they want.
You should be glad..,
your skateboard's been modified for snow.
Yeah, that's right.
That's where it needs to be.
Boy, is Conan taking a long time.
Yeah, but it's pretty warm in a snow shack like that.
Yes.
Huh?
Did you hear something?
Ah! It's Conan-kun!
You're late, Conan!
Ai-chan came, too!
I'm not used to the snow.
Edogawa-kun alone, I'd be worried.
Hm,
I see.
It won't work without an adult.
We should have the professor
to pick us up.
What?
I called you because I didn't want anyone to know.
We don't have a choice!
- It's your fault. - It's your fault!
You got too cocky!
You were having fun, too!
But there are such things as limits!
Think about what you're doing!
What are you saying?
Stop it, you two...
You make it sound like I don't think!
Hey, were you thinking something?
Of course!
You're just pretending to be smart.
What's that supposed to mean? Genta-kun, you...
- Mitsuhiko, you...! - That's enough!
Both of you..,
You shouldn't say anything else.
Once you've said something..,
you can't take it back.
- But, but, but... - But...
Words are like knives.
Misused
they become a weapon.
Through wrong words you can lose a friend.
If you pass each other by, there might not be a second time.
Ah!
There's a car coming!
Yes. We'll be back soon.
Tell the others we're fine.
Yes good, be careful.
Yes.
Hey!
Apologize properly.
- Yeah. - Got it.
I'm... I'm sorry, Mitsuhiko.
That's all right. I'm sorry, too.
You're lucky.
If I didn't have a date,
I wouldn't have gone that way.
Uncle, don't you live in Kitanosawa Village?
I live alone in a hut on the mountain over there.
I carve owls.
Huh?
You carve owls?

You make these?
I carve the small ones in the hut.
The big ones in the workshop near the dam.
The dam...
I used to live in the village,
but the dam swallowed it up.
Tell me,
Are you the one who was against the dam until the end?
Yes, I am.
Even the initial opponents,
like my parents,
eventually moved to the relocated village.
That damned village!
Sorry.
- You three... - But, Môri-kun,
The three of them look like they've repented.
- But still... - You see...
Thank you for coming all this way,
Thank you for coming all this way.
No, no, no, no,
I was on my way to this lodge anyway.
Oh, I see.
I'll say goodbye then.
Yes, thank you again.
Hey, say thank you too.
Thank you.
Don't make any more trouble!
Yes!
Come on, let's go inside.
- It must have been cold. - Yeah.
I thought we'd freeze to death.
Who wanted to ride the snowmobile?
You, Genta-kun!
SOUVENIRS
Hey, Mutô!
Here!
You're late.
Ah! The nurse from today at noon!
So it is.
Thanks for earlier!
Good evening.
How's your belly?
- It's fine. - Genta-kun has...
- Oh... -has a huge stomach.
Those two...
Excuse me, sir. Are you Kogorô Môri?
the master detective Kogorô Môri?
Indeed I am. I am Master Detective
Kogorô Môri.
Eh?
I knew it. Are you investigating a case here?
No...
We're here for the Snow Festival.
Do you take children to work?
No, certainly not.
Of course not.
To meet the master detective in a place like this...
Isn't it?
Let me introduce you.
Next to me is Keisuke Yamao.
Opposite him are Mizuki Toono
and Fuyumi Tachihara.
And this is Takehiko Mutô.
And I am Shôgo Hikawa.
We are from
from the former village of Kitanosawa.
Yamao and I
have traveled from Tôkyô
to attend the ceremony.
So you've known each other since you were little?
Yes.
We were in the same class.
However
it was a village school
and our class consisted of just the five of us.
Only five?
Yes, that's right.
It's been eight years since we last met.
Eight years?
A really eventful reunion!
But why
have you waited eight years?
Huh?
Oh, that's
That's why.
Hikawa-kun, stop it!
Eh?
Is that...?
Eight years ago,
...he was living in Tokyo at the time..,
he went to visit his grandmother, who lived in the old village...
BEER
He got scared,
left the girl as she was and fled to the village.
But then he changed his mind
and voluntarily surrendered to the police.
Eh,
voluntarily?
Yes,
The car was badly damaged.
Escape was out of the question.
At that time he had
had run up gambling debts
and his life was totally upside down.
Hit and run,
drunk driving, speeding
and no driver's license.
He was severely sentenced
and not released until this summer.
Then the village, while you were serving time....
Talk of the dam came up,
and the village was sunk.
Yamao-kun's grandmother
suffered a shock from the incident
and died.
So she didn't live in the new village at all....
The worst thing is,
that the girl he let die
Mizuki's 18-year-old sister
Mizuki's sister, Natsuki.
Yamao-kun,
I still haven't forgiven you.
I can't forgive you either,
Hikawa!
When the dam issue came up..,
...you were all for it, sold the land to replace it...
...and moved to Tokyo. That's unforgivable!
But Mutô...
You tipped off your parents!
You sold our precious homeland!
Do you realize that?
In this world, you have to look after yourself.
Well, that's enough.
Let's go to the rooms.
Yes, exactly.
We shouldn't disturb any longer.
Let's go to the rooms.
Yes, fine.
Sorry to disturb you.
That one,
that Fuyumi,
she's carrying a burden, too.
Yes.
Classmates of the elementary school and each
develop so differently.
Yes, that's true.
Don't worry. You'll be fine.
Eh?
Why?
I know exactly what you're thinking.
Aaah,
what will become of Shin'ichi and me?
Won't we?
No,
I was just thinking about those people.
But not about him...
So?
The thing with the souvenir...

Is Shin'ichi-kun really in this village?
Yes.
But he's probably not staying at this lodge.
I
just feel..,
...that Shin'ichi is somehow nearby.
Eh?
Whereas I actually always have this feeling.
You sold our precious homeland!
Do you realize that?
I wonder if Mutô-san had something to do with the explosion?
And
his classmates?
Oh, so much snow!
Let's have a snowball fight!
Yeah, let's do it!
Conan-kun, Ai-chan, join in!
I'll pass.
If you don't watch them, you won't know what they're up to.
Hurray!
How dare you! Wait!
FOR TÔMA
Wait!
Take this!
- He's coming! - Get out of here!
Hey!
Hey, wait!
Missed!
But now!
- There he is! - Hey!
- Take that! - And that!
Oops!
- Ah, someone's watching. - Eh?
He seems to want something from us.
Good morning!
Ah...
Huh?
I... I...
Sorry for entering the property so easily.
La... let
mi... me...
with...
Let
me
play along...
Isn't that boy a little weird?
Yes,
kind of childish.
Eh?
Toma!
You're awake...
Tôma!
- Tôma! - Ah!
Hello? Mom?
How nice.
I'm finally with you.
Tôma.
How nice.
Fuyumi's son, Toma..,
...fell off a cliff...
from a cliff near the old village eight years ago.
and was found unconscious.
Tôma was immediately taken to the hospital
and could be saved,
but since that day he has been unconscious for eight years.
Eight years?
On that very day, Yamao committed the hit-and-run accident.
What? The same day?
Yes.
In a quiet, peaceful village
two big accidents happened in one day.
The whole village was upside down.
Do you have any details about Tôma's accident?
The police determined that it was an accident.
The cliff is close to the lake with Tôma's beloved swans.
When he was found
a pair of binoculars was hanging around his neck.
He must have slipped.
He was found
by the neighbor's dog, whom Tôma had loved so much.
What happened to Fuyumi-san and her husband?
She is a single, unmarried mother.
The hospital where she works called her for an emergency.
Does Tôma have any grandparents?
No, Fuyumi's parents were victims
of an avalanche.
They died?
They were found 30 minutes after they were buried.
If they'd been found 15 minutes earlier, they might have been saved.
Yes,
They say that the time limit
for burial in an avalanche is 15 minutes.
15 minutes?
Yes. Those 15 minutes are life critical.
15 minutes is very short.
You can take some time off from work.
Take good care of Tôma.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
POLICE NIIGATA
What happened, Fuyumi?
Mizuki,
Mutô-kun!
For now, Tôma's body doesn't show any problems.
Good.
Only
his soul...
He doesn't remember the fall.
Therefore
he can't understand why he slept for eight years
for eight years at a stretch.
Still, it's nice, Fuyumi.
Really nice.
Forgive me.
Why don't you wear contact lenses?
For a beauty like you.
contact lenses are better than glasses.
Glasses have a coolness to them,
I don't like it.
But, Pop!
Really.
That's what's bothering you.
That Toma-kun's accident and
Yamao-san's accident were on the same day.
Yes.
Is it just a coincidence,
or...
Tachihara-san!
Toma-kun woke up?
You all came.
Come in.
Do you think he'll be okay?
Eh?
Isn't it too early for a meeting?
I guess so.
Toma, look at Kaori and the others.
Hey..,
How are you?
Long time no see, Tohma-kun.
Let's take a break.
Yes!
Oh! So many swans!
Hey, Mizuki-san.
Yes,
I've got contacts in.
I had some left.
Yes, it looks much better like this!
It really shows off your beauty.
Really, Pop.
You,
didn't she change her hairstyle a little, too?
Eh?
Maybe she likes your father.
Stop it, Sonoko!
You're really beautiful.
You, tell me...
Huh?
This lake is this one, right?
Yes, it is.
And where was Tôma-san found?
Eh?
Tohma-kun?
- Yes, that's right. - Um,
here.
What? That's weird.
If he went this way, the direction is wrong.

He must have gotten lost.
Now let it be.
And Yamao-san's accident, was that
in that bend?
Yes, that's right...
Why are you asking about that?
Go on, get out of here!
Conan-kun!
Oh, it's snowing!
Yes, it is.
Oh, man.
Something to think about again?
Yes.
I wonder if Tohma-kun was really here for the swans.
How nice!
This could be piling up.
Don't worry.
It'll stop soon.
Let's slowly start moving again.
It's really stopped.
Locals really know their way around.
Mizuki-san,
why don't you come visit us in Tôkyô?
I'll show you around.
Then the Sky Tree.
Ah. N... just not that, please.
Môri-san, do you have problems with heights?
Shamefully, yes.
Do you have a weakness?
Dark, narrow spaces scare me.
Why do you squeeze in?
Why not?
What's wrong, Mizuki-san?
Well?
That jacket? Isn't that Hikawa-kun?
Huh?
Hey! Hikawa-kun!
- I wonder if he can hear me. - What's he doing back there?
You,
Something's wrong.
Yes.
Please
wait for me.
Hikawa-kun!
What are you doing back there?
Dad...
Yes,
I'm going to go check.
Hikawa-kun, what's wrong?
Hikawa-kun!
Mizuki-san!
What happened?
Something's wrong with Hikawa-kun!
- Get back! - Yes.
Hikawa-san, what happened?
Hikawa-san? Hikawa-sa...
Dad!
Stay away from here!
It's too late.
He's dead.
Are you all right?
Yes.
No external injuries.
Death by freezing? No.
Heart attack?
That's right, Hikawa-kun has had heart problems since he was a child.
Then that's it.
Ran, call the police.
Yes, I understand.
You, that's weird.
Huh?
The stun gun is missing.
Hey! Get out of here!
Hikawa-san said
that he always keeps it in his pocket for protection!
Huh?
That it's missing means..,
someone took it.
No, that can't be.
Why?
Look at that.
There's only one set of shoe prints.
And they're from his shoes.
In short, Hikawa-san
walked from the village alone along the stream
and as he ran across the field,
he had a heart attack.
That's how it must be.
And the stun gun?
Left at home.
Unthinkable.
But, uh... These shoe prints...
Maybe it's a trick
a trick of the perpetrator.
Eh?
What?
Well, you often hear about it.
About the mystery of shoe prints in the snow.
I don't know...
Huh?
Shoe prints
in the snow...
I've got it!
It's actually a trick!
Watch out.
The culprit has already poisoned Hikawa-san
at the creek with poison or something
by a heart attack!
He puts on
boots like the ones Hikawa-san has,
and carries the dead man to here.
Then
he sets him down
and steals the stun gun.
On the way back he steps backwards
into his own footsteps.
Backwards?
Is such a thing possible?
Sure it is.
Look!
Why is there so much snow in his hood?
I see.
I got it, Uncle!
It was a very simple trick.
What?
It was snowing earlier.
The culprit comes with Hikawa-san from the creek,
causes a heart attack and kills him that way.
After that, the fresh snow erases their shoe prints.
Then he waits until it stops snowing,
puts on the same boots as Hikawa-san has on,
and returns to the stream, walking backwards.
backwards to the brook.
You don't?
Thus remains
only one kind of prints remains.
As proof just look into the hood of Hikawa-san.
It's full of snow.
After the snowfall, the perpetrator must have
the snow from his head and shoulders.
To pretend that the dead man had just come here.
But this trick
works only if the body is discovered immediately.
Otherwise the shoe prints would
would disappear again with fresh snow.
That means the perpetrator
must be someone who knew we were coming this way.
Or he has
led us here on purpose.
That we come along here about this time,
you can guess, if you read
the notice.
Haha, that's right.
Tell me, Mizuki-san.
What's in the direction of those shoe prints?
Mutô-kun's mountain lodge.
Mutô-san's?
But
There's a village road leading to the mountain hut from the village for cars.
Ah,
where we rode the snowmobile yesterday?

Why didn't Hikawa-kun
didn't take this path?
No, the perpetrator and Hikawa-san deliberately
intentionally did not take this path.
They chose the inconspicuous path from the stream across the fields.
Why?
POLICE
Thank you for your patience.
Hikawa-san's body
is being examined
by the medical examiner.
That it was a heart attack is confirmed for now.
But whether the death was natural
or if it was induced,
we won't know until after the autopsy.
Induced?
You mean Hikawa was murdered?
We can't say yet.
Yamao-san,
what were you doing
at 2 p.m. today?
I wasn't with Hikawa at the time.
I went for a walk in the grove to the east.
Alone?
Yes.
Did you meet anyone?
No.
Got it.
Next,
Tachihara-san.
I went to Tôma's house.
He was asleep because he was exhausted...
had exhausted him.
Can anyone testify to that?
No.
And you, Mutô-san?
I was in my workshop near the dam...
working.
In your workshop?
Not in your mountain hut near where Hikawa-san's body was found?
where Hikawa-san's body was found?
No.
Can anyone testify to that?
No, nobody!
I don't meet anyone while I'm working!
But
why was Hikawa-san
was on his way to your mountain hut?
How should I know?
Were you really not at the mountain hut?
What?
You had him come and kill him, didn't you?
Pretended you wanted to talk about Mizuki.
Huh?
What's this about?
Hikawa once proposed to Mizuki...
once proposed to Mizuki and got turned down.
But Hikawa was still attached to Mizuki.
If it was about her, he'd go for sure.
That's how it is.
And I was sure Mutô-san would be interested in her.
Why would I kill Hikawa anyway?
Because there was apparently friction over the dam!
I really can't think of anything more to say about that nonsense.
Finally, you, Toono-san.
She was with us.
So your alibi is solid.
That's it.
I understand.
We'll leave it at that for today.
If we know
when we know for sure that Hikawa san was murdered..,
we will question you all
in detail.
Excuse me, are we checking the property?
At the moment, we can't force them to do so.
Even if someone stole the item in question,
he's probably already hidden it.
Thank you
for your cooperation.
He sure talks slow.
- Yeah. - I almost fell asleep.
It's cold.
And all this just to watch a sunrise?
Come on!
I wonder who it is,
who killed Hikawa-san?
Well..,
if it's Mutô-san...
According to the shoe prints.
he didn't wait in the hut, but in the field.
After the murder, he went to the stream.
But why Hikawa-san
...chose the creek and the snowfield, I don't know.
If Mutô-san had ordered it,
he would have stopped.
Yes, that's right.
I would have taken the car.
And if I had..,
Are the murder and the explosion
...related?
And if they are,
it's not over.
Something else is bound to happen.
Again.
Right now, I can't...
Again.
Shin'ichi-kun's voicemail?
Yes.
I wanted to tell him about Hikawa-san.
I wonder if he's really here in the village.
That detective freak!
That's what she calls you.
Let her be.
And at this hour!
Well, here's Toma-san!
KURO'S GRAVE
Kuro...
- Toma-kun! - Tôma!
What's wrong, Tôma-kun?
Kuro's grave?
Kuro? The dog that killed Touma-kun eight years ago?
Why?
Did Kuro really die?
Toma!
What are you doing out here?
Mom.
Why did you leave secretly?
So calm down.
What's wrong? Say!
- What happened to me? - Eh?
I don't understand.
My friends are strangers to me.
Kuro has died.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know!
Kuro...
- Kuro... - Tôma!
It's no wonder.
The body is 15 years old.
But in his heart he is still seven.
Understanding reality is difficult for him.
Almost the opposite of us.
Tôma...
Mom.
Look! How the snow glitters!
Hoh, it's not snow.
It's diamond dust.
Diamonds?
Is treasure coming down?
But no.
The water vapor freezes through the cold
and forms very fine ice crystals.
Come on,
Look, Tohma-kun.
It's beautiful.
Isn't it great? It's a treasure.
Tôma?

What's wrong? Are you okay, Toma?
His memory...
What is it?
I have this light...
No, I don't remember...
- Toma! - Tohma-kun!
- Toema-san! - Tôma.
I don't...
...don't feel inside.
The diamond dust was really beautiful.
Yes, like in a fairyland!
More
please!
You,
that missing memory...
Yes,
I thought he would remember the day he fell.
So I did some research.
That day it was snowing
and there was no diamond dust.
Then what was it,
that he saw?
Where did the three of them go?
They went outside to play with Tôma-kun.
Oh, boy. They're probably up to something again.
Where are we going?
If we go too far away, my mother will scold us.
Hey, Touma-kun...
Let's go to the cliff where you fell.
Then maybe you'll think of all sorts of things.
But...
We're here with you, aren't we?
Yes...
Yes, we are.
Be brave and let us go!
Yes.
Let's go.
- Hurray! - We can do it, Tohma-kun!
- Don't worry. - We're with you.
KITANOSAWA DAM
I wonder,
where did the kids go?
Probably to the campsite.
That's where the memorial service is later.
Yes,
from 10 o'clock, they said.
In about an hour.
I hope they don't do anything stupid.
Otherwise, this time that fist...
Ah! The people from the dam!
I'm sure they'll want to join in the celebration.
But can the dam be neglected so easily?
Don't worry.
Two people are there to keep an eye on it.
Ah, you heard me?
At least let us have coffee here.
Thank you for your concern.
Really, Sonoko.
I'll be right there. Go on ahead!
You run, you fall!
Yes!
How do you do?
You're Tôma-san's classmate, aren't you?
Are you going to visit him?
Yes, I wanted to show him something.
He's not here.
What do you want to show him?
Hey,
a picture from eight years ago.
He was about your age.
Hey, those binoculars...
That's the school, right?
Yes.
He had them with him at school?
Yes.
It was his trademark.
He always wore it.
So..,
he didn't necessarily go to the Swans.
Ah,
Tôma-kun gave me this picture.
He was really very fond of Kuro.
I wanted to show Tôma-kun
I wanted to show him the picture and talk to him.
Ah!
Or is that more of a torment to him?
Wait a minute!
Hikawa-san had unfolded a folded printout...
and showed it to everyone.
But
the important thing is inside,
so it won't get dirty?
Is something wrong with the picture?
What? No, nothing.
Thanks for showing it to me.
But now I have to go back.
If you run, you fall!
Don't worry.
Say, do I have to change the sheets here too?
What? Did you open the door?
What? Wasn't I allowed to?
That's logical.
They want to check for fingerprints.
Oh, no! What am I going to do?
They'll suspect me.
Yes, they'll arrest you.
Don't scare me like that!
That's it.
ROBBERY-HOMICIDE AT JEWELRY STORE
Burglary at the jewelry store?
On the 15th at about 11 p.m.
the Misuzu jewelry store in
Misuzu jewelry store in Shinjuku, Tôkyô.
The perpetrator killed the manager Eiko Misuzu
with a blade,
captured jewels worth 1 billion yen, and fled.
This case.
It happened when I was in the third grade.
The culprit hasn't been caught yet....
But why did Hikawa-san write this article...?
Wait, the date!
AM 16...
Fact.
The night before Yamao-san's hit-and-run.
Wasn't Yamao-san
sitting next to Hikawa-san?
Yamao-san didn't see the outside,
but this one.
That's why he was contorting his face!
Could it be...
Kudô-kun?
I can't reach the kids.
I can't reach the kids.
Well...
Hello?
Wasn't that the cell phone base station?
Both of them!
The landline connection is also gone!
The base stations for mobile and landline...
An accident like this on the day of the party?
No. It wasn't an accident.
Hey, I can't get a connection.
- Me neither. - Can you hear me?
I hear you!
What's the situation?
Because of the cell phones, people are
people are panicking.
So they are.
As for the kids,
someone saw them with Tohma-kun.
The four of them went somewhere.
Hurry back.
I understand.
You're not going to...
not...
With exuberant strength
- we test the courage. - Is this the right place?
Yes... I think so.

- With united hearts - Hey, not so loud!
- Let's go and excuse... - We know we're loud.
- With firm step - And? Is he still there?
And resounding we must
go on and on!
He is there.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
- We run! - Yeah!
Hey!
- I'll explain later. - Please just run!
What's going on?
How long has he been there?
- We don't know. - Suddenly he was there.
Is he evil?
- We don't know. - I'm scared!
That's why we run away!
Even then
I ran away.
Did you hear?
Yes.
- It's too dangerous. You wait... - Of course not!
Too brash for your age!
Yes.
Ah! A cave!
That's where we'll hide!
- Yes! - Quick! Quick!
Wait! Don't!
Oh, no!
Haibara, you go!
Yes!
Those kids,
what are they thinking?
Further back!
Oh, that's going in far.
Wait!
Oh Haibara, come in quick!
What do you mean come in here? Do you want to die here?
Adults don't fit in here.
Toma-kun could fit in here, too!
What if you get shot at from the entrance?
- Come on! - You guys!
Why did you come in here?
I just told you.
Now we have to move on.
Yes.
What?
You were followed?
Yes,
I remembered.
So you were.
Now I realize some things.
Oh no! If I'm right...
- Hey! - What happened?
Quick!
We've got to get to the dam before that guy does!
The dam?
I don't get it.
Explain it to us, please!
I have no proof
and I'm just guessing...
The perpetrator of all the crimes
is Yamao-san!
If he robbed the jeweler eight years ago,
murdered the boss
and stole a billion yen worth of jewels,
it all adds up.
NIIGATA
Yamao-san, who had a loan shark breathing down his neck,
was on his way to visit his grandmother in Kitanosawa.
On the way he
he hit Natsuki-san just before the village.
He panicked.
If the police came,
the robbery would be discovered.
He had the stolen jewels with him.
Normally, when you hit someone,
you usually stop and check on the person.
When he saw Natsuki-san downstairs..,
he must have
he must have run into you,
Tôma-san.
Me?
You were running after
You were chasing after your mother, weren't you?
On your way to the hospital.
you passed by the crime scene.
That's why...
What? Mom?
How nice. I'm finally here!
For Tohma-kun...
that was the continuation of that time.
Yes.
For Yamao, it was easy,
to knock Tôma-san unconscious and put him in the car.
He then just drove on,
and thought about what to do with Touma-san.
But then Tôma-san saw her.
He had woken up and saw
how the diamonds were flying around.
Then he was trying to remember
when he saw the diamond dust.
To a real treasure!
Now Yamao-san knew
what he had to do.
Are the jewels in the old house?
He hid them there!
Yes, Yamao-san checked the location of the old house.
He turned himself in because he thought he would soon be free.
But his crime was more serious than he thought,
and the village is now in the reservoir.
To get to the jewels,
he must drain all the water.
- Drain the water? - Drain it?
That's why he chose the celebration.
Why?
Because the dam staff is at the celebration.
Only two are on site.
No one expects to be blown up.
But then the village...
Everyone will die!
We have to get to the dam before he does!
Look!
A light!
The exit!
Hurray!
All clear.
You can come out.
A drainpipe.
Through there...
No doubt about it. It's the shortest.
Then he killed Hikawa-san, too?
Yes, it was Yamao-san.
Two obstacles stood in the way of his plan.
One was Hikawa-san.
Hikawa-san was a classmate...
and also an insurance investigator.
He found out who had committed the jewel robbery,
and, demanding a share.
he offered him his assistance.
Yamao-san pretended to agree.
and took it upon himself to assassinate Hikawa-san before the blast.
That's the way it fits.
Because to me
it didn't look like a simple blackmail.
And
And in order to frame someone else for the murder and blowing up of the dam..,
Mutô-san seemed to be the right person.
Because he was angry with Hikawa,
and he condemned the construction of the dam.
But how did he get Hikawa-san to go there with him.

Well, I can only guess.
What? Mutô?
He must have gotten wind of our plan...
and wants to talk to us about it.
We may have to finish him off first.
Something like that.
he must have talked him into it.
So they both went along the stream and across the field.
Yes. And the second obstacle was
the participation of the mayor in the celebration.
Because then, of course, his entourage and the media are there.
Even if he blows up the base stations to make phone calls,
the news would leak out over the dam.
Understand.
After flooding the village, he needs time,
to find the place where he had hidden the jewels.
That's why, in order to prevent the participation
and to test the bombs, he blew up the tunnel.
The only thing he didn't count on was Tôma-san waking up,
he certainly didn't expect.
The fact that Tôma-san didn't remember the day of the accident..,
reassured him.
But when the memory
threatened to return,
he thought about finishing him off with you.
He gets the jewels and sits down.
I'm sure the escape plan is already in place.
Yes.
What's the matter, Toma?
Are you exhausted?
No...
Does my version bother you?
Yes,
Something is wrong.
But what?
I'm sorry, but..,
Time is short.
Yamao-san lost time because of the attack.
I'm sure he hasn't planted any bombs yet.
Yes.
Before that, the employees were there.
In that case.
there's hope.
Not there yet?
Why does it only have to go up?
All right. Come on up!
Careful.
Yes.
Whew, I'm exhausted.
- Tôma, we're almost there. - We got in unscathed.
I don't think we came in unscathed.
- Are you okay? - No, I'm not okay.
I can't take another step.
I'm not surprised.
Please keep an eye on Toma-san here.
I'll tell the dam staff.
- You got it. - You can count on us!
I'll go to Mutô-san's workshop.
She must be nearby.
Be careful!
Yamao-san might be there.
I know.
You're about to hide.
Yes!
Oh... oh no!
Are you okay?
Come on!
No external wounds.
That was the stun gun.
Wait a minute!
Oh, no!
The same bombs used on the freeway!
Damn it! How could he have...?
Was he driving a car or a snowmobile?
What's wrong?
Kudô-kun,
I'm at the garage.
It's bad.
Mutô-san's been drugged.
- As expected. - Huh?
The workers here are unconscious, too.
Probably the stun gun.
Huh? Wait a minute.
Strange.
What?
He's working way too fast.
Aaah!
Kudô-kun!
What's wrong?
Answer me! Kudô-kun!
Is he...
Bombs?
Not so loud.
We're talking to you as the master detective.
If anyone hears this,
panic will break out.
- Yes, please forgive me. - So?
Are you sure it was time bombs?
A timer-like fragment was found at the scene.
We're heading to the dam to check on the others.
We can't reach them from here.
Is it possible to use a cell phone at the dam?
There's a base station nearby.
Then we could contact Conan-kun.
Yes,
Let's go, too.
Another rifle shot!
I wonder if Conan-kun's okay.
I'm worried.
Ah, I can't take it anymore.
Let's go!
Yes!
What a stupid kid!
If you'd been good enough to enjoy the Snow Festival..,
you would have died without pain.
Spit it out!
- Where are your friends? - I'm all alone!
Apparently you need more pain
to understand me.
Son of a bitch!
Is that some brat trying to screw me!
I don't have time to play with you!
So I'll take your word for it that you're here alone.
Don't worry.
In 15 minutes, when everything explodes,
things will get pretty lively in heaven.
Take care,
Kid!
Mizuki-san!
The shot sounded different.
Hurry!
Put your back into it!
Hey, you!
Thank God you're all right.
Haibara-san!
Mizuki... You...
Give up, Yamao-kun.
Are you okay, Conan-kun?
J... Yes...
Why are you here?
I had this...
I had this weird feeling...
...so I rushed over.
And the gun?
I see,
I have a license for hunting rifle.
I'm a good shot.
Yes, it looks like it.
Careful, Mizuki-san!
Give me that, Mizuki!
- Toma-san... - Hey! - What's wrong with you?
The...
The woman from back then!
No glasses, but I'm sure...
You just don't understand what my dream is!
What is it?
Ow. What are you doing?
I see.

The person who saw Tôma-san at that time..,
was you, Mizuki-san.
That's why you didn't come to the cave.
You mentioned it yesterday.
Dark, narrow rooms scare me.
Mizuki!
What's the meaning of all this?
Conan-kun.
You said something about a cave.
Huh? Did she say...
Yes. It was Mizuki-san who attacked us...
...who attacked us.
She was afraid that Tohma-san, who saw the accident..,
might wake up again.
Therefore
she started working as a receptionist at the lodge in front of Touma-san's house,
as a receptionist
and watched over Tôma-san unobtrusively for eight years.
Is that right,
Mizuki?
When Tôma-san woke up from her coma,
she wore contact lenses
and changed her hairstyle.
So he wouldn't remember that time when he saw you.
You took advantage of Uncle's tip.
I put contact lenses in.
But it was no use.
Tôma-san was steadily regaining his memory...
and before he remembers, you tried to silence him.
You are
a pretty bad sister.
Pushing the little girl in front of a car.
I didn't mean to kill her!
Just knock her over,
so she'd feel pain.
But where my sister fell..,
...was Yamao-kun's car.
If that became known, I wouldn't be able to stay.
The thought frightened me.
...and suddenly I was holding the shotgun.
But..,
I just wanted to keep Tôma-kun away from me.
I... I..,
I didn't mean to kill him.
I know that.
I realize that..,
that the truth is you didn't mean to hurt anyone else.
Because
...if you can hit the shoulder from that far away...
and the dropped rifle from so far away,
then surely you could have shot us.
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.
But
be glad, Mizuki.
Now you're
finally rid of the nightmare
that's been tormenting you all these years.
And I got to see your pretty face without your glasses.
Mutô-kun...
I'll wait patiently for you.
Until you return.
All the time.
Edogawa-kun!
The light's blinking!
- What? Eh?
Darn it! Earlier...
Yamao-san said 15 minutes.
Damn it!
We've got to go!
It's going to explode!
Don't dawdle!
Come on, run!
- Tôma, hurry! - Yes!
- Ayumi-chan! - Don't stop! Keep going! Okay?
Run!
Not good.
Any more explosions
and the dam will burst.
Oh, no, that sound...
The outer wall is collapsing!
I have to do something.
Before it all collapses.
The water pouring out
would completely destroy the village!
Is there
no rescue for the village?
The ski area!
Are you unharmed?
Everyone is there, right?
- Conan is missing! - Eh?
A boy is not there.
Excuse me?
He disappeared after helping me.
Conan-kun!
What are you going to do?
What?
There were still bombs left?
Damn it!
Oh, no! The dam's going to burst!
Everyone, get back!
No, Conan-kun's still there!
We're not leaving until Conan-kun gets here.
Conan!
What are you doing? Kudô-kun...
- Hurray! - Come on, Conan!
Huh? Where's he going?
He's going to stop the water!
This is madness! No kid can do that!
If he gets caught, it's over!
He can do it!
Conan can do it!
Nothing is impossible for the Detective Boys!
I'm counting on you,
Kudô-kun!
Just outside the village...
there was an unused ski area.
With the help of the fresh snow...
...it might work out somehow.
- What's going on? - This is terrible!
D... the dam!
We have to escape!
Shit, I can't do it like this.
It's risky going through the forest, but...
Good. That was a close one.
That was close.
No! Please hold on a little longer!
Hey,
when the water comes,
what will happen to the village?
That would be really bad.
And what does that mean?
Without a doubt
the village will sink.
W... what?
I see it!
Conan-kun!
What's he up to?
An avalanche!
An avalanche is going to change the course of the water!
Conan-kun!
Shit, right now!
Conan-kun!
Oh, no!
Damn it!
Damn it! Damn it!
Damn it!
Oh, no!
He did it.
Get out of here!
It's gotta work!
Look out!
Ran.
No!
Conan-kun!
Conan!
- Conan! - Where are you, Conan...
I can hear their voices.
Apparently they didn't get hit.
I've got to get out of here...
Oh, dear,
I can't move.
I've got to...
...do something...
Conan-kun!

Conan-kun! Conan-kun! Conan-kun!
- Conan! - Conan! Conan-kun...
You son of a gun, you son of a gun.
How long?
How many minutes?
- It's... - 11 minutes, 50 seconds.
Since the avalanche
it's been 12 minutes!
- What?
It's only 3 minutes to the 15 he's got,

Please come out!
Ran,
your hands are bleeding!
But... Why aren't you here, Conan-kun?
Will we ever see Conan-kun again?
we'll never see Conan-kun again?
If we pass each other by,
there might not be a second time.
No...
E... joking, right?
Conan-kun,
you can't die!
There's not a minute left until the time limit.
Ran...
Don't give up!
What is it, Ran?
Shin'ichi!
Please,
if you're nearby...
If you're not far away, help.
Help me, Shin'ichi!
Shin'ichi!
Wasn't that Ran's voice?
I have to tell her where I am somehow.
Ran!

Could this be...
Conan-kun...

He's here! He's here!

That afternoon
in the garden of Yamao-san's former house...
a bag of jewels was found.
When the evidence was shown to him, he confessed to everything.
The case was closed.
Mizuki-san confessed to her sister...
and the police questioned her.
Tôma-kun has
did not fully recover his memory.
But
until he remembers everything
and can show his old smile,
it is surely not far.

I have sent your luggage to this address.
Thank you very much.
It was nice here.
Despite what I have experienced, I hope to see you again,
I hope to see you again.

Hey, you there!
Hurry up!
Those who dawdle, stay here!
Why is he in such a hurry?
Well...
Ah!
I haven't bought a souvenir yet!
Ah, me neither.
Wait! There's no time for that!
Ah, yes.
What should I buy?
Ah!
We haven't bought a souvenir yet either!
We'll take the bear manjû.
What are you talking about?
The swan cup and basta.
I think the owl is best.
Eh?
Was that...
Just buy everything.
- The professor pays anyway. - Hey, hey.
I see.
The kids drew this.
You there!
Hurry up and buy!
Hurry up!
We have to leave soon or I'll miss Yôko's new drama!
Fifteen more minutes!
I'm leaving in 15 minutes!
- Hey! - You can't do that!
Hurry up!
What? 15 minutes again?
