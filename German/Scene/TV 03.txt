KINGDOM OF VESPANIA
FOREST PRIVATELY OWNED BY THE ROYAL FAMILY
Point A reached. Will now begin.
Everything normal here. All teams in position.
GERARD MUSCA VESPALAND DUKE OF THE KINGDOM OF VESPANIA
GILL COWELL VESPALAND CROWN PRINCE OF THE KINGDOM OF VESPANIA
You will please stay here on standby.
If there are too many of us, the loot will escape.
I will take care of that.
I showed you how to use it. Remember?
Yes, I remember.
Ah... Should I have forgotten?
No, it's better this way.
Here you are.
Oh! I am honored to receive it from you myself.
Mother... Are you sure you won't join us?
No, I'd rather not.
SAKURA QUEEN OF THE KINGDOM OF VESPANIA
SAKURA, QUEEN OF THE KINGDOM OF VESPANIA - Hunting is too barbaric for me.
Hunting is not barbaric, it is a prestigious, noble sport!
Leave it, your highness.
Let us have a contest among men.
The pleasures of the hunt can only be understood as a man.
So I have heard.
Oh, dear, that...
You can't stay here...
Shoo, my little one! Run away!
Mother!
Oh no...
This can't be...
This can't be happening!
Come here! Quick!
Yes!
- You get the car ready! - Yes!
Duke Gerard!
I didn't have a chance to stop him.
Missed!
Four throws in a row!
- Oh dear... - No outs and all bases loaded....
Very good!
Beer, beer!
Haha, more beer...
That's the fifth can already! You drink too much!
Oh, cut him some slack.
That's his only pleasure...
Don't disappoint me, Rumi-chan!
A fly ball to the outfield is all it takes! Or better yet, a home run!
Why did you get two?
But no strikeouts, please?
Pops!

ROYAL PALACE OF VESPANIA
The funeral service with the guests of honor will not take place for another month.
With a tragic accident like this, it's inevitable.
And I was right there with him...
Just terrible.
If I could have at least held the prince back....
KEITH DAN STINGER COUNT OF THE KINGDOM OF VESPANIA
COUNT KEITH DAN STINGER - It can't be helped.
Do not reproach yourself.
Let us think of the future.
Yes... Thank you for your kind words.
How is Princess Mira?
The same.
She still refuses to become queen.
She lost her mother and brother in one fell swoop. The reaction is understandable.
However...
In this situation...
We are against a queen Mira!
We don't want to be ruled by a bakery fish!
Abolish the monarchy!
The opponents of the princess...
That they dare to call their princess a "backfish"....
Some shall not even shrink from attacks.
- I'm relying on you to protect the princess. - Yes.
Abolish the monarchy! Abolish the monarchy!
What are you waiting for? Shut those guys up!
Please try to calm down...
Shut up!
Don't you care what they say about me?
Keith! Where's Keith? Quick, call Keith!
I'm here, Your Highness.
What happened, Princess Mira?
Pah, you can hear it.
Those shouts... That's the voice of the people.
You don't even have to tell me!
MIRA JULIETTA VESPALAND NEXT QUEEN OF VESPANIA
Who would want to be king of a country!
You are now next in line to the throne, Your Royal Highness.
Please don't keep whining and resign yourself to it.
I will not do that.

My brother should have become the next king of this country.
I have always been of that opinion.
If I may get to the point...
You will be going to Japan as part of your official duty.
To Japan?
Out of the question. I heard!
There are people who want to harm me!
I won't take a step away from here!
We will protect you with our lives.
Besides, we'll have the perfect bodyguard escort you.
Come in.
Hello princess!
I can't stand men with beards.
EIGHT HOURS LATER 10:26 PM
PRIVATE PLANE OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF VESPANIA TAKES OFF FOR JAPAN
Hi. Carry on.
Please instruct me in sharpshooting again!
You're welcome.
Jigen-sensei!
Drop the "sensei," please.
We thought you went to Japan with us?
The princess doesn't like me.
What?
One question... Is the "Queen's Crown" in there,
the crown the princess will wear at her coronation?
Yes. Would you like to see it?
What? Can I?
So, this is the "Queen's Crown"...
Vespania's most precious treasure, handed down for generations.
Oh, my. I'm impressed.
Don't, Sensei!
I'm not stealing it.
No. But from there on, we have no control over the system.
Once you enter the room, you'll be locked in immediately.
We don't know the password to unlock the room either.
Oh?
That would be unpleasant, of course.
Yes, that is really unpleasant.
VESPANIA - VESPALAND SQUARE 12:15 P.M.
They're guarding her like the apple of their eye.
That's almost overprotective!
Suppose I were to put one foot on the ground....
"Out" because of the weight sensors.
If I were to avoid them...
"Out" because of the infrared sensors.
And would I avoid them...
"Out" because of the temperature sensors.
And three times "out" means strikeout....
Because someone once
unsuccessfully tried to steal the crown,
the security measures are now overly strict.
I didn't "unsuccessfully try"!
So, what are you going to do?
Do you give it up and go sightseeing? Sponsored by my paycheck?
Have I ever given up on anything?
That's why I always get in trouble.
Look at this.
CONFIDENTIAL
Are you bragging about being a hacker?
Don't. This great stone
will be our lucky charm this time!
Vespania ore...
Oops?
No. 2 to Headquarters: Are now above Hotel Sakurasaku.
TOKYO - HOTEL SAKURASAKU 6:02 P.M.
Do we have a VIP protection order?
Dispatch here. So far, no.
HOTEL SAKURASAKU RECEPTION
Really! This would be a chance for them
to meet handsome TV stars and athletes en masse!
But she has to go to karate training!
People have strange priorities, don't they?
Ran really has weird tastes. I don't understand.
Actually, I was talking about you...
She said she'd be there, even if it's later. Let's go then!
What does he mean by that?
It's obvious...
He's looking for Yoko Okino.
- Hope springs eternal, huh? - Yep.
Are you crazy? You want me to go to a party the way I am?
- I told you... - I understand.
Then you want to cancel this ceremony organized at your mother's request...
and return to Vespania without a word to the grieving Japanese people...
and return to Vespania...
Be quiet!
Your Royal Highness...
We are already late.
- Get the princess ready quickly. - J... Yes, Your Majesty!
Princess Mira...
I hate this.
Did you find Yoko?
No, she was nowhere to be seen.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience.
Please welcome, with a round of applause.
our surprise guest:
Her Royal Highness Princess Mira of Vespania!
Please welcome our surprise guest: Princess Mira!
The princess is in the hall. Keep an eye on the guests.
Anyone who wants to leave the hall
- must be shadowed. - Roger that.
This is Team Lobby. We are temporarily closing the main entrance.
We're sending new arrivals to the side entrance.
- Do you copy, Team B? - Roger that!
Please sit down!
Ran?!
She looks just like Ran!
Ran would never get all dolled up like that.
...chi!
Oh no! I think I caught a chill in the shower.
Wah, it's so late already?
Sonoko will be pissed...

Princess Mira, would you be so kind as to say a few words to us?
Her Royal Highness is happy about her first visit to Japan.
The guy behind her started talking.
She doesn't seem very nice.
The princess of a foreign country would never
would never come to such a reception of her own free will.
The name of this hotel is Sakurasaku.
The late Queen Sakura
loved Japanese cherry blossoms, whose name she bore, very much.
Cherry blossoms also gave the name to this hotel.
If not for this sudden accident, the Queen would have surely come to the reception.
Normally, the visit of the princess would probably have been canceled,
but the kingdom of Vespania must have felt the need
to know that Japan is in its debt.
I feel sorry for her...
What would you like to see here?
Princess Mira has always wanted to see Kyoto.
Ah, I see.
And what Japanese food does she prefer?
The princess loves sushi more than anything.
What are you doing! He'll answer anything for her!
Here, hold this.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Don't give wine to an elementary school student.
Then we would like to ask Princess Mira to propose a toast!
Please, everyone, pick up a glass!
Oh dear, I'm out of juice!
Ah, I'll go and get some.
That's very nice of you, peck!
Pah! Yet the look on her face clearly said, "Go get me some!"
HOTEL SAKURASAKU 6:37 PM
Princess Mira, if you would like to propose the toast now....
Princess, would you like to propose a toast?
Don't drink it!
I am very sorry, princess.
But please let the wine
by the man who poured it for you.
Quick, someone!
Arrest that man!
Hold him down!
To the kitchen! And block all exits!
Please remain calm! Don't run! It's too dangerous!
Out of the way!
Uncle! Put that guy down!
Get out of the way!
Pulling a knife on Kogorô Môri is out of b...
HOTEL SAKURASAKU CONFERENCE ROOM
HOTEL SAKURASAKU - CONFERENCE ROOM - Hey, I'm still in the middle of a sentence!
The wine of the princess
was laced with a lethal dose of poison.
Mister Keith.
Moments of surprise are a good thing,
but you have to let us know so we can protect you.
In my estimation, we had enough of our own people on the ground.
Enough? Even though you couldn't even post any in the kitchen?
Takagi-kun!
Actually, it was agreed..,
...that the princess would have neither food nor drink...
...at the reception.
However...
I would like to thank these two gentlemen.
Princess Mira...
No!
Bi... Please be calm, Your Highness.
We got this water ourselves.
That's enough. Please leave.
Leave me alone!
We'll wait out here.
Please call us when you feel better.
Mother...
I can't.
I can't
make it!
I'll check the roof.
- Don't let anyone see her now. Yes, sir.
I've had it. I can't take it anymore!
The failed assassin says he was hired to do it for money.
He was told it was a joke, that the substance was a laxative.
He is very cooperative and tells everything.
Who hired him?
He says he doesn't know him and it was a foreigner.
Really...
Getting involved in a crime for a little money....
According to our information.
there are radical elements among the princess's opponents?
Will you really be able to protect her alone?
At the moment, there is nothing that our country would require
...from your police force.
But Conan-kun... It's great that you recognized the sommelier as an impostor.
How did you know?
Well, it's like this... When I walked past the sommelier..,
he smelled like cigarettes.
And because I had heard that good sommeliers don't smoke..,
I thought, "That's strange!"
After all, this is a good hotel, right?
Well, there may well be sommeliers who smoke,
but right before serving a princess,
one certainly wouldn't smoke.
And many criminals calm down before committing a crime,
by smoking a cigarette.
Oh, I can only say again: Bravo!
- Your Highness! - Princess Mira!

- Is there a fire? - No, there's no fire anywhere!
Princess Mira has disappeared!
You... Is there anyone at that door over there?
No, there's no one there!
You fools!
Princess Mira!
We're... sorry! Let's take the stairs!
We'd never make it in time!
- Notify the lobby! And send people to the basement! - Yes!
- You keep an eye on the elevator. If it stops on the way, let me know! - Yes!
FOR HOTEL STAFF ONLY
She held the lighter to the fire alarm.
And then fled outside in the confusion from the other room.
That's the downside of a royal suite...
We need to lock everything down immediately.
That's not necessary.
If anything happens to her, it'll be too late!
I repeat, this is Kyle.
I've spotted the princess. I'm placing her under guard.
Princess Mira!
I wonder if the party's over yet.
Ve... Excuse me!
Oh, really! Can't you see where you're......going...?
Come back with me now.
I don't want to! Let go of me! Let go of me!
Be reasonable.
Now listen. Let go of her!
She's fighting back!
I'm very sorry, but this is none of your business.
Please help me! This guy's been chasing me the whole time!
Let her go!
No.
Don't! Or you'll be los...
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
This can't be...
What? You're...
You're...?
How dare you!
Takagi-kun!
Yes, sir!
We're locking up.
Yes, sir!
Lock it down, lock it down...
I interpret this as an official request for support,
is that all right?
Excuse me! This, please!
Coming up! One moment please.
Here, please!
It's this one, right?
Yes. Thank you!
What?!
You're a real princess?
Does it amaze you that much?
S... Of course it amazes me!
Is that so?
That is, the man before, that was...
That was my bodyguard.
I was afraid...
I'll apologize. Let's go back.
No. I ran away because I don't want to be there.
I'm not going back.
But that's... Why did you run away anyway?
I'm sick of the receptions.
Ah... I'd like to say something like that.
Tell me, do you have cigarettes?
Cigarettes? Of course not! I'm still a minor!
What? How old are you?
I'm seventeen.
A fresh and fully blossomed second grader of Teitan High School!
Why are you freaking out?
Come on, let's go back. I'm sure the reception is still in full swing.
"No" means "no!" to me.
I thought we were about the same age. But I'm two years older.
That makes you nineteen...
So you're a minor, too!
In Vespania, you can drink alcohol and smoke from eighteen.
Oh, really?
What's wrong?
I was just surprised.
So princesses smoke too....
Sorry to shatter your illusion.
Can't a princess smoke?
After all, I'm alive too! I'm not a doll!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean...
Well, it doesn't matter. I'm used to it.
Everyone says the same thing...
But it's every girl's dream...
Everybody would like to be a princess,
even if it's only once in a lifetime.
Do you want to be a princess... Princess?
Wait, Mom... What's, uh... what's going on?
Commissioner Megure! The perimeter is ready.
It's only a matter of time before we find the princess.
Hey, Takagi! Have you seen Conan?
Conan-kun isn't here anymore?
That brat's gone off on his own again.
No! Hey, wait, what... Why?
Oh, come on, come on!
Hmm... I'm bigger in the bust than you are.
Shut up. Do what your elders tell you.
But, but, but, but... No, no, no!
PUBLIC LADIES ROOM TEN MINUTES LATER
So, let your hair down again.
What did you say? So...
you too are a princess from now on! Aren't you?
That's... me?
But this...
P... Princess?
I'll be back when the reception is over.
You can't do that! I can't do that!
If you don't hurry up a bit, the bodyguard will track you down!
This can't be happening...
Only I'm not going back. Of course not.
Yay!
I underestimated...
Since she's still in her ball gown, I thought I'd find her right away.
Ran-neechan!

You're really late! Sonoko-neechan is pissed.
Ran...?
Oh, kid, you were at the reception...
You...
What? Hey! Wait... Wait, wait!
I actually didn't notice for a moment!
Get on!
Don't think.
I know who you are. If I were an enemy, I would have run you over.
Trust me.
7:37 PM
What do I do now? She's been gone too long for the bathroom.
"I got lost in the hotel!" doesn't work either.
I just tell the truth.
I hope no one comes out now!
Princess...
Princess Ran!
So this is where you were!
Shi... Shin'ichi!
Come! Everyone is waiting for us. Let's go.
What's with the elevator?
Is something wrong?
Well, you look like a prince!
"Like a prince," you say? You're up to something, aren't you?
You're incorrigible.
Ah! I don't want to, Shin'ichi, put me down!
No. I won't do it.
Honestly. How dare you suddenly...
We have something to tell you!
I will make Princess Ran my queen today!
Shin'ichi...
This is a done deal.
A... but this...
What is the princess doing?
I don't know...
She is completely enraptured with herself.
In this disc, from the outside, you can see only your own reflection.
But you can't make such a decision so suddenly...
I'd like to, but you're embarrassing me... I can't...
Control to all units!
Search object secured!
The object was seized at 19:53!
Returning to normal guard operations.
Okay. Let's go.
Who are you?
I told you: I'm your big sister Longlegs.
Are you making fun of me?
What an adventure-less princess...
You can stay here too. Or do you want to go back to the hotel?
But wouldn't it be more fun to amuse yourself with me until tomorrow?
A tracking device?
Yes. It's built into your collar.
- But then... -... they would have found you everywhere.
Keith was responsible for that.
I would hope so.
Apparently, there are people who are after you.
who are out to get you.
Hold on!
That's our enemy over there.
But the necklace is gone!
They must have seen you swapping clothes in the park. Like me.
- You have fans. - Don't joke, drive!
Very well!
We have to go to the toilet quickly!
You seem to be enjoying this.
Oh, you noticed?
But don't worry. If I ride this machine, no one will catch us.
What if they shoot at us?
This is Japan.
And they want to make it look like an accident.
Oh, dear. I guess they don't care about their public image.
Whoever's playing tricks on us...
Did you kill them?
No, I didn't.
I'm not that untalented.
I don't mess with amateurs.
Amateurs? But they had a machine gun!
They just had it.
For a car chase, you need two cars with two people in each.
And from the back seat
shooting at a target in front of you is impossible.
And they aimed for the tires and missed.
They don't even know that at night you instinctively aim higher.
They were dilettantes hired for money.
Wow...
You're great!
Tell me, is that a fan of yours?
The kid?!
He foresaw what I'd do? Really?
I'm gonna step on the gas a little bit.
I have no choice!
Oops...
Get out of the way!
I'm really sorry... Was I being childish?
But...
It's your own fault for making me get serious.
Who the hell... is this woman?
She's not an enemy...
HOTEL SAKURASAKU 8:21 PM
You are actually... Ran?
Oh? So you don't even recognize your own daughter.
I actually remembered Ran as being a little smarter.
I'm getting mad.
Okay, Ran-kun...
So the real princess said she'd be back..,
when the reception was over?
Yes. I didn't know..,
I didn't know there was such a commotion...
If I had known... I'm really sorry.
You don't have to blame yourself for that.
It's just that...
I see.
Sorry for the trouble...
Mr. Keith!
Please let us resume our search for the princess.
There's no need for that.
I beg your pardon? What are you saying?
You're really...
Please explain why that shouldn't be necessary.
There is nothing to explain.

Who do you want to look for?
Sonoko-neechan!
Come on! Stop it already! Where were you? I was looking for you!
I got lost, hihi.
"Lost, hee hee", don't make me laugh!
You're always bringing up strange cases!
Uh, it's like this... Is Ran... uh, no...
Is the princess back yet?
Back? Isn't the princess on one of the upper floors?
She was with the inspector...
- Let's go! - Hey, wait a minute!
Do you realize what you're saying?
Suppose the kidnapper of the princess was someone from Japan...
What does that mean for the relationship between our countries?
Now I'm really getting angry! You want to use her as a substitute?
We can't accept that.
Ran-kun is a normal civilian.
We can't drag her into this knowing that she might get killed!
Change your clothes, Ran. We're leaving.
Ä... Uh... I, uh...
If it's just until the princess comes back, I'll do it.
Don't talk nonsense!
Your father is right! What if she doesn't come back?
He's right.
We told you, you're not responsible for anything!
Protect the princess.
Hey, let go of me!
- Hey! What are you... - Back off!
Let's finish her off!
No, don't lay a hand on her!
Please follow diplomatic protocol in the future.
Commissioner Megure...
I officially request that you begin the search for Ran.
- Uh... - All right! We will immediately...
...look for her!
This... I don't understand a word you're saying!
I'll get another suite.
- You protect the princess. - Yes.
Isn't that right? That's him...
Uh, excuse me...
I didn't know you were the Princess's bodyguard, so...
Uh...
I'm sorry.
You don't have to apologize.
I was careless, which is what led to this situation in the first place.
I owe you an apology.
A... but don't! That's...
Uh... Maybe
now is not the time, but...
You're missing a button.
QUARRY WHERE THE VESPANIA ORE WAS DISCOVERED
(STRICTLY FORBIDDEN TO ENTER)
Six months ago, there was a movement in the earth's crust here.
The Mohorovičić discontinuity, which is usually located kilometers under the ground
has come to the surface.
Homović?
No, Mohorovičić!
Oh, never mind.
What was discovered in it...
ELECTRIC SWITCH
...was an unknown type of ore.
Vespania ore.
- This is all Vespania ore? No.
The ore was discovered here in this rock.
- And it was a complete coincidence. - Coincidence?
What kind of properties does this ore have?
Do you want to know?
In words from the last century:
ultimate stealth properties.
Stealth?
You've heard of it.
About planes that can't be detected by radar....
And this ore can perfect that stealth effect.
Radio wave absorbing ferrites are constantly being developed,
but they only make early detection more difficult,
the object doesn't really disappear with it.
But with this material, they disappear completely?
That's right.
They are searching for it by various means,
but the ore is a strong opponent.
Precisely because of its properties, you can't locate it that way.
I see. Then let me ask you:
How do you intend to find this ghostly ore then?
With divining rods!
Well, well, well! Have you ever done that before?
DOWSING:
Nope.
METHOD TO FIND HIDDEN UNDERGROUND WATER OR ORE VEINS
DOWSING: METHOD TO FIND HIDDEN WATER OR ORE VEINS
But I believe
in Fujiko-chan and dowsing!
Idiot.
TOKYO KABUKICHÔ
TOKYO - KABUKICHÔ - Won!
Go... go... go! Whoo-hoo!
Hey! The claw had grabbed it! She had it!
You're always looking out alertly....
That's understandable! I kidnapped a princess.
KAITEN-ZUSHI
Delicious!
Please act a little more hostile.
Jahaa...
You don't put the plates back on the conveyor belt.
I don't know your intentions, but you're not a bad person.
Or would you tell me?
What you're really up to, Nurse Longlegs?
There you go, you keep quiet.

But I have decided to trust.
In your intuition and in mine.
You have rice on the corner of your mouth.
KAITEN-ZUSHI 1 PLATE FROM 120 YEN
KAITEN-ZUSHI
I told you: you keep the plates!
What do you mean?
We can't accept that!
Yes...
Yes...
Goodbye.
I'll talk to the Central Authority again.
Stay here, please.
Are these guys putting on the pressure?
Probably, yeah.
No rash actions until I get back, all right?
Understood.
If we don't catch this Ego Princess, Ran...
I know that too!
Then why aren't they complying with our request for a search?
But that... Why do you know about that?
You can figure that out just by watching you!
Why? Is it really necessary for us to get involved?
Or is there any point in keeping Ran on as a deputy?
Takagi...
If it comes to an emergency, you will support me, won't you?
Of course.
You are risking your life, aren't you?
Se... of course!
Oh, oh, oh!
There's something, there's something!
Here!
It was you! I was so looking forward to meeting you! Kissy!
You found something?
Oh, yes, I did. An exquisite treasure!
H... hey!
And this piece of stone is supposed to change the world?
Just imagine:
If a rocket equipped with it would suddenly
comes thundering down from above...
You don't know from where it was fired,
no, maybe you don't even realize that something has been fired!
What, the world still puts up with this kind of thing?
It will never give it up.
Nowadays you can even spy from space.
If the whole city is full of cameras, you want to hide!
- People with a guilty conscience do. - And that's what a thief says!
Fortunately, the ore wasn't discovered in a dodgier country!
Here in Vespania there is only nature and peace...
What was that disturbing "Wah!"?
Why are you still hiding your face now?
"Hyuu?"
Yessir! Well done!
- What are you so happy about? - We have to run!
We should run in the opposite direction! The other car is over there.
I taught them: There's always more than one getaway car!
What, who?
Ah... My poor little SSK...
You bastard! Explain this to me in ten words or less!
I gave the guards a few lectures.
- Let's go! - Yeah!
One: Grab them when they come out grinning.
Two: Don't let them escape!
Three: Corner them immediately! Show no mercy!
We'll apply Jigen-sensei's teachings now!
Roger!
Hey! You can't shoot at us with that...
But you didn't say anything about the helicopter?
Remember? Helicopters with a TV station logo on them...
are especially suspicious!
There's one! 200 meters below us.
And it's got one! The logo of a TV station!
That helicopter was our last hope! What do we do now?
We run.
- Let's go. Good luck, you part-timer! - The recession can't touch me!
It doesn't matter if the helicopter was really chartered by the enemy.
Just shoot it down first.
If it was wrong, it was bad luck.
- An old fighter! - He thinks completely differently!
That's what you call "hard-boiled".
To hell with "hard-boiled"!
A press conference at Haneda Airport?
Yes. It will start tomorrow at ten in the morning.
Directly after that, we'll fly back to Vespania.
Fly back, you say? But I can't!
And I wouldn't know what to say at this conference!
Don't worry. I'll answer the questions.
And it will be the real princess who will fly back with us.
I see! So the princess is well?
Then I don't have to go to the conference, but she could...
The purpose of the conference is to announce that you have taken her place.
That the princess disappeared in Japan.
And that with you there exists an almost identical double.
We will make this known.
We will inconvenience you...
But will you help us until we find the guys who are trying to kill her?
who are trying to kill her?
THE NEXT DAY 05:08 HRS
Well, how is it? Are you satisfied now?
It's really great! I've never been so free in my whole life!

Where are we going today?
Well... To the place where you belong.
No. I don't want to go back.
Well? Did I say anything about going back?
But then you do belong there.
No, I don't!
Was there anywhere in this town
a place where you belong?
Is there something you can do here in Japan?
Shall we look for it?
Something only you can do?
HANEDA, NEW TERMINAL FOR INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS, 09:36 AM
All right? As soon as the conference starts, we'll get Ran back.
Yes! I've got my release form with me!
PRINCESS OF VESPANIA PRESS CONFERENCE
I wonder if that will do it.
You just have to sit there. Please be calm.
You are right, after all.
But... Even if it's not a real one, I've never...
a press conference...
It's all set to go.
No wonder she was able to kick you to the ground. Finally, the formula works.
Carry her to the plane. We're leaving immediately.
PRINCESS OF VESPANIA PRESS CONFERENCE
- How can you... - What are you doing?
Due to unforeseen circumstances, the conference must be cancelled.
What are you doing?
Silence, please!
Come on, tell me, where are they now?
They're about to leave!
What?!
PRESS CONFERENCE
Damn...
Private plane of the royal family, B-1027: permission to take off.
Good luck.
Thank you, Tower.
Thank you for your support.
- Gear up. - Retract the landing gear.
Ran...
Môri-san...
There you are!
We're on our way, Môri-kun!
What? We're going after them?
I'm afraid we're not. The only one who can go..,
...is you, Môri-kun.
What do you mean by that?
Let me introduce you: This is my friend,
Inspector Zenigata of Interpol.
Hello.
So you are the famous master detective Kogorô Môri?
J... yes...
In a single, special case
Inspector Zenigata is authorized to investigate worldwide.
And that is to arrest Lupin III!
I have already been informed.
I'm going to take you with me to Vespania...
to Vespania with me.
Vie... Thank you very much!
That's great!
I entrust all my good wishes to this fist!
Give this guy a good smacking!
You can count on me.
Oh yes, that's right... My letter of resignation.
Take it!
But who would I give it to?
BOOKED BY HANEDA AT THE SAME TIME
So I'm borrowing it!
Go ahead! I love you, Fujiko!
Tell me... Who are you really?
Are you CIA?
Or the FBI? The "M Organization"?
Where do you think you're going, not in the slightest!
I'm a normal civilian with a large circle of acquaintances.
- A civilian doesn't fly F-18s! - Don't bite your tongue!
The Queen's Crown...
That's what Lupin's after?
The information is reliable.
So Lupin III actually exists...
I thought he was a novel and manga hero.
I beg your pardon? You don't know about Lupin? And you want to be a master detective?
EIGHT AND A HALF HOURS TO VESPANIA
Ran...
Ran!
Shin'ichi...?
You woke up?
Where am I?
You have an explanation, I hope?
Who the hell are you guys anyway?
I asked you a question!
A normal young girl
would make a huge fuss at first.
Do you want me to live up to that expectation?
I can get pretty loud.
While you were sleeping, something unexpected happened on the plane.
The boy who recognized the wrong sommelier at the reception....
He performed the feat
...jumped onto an airplane as it was taking off...
Conan-kun...
If the bulkhead under the cockpit is open, the plane can't climb.
We went down a little bit and checked the front landing gear bay.
And that's where we found...
the boy.
What amazed the captain most was his cold-bloodedness and knowledge.
With unreasonableness, he could have put us in danger at 10,000 meters as well.
But he looked for the sensor and thus alerted the cockpit.
In the thin air and icy cold there in the forward landing gear bay....
Is he all right?
Don't worry. He just got some frostbite.
What I'm about to tell you is neither a lie nor fiction.
Please listen to me.
THREE HOURS TO VESPANIA
Lupin! I just used your shower!
Okay!
Fujiko?
When did you get here? Well?
The washing machine...?

I said, "I used it. You are really stupid.
There's a feeling of regret....
But also one as if I'd seen something worthwhile....
The toilet bowl...
I was still wondering about all those packages.
You didn't open them?
I thought they were Jigen's.
Parcel delivery services are really convenient.
Too convenient, I guess.
But the fact that you found us at all...
If this is about you, Lupin...
there's nothing I don't know.
Why didn't you include me?
Ah... I was going to tell you right away...
Really, you were? I'm glad.
Because I suspected it, I brought the princess.
I'm supposed to deliver her tomorrow,
Maybe I'll get into the palace.
Well, good night.
I haven't slept since yesterday...
D... You're going to sleep?
To our 80 million adult viewers!
Thank you for waiting patiently!
Well, bon appétit!
HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE...
See you tomorrow!
You forgot something.
Sniff...
THE NEXT MORNING 09:00 O'CLOCK
How is the princess?
She has calmed down and is eating her breakfast again.
I'm sorry that she worried you.
You don't have to apologize, do you?
But for her enemies to infiltrate all the way to Japan....
I really didn't expect that.
In this context:
I would like to hold the coronation ceremony a little earlier....
Bring the coronation ceremony forward...?
Thanks for waiting.
The princess...?
Unfortunately, she hasn't arrived yet.
Listen, uh...
She told me the broad outlines of the affair.
But me and that kid won't work out.
You look like a Japanese man and his son.
Stop it!
But do you really intend to involve Conan in this?
Embarrassingly, those present are the only ones we can trust.
It was Count Keith's idea to go to Japan in this situation.
And we realized: even among the security people, there are suspects.
A sad story.
The next in line to the throne would benefit from Princess Mira's demise.
Even this brat understands who's pulling the strings in the background.
Yes.
It was Duke Gerard who killed them both...
and made it look like an accident.
Well, well, well!
Should you be saying that out loud?
So you found proof of that?
No. I have nothing.
Our families have served the royal family for generations.
But this also includes the duke.
Because you can't take action yourself, you turn to us?
That doesn't make your judiciary look very favorable.
Only the queen can judge members of the royal family.
Princess Mira does not have that authority at the moment.
Pah! Are you still living in the 19th century here, or what?
Please.
Time is running out.
The parade to celebrate the coronation will take place the day after tomorrow.
Oh no!
What if the real princess doesn't show up by then?
Then Ran will have to participate in the parade...
Conan-kun...
Miss Ran, close the curtain.
Someone could be aiming at you at any time.
Please don't call me "Miss." I'm just a double.
Have you been serving Princess Mira for long?
Yes. I have been in her service for five years.
And I have worked here at court for three years.
Well, I... I've only gotten to know her eccentric side.
Was the princess like that even as a child?
No. She was very gentle
and sensitive...
And she still hasn't...
Not yet... Not yet what?
She still hasn't cried in front of anyone else....
She lost two loved ones in one fell swoop....
When I think about how she
is overwhelmed by this great grief,
I can hardly stand to feel sorry for her....
She can't handle it.
That's why... she's created a whole other personality for herself.
Do you think it's strange that I'm entrusting this matter to these two?
Yes. I can understand it with Jigen-sensei.
But that little boy...
I don't know why...
But I wonder..,
if that boy's figure...
is really his true form...
He has the body of a child, but the mind of an adult.
Fujiko! It's morning!
Quiet!!!
Oh no, do you have a cold? Don't catch it.
You're one to talk.

Who made me sleep in the park?
Oh no, how mean! He blames you for it!
- That's the last straw. - No, I don't!
But tell me, can't this car go a little faster?
I can't go any faster.
Where are the ones you usually drive?
They're both dead.
Listen... I'm thirsty. Buy me a Coke.
Yes, right away!
I'll have an iced coffee.
Yes, yes!
Once "yes" is enough!
Of course...
The tallest buildings along the parade route... are here.
Tell me, Dad...
Where would you aim from?
From the tallest building?
Don't get cocky, will you? Get off!
- What are you playing at, the cute little guy? - How mean.
Answer me!
You could escape from that one in no time...
Hey, wait!
I'm not an assassin.
I don't know where to aim from.
I never said you were a contract killer.
But on the second limb of your right forefinger...
and the left palm of your hand.
That means..,
that you often have to hold a revolver in your hand.
How do you know that?
I always have my hands buried in my pockets.
I caught a glimpse of them earlier!
Hey, peck!
I'll tell you one thing...
J... Yeah?
Don't ever call me "Dad" again!
But you can't! It's still broad daylight!
You said we were going to the scene of the accident now!
It's not my fault.
It's the fault of the bar, which is already open!
That's a very flimsy excuse!
Don't worry about it. I'm just having a drink. Here.
That's about 500 yen.
Go buy a soda or something!
But just one drink, right?
Really... Now I've got two princesses on my hands...
First... a Coke.
What's that? Hey there!
You don't give me a coke!
And you keep my money, what kind is that?
Alright, then I'll press...
your secret meridian point, then you have to spit something out!
Wah... You don't have to tip me like that...
Uncle, you shouldn't steal.
You'll ruin my reputation!
I paid good money!
For a can, yes.
It's okay. The machine said to take them all!
Are you really a bad person? You don't look like one, uncle.
Watch out!
Maybe I am a very, very bad thief!
I see. So that's why you carry a gun in your shoulder holster!
Your left shoulder is a little lower, so I thought...
And smile.
I'm sorry to disappoint you. It's a video camera. Hihi.
Sorry. I actually thought you were a bad person.
You're lucky.
It's dangerous to say that to a really bad person...
Hey! Is one can enough for you?
Take more!
Let's be accomplices!
You can't steal.
What's wrong with this kid? He doesn't have many friends.
I paid for the second one, didn't I?
ROYAL PALACE OF VESPANIA 12:32 PM
Welcome to the site. So you're the gentleman from Interpol.
My name is Zenigata. I'll get right to the point...
Ah, it's a little uncomfortable in here.
Let's talk inside. All right?
And who are you?
Pleased to meet you, I am Inspector Zenigata's assistant, my name is Kogorô Môri!
Commissioner! Please let me go on patrol right away!
Oh, take your time. There's tea waiting inside...
Patrol!
Lupin, where are you?
- Where are you? - We can safely ignore him.
Lupin!
Lupin!
Ran!
Where are you, Ran?
This is delicious!
Ran!
That voice... Is that Dad?
Wait, Miss Ran. Maybe that's a shady guy.
Ran!!!
Ah! It's a shady guy!
A man with a mustache! He looks scary!
That can't possibly be your father!
It's my father.
Ran!
- You're all right! - What are you doing here?
- We're going home! - Anyway, please help Conan-kun!
- What's all this noise? Count Keith!
- There you are! Listen to me!
- They're... - Get ready for something! - No!
- Listen to me! No! - I'm going to beat you up!
Don't worry! This is Takagi's request!

- Let me explain. - Later!
Lupin is really after the Queen's Crown?
Yes. That much is certain.
ROYAL PALACE RECEPTION HALL FOR HONORED GUESTS
But didn't Lupin try to steal the Queen's Crown once before..,
but then gave it up?
So far, the guy has never given up on anything.
I understand now why you're here.
But Lupin will probably have no choice but to give up again.
And if he can crack our system..,
then he deserves the crown.
I sincerely hope you are right.
We have provided you with a snack....
I would like to see the treasury first.
The guard there will take you there.
Thank you very much.
Whirl up as much dust as you can.
DISH ROOM
RAN DECLARED
KOGORÔ DECLARED
I hope you are satisfied now?
I'm not sure.
But Pops!
Conan-kun alone may not be able to find proof!
It's not certain yet that this Duke Gerard is the culprit.
But he was at the scene of the crime!
You're so gullible.
Maybe they're just saying that.
You are a count, aren't you?
Maybe you want Gerard
and then inherit his estate!
Impossible! Count Keith was here in the palace that day!
Even if you don't do it yourself...
Hiring a professional killer is easy.
A professional killer...
THE DUBIOUS MAN...
Well? Do you have any idea who that could be?
You are quite right.
I now understand how your son got to be the way he is.
He is not my son! I'm just taking care of him.
I would like to hire someone like you....
With an unbiased investigation.
It's not much, but your advance in Japanese yen...
Will you take the job?
¥$£¥£¥$£$¥!
Vie... thank you very much.
Oh, Pops...
So this is where she was going before she went back....
They died at the end of this road, didn't they?
Yes...
I don't know if it's a good idea to leave her alone.
She's a master at running away.
If she was going to do that, she wouldn't come back like a good girl.
And besides... If we were with her, I don't think she'd be able to cry.
You seem to understand the girl pretty well....
- I'm getting suspicious. - Don't be silly.
- It's just that... - It's just what?
She looks like her...
Mother...
Gill.
There's nowhere else for me to go, it seems.
There's nothing I can do. Even if I'm expected to... I can't.
No one......loves me...
But I have nowhere else to go!
Only here..,
where you are...
This is... the only place I can be!
LET'S GIVE IT FIVE MORE MINUTES
If even one ant gets in..,
they immediately lock up walls made of a special alloy.
And you keep watch here 24 hours a day?
Yes, I do. In three shifts of eight hours each.
Shall we increase the number of guards?
No, that's not necessary.
They would only be put to sleep.
ROYAL PALACE ARMORY
The control and storage of weapons is our task.
Even the royal family cannot simply help themselves.
It says here that no bullet was found in Queen Sakura's body.
The bullet passed through her body.
It was found in the ground.
And the swirl marks on the bullet
matched the marks of Prince Gill's rifle barrel.
Can this investigation report be believed?
Yes. I was also present at the scene.
You are welcome to take the report with you.
Are you sure it's admissible?
As head of her personal guard...
I have been unable to contact Her Majesty.
nor the crown prince, nor Princess Mira.
And as a result.
we have also put your daughter in this unpleasant position.
I will find out the truth, I promise you.
Here... here it is.
Ah... It's really not far, is it?
The cherry blossoms are beautiful!
Listen! What are you doing here?
Oh, Your Royal Highness! How did you get here?
I'm surprised! We hadn't noticed you at all!
Much too exaggerated...
So you two are playing detective, huh?
Well, good luck with that, little wine boy.
Say... Was Queen Sakura lying on the ground over there?
That's what I heard.
Then, uh...
You, Uncle...

- Put me on your shoulders! - Are you getting cocky again?
I'll call you "Dad"...
Thank you, dear uncle!
He's singed!
You have a good nose and sharp eyes.
This branch is said to have broken when my mother was hit.
That means...
Say, uncle, could you hit from up there?
- What? The cherry tree branch, you mean? - No...
My brother had
My brother was aiming at the fox in the shade of the tree...
But at that very moment, Mother was trying to scare the fox away....
And then my brother snatched the gun from my uncle...
Snatched?
So? What are you going to do now? Will you come back with us in the helicopter?
Uncle is really great!
He can just order the soldiers here to do anything, and they do it!
No need. There's someone waiting for me down the hill.
Is it the young woman from the other day?
Yes. She's an international lawyer.
She enjoyed the chase.
Young woman? International lawyer?
Did you ask her what her name was?
Huh? She said her name was Mineko Fuji.
Oh, dear...
Do you know her?
So this thing has powers like that?
It has a very specific frequency. It'll last 30 seconds.
- I don't need it. - Well, well, well.
I thought you'd be after a much more fabulous treasure.
What do you see in that crown?
It doesn't even have any precious jewels in it, it's just stuff.
How can you say that! It's really historic!
Price trumps history!
Did you notice anything different about the story before?
Yeah. It makes sense to me..,
that Prince Gill didn't use the long rifle,
but a handgun.
But not why the uncle was carrying a handgun.
Even though they had guards around, he carried both.
Are we going to look at these weapons?
So you are going to help me?
I guess I don't have a choice. It's my job, after all.
Have you decided to become queen?
I'm going back because I have to. I haven't thought about the crown yet.
Whether you become queen or not...
When I've delivered you, my job is done. But I'll be happy to do it again.
There she is: Mineko Fuji! She'll rip those guys off shamelessly.
- Did you say something? - No, nothing.
Ah, stop!
What are you doing?
We girls have all kinds of needs.
3:45 PM
Princess Mira!
Are you mad?
No, I'm not.
Why not? Because of me, you've been through so much....
Well, it wasn't really your fault.
I know.
You told her...
Count Keith told me.
Keith told you...
Thank you very much.
You're welcome. I was just doing my job.
You really insist on cash?
We would have paid by check or money order.
Well, the thing is... I only trust cash.
I see...
So, how was it? Did the princess enjoy herself?
Yes. Until this morning, she was able to be a normal girl...
and forget for a while that she was a princess.
I see.
You're really nice.
Why don't you tell her the truth?
That you wanted to give her freedom, even if it was only for a day.
Did you give her...
Don't worry. I'll keep my clients' secrets. I keep my clients' secrets.
I'm a lawyer, after all.
Thank you for treating even me, a simple driver, to such sumptuous meals.
Delicious! Mmm, yummy...
- A beer and a juice, please. - Yes, right away!
What?
Hi!
A "Hi!" is not an explanation!
Well? That's...
Come with me for a second.
Oh... hello uncle!
Just "Hello uncle"? What's the meaning of this?
What's the meaning of this?
We were delivering the princess when they invited me to dinner.
That's not what I meant. I meant Fujiko!
Ah, well, that...
Before I knew it, I was on the plane and it was so cold...
That's not what I meant!
What are you playing detective for?
Ah, well, that...
Did anything good ever come out of her being there?
You're just in my way!
Well, she asked me...
...to help them...
Huh? What are you talking about?
Nothing good has ever come out of this!
TWO OF A KIND...
- Anyway, let's close the deal and go! - You're right.
So, what did it look like at the crime scene?
You examined the prints on the hunting rifle?

TRAUMPAARE...
Thank you for your patience!
Miss, could I have a coffee, please?
Yes, with pleasure! What's wrong?
Is something wrong?
Until just now, there were... Or was it my imagination?
Dad, Conan-kun!
That's Ran-neechan, isn't it?
Just be careful.
If we mess up now, we'll be in trouble!
Those wretched...
- Ran! - Ran-neechan!
I don't believe it! This is the worst!
Don't get so mad, Ran!
Ran-neechan!
Here you go, your coffee!
Thanks, Ran-neechan.
So you stayed behind?
Yes.
Only the cook and I are still here.
Sorry for the inconvenience. It won't be long now.
What's the "little father" doing here?
How should I know?
It was that woman!
I don't think so, no...
Now all the actors are in position... Shall we start the show?
Mother's scent...
Princess Mira?
The door is open.
Sorry to disturb you.
I brought these two.
Are you really sure?
It's fine.
This is my mother's room.
Nothing's been changed here since she died.
No one's been allowed to touch anything.
You'll investigate, won't you? I'll back you up.
Good, then we'll allow ourselves...
It's really funny...
That my uncle killed those two...
And that I'm looking for evidence...
But we don't know for sure yet if...
I'm sorry.
What are you apologizing for?
It's cursed. This land is cursed.
By this rock...
Mira-san...
Wow, that's great...
That's...
Now I realized what the queen felt.
Queen Sakura's great love...
Oops?
Well, well... The door is open!
Watch out, or a thief will get in!
SLEEP SPRAY
Look, Schlahaaf spray! Nonsense, just kidding.
Why are you sleeping?
Why is it open?
Why is the crown gone?
Then I built this thing for nothing!
Who are you?
I'm sorry, Lupin. I'm really sorry, Lupin.
No... You've got to be kidding me.
I'm really sorry, Lupin. I'm really sorry...
Oh, dear.
Bathtub!
INFRARED TEMPERATURE/WEIGHT
I've tripped them all...
I'm really sorry, Lupin. Let me catch you.
What's that?
They're way too early!
Thank you for your support.
You're welcome!
So Lupin really came. You're a real expert.
Well, see you later.
Lupin! Lupiiin!
We'll use the gazebo in the garden. Everything is ready, isn't it?
Yes. Everything is prepared as planned.
Finally, the end is near.
- Hello? Can you hear me? - Yes.
I'm locked in. Could you please come and get me?
And the treasure?
- He's gone. - I'm going home.
Don't say that again.
- Learn from your mistakes! - Yes, sir!
Sensei! It's your turn.
Yes, sir.
He seems to be "slaying" more than usual....
I have once again slain a lot of
Unworthy things...
- Surely this pose is unpleasant? - Yes...
Thank you!
Keep covering my back, will you?
It was just Jigen and Goemon.
As I expected.
- Are we all here? - Yes, we were the last.
Something wrong?
- Why do we have to assemble? - Order of the policeman.
ROYAL PALACE - GARDEN PAVILION 5:32 P.M.
Is that all right, Commissioner Zenigata?
Yes, thank you.
There is a reason why I have gathered you here.
Earlier today, from the palace vault...
the Queen's Crown was stolen.
To find the culprit and...
I'm sorry, but please let me do the talking.
...I had to make sure that there were only a few people in the palace.
Oh, crap!
What?
It has to work like this!
What about you?
He's among us.
The guy who wants to kill Princess Mira!
But you investigated that, didn't you?
What, me?
It all started with that unfortunate hunting accident.
Well? Did he...?
No, not as far as I know.
It was the boy and Miss Ran's father, wasn't it?
But it wasn't an accident.
"Ooooh"?
Ooooh?
Unbelievable! That would have knocked out an elephant for half an hour!
Exactly. It was a murder made to look like an accident.
Well? What about me...
The drink thief?
This promises to be exciting, peck.

Let me say a few things first, Father?
Is he serious?
All right, all right, old man.
So play along.
That day, Prince Gill
fired his rifle from the hill at the fox near the big cherry tree.
But instead of the fox, he hit
Queen Sakura, who wanted to scare the fox away.
This is what Duke Gerard testified.
Isn't that right, Princess Mira?
Yes. That's what I heard.
You haven't got us mixed up again, have you, Pops?
I'm your father?
What's that girl doing here?
So you knew about the Japanese girl?
Ah... Yes, I must have overheard one of the guards talking about her.
Forgive me.
I took the liberty of bringing her to the palace..,
without telling anyone.
I see. So that's how it was...
After his suicide, the Prince held
held the pistol in his right hand.
He shot himself in the right temple.
Of course, he held the gun in his right hand to do that. Right, Princess Mira?
My brother was left-handed.
That means someone put the gun in his wrong hand.
But why did that person think the prince was right-handed?
I saw a photograph of the prince in Queen Sakura's chamber.
It was from his childhood, when he played baseball.
He wore the glove on his right hand.
They trained my brother
to eat and sign with his right hand.
I see.
It's not always easy being heir apparent....
Kyle! Did you bring the rifle that was used in the hunt?
Yes. Here it is.
The boy told me you told me to take it.
They both used the same model of rifle.
Rifles with cylinder breech
must be handled right-handed, even by left-handed
by left-handed people, unless they are custom-made.
That's because the chamber stem used to load is always on the right side.
Well?
Aha... Now I understand.
Don't just talk yourself into it!
- Now I know who the culprit is! - Uncle!
- Tell us what you've deduced! - Conan-kun!
Don't just climb up there!
Ah... I'm sorry...
Duke Gerard!
Just a moment, please.
This was the spot where you made the mistake.
Since you saw the Prince handling the hunting weapon with his right hand only..,
you, without a moment's hesitation,
you put the pistol in his right hand.
Why only...
Why?
Why did you kill them?
It was you who shot Her Majesty.
Uncle... Is it true? Did you really...
What you're saying really surprises me...
Inspector, your subordinate is determined to make this a murder case.
What should we do now?
Môri-kun... Is that all you have to say?
No, this is where it gets really interesting.
He's just going on and on again...
Ah, staff announcement, staff announcement.
Peeked in, saw the bullet. Let me do the show. Uh, uh, uh...
Well...
So you're eager to pass this whole thing off as an accident.
And claim that the queen was shot with this gun.
And what about this?
They replaced it.
Also because of the marks on the bullet.
you switched your gun with the prince's after you killed him.
Didn't you?
That's enough of that.
If you want to make it a homicide, provide evidence.
Yikes?
Pops, what are you doing!
That was a blank.
E... a blank?
I wondered all the time why the Queen
was going along on that hunt.
Did your father know my mother?
Not that I know of!
And besides, he seems quite different from usual!
IN THE ROYAL PALACE - TOILETS
Than usual?
SLEEPING SPRAY
Normally he is called "the sleeping Kogorô"
and he would never talk so confused about a case...
THE SLEEPING KOGORÔ
Unbelievable...
This is really strange, Duke Gerard!
Why are you so surprised?
Did it break?
It can't go on like this.
This is...
...the box you used that day, isn't it?
Because I asked Conan
to tell Kyle to please bring back the box
that Duke Gerard used that day.
Yes. That's how it was directed to me.
So you used your own rifle for hunting,
without knowing that it was loaded with blanks.
Queen Sakura did not approve at all,

that hunting kills animals under the guise of sport.
She must not have wanted her son to indulge in this hobby either.
That is why she gave him cartridges,
from which she had removed the bullet.
Mother...
And this is exactly what Kyle and his colleagues have recorded
in the investigation report.
But it seems unlikely to me
that a queen would have such an intimate knowledge of weapons.
A good point!
Shut up!
Okay.
AII the trophies in Queen Sakura's chamber....
She was a gifted athlete, right?
At a young age, she also won competitions in the Modern Pentathlon!
And whose five sports are:
Horseback riding, swimming,
cross-country skiing, fencing
and... Sport shooting.
Among the trophies was one
from a competition you had won, Duke.
And it was from a shooting competition three years ago.
- That's really... - That's enough, master detective.
Assuming that I was the perpetrator,
why should I be so bold
without trying to get rid of the evidence?
Let me answer that:
To get rid of everyone in your way at once.
You are really good, master detective.
I'll get rid of them at the very end.
Pooh, how can you put yourself in such an embarrassing position!
Oh! I think that's it.
So that's the end of it? How annoying.
Well, they were pretty disappointing as opponents.
- I'll leave the rest to you. - Guard!
Keith...
There isn't a single guard in the palace
who would listen to your command.
Oho? So you expected something like this and prepared for it?
You're pretty good, you little crook.
And how do you like this?
Don't move!
There's a little surprise hidden in the column in the middle.
With it, you can all go together to where the queen is.
And what about you? Are you going to fly up in the air too?
If I'm not careful, I might actually get hurt.
Therefore, please don't force me.
Let me have the last chance...
Keith...
Let me give it to you.
Won't you join me in making our Vespania great and powerful?
A count in name only...
Do you really like playing babysitter to the royal family?
Doesn't this chance make the blood in your veins boil?
I'd spare Kyle, too.
What do you think?
Can't a real man
can't a real man go wild once or twice?
And it would be for the good of the people!
Vespania is about to take over!
A new kind of energy...
An infinite power that the whole world is striving for!
Keith...
Count Keith...
The Stinger family has served the royal family for 200 years.
The blood that flows in my veins..,
I'll sacrifice it to the Royal Family to the last drop!
That did it!
That's right.
What are you doing?
Chaos is about to break out.
You were going to escape under his protection, as usual, Lupin.
Oh, you noticed?
Think back nine minutes and thirteen seconds.
Let me say a few things first, father?
That's when you called me "little father," isn't it?
Ouch... But why are you doing that now of all times?
The good man had such a great performance. Don't spoil the mood,
Okay? I don't care.
I don't care.
As long as I can arrest you, I'm happy!
You...
Were you really responsible for all this, uncle?
Yes. I couldn't let my sister have our land any longer.
If we really start mining this ore..,
it will mean the end of nature in Vespania.
You don't understand.
Do you have any idea how valuable Vespania is now?
You are the one who has understood nothing!
In exchange for the profit we would
something irreplaceable, immeasurably important!
You are the one who is narrow-minded!
Because who always only exploits the earth, it will let down
sometime in the abandonment!
Don't you even realize this anymore?
A king who has no ambition is not worthy to be king.
And her children would have done the same as her in her place.
So that's why you have my brother and also me....
I am sorry, Keith.
But I'm going to grant your wish in the end.
I turned it on.
Okay!

Caught! Pull, father!
What?
Duke Gerard!
- Kyle! - Yes!
Mineko-san!
This bullet's great, isn't it?
You're not my uncle anymore.
To kill your own sister and her son...
I can't believe you're capable of such a thing.
I'll never...
...forgive you.
And I will never let you have this land...
Because the queen of this land
is me!
Princess Mira!
Say, girl with the motorcycle!
How long will this gadget be active?
About three more seconds.
Come on, jump!
BESIDES GERARD, THREE GUARDS WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED AND TWO GUARDS WERE SLIGHTLY INJURED.
This is where I met your mother.
THE NEXT DAY 10:27 A.M.
I beg you! Steal me too,
together with the crown!
I don't want to be a caged bird
but to fly in the sky!
I don't think I can do that.
Why not?
Listen.
Just like my grandpa was a famous master thief,
your father is the king of this land.
Someday, you too must rule this land.
With that thing on your head.
Fly in the sky, but not with me, with your subjects!
Lupin...
Goodbye.
If this land has become a good land thanks to you..,
I'll be back to steal it.
She was then as you are now.
My sensible, reliable mother...
That she was once like me....
I had completely forgotten about that promise.
But when I heard that Sakura had died..,
I remembered.
Uncle! Stealing is a crime.
It wasn't me, but the girl with the motorcycle!
You guys are accomplices.
You're a pain. I'll give it back.
I'll give it back.
It looks best on your head.
But tell me, peck... Can I ask you something?
Why did you realize that shooting Sakura wasn't an accident?
Your dad said..,
you were safe as soon as you got here.
It was because of the broken twig.
The twig?
Prince Gill must have known that your mother loved this cherry tree very much.
Yes...
Then he wouldn't have pointed his rifle at that tree, would he?
I see. That's why the shooter couldn't have been the prince.
The cherry tree
told me.
That reminds me. Can I ask you something too, uncle?
I don't even know your name yet.
You don't?
My name is
Lupin III!
Is it okay not to tell the commissar?
Queen's orders. We can't go against that.
Damn it!
The next time we see that guy, I'll catch him!
But I'm relieved.
The bad guys have all been caught.
Lupin!
Ah, not quite all of them.
They're already gone.
Oh...
He must return as soon as possible to steal the crown.
But until this land becomes beautiful and peaceful..,
he will not do so.
I am grateful to all of you from the bottom of my heart.
Thank you very, very much.
Ran... I had a great time that night.
Thanks to you.
Don't! I, too, got to be a princess for a while.
Princess Mira, it's time.
Where's Conan?
Didn't he say he was going to the coronation?
Someone from the Japanese embassy picked him up earlier.
After all, he entered the country illegally.
Oh, that's right.
Well then, shall we go?
I'VE GOT THE PECK. LUPIN
Oh dear, how awful!
Shit...
If I apply for a passport, it will be revealed that Conan Edogawa doesn't even exist!
Looks like even the master detective is in trouble now.
Uncle... uh, Lupin-san?!
You seem to have a hard time with that name. Oh, leave it at "Uncle"!
We stopped wearing the masks a long time ago.
Haven't you noticed?
The girl with the motorcycle?
What about Dad?
- I said: Don't call me "Dad"! - Your beard itches!
He really looks like a kid.
But the poor guy is a high school student inside!
Ah, Mom...
Isn't it torturous to have the body of a child?
A lewd innuendo?
No, it's not lewd at all! Old-fashioned guy!
Take it easy!
My mind is that of an adult.
So is my body.
Ouch!
So it was salacious after all.
Just calm down.
This girl here said she would accompany you to Japan, Shin'ichi Kudô.

Coincidentally, a friend with a ship is nearby.
Thanks.
But next time you go on a thieving spree,
I'll catch you.
THE FRIEND'S SHIP
What now? The next time he meets you, he'll catch you!
Don't talk nonsense...

So, now we have a lot of time. So let me figure it out...
Figure out what?
Well, it's obvious! The secret of your rejuvenation!
"Rejuvenation" is an exaggeration. I've shrunk.
Either way's fine with me.
Hey, stop, Mom...
Please don't just touch me!
