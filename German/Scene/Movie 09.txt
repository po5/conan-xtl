ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC 15 YEARS AGO
YASHIROMARU I
WATARU KAIDÔ (41) 1ST OFFICER OF THE YASHIROMARU I
Iceberg ahead! Turn off!
Aye, aye, sir!
Captain?
Captain! Are you all right?
I'm sorry, sir.
Captain...?
Captain! Pull yourself together! Captain! Captain!
First Officer...
NISHITAMA, HALF A MONTH EARLIER
YASHIRO
HIDETO YASHIRO (49) NAVAL ARCHITECT AT YASHIRO
That's nice!
Yes.
I'd like to show a beautiful sunset like that to Shin'ichi.
I can see it.
W... what is it?
You can see better from up here.
J... yes...
It does look better, but
it's pathetic.
We saw that, Conan!
Oh, no. Put me down, Ran-nêchan.
- I saw it! Seen it! - We saw it.
You're letting Ran-san coddle you.
Idiot! That's not what happened!
You're all red, Conan-kun.
What are you talking about? It's the evening sun.
- Yes, it is! He's blushing! - You idiot! I'm not.
Idiot! It wasn't like that!
What are you talking about? It's the evening sun.
It's just like back then.
Huh? What is it?
No, it's nothing.
Don't be like that. Tell me!
It's really nothing.
How nothing?
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE PLOT OVER THE OCEAN
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on what was happening
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He administered a poison to me
and when I came to...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked my name, I said Conan Edogawa.
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
I'm Genta Kojima from 1B of Teitan Elementary School.
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya, same class.
Ayumi Yoshida!
- With protégé Conan... -...as well as Ai-chan...
...we are the Detective Boys!
Our detective badge
contains a tiny transceiver.
You can also transmit with it. A great piece!
Our wrist watches are also flashlights.
They are waterproof so you can use them in the water.
Both devices are
Professor Agasa's inventions.
Since I am small now, he built
unique parts for me:
ANESTHESIA CHRONOMETER VOICE TRANSPOSER
The voice transposer in the shape of a fly and
the anesthesia chronometer.
Thanks to these two I created
the master detective "Sleeping Kogoro".
By the way, Haibara-san...
How can I say, she's so cool
and seems so grown up.
Haha, I'm not surprised.
Ai Haibara. Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She originally belonged to the men in black.
In order to escape,
she took the same poison that was given to me,
and shrank as a result.
And while I, the former high school detective,
now as an elementary school detective
one difficult case after another,
I secretly try to uncover the identity of these men.
But, dude,
you could draw better conclusions.
I am small, my mind is not!
No case remains unsolved!
There is always only one truth!
Oh, it's so big!
What a luxury!
That was to be expected.
After all, the Yashiro Group is a big company.
Their merchant ships have high status
and this is their first cruise ship.
Such luxury is the least they can do.
Dear Sir,
You are Môri-sama, aren't you?
Yes.
We are preparing your table.
Please wait a moment.
Professor, what is this?
Huh? This? It's just an IC recorder.
If I have an idea,
I can type it right in.
Oh yes, with invention comes to mind....
Tada! Loudspeaker in cufflink form
with a listening function.
I say.
Oh, they look very elegant.
I like that.
Oh, cufflinks.
Just right. I'll borrow them.
But these are...
Fool!
That's more fitting for a man of my stature.
A brat like you doesn't need to wear that.
But Dad, they're...
It's okay, Ran-neechan.
- I won't be needing them on the ship anyway. - Well? Môri-san?
You're the great detective Kogoro Môri-san?
Yes, that's right...
- Wonderful! - Who is this guy?

My name is Hironari Kusaka and I am a screenwriter
HIRONARI KUSAKA (26) SCREENWRITER
and a big fan of yours!
Oh, thank you very much.
Ah, this is
Minako Akiyoshi-san.
She co-chaired the design group for this ship.
The wonderful name of the ship "Aphrodite" is from her.
MINAKO AKIYOSHI (32) SHIP DESIGN ENGINEER AT YASHIRO
Akiyoshi. Hello.
Môri. Pleased to meet you.
- What a beauty! - J... yes.
Excuse me, Môri-sama.
Thank you for your patience. The table is ready now.
Excuse me, sir.
Two more seats, please. It's okay, isn't it? Môri-san?
- Ah, yes... - Then please follow me.
Isn't your father kind of strange?
- What do you mean? - Otherwise he would say something like:
Oh, Aphrodite is the goddess of beauty and love.
The name fits you much more than a ship.
Hahaha.
Well, something like that.
I guess it's because Minako-san looks a lot like my mother.
I see.
Now that you mention it.
So she's the type of woman the old man doesn't like.
I'm writing a series...
I'm working on a series set on a luxury liner.
While researching, I met Minako-san.
- Yes. - Ah, so that's how it is.
By the way, Môri-san, you must have been invited.
Or are you here for professional reasons?
Well, it wasn't exactly an invitation...
Excuse me, but it's not like that.
Huh? What is it?
To be honest, Sonoko's parents
received the invitation.
Sonoko's father is the director of the Suzuki Group.
My parents couldn't
My parents couldn't take the day off, so they gave me the card.
And since it's more fun with more than one, I invited the others.
And so she organized the invitations for the eight of us.
Oh, so that's how it is.
Well, I'm here as a chaperone, so to speak.
I see, so that's how it is.
What kind of story are you writing?
Is it about a trip around the world
- on a luxury liner? - That's good!
Isn't it?
Or about a maiden voyage
like the Titanic that ends in a shipwreck?
But Ai-kun!
Speaking of shipwrecks,
There was that accident where a freighter...
...collided with an iceberg.
Yes, that was in winter 15 years ago.
A bad decision by the captain was the cause.
A crew member died
and the captain shared the fate of the ship.
Is that true?
What if this ship sinks too?
I can only swim seven meters.
Don't worry.
The captain of the Aphrodite is excellent
and there are no icebergs here.
If the ship sinks, I'm sure those people will be the first to be rescued.
will be the first to be rescued.
Well? Isn't that Nîmi-san? The former prime minister?
And his wife.
- Still the stars... - There are the Uruwashi sisters!
They have a "nice body" as always!
They are the invited guests of the president of the Yashiro group.
Speak of the devil...
President Yashiro with daughter.
TAKAE YASHIRO (51) DAUGHTER OF THE PRESIDENT.
Takae became director of Yashiro passenger ships after her marriage.
ENTARÔ YASHIRO (78) PRESIDENT OF THE YASHIRO GROUP
Come to think of it, Director Takae's husband was recently
in a traffic accident recently.
What? Really?
Yes, Hidehito Yashiro-sensei.
He was my supervisor and was in charge of the design group.
So that's how it was.
How was that? I think he had a heart attack while driving...
and fell off a cliff.
Ah! There's the captain!
He's so cool!
This is Captain Wataru Kaidô.
We were talking about the shipwreck.
He was the first mate on the ship.
What? Illogical?
The accidental death of Mr. Hidehito Yashiro?
Yes. That he had a heart attack..,
...as he was going down the mountain.
But the investigation didn't raise any particular doubts, did it?
Yes, that's true, but...
Very well.
There's nothing wrong with removing doubts.
I will let the appropriate authority know.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me, Satô-san, can I help?
Don't you have reports to write?
Chiba-kun,
- could you give me a hand? - Yes.
Since we've all been given something to drink...
Can I take over, Mr. Môri?
G... Fine...
Well then. To a happy cruise
and
to Ran's victory in the Kantô karate competition!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Thank you... Really, Sonoko!
You, you, Ran-onêsan.
It's really great that you won the karate tournament.

It was even the Kantô tournament!
Wow! Wow! That's amazing!
So, has Kudô-kun congratulated you in any way?
Shin'ichi?
When I told him on the phone,
he said, "There. How nice for you."
What? That's it?
He's probably busy with another case,
that freak.
That was only because I had congratulated her a thousand times as Conan.
Ah, I'm full.
That steak was delicious.
We could have that every day.
Next up is dessert!
Huh? What's the matter?
I think I'm seasick.
Yeah, I'm a little dizzy, too.
Pops, with you it's the alcohol!
Ran-chan, lighten up.
Really.
Your dad's funny.
Don't be silly. He just drank too much.
I'm sorry. I'm going to retire
and lie down.
Will you be all right?
I'll take some pills. See you later.
Get well soon.
Jeez, Pops!
Are you sure you're okay?
Yep,
Kogoro Môri is fine!
Don't worry, Ran-nêchan.
We just need to put him to bed.
I'm so sorry.
Then I'll leave Pops to you, right, Conan-kun?
Yes!
Thank you, Professor.
You're welcome.
Don't mention it. Don't mention it.
Good night, Ran-chan!
Please, Professor.
Okay.
We'll be going, too.
Okay.
Well then, Conan-kun...
...I'll leave Dad to you.
What's up?
- Hi! - It's us!
What are you guys doing? All together?
We were thinking about giving Ran-san...
something for her victory.
And this?
Aren't they beautiful? We got them from the island visit today.
We want to make a gold medal out of them.
Because she didn't get anything from Shin'ichi-nîsan.
Hm. Good luck, then.
I'm going to the bathroom.
I... the bathroom?
What? You want to come in?
Ah... no... this...
Let me read you your plan for tomorrow.
Breakfast is at seven in the morning.
You'll get your breakfast in your room.
NATSUHO TSUJIMOTO (25) CHIEF STEWARDESS
Ms. Director has an appointment to play squash with Ms. Nîmi at 9:00.
A seat is reserved on the 7th floor.
Mr. President, billiards with Mr. Nîmi at 9:30.
The table is reserved in the pool bar on the 3rd floor.
Madam Director will
be back in your room around nine-thirty....
Ah, does that feel good!
Right.
Surrounded by a sea breeze, a cup of tea in the morning.
Ha! That's really something.
Yeah, there's something about it.
There's something about it.
This way, please.
Did you see those? The director's legs?
I can't believe she's over 50.
Jesus, what is this, Pop?
Professor, isn't it about time?
Huh?
Well, for your popular word quiz!
We won't rest until we get through this.
Now they're having fun with him.
Good. Then I'll grant your wish.
Here's the quiz for our ship's voyage.
Genta-kun will be treated at sea...
...at the ship's hospital.
So... What happened to Genta-kun?
First:
He ate too much and now has a stomachache.
Two: He fell down and sprained his foot.
Third:
He was in the sun too long and got sunstroke.
Now, what is the correct answer?
Since it's about Genta-kun, I'd guess 1....
Boo! One is wrong!
No matter how much I eat, no problem!
Ah! I got it!
I got it too!
But isn't the quiz too hard for the kiddies?
- After all, English is... - Sonoko!
English is the key? So English is the key?
It's about the ship.
Ship?
I got it! The answer is two, the sprain.
SHIFF = SHIP (SHIPPU)
Ship means "ship" in English.
Genta-kun got a wet envelope!
SHIPPU = WET ENVELOPE
That is correct! By the way: Friendship is called "friendship".
FRIENDSHIP = FRIENDSHIP
And gossip is "gosship".
GOSSIP = GOSSHIP
Hey, hey. It's spelled "gossip."
GOSSIP
Well then, see you at ten.
Going from ship to shippu...!
Listen, what do you think of this?
A bad performance (kôkai) you regret (kôkai).
What's the point of that?
- Man, you're boring. - Oh, yeah.
Tell me, when do we want to give it to her?
I'll give it to her now.
Hey. How about this?
Ran. Let's get one last cup.
Good.
- We really need to savor this. - Don't we?
Not at all. Not by a long shot!
Let's also drink...
...h......h...!
Which juice shall we have?
- Come on! Let's go! - Wait!

But they are left out again.
Huh?
Yes?
15 YEARS AGO. COME TO THE MARINA AT 10:15.
I know the secret from 15 years ago.
Come down to the marina at 10:15.
That's how it is.
It actually happened just outside his villa.
Yes.
Let's take a look at the villa.
Well then, what do we do now?
It's still a little too cold for swimming.
I should get changed.
What? Change?
I received an invitation from the Uruwashi sisters...
from the Uruwashi sisters.
Huh?!
They want to hear stories about the great detective Kogoro Môri.
See you!
Your father won't miss a beat.
When did he get the invitation?
Let's leave him alone.
So, what do you guys want to do?
Well...
I want to play hide and seek!
That sounds like fun.
Let's do that.
Hide and seek? That brings back memories.
We used to play that when we were kids.
Yes, in the park or at our house.
Even in elementary school once.
What, really?
Sorry, I'll pass.
- Huh? - Why don't you play along, Conan-kun?
You're such a drag!
That reminds me. Shin'ichi turned me down, too.
Come on, let's go! Let's play hide-and-seek!
Well, you could pass the time with that.
What about you?
I have a massage appointment in a few minutes.
That's opaque!
Let's get to the rules.
The time limit is 30 minutes.
Floors 1 to 7 are allowed as hiding places.
Forbidden are the cabins, where entry is prohibited,
the toilets and the bathroom with a view. Agreed?
Yes!
So, come on everybody!
First the stone. Who will it be?
What?
Sonoko has to search!
M... Wait a minute!
How am I supposed to find six people
How am I supposed to find six people in 30 minutes?
That's impossible!
We could designate a second searcher.
- Two to search? - Why not? It's a change.
Okay, let's do it again!
- To good cooperation. - Yes, likewise.
- What an odd couple. - Oh, yeah.
Lend me your detective badge.
What? Why?
How else will we know who found who?
With this we can communicate.
Tsk. Don't lose it!
Good. Then in five minutes, at 9:50, the search will begin.
If all are found by 20 past, the searchers have won.
Okay! We will win!
Sorry, but the victory will be ours.
- After all... -Conan-kun is on our side!
That's easy for you to say.
- Let's go! Let's go! - The game's starting!
Yippee!
- See you later! - No way! See you in a minute!
Ran-onêsan didn't notice.
She'll notice when she's in hiding.
I'm sure she'll be super surprised!
- Got it. - Mine!
Probably better not here.
What time does the movie start?
I think at 10:00.
We should go then.
- Let's go! Hurry up! - It's about to start!
It can't be!
Yes!
Who would have thought I'd have to search....
Every now and then it's good to be on the side of the searchers.
- Huh? - Five minutes have passed.
I'll search from the fifth floor. You take the lower ones.
Ah, yes!
Hey, Kudô-kun.
Hi, Haibara!
Could it be that you forgot to play hide-and-seek?
I've got one!
You found me pretty quickly.
A wolverine's hiding place has always been the dining hall.
Ah! Haibara-san.
The professor's things.
But the tactician succumbs to his tactics.
Yes, sir! Come out!
Manno.
And I thought this would be a good hiding place.
You thought wrong. It's ten years too early to come after me.
Yes, Akiyoshi here.
Hello Minako-san, Kusaka here.
Yes?
I'll start right away with the people appearing.
Nanami Okazaki, 20 years old,
companion on the luxury liner Southern Cross.
I will now read the story.
Nanami Okazaki loves the sea.
Maybe because she has lived by the sea since she was born.
She especially loves the vastness of the sea.
We found four easily...
I had a feeling Ran wouldn't make it easy for us.
Was Ran-san that good at hiding?
Yes. She was like a ninja!
Who else would cling to the ceiling
or dive into the lake?
To the ceiling?
Into the lake?
Insanity.
She was very strong even as a child.
We still have 12 minutes. Let's find her!
She's not here either.
Ten eleven.
Only nine minutes left.
Hello Uruwashi sisters! It's Môri!
Revenge for father!
OPEN - STOP - CLOSE
Only seconds left!
Five more!
Four!
Three!
Two!

One!
Zero!
We won the game of hide and seek!
- We have Ninja Ran-san to thank for that. - A hundred percent!
Ran-onêsan!
You see! We won the game.
Ran-nêchan, where were you hiding?
Conan-kun, you were just playing with the soccer ball.
I heard that.
Ran-onêsan still hasn't noticed.
How strange.
Is she stupid?
I wonder if the other one is still looking.
Huh? What?
Cold. What's wrong?
A box? Am I in a box?
No! Help!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Help me!
- What? - What's wrong, Sonoko-nêchan?
Quick! Please help me!
Calm down, Sonoko. Where are you?
I don't know. In some box.
Someone hit me...
Hello, Sonoko, what was that? Say it again!
Please help me!
Is the battery dead?
Darn it. The other day...
Are you cold, Sonoko?
It's freezing?
She's freezing...?
A freezer!
Hey! What are you doing?
Where's the freezer?
- The freezer? - Please! My girlfriend's in danger!
In the second basement...
- There's plenty here! - Where could she be?
Split up and search!
Yes!
Sonoko-nêchan!
MELONS TANGERINES
Hey!
Sonoko-san!
Sonoko! Are you there?
Sonoko-onêsan! Where are you?
She doesn't seem to be here. Let's go.
That was cold.
- It's not in any freezer. - Sonoko. Sonoko...
Damn it. Where is she? Where the hell is she?
Could she be dead already?
Don't paint the devil on the wall!
Well, there are no other cold places!
Dead? Got it!
MORT
They have this on a ship?
Amazing.
This is heavy.
Sonoko!
Sonoko!
Get her to a doctor quick!
Ha! I'm alive again!
She's out of danger. If the body continues to receive
warmth and rest, she will be able to move again soon.
Thank you. How nice, isn't it, Sonoko?
Besides...
Who makes such mischief?
Mischief? It wasn't mischief.
That was definitely an assassination attempt!
DOCTOR'S ROOM
Call the police!
V... understood.
Will you tell me what happened?
Where did it happen?
At the marina.
I was looking for Ran when a stick or something hit me.
I must have been knocked unconscious.
And the perpetrator's face?
I might have seen it, but... I can't remember.
What time was it?
Ah, I remember. It was exactly ten eleven.
Ten eleven.
Uh-huh. From here it is
a stone's throw to the mortuary.
But why was Sonoko-nêchan attacked?
That's...
President Yashiro's metal fan!
What's it doing here?
- It's not here. - Môri-san!
The captain said the police...
Excuse me, but this is President Yashiro's suite.
Yes, I heard it from the Uruwashi sisters.
That reminds me, someone came out of the suite earlier.
Someone?
I couldn't make out his face.
He had a windbreaker on and a hood.
What time was that?
It must have been about 10:15.
Is that true, Môri-san?
That's strange.
Neither of the two gentlemen is wearing a windbreaker.
And at that time, only the principal should be in the suite.
If you wear a hood in the hallway, it's as if you don't want to be recognized, right?
you don't want to be recognized, right?
I wonder if something happened to her.
Madam Director! This is Tsujimoto! Principal!
Do you have a central key?
- A... but... - Warden, please forgive me!
- Warden! - Stop! Stay here!
- Oh, no! - Who would do such a thing?
I guess she's been dead for 30 minutes.
I'll tell the captain!
I'll tell the president!
She was coming out of the bathroom when he hit her.
The blood's all cleaned up here.
Why? Why only this side?
What are you doing now?
Ouch!
Really!
Môri-san!
About President Yashiro...
He left the billiard room and hasn't returned!
What do you mean?
It's possible that
President Yashiro may have been involved in something as well.
OOTORI
- Hello. Môri-san!
Thank you for coming, commissar.
- Have you found President Yashiro? - No, not yet.
The crew searched the whole ship, but...
Amazing, whether it's the sky or the sea,
there's always something happening where you go.
What's next, outer space? A rocket ride?
What nonsense!
What? The president's fingerprints?

Yes, the concentration of bloodstains is highest at the
of blood stains is the strongest.
The blood found there matches
with President Yashiro's blood type.
Thank you very much. Please continue your work.
One more thing, Commissioner. According to the person in charge of the marina.
...there are traces of use on the delivery dock... And it's...
...quite fresh.
What kind of marks?
Fingerprints, bloodstains, use of the door...
Inspector, it looks like...
It looks like..,
someone in the marina attacked President Yashiro...
and pushed him out the door into the sea.
We can safely assume that.
Yeah, it looks like it. Shiratori-kun,
inform the coast guard. Tell them to search the area.
Yes, sir.
- Takagi-kun. Yes.
I want to listen to the Nîmi couple. Bring them in, please.
Yes.
Now, Conan-kun.
Yes?
Leave everything else to us and go back to your room.
And don't hang around anywhere.
The killer is probably still on the ship.
Yes!
There's even cake!
Looks delicious!
Roast beef.
Once in a while, I guess...
Not once in a while, either.
Oh yes, Professor. Shall we take something for Ran-san and Sonoko-san?
They must be hungry.
It's better if we leave Sonoko-kun to the doctor.
Ran-onêsan also said she would go eat something later.
I see.
You Mitsuhiko, did she find her gold medal?
I'm sure Ran-san doesn't have a head for it right now.
You're right.
Where's Conan-kun?
That's right, he's not here.
Do you think he'll beat us to the police interrogation again?
That's possible.
He's really good at hiding in a place like this.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Please catch the perpetrator as soon as possible.
Yes.
Well, then...
PRESIDENT YASHIRO, BILLIARDS WITH MR. NÎMI, MARINA
The director went to her suite after squash.
DIRECTOR TAKAE, SQUASH WITH MRS. NÎMI, SUITE, BATHROOM
and was murdered after bathing.
Consequently, we can assume,
that the person wearing the windbreaker, who Môri-kun saw,
- is the perpetrator. - Right.
This suspicious person went directly to the marina from there.
If he murdered the president he had ordered to go there earlier,
...it would be consistent with the timing.
In short, there's a high probability
that both murders were committed by the same perpetrator.
Môri-kun, about the perpetrator's physique....
Height about 170 cm,
well-built, slim figure.
From the height, we can hardly conclude the gender.
Come to think of it, the murdered principal Takae...
was about the same height.
- Tsujimoto-san, is this the one...? - Yes.
This jacket was given to all the guests as a souvenir.
I'm sure an employee can get it
I'm sure it's something an employee could easily get.
Shiratori-kun, as for the motif...
Hate is undoubtedly the driving factor.
After all, the wallet and jewels were not touched.
Obviously, the lock was not forced.
Either the victim herself let the perpetrator in...
or the perpetrator used a central key to get in.
Misaki-san, who all has a central key?
Oh, there are quite a few.
Of course, me, the security guards,
Her guardian, Natsuho-kun...
and all the cabin crew who belong to the head class.
- I see. - Superintendent,
the perpetrator wanted to meet the victim alone.
In that case
he must have known about the victim's daily schedule.
Tsujimoto-san,
you, as an assistant, are in charge of the daily schedule?
Yes.
Who else knew the daily schedule?
I informed the chief steward Misaki-san,
no one else.
In other words:
If you were 10 cm taller
or if Misaki-san were 10 kg lighter,
you would be our prime suspects.
One more thing. The question of whether or not the incident with Sonoko-kun...
is related to the two cases or not.
I must say, you're walking past the possible perpetrator...
...and you don't see his face.
Yes, it's embarrassing.
But Commissioner!
We are in the middle of the sea.
The culprit is undoubtedly on this ship.
Crew and passengers,
So all together, we only have 600 suspects?
Anyway, Takagi-kun,
continue questioning the passengers.
Yes!
Misaki-san and Tsujimoto-san,
you tell me everything about the people on board.
Understood.

What Inspector Shiratori said is true.
How could the perpetrator know the daily schedule?
Natsuho-san said she didn't inform anyone.
That's...!
I see. Maybe if you use that...
Say, I'd like to ask the lady something!
Conan-kun?
Hey! Where did you come from all of a sudden?
Hey, where'd you come from?
Did you talk about...
Did you talk about the day's schedule in the suite last night?
Yes.
I took them both to their suite and had them confirm the plan.
Then was there a time yesterday when no one was in the suite?
Let's see,
Yesterday, President Yashiro was exhausted
and rested until dinner.
So the suite was only empty during dinner.
That's how it is.
You!
So you were eavesdropping on us earlier!
There!
Ouch!
Misaki-san, was there anyone who didn't show up for dinner?
No, everyone must have attended.
Then the culprit is a crew member?
Forgive me. I'll retire and lie down.
Tell me, did Kusaka-san ever interview you, too?
Hironari Kusaka-san? Yes, he did.
And did you miss your central key afterwards?
That's enough! As if something like that would happen!
Well, we actually noticed
actually noticed the loss of a key about three months ago.
What? Really?
And that was, just like Conan-kun said,
after the interview with Kusaka-san.
Wait a minute.
Who is he, this Kusaka-san?
He's a screenwriter, and he's interviewed us several times before.
I see.
And, Conan-kun, what makes you suspicious of him?
Kusaka-san returned to his room during dinner.
He said he was seasick.
But he must have been hiding in the suite,
to eavesdrop.
Fool!
He's not a little kid still playing hide and seek!
A bug.
He could have planted a bug in the suite afterwards.
I see.
How is it, Môri-kun? That Kusaka-san's stature?
Come to think of it, it fits pretty well.
Good. Let's talk to this Kusaka-san.
I see. A bug, then.
You really are the great detective Kogoro Môri.
Well,
this time, the ending is based on..,
...based on what Conan-kun told us.
Hey, so that's how it is.
But the conclusion is wrong.
At around 10:15.
I was in my room talking to Minako-san on the phone.
Minako-san? You mean the architect?
Yes.
My cell phone doesn't work in the open sea, so
so I used this one.
How long were you on the phone?
Um, from ten o'clock on, about 30 minutes.
The phone log should
the exact time.
And what did you talk about?
If I may ask?
I've finished my exposé and I wanted to get your opinion.
Exposé?
Yes.
It's for a drama set on a luxury liner.
Minako-san advises me on passenger ships.
CRUISING LOVE STORY SCREENPLAY: HIRONARI KUSAKA
Cruising Love Story.
I took a single room on purpose
so I could finish this work undisturbed.
But why didn't you talk to each other directly?
You are on the same ship?
Minako-san is single.
Visiting her in her room...
And there's a risk of eavesdropping at the cafe.
In my circle, it often happens that exposés are stolen.
I see.
My feeling is that Kusaka-san is innocent.
That's not certain. First we have to check his alibi.
I'm thirsty.
Then let's hurry.
What is it, Môri-san?
You must have been charmed by that woman.
Quite a beauty.
Well...
Misaki-san told me about what happened.
In fact, Kusaka-san called me at exactly 10:00.
We talked on the phone for about 30 minutes.
I gave him advice beforehand.
In the morning at tea, he said,
that he would be finished soon and would like to hear my opinion.
He would call at 10:00 and asked me,
to be in the room.
That's the way it is. Well, as soon as we check that out....
Sorry to interrupt.
This confirms Mr. Kusaka's alibi.
Yes. Unless these two are accomplices.
The room telephones are not cordless.
It's impossible to make a call and walk away at the same time.
What is it, Môri-san?
You must be thinking about Minako-san.
She's a beauty, too.
Well...
- That's all... - Tome-san!
- Commissioner Megure. - What does it look like?

We're done so far. But there was nothing revealing.
That's how it is.
Only on the floor it looks
as if someone had wiped away a reddish-brown liquid.
A reddish-brown liquid?
Tell me, Tome-san, wasn't that blood?
No, the color is similar,
but the blood test was negative.
Was that...
Inspector Megure!
I questioned all the passengers on the 6th floor and the crew..,
but no one saw anything.
I see.
The welcome party is at 5 p.m., right?
Then we'll split up and question the other passengers...
the other passengers.
Yes!
Well then, commissar,
we'll go back to headquarters with the evidence.
Yes, thank you.
Onê-san!
I was looking for you. Can I ask you something?
Sure, little detective.
What is it?
What was that phone call with Kusaka-san?
Hm, what kind of... how shall I put it?
He read out his story and I listened.
What? Just listened?
Yes. He doesn't like it at all when you interrupt him.
Just listen to me, he always says.
It's happened before.
So now I let him finish.
Then you just listened all the time,
until Kusaka-san finished?
That's right.
After about 20 minutes.
after about 20 minutes of reading, he asked me..,
what I thought of them. Good, I said.
There, done!
- Here! - Ah, thank you.
How are you feeling, Sonoko?
I'm fine, thanks.
We shouldn't have played hide and seek.
No, we shouldn't have. But tell me, when we started the game...
Victory will be ours. After all...
What were you going to say afterwards?
I used to play hide and seek in elementary school.
It was in the first grade, when the gate to the schoolyard was open.
We also asked Shin'ichi.
Shin'ichi, are you listening?
- Well, Shin'ichi! - Let's play hide and seek!
It's fun!
- Sorry, but I'll pass. - Huh?
The soccer tournament is coming up.
What a lout!
He really said that when he was a kid?
So we played hide and seek without him.
There was a storage room under the stage in the sports hall.
Yeah, there were folding chairs and stuff in there.
And on the side of the stage, by the stairs.
there was also a little room.
What? So you were in there...?
Yes. I thought that no one would find me there.
But then a teacher came and pushed the stairs back.
I couldn't get out.
Really? And then?
Everyone was looking for me, but to no avail.
I couldn't get out and didn't know what to do.
But Shin'ichi found me very quickly.
Oh...
On the way home.
I asked him how he knew where I was hiding.
"The monster of the school...
In the movie, all the kids who hid in the school building...
were eaten by the monster.
Therefore, you will not have been hiding in the building.
Wait a minute. How do you know I saw this movie?
Every time you went to see it
the movie poster at the video store.
You say you're afraid of ghosts.
but I guarantee you're going to see something like this.
So that left only the places outside the school building.
As an animal lover.
you would never hide in the animal enclosure because of the chickens.
You could have left the sports equipment shed..,
because the basketball club was cleaning up.
The swimming pool is a construction site, so the sports hall remains.
So for me, that was the only option.
Besides, you took a look behind the stairs
you took a look behind the stairs.
Impressed?
Hey, you pay a lot of attention to what I do.
Idiot. It's not like that!
You're blushing!
What nonsense! It's the evening sun.
Yeah, all right. I got it.
When you said..,
it was like back then, you meant this experience.
Your sentence reads:
Victory will be ours, after all...
Shin'ichi is the only one who can find me.
Isn't that right?
No, that's not what I meant.
What am I looking at? You're all red!
What nonsense! It's the evening sun.
What was the old man doing at Kusaka's?
Yes?
Now it's your turn.
I wanted to have a look.
Ah! Hey!
I've seen it before. The laptop is really great!
It's my work tool, after all.
CRUISING LOVE STORY
PERSONS...
This is not for kids!
Yes!
Well?
The professor has the same!
Oh, you don't hear anything.
Kid, get out!
Why should he keep the evidence?

Oh, man, now our nice trip is for nothing.
Don't say that, Genta-kun. It's a terrible crime.
Yeah, you're right.
But why do people hurt other people?
Can't they all live together peacefully?
That's impossible.
We humans have feelings.
They are invisible, change quickly and are often very annoying.
Friendship and love are not a problem.
But these can turn into jealousy and hatred
and murderous intentions.
But you know,
my parents often quarrel,
but they still get along well.
That's because they're both considerate of each other.
It's like Ai-kun says.
Through casual words and actions people can be
can be hurt and also hurt.
So that it doesn't come to that,
we must be considerate of others' feelings.
Be considerate of others' feelings?
Professor.
Can I borrow something from you?
Huh? Yes.
NISHITAMA MAIN POLICE OFFICE
The seatbelt buckle.
Chiba-kun, come here.
Yes.
Did you find anything?
Look at this!
The buckle of the seat belt...
There are burnt marks here,
as if something had been tied.
Indeed!
They are about as thick as a kite string.
A kite string...
Oops, where are you going, uncle?
Where have you been hanging out again? The party's soon!
Ah, Môri-san,
Commissioner Megure wants to see you.
The commissar?
Got it.
- Me too! - You get ready!
So there are also doubts about Hidehito Yashiro's accident.
Yes, according to Satô-san's report.
the cord that was probably attached to the belt doesn't give her any peace.
How is it, Môri-kun? Don't you have any idea?
Hmm, it's hard to say...
What else was found?
Yes.
A charred object that looked like a can..,
and some other junk were discovered,
but these items were discarded.
A juice can and a string....
If you use that...
Huh?
Well, scared?
You rascal!
Actually, I was going to shake
and let it squirt,
but they didn't have Coke.
A Coke?
Phew, I thought my heart was going to stop....
Aah! Can and fright....
A stun grenade!
Could the perpetrator have used a stun grenade?
Now you've got it.
What is this, Shiratori-kun, this stun grenade...?
A stun grenade! Also called a flashbang.
Intense flashing light and an explosive bang will paralyze the victim.
It has the shape of a can and belongs to the hand grenades.
For example, if you
pull the pin of the grenade, secure it with a string
and attach the string to the safety belt buckle,
then the moment you put the seatbelt on...
I see.
Even without a heart attack
you'll be unconscious and unfit to drive,
so that the car can plummet down the hill.
But can you get a stun grenade that easily?
No,
In today's world, you can get to anything if you want to.
Yes, and if one
if you just wanted to scare the other guy,
a real grenade wouldn't be necessary.
A loud banger would have done as well.
Inspector, the news just came in:
Body found. Could be Yashiro.
Captain, I have a request.
What is it?
I'd like to ask you to cancel the welcome party
at 5:00 p.m.
If the culprit is planning another crime,
he'll probably use the party as an opportunity to do so.
But that's...
Please, Captain!
But commissioner,
let's hold the party.
Because everything will be cleared up at the party.
Môri-kun, did you...?
Did you have your epiphany again?
But he's not asleep.
Can you handle it, dude?
Let's go! Let's have some fun!
I've got half a day of catching up to do!
Really, Sonoko.
Should we ask Ran-onêsan...
We should ask her!
You're right.
What? A gold medal made of shells?
The string was too short and it just became a bracelet.
You really didn't notice?
That's too bad.
I'm sorry. I'll check later.
Thank you very much.
Your feelings make me very happy.
Dear guests, I welcome you to the Aphrodite!
My name is Natsuho Tsujimoto, and I'm your host for this evening.
through this party.
Thank you very much.
First, I would like to introduce you to our main crew.

First our chief steward Naoya Misaki.
Then our ship's doctor Doctor Mizukubô.
Our chef Katsuhiko Shiomi.
- Do you know the culprit? - Yes, but
I don't have definitive proof yet.
And last but not least:
our captain, Wataru Kaidô!
Before I welcome you,
I would like to introduce the ship's designer:
It's Minako Akiyoshi-san!
Captain. Is it true that Director Takae was murdered?
And that President Yashiro has disappeared?
Well...
You're policemen. Did you catch the culprit?
Why are you standing around at the party?
Calm down! Please calm down.
What's going on?
Ah, well... M... Môri-san? Oops?
Môri-san?
Please calm down.
WELCOME PARTY
Your worries are unnecessary.
I, Kogoro Môri, have long since identified the criminal..,
the criminal who committed the serial murders!
Now the master detective is speaking!
He murdered Director Takae Yashiro...
and also President Entarô Yashiro.
The culprit
is you, Minako Akiyoshi-san.
The motive for the murder is revenge
for Hidehito Yashiro, who died in a traffic accident two weeks ago.
in a traffic accident two weeks ago.
This accident was in reality
a murder planned by Entarô Yashiro and his daughter.
But why would Akiyoshi-san want to avenge Yashiro-san?
Probably because
Minako-san was Hidehito-san's mistress.
Wait a minute, Môri-san!
I have indeed respected Yashiro-sensei
as a great superior.
But I wasn't having an affair!
And at the time of the crime, I was in my room
talking to Kusaka-san on the phone. I have an alibi!
That's true.
But the fact is that for about 20 minutes
Kusaka-san read his script...
and you didn't say a word.
In short, you don't have an alibi for that time.
Now, that's enough!
If Kusaka-san had asked me something in between,
he would have noticed my absence!
I wouldn't be so stupid as to invent such a weak alibi.
You want to claim that I am the culprit?
Then show me your evidence!
Hey, Môri-kun. You do have proof, don't you?
Well... geez...
Dad wouldn't suspect Minako-san...
...just because she looks like Mom, right?
What's wrong, Môri-san?
V... Sorry, time out for toilet.
A... Time out?
That's it!
Commissioner, as long as everyone's laughing, we should do something.
- Yes, but what? - Don't worry, Commissioner Megure.
The real culprit is known.
Is that true, Professor Agasa?
- Hurray! - The Professor is showing what he can do!
Do you all know
the real reason for a cruise?
It was piracy!
The pirates have
cruised the sea in pursuit of booty.
And on this ship, there is also a pirate.
Not one who wants money,
but a pirate named Murderer, who takes your life.
This pirate is the screenwriter
the screenwriter Hironari Kusaka-san!
You're talking nonsense!
Didn't you hear what Minako-san said?
At the time of the crime, I was on the phone...
I was reading my story to Minako-san.
By story, do you mean this one?
Nanami Okazaki loves the sea.
Maybe because she lived by the sea since she was born.
She especially loves the vastness of the sea.
It's a simple trick.
You had recorded your story on tape
and played it back on the phone.
Meanwhile, you murdered them both.
That's absurd! I erased it!
Erased? That's what you thought.
But in fact it wasn't.
Something so important should be
otherwise it can be fatal.
Inventing evidence.
You did
you discussed the tape with his voice?
Yes, I did.
But there is another definitive proof.
But that doesn't prove
that I'm the killer.
There is one proof. There!
What's wrong, Oni-san?
There are black spots in your red hair.
Could it be blood?
Blood?
But Kusaka-san...
I see.
You did look in the mirror after the crime,
but because of the color of your hair.
you didn't notice the fresh blood.
But you should remember that.
Blood coagulates with time
and changes its color.
While we're at it, could you remove your bandana, please?
If I'm right,
there should be bruising,
scratch marks, or fingerprints
of the president resisting your attack.

Excuse me.
Kusaka-san,
you can tell us more about it somewhere else.
Please wait. Really... I still have...
this trump card left!
Nobody moves! Or the bomb will go off!
A bomb?
The ship will sink if you don't obey!
It was him! He attacked me!
Ha! Finally you remember.
Please calm down! Why are you doing this?
To avenge father!
Revenge?
The crew member who died 15 years ago
in the Yashiro accident 15 years ago...
was my father!
Yeah right.
The photo!
Two years ago
I heard a strange rumor from one of my father's comrades
a strange rumor about this accident.
At that time
Entarô and Takae were leading the Yashiro merchant fleet.
A freighter was to be sunk for insurance money.
and Captain Okita, who was fighting for better working conditions,
who was fighting for better working conditions.
The first officer Kaidô was brought in.
They got on board,
gave Captain Okita coffee with sleeping pills
and drove the ship into an iceberg.
At the same time
You let your bomb explode.
The place where the bomb was to be placed..,
was probably calculated by Hidehito Yashiro.
What? The sensei has...?
How did you kill President Yashiro?
The guy was sitting astride me and squeezing my neck.
So I threw him into the sea with an overhead throw.
And just like you, I wanted to blow up the ship...
and then kill you in the general chaos.
A wild fantasy.
Wait! First, let go of the remote control button.
Shut up! Don't come any closer!
He's gone!
You can't escape!
Conan-kun!
Get after him!
APHRODITE TOKYO
Damn it!
Wait! Conan-kun!
Please wait!
Hey, you!
- We're coming with you! - Don't be a hero by yourself.
Haibara!
Well, that's how it looks.
Hold on tight!
Everyone to the left!
To the right!
Overtake!
Haibara, take the wheel!
Conan-kun!
Did you do it, Conan?
Hurray!
A big victory for the Detective Boys!
- Yippee! - Hooray!
Hey! Kids!
Hey!
You all right?
Hey!
What do you think you're doing?
He's a suspect in a murder case!
What if something had happened?
Excuse me.
Ko... Commissioner Megure...
How many bombs did you plant?
So? Izawa-kun?
Captain! The explosion tore holes in the ship's
The explosion tore holes in the ship's hull!
Water doors?
Closed.
But the water's leaking from the 3rd to the 4th block.
What?
Captain! The evacuation order.
...heavy smoke...
Captain!
Evacuate all hands.
Passengers, this is the First Officer.
Please put on your life jackets
and proceed to the boat deck.
This is not a drill.
I repeat.
This is not a drill.
Please remain calm.
Each of the crew has to take the passengers to the boat deck.
She's not here. The children's gold medal...
I can't find it.
Ran...
Come on, let's go! Hurry up!
Ran, come on!
Yes...
Please don't push.
We still have plenty of time.
Go on without pushing.
Dad, where are the kids?
They're safe.
According to Commissioner Megure's report.
they were chasing Kusaka in a motorboat.
A cruiser nearby picked them up.
All right, then.
Ran! You two will be fine in this boat.
I'll take another one.
- But, uh... - I'll see you later.
Pops!
Don't push and stay in line.
If you come in contact with water, get off the ship immediately!
If you get caught in the whirlpool of the ship, it's over.
Roger that.
It's oppressively hot in here.
In a situation like this, you should take it.
That's easy for you to say. When it's hot, it's hot.
Exactly!
Huh, what?
It must be in the stash!
The medal?
I'll let you down now. Please hold on.
- Ah, I'm getting off. - What?
But Ran!
- I'll get it quickly. You go first. - But...
It's just a medal made of shells..,
but it's a precious treasure to me.
- See you later. - Hey, Ran!
I got it! That's it!
Boy, were we lucky,
that boat was nearby.
Are the people on the boat okay?
I'm worried about them.
Don't worry. She'll be safe with a lifeboat....
Although Kusaka said
he wanted to kill Kaido-san in the general chaos,

but wouldn't fewer bombs have sufficed?
As if he had intended to sink the ship.
Also the trick
with the alibi seems too easy in retrospect.
If Minako-san had asked him a question..,
...he would have been found out.
I'm sure he tested it many times.
He convinced himself that she was just listening obediently on the phone,
so he thought it was a good alibi.
In fact, she did...
He doesn't like being interrupted at all.
Commissioner Megure!
The message just came in from the Coast Guard.
There must have been a fruit knife...
- There must have been a fruit knife in the back of the body. - What?
What does that mean? Kusaka didn't say anything about a knife.
It was 10:11.
It was about 10:15.
No! It wasn't Kusaka!
Then who was it?
Hard to believe she's over 50.
Hey, Conan!
Where are you going, Conan-kun?
Conan-kun!
Something's still there.
I can't breathe freely yet.
I feel that if I don't act now, something will happen..,
...that I'll regret.
You mean the crimes?
Yes. That's
...it's possible.
Conan-kun...
The crimes?
Are you sure it's just them, Kudô-kun?
If I'm right, the real culprit is...
Captain!
The evacuation is complete.
I'll take the life raft.
Tell the crew to abandon ship.
Understood.
Don't you want to share your fate with the ship,
Captain?
What are you doing here? Get off the ship quickly!
Does this look familiar?
My father was very fond of it.
An origami ship?
Are you...?
Yes. I'm the daughter of Captain Okita..,
...whom you and the Yashiros killed 15 years ago.
I'm sorry, but I destroyed the rest of the life rafts.
What did you do?
Don't move!
It's a bit cramped here.
Let's go to a larger place surrounded by sea air...
where we can talk in peace.
It was half a year ago.
That's when Kusaka came to see me and said it was about his drama.
But he asked about the yashiros, who had nothing to do with the drama.
He was acting strangely
and when he went to the bathroom once....
THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SINKING OF THE YASHIROMARU I
The truth about the sinking of the Yashiromaru I.
That was Kusaka's true intention.
I did not want to believe it
and visited Hideto Yashiro the next day.
Over high-proof liquor, he started chattering.
That the shipwreck was not an accident,
but was in fact carefully planned.
He didn't know that I was Okita's daughter.
I... Forgive me. It was an order from the President.
Excuses are superfluous!
You will now follow the two Yashiros.
Like my father..,
...who died full of bitterness.
Damn it! I have to make it!
Please! Spare me!
Goodbye, Captain.
Don't do that!
So you are indeed the real culprit,
Minako Akiyoshi-san.
The old man!
Don't move!
I'm sorry, the gun is useless.
I found it in your room during my bathroom break.
Captain!
I will deal with you in detail later.
Akiyoshi-san, the way I see it...
Let's stop.
The three of us are going to die here anyway.
Your conclusions are meaningless
on a sinking ship.
Stop it?
Uncovering the truth is the nature of a detective.
You probably discovered
Kusaka's plan to kill four people including Hideto.
But the plan seemed unfeasible to you.
And so you killed
Hideto in front of Kusaka and made it look like
to look like a heart attack.
With the help of a homemade stun grenade.
Hideto was now dead.
Kusaka reduced his plan to three murders...
and decided to use you as an alibi.
They found out about it
and used his plan
to take revenge with your own hands.
You assembled your own bombs in advance.
You designed the ship.
You know the places where the consequences will be fatal.
Finally, today at 10:00 a.m..
you got Kusaka's call.
When he started reading aloud, you left your room.
You drugged Director Takae in the bathroom..,
put on her bathrobe and impersonated her.
Kusaka, who then entered the room,
mistook her in the robe for Director Takae.
They pretended to fight over the knife and then stabbed it into the blood.
and then stabbed it into the blood bag in front of her stomach.
After Kusaka fled, thinking he had completed his work,
you killed Director Takae.

Then you wiped away the fake blood,
and left the room in the windbreaker.
I thought
the person had turned away
to hide his face.
But later it occurred to me
that it could be a woman
who unconsciously wanted to protect her breast.
I see.
Hence this behavior...
They then went downstairs to the marina.
There sat just
the president sat astride Kusaka and squeezed his neck.
They quickly ran to the two,
took the legs...
The legs?
Yes,
they sneaked up behind them
and stabbed them with the knife.
That's right. They stabbed him in the back with the knife.
Since you immediately stole away afterwards,
Kusaka thought he had overpowered him alone.
Everything went as you wanted.
You really are the master detective Kogoro Môri.
When I learned that you would be on board..,
I decided to take advantage of the man.
To fool a master,
I needed a false culprit.
And one who really thinks he committed the murders.
One more thing. This man criticized my father,
saying it wasn't proper to share his fate with the ship.
Insulting my father is unforgivable.
You cannot be forgiven.
You have not only snuffed out three lives,
but you have endangered many innocent people.
You let your self-designed ship sink!
I have simulated this accurately several times!
The number of bombs. Incoming water volume.
The evacuation time.
And this is the result:
The man who is squeezing around there should be at sea
be tormented by loneliness and despair like my father.
Besides
Aphrodite is a goddess created from foam.
She only returns again.
But now that you know everything, I have no choice.
I turn myself in voluntarily.
I don't fight women on principle.
Isn't that discrimination?
Dude!
So? Are you deviating from your principles now?
Useless fights are not my cup of tea either.
The three of us are going to die here anyway.
But only because you interrupted my revenge!
That boy...
- Shin'ichi... - Huh?
Ah, nothing.
Shall I finish slowly?
Kogoro Môri-san.
A master detective in such a state.
No one wants to see that.
That's my business.
Uncle!
I'm not lucky.
That the master detective had me in his sights from the start...
I must be a lot like some woman he hated.
It's the other way around.
Because you look like her,
I hoped that you were not the culprit...
and I was looking for proof of your innocence.
That's why it turned out this way.
Oh...
Uncle!
Are you okay, uncle?
You combined great, dude!
What are you doing here?
Never mind. Let's get out of here!
Get...?
No way!
All the lifeboats are gone
and the life rafts have been destroyed by that woman.
Hey, hey!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
We are saved.
How does it feel?
The case is solved.
What is it?
This uneasy and unclear feeling inside me?
It's going to sink soon. Hurry!
Hey, you next! Hurry up!
What are you hesitating for? Come on, get in!
Hey, what about Ran-nichan?
What? Ran is in one of the lifeboats right now.
Isn't Ran with you?
What do you mean?
She ran to her hiding place to get her gold medal.
I thought she was with you!
That's it!
Hey! Wait!
Hey!
Where's Ran?
Hey!
Help!
Help, is anyone there?
Hi Ran, I knew you were here.
Shin'ichi. You'll find me, won't you?
Shin'ichi.
Hey! Where's Ran?
She knew I was here playing with the ball.
That means...
Up there!
I'll find you! I'll definitely find you!
Be patient, Ran!
Hey! Where in the world is Ran?
Stay cool. I have to be cool and think.
I found her pretty fast back then, didn't I?
That reminds me...
How did you know where I was hiding?
You were so busy playing soccer.
Conan-kun, you were just playing with the soccer ball.
That's what I heard.
I see. Then, just like now...
Uncle!
Isn't there a place to hide in the ground?
Here's something!
Damn it, it won't open!
Uncle!
Open!
Ran! Are you in there?
Dad...

- There she is! - We have to hurry, Uncle!
Damn!
Not good, not good at all!
We have to turn the boat around or they'll drown!
I'm sorry, but we can't.
There's too much danger of being caught in the whirlpool!
It can't be...
The Coast Guard helicopter!
Hooray!
A helicopter!
- Oh no! - Quick, to the bow of the ship!
Hello! Here we are!
Hello!
COAST GUARD
- Are you the last ones? - Yes!
Boy. Be patient a little longer! We'll save you in a minute!
Yes!
- Are you okay? Hold on tight! - Yes!
We'll pull you up now.
Give the girl a big assist.
Got it.
W... what is it?
Hold on!
Damn it!
Hold on tight, Conan-kun!
Ran! Are you okay?
Son,
Hold out your hand!
Hora, kyô mo kaze ga hashiru.
Look, the wind is running today too.
The light passes through the waves.
Hikari ga nami o tsukinuke.
When you stretch out your hand vigorously,
Sono te o gutto nobashitara,
it reaches the sky, or so it seemed to me.
sora ni todoku ki ga shita.
I see a side of you that is unknown to me,
Jibun no shiranai kimi o
mite, isshun kowakunaru.
for a moment it scares me.
That's how much I love you,
Konna ni mo kimi ga suki de,
kotoba ga modokashii.
that words are not fast enough.
Just as the sail awaits summer,
Natsu o matsu sail no yô ni
kimi no koto o zutto
I think all the time,
zutto zutto omotte iru yo.
all the, all the time thinking of you.
In the distance of the sun I have though
Taiyô no kanata ippai
shippai bakari shita kedo,
I made nothing but mistakes,
I often bounced back, but now
hanpatsu shiattari demo ima wa
I turn to one direction.
hitotsu ni mukatte iru yo,
soko ni wa yume ga aru kara.
Because that is where my dream is.
"Sorry."
"Gomen ne" no kotoba bakari
I don't want to say this word all the time,
iu no wa iya dakara,
kimi ni wa "arigatô"
so I want to say the word "thank you
no kotoba o motto takusan iitai yo.
more and more to you.
We understood each other. But also to you
Wakariaeteta kimi to mo
itsuka ondosa ga atta ne.
there was a difference in temperature at some point.
Still it is painful
Soredemo kurushii no wa
ittoki dake da mon ne.
only for a short time, isn't it?
Just as the sail awaits the summer,
Natsu o matsu sail no yô ni
I want you all the time,
kimi no koto o zutto
the whole, whole time in my arms.
zutto zutto dakishimete itai.
I just want to my own feelings
Tada jibun no kimochi ni
mashôjiki de itai kedo,
to be completely honest,
but that's also how you can hurt people.
sore de hito o kizutsukeru koto mo aru ne.
One direction I turn to.
Hitotsu ni mukatte iru yo.
Because that is where you are.
Soko ni wa kimi ga iru kara.
Just as the sail awaits the summer,

One direction I turn toward.

- We will be there soon. - Thank you.
Your parents' boat is nearby.
Then you were convinced that she was the killer..,
because Kusaka's alibi was too simple?
Yes. He could only get away with that cheap alibi..,
was because Minako-san
intended to use his alibi for her own benefit.
Besides, only she could pretend to be Director Takae,
because she also had slender legs.
I see.
But amazing how you found Ran's hiding place.
Well, that was because...
That might have been a shock!
I had been playing soccer with a volleyball,
but Ran-nêchan said "soccer".
Therefore
I thought she must be somewhere where she could hear me.
Kind of a shame, though.
Of course I'm glad you saved me,
But I thought only Kudô-kun...
would be able to find you and save you.
What saved me was...
Ran-onêsan!
We fixed your gold medal!
And we made the string longer to fit around your neck.
I'll put it around your neck.
You're welcome.
Thank you.

- It looks really good on you. - Yeah.
I cherish it.
What saved me..,
that the three of them
showed their sympathy.
