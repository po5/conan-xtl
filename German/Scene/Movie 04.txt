Look,
there are dinosaurs!
Huh?
Man.
He's always gone in a flash.
Here, you must be thirsty.
Thanks.
Oh dear, it's three minutes early!
Hey, Shin'ichi!
Okay. We made it!
So what?
The space is only big.
You'll see.
Ten,
nine, eight,
seven,
six,
five,
four,
three,
two,
one!
What?
Fountains come every two hours.
You like that kind of thing.
Shin'ichi.
Well,
this is my gift to you for winning the karate tournament.
So be grateful!
Don't be so smug!
- A rainbow! - Come on,
let's toast!
Oh dear.
How funny!
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE KILLER IN YOUR EYES
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
HIS NAME IS SHIN'ICHI KUDÔ
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on what was happening
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He administered a poison to me
and when I came to,
my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive,
my life
and that of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised
not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked my name,
I said Conan Edogawa.
CONAN DOYLE RANPO EDOGAWA
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
Master Detective Môri, what was the kicker?
Well, I don't really remember.
No wonder. To wit
ANESTHESIA CHRONOMETER
I put him to sleep with anesthesia
VOICE TRANSPOSER
and can then use the voice transposer
with his voice to solve the case.
Both devices are
inventions of Professor Agasa.
Hello!
He also has
the skateboard with turbo drive,
the radar goggles and
the power kick-boots
as well as other unique devices.
By the way, Ran and the old man
Ran and the old man know nothing of my true identity.
Only Professor Agasa knows,
the high school detective Heiji Hattori...
and my classmate Ai Haibara.
She was one of the men in black,
but drank to escape,
she drank the same poison that was given to me
and shrank as well.
Who these men are is still unsolved.
And now
a thick
wall is about to rise between Ran
and me.
I am small, my mind is not!
Iöse each case!
There is always only one truth!
- Fountains? - Yes,
the rainbow that appeared was beautiful!
Yes, it was.
I can't believe she remembers something so insignificant!
Let's go to Tropical Land again!
After all, we haven't been there together once since then.
How could we? I've been just a little boy since that day.
Say, when are we going?
Um, well...
- Will Conan-kun be there? - Well, we'll see.
He just has to be there.
Sorry, Ran,
I'm still on a case.
I'll call back.
Take care.
Ah, hey, Shin'ichi!
Man...
Cases, cases, cases!
You idiotic cases!!!
Even Conan-kun won't be able to figure that out!
I want to quickly see his perplexed face.
Conan-kun and clueless.
I'm at a loss. I have to give up.
SIEG
What are you three laughing at?
- Conan-kun! - You're just in time.
We were just about to go to your house.
The three of us came up with a really great riddle.
A riddle?
Ready? When we asked Haibara-san what she thought about you, she replied
looking at the moon: He is like summer.
Haibara-san praised you
(a) praised you or
(b) criticized you?
Which is right?
Like the summer...
Moon...
I got it! The answer is b!
Huh?
And why?
The summer months
ARE LIKE THE SUMMER.
are the sixth, seventh and eighth month.
JUNE = ROKU (SIX), JULY - NA (SEVEN) AUGUST = YATSU (EIGHT)
Roku-na-yatsu is a good-for-nothing.
Great! As was to be expected from you!
This is boring.
You'd better tell me what you were laughing about.
Will you look perplexed for us then?
- Oh, let's run for it! - Hey!
Hold it right there!
The flashing green corresponds to the yellow.
Wait for it to turn green again.
Yes.
- That was trouble. - No wonder.
After all, the man is right.
Now I'll ask a question.
What do you think? What is the man's
has the man?

I wonder if he's a school teacher.
He lacks the briefcase for a businessman.
Eel restaurant owner?
The answer is: policeman!
E... a policeman?
If a policeman makes a note,
they take their notebook across
to write horizontally.
Oh, that's right.
Great, Conan-kun!
OSAMU NARASAWA (48), CRIMINAL INVESTIGATOR
You know your way around everything!
It's green! Let's go.
Shots fired! There's the perpetrator!
- You're not leaving! - Conan-kun. Be careful!
Call an ambulance!
Got it!
Damn it!
He got away!
Hang in there!
Who did it?
What?
At about 2:00 p.m. today, at the Beika Park intersection...
Police Sergeant Osamu Narasawa was shot dead.
The perpetrator is on the run.
The manhunt is being conducted by the Beika Police...
led by the Beika police.
BEIKA POLICE HEADQUARTERS
Sorry to ask again, but tell us something
about the perpetrator.
It was a young man.
No, it was a beautiful young woman.
No, it was a middle-aged man.
And what did his umbrella look like?
It was black.
It was green, green!
I thought it was blue...
Did you really see him?
What about you, Conan-kun?
The raincoat and umbrella were grayish, but I couldn't tell...
...but I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman.
He was holding the umbrella in his right hand.
That means..,
...he was shooting with his left hand.
So the perpetrator is left-handed.
By the way, Inspector,
do you know why Narasawa grabbed his chest before he died?
Well..,
...we think he was pointing to the notebook in his breast pocket...
in his breast pocket.
We are in the process of thoroughly examining...
from that notebook.
Inspector Megure,
judging from the bullet casing
it is a 9 mm automatic.
A 9 mm, that is.
It's a common weapon that women also use.
Fortunately, you didn't get involved in the case.
You too, Conan-kun.
Yes.
Damn.
Just because the light was red,
I let him get away!
YÔICHIRÔ SHIBA, POLICE OFFICER
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
ANOTHER POLICEMAN... IN THE PARKING LOT...
CRIME OF A RADICAL WING?
THE POLICE ARE CHALLENGED!
CAPITAL POLICE DEPARTMENT
INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT, 1ST SECTOR
Megure here. Ah, you Môri-kun.
Inspector,
Can you tell me more about the case last night?
I'm sorry, sir. I don't have time.
Some other time.
What?
Hello? Inspector!
What is it?
He doesn't have time, he says.
That's logical.
After all, two policemen died.
But still...
There was something different about the inspector.
Listen, Shiratori-kun.
This case has to stay between us.
Don't tell anyone about this.
Got it.
The type of bullets used in the two murders,
CRIMINAL POLICE, OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR
CRIMINAL POLICE, OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR - Agreed....
TOSHIRO ODAGIRI (56), POLICE SUPERINTENDENT.
The following is the weather report.
BEIKA SUN PLAZA HOTEL
For real.
Shiratori's sister has an unfavorable day
KÔTARÔ HARETSUKI, SARA SHIRATORI WEDDING PARTY - 15TH FLOOR
WEDDING PARTY: 15th FLOOR - Chosen for their wedding announcement.
It's just the way it is. The ceremony
was scheduled a month ago.
And it's not her fault what happened.
Besides, it's not a wedding announcement,
It's a wedding party.
The organizers are friends of the bride and groom.
I know that!
Tell me, what's her groom Haretsuki-san like?
I heard he's a painter.
Probably one who doesn't sell.
So he's a painter without a living.
I can't expect much from his friends.
ASAKURA... MÔRI KOGO...
You still have a rough handwriting.
Mother!
So you were invited, too.
Yes, since Sara-san is an aspiring lawyer.
In that context.
ERI KISAKI
Oh, what a beautiful handwriting!
Are married and registering separately!
This one please.
That'll be number 87.
We're leaving, Conan-kun!
J... Yes.
It's amazing how many people are here!
Oh, even the inspector came.
You can tell it's the police right away!
They look angry
and depress the mood.
No wonder.
They are certainly not in a party mood because of the incidents.
But Inspector Satô is always cheerful.
So? At least the dress is nice, right?
Wha... what are you talking about?

It looks great on you!
Ah, there's Odagiri-san!
I'll go say hello.
- Who is he? - Superintendent Odagiri.
He was head of the department
when that bungler was a cop,
Now he's the head of the department.
Ladies and gentlemen!
The entrance of the bride and groom!
Let's have a great round of applause!
Wonderful!
Kôtaro, Sara-san, congratulations!
Môri-san.
Jo,
- congratulations! - Thank you very much.
Let me introduce you.
This is Dr. Kazato,
my psychiatrist who works at Beika Yakushino Hospital.
KYÔSUKE KAZATO (36), PSYCHIATRIST AT BEIKA YAKUSHINO HOSPITAL.
Kazato. Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you. Môri.
My wife Eri, our daughter Ran,
and our freeloader, Conan.
Stop with the "freeloader"!
But Shiratori-san,
a psychiatrist?
Well,
in the administrative post, you have a lot of worries.
Besides, I thought
it would be good if you had a check-up, too.
That's true.
Lately, my memory...
Hey! What's that supposed to mean?
And you laugh too much!
- Ouch. - Excuse me a moment.
Inspector!
Oh, Môri-kun.
How's the investigation going?
Sorry, I don't talk about that.
Huh? Why won't he tell me?
I'm sure he can't tell you.
Hey!
- Is that so, Takagi? - No, not really...
Say, Takagi-san, you're in love with Inspector Satô, aren't you?
Oh, that's interesting.
I should tell her about your feelings.
Bi... please wait!
I understand.
We didn't tell the press.
Inspector Shiba was clutching his police book...
was clutching his police book.
What?
That means...
No need to ponder, Môri-san!
Need not to know.
Well, do you understand now?
Need not to know.
Something you don't need to know?
What a stupid thing to say!
Need not to know...
It's a saying the cops use.
Are you saying the killer...
is to be found in police circles?
That it's not an ordinary officer,
but someone higher up?
Or that
that the whole police force is involved?
Then there was no marriage proposal at all?
No,
he's not into that kind of thing.
It's better when men are like that.
There are no decent men
there are no decent men.
I've always wanted to ask you that.
What words did Pop use to propose to you?
I told you, it was nonsensical sweet talk.
Sensei, please tell us!
I don't remember exactly anyway.
Don't play ignorant!
As future advice, please!
Don't keep us in suspense, mother!
Hmm...
"I love you very much.
More than anyone on this earth," I think it was.
Ahchoo!
Isn't it?!
That has a nice ring to it!
"If Shin'ichi
would say that to me"...
Stop making such a face!
I'm not making that face!
What's wrong, Ran-neechan?
You're blushing.
It's nothing.
What are you doing here?
This is no place for someone like you!
You must be
TOSHIYA ODAGIRI, ROCK SINGER
not invited either.
Shut up!
I happen to have business in this hotel!
This is his son Toshiya-san.
I think he's active in a rock band.
Let him be, Superintendent.
- Toshiya-kun, welcome. - Get lost!
Stop acting like a street dog!
- What was that? - Toshiya-san!
I'm out of here!
Toshiya-kun!
Oops...
I know her from somewhere, don't I?
Satô-kun,
about that thing.
I don't need anything.
But, uh...
- Don't worry. - Hey!
- The 38, please. - Yes.
Hello, Ran-chan!
Inspector Satô!
Strange party, isn't it?
With all those policemen?
Don't mention it.
But please take good care of yourself.
After all, cops are getting shot these days.
Don't worry, I'm tough.
Oops...
Power failure?
I wonder what happened.
That's weird.
I'll go see.
You stay here!
Inspector Satô! Here's a flashlight!
Look.
Don't! Ran-san!
Ms. Satô!!
Satô-san?
Satô-san! Come on...
Because I...
Because I have the flashlight...
Ran!
Satô-san!
Hey, Ran! How are you doing?
Ran-nêchan's just unconscious!
Critical is...
Satô-san!
Satô-san! Hang in there!
D... that's...!
Megure! Get an ambulance!

Shiratori!
- Have all the exits of the hotel blocked! - Yes!
Hello?
We're at the Beika Sun Plaza Hotel.
A woman's been shot.
Get an ambulance!
Magazine's empty.
A 9 mm automatic.
Same perp!
But where
the flashlight?
Hurry up!
Block off all access points!
Check everyone but children for powder burns!
No exceptions!
Including me and every policeman!
Of course
including this idiot here!
He's still here.
But
the other two are not in sight.
BEIKA-YAKUSHINO HOSPITAL
OPERATION!
Inspector Megure, what is Satô-san's condition?
A bullet is lodged near the heart.
The chance of survival
is 50%.
Inspector, what about Ran?
She has no external injuries,
...but she's still unconscious.
Her room is back there.
Ran is probably fine.
It's just that flashlight that worries me.
Could it be...?
Shiratori-kun, how did the investigation go?
We checked everyone for traces of powder..,
-...but to no avail. - Unsuccessful?
We think the perpetrator got away...
...before the perpetrator got away.
Fingerprints on the weapon?
Also negative.
Chiba-kun,
Did you find the switch mechanism?
Yes,
POLICE OFFICER CHIBA
Apparently the explosion was triggered by a call from a cell phone.
There's still one thing that puzzles me.
The flashlight that was lying on the ground...
Did Satô-san have it with him before?
I don't think so!
The cabinet under the sink was open.
It was probably lying there.
It was already turned on.
What?
- The perpetrator...? - I see.
As long as the light is on, she goes unnoticed.
That makes it pretty certain that this case
is connected to the other case.
With "the other case"?
Oh, nothing.
Why don't you tell me?
One little mistake
and Ran could have been shot!
Inspector!
It's bad! Ran is...!
What's wrong with Ran?
She's awake,
but she's weird!
What?
Ran-nêchan!
Are you okay?
Ran-nêchan?
Boy, who are you?
H... Hey...
Not only does she
not only can't she remember us,
she can't remember her name either.
It can't be!
I am your father, Kogoro Môri!
This is your mother, Eri Kisaki!
I don't know anything.
I don't remember.
Ran.
Kazato-sensei.
I'm sorry to bother you.
There was no psychiatrist on duty, so...
Do you know who you are?
Do you remember...
what happened today?
No.
The capital of the United States is?
Washington...
How much is five times eight?
40.
Please show me
how to use this.
COUNSELING ROOM FOUR
Retrograde amnesia?
Yes.
Due to illness or injury
you forget things that happened before.
Memory Impairment.
However, in the case of your daughter
...it was triggered by a psychological shock.
She saw the inspector being shot down!
Will my daughter regain her memory?
It's too early to say.
But
her knowledge of everyday life..,
seems to be undamaged.
That means she can lead a normal life?
Yes.
However, we should keep her
for a few days for observation.
However...
Of course Ran is shocked when she sees..,
when she sees a friend being shot at.
But there must be another reason
there must be another reason.
Something,
that shook Ran to the core?
They finished Satô-san's operation.
The bullet was somehow removed,
but it's unclear whether Satô-san will pull through.
That's how it is.
Inspector!
And you still won't tell me anything?
Shiratori!
You know all about it, don't you? Tell me!
We're definitely going to arrest the culprit.
Damn it!
Inspector Chiba,
Did you check the fingerprints on the flashlight?
Yes,
but we only found Ran's fingerprints.
We just assumed..,
that Satô-san took the flashlight,
but it seems to have been Ran-san.
Then Ran must have thought
that Satô-san was gunned down through her fault.
So that's what shocked her so much?
That's why Ran-kun lost her memory!
Ran...
Even if your memory
I'll be your friend for the rest of my life.
I'll be your friend.
I'll tell you everything.
But Inspector Megure! That's...
What the hell?

If I get fired, I'll
I'll open a detective agency like Môri-kun.
Inspector...
Takagi-kun, you stay with Satô-kun!
Chiba-kun, you stay with Ran-kun!
If anything happens, let me know right away!
Yes, sir!
Last summer...
...the body of Dr. Tamotsu Jinno...
Dr. Tamotsu Jinno of
TAMOTSU JINNO (35), DOCTOR AT TÔTO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, SURGERY 1
in his private apartment.
The investigation was led
my senior tomonari,
INSPECTOR TOMONARI
who, like me, belonged to the First Criminal Investigation Division of the police headquarters.
POLICE OFFICER NARASAWA POLICE OFFICER SHIBA
He was in charge of Narasawa and Shiba, the two policemen who were shot.
POLICE OFFICER SATÔ
as well as Satô-kun!
Dr. Jinno had drunk quite a lot
and cut his carotid artery
his carotid artery with his scalpel!
Cause of death: blood loss.
He was found
by his sister Tamaki-san, a journalist,
TAMAKI JINNO (27), YOUNGER SISTER OF TAMOTSU JINNO
who lives nearby.
Uncle! That woman!
At the party in the hotel!
Now I know!
That woman came to see me once!
What? She came to your office?
And? What did she want from you?
Well, I was pretty drunk at the time...
and I don't remember what she said at all.
I remember the cases with that Jinno guy.
A few days before his death
a family accused him of a surgical error.
Right.
On his word processor
we found a letter in which he apologized for it.
Therefore, Commissioner Tomonari decided that it was a suicide.
However,
his sister Tamaki-san rejected the suicide.
Her brother would be a bad doctor who did not care about the patients.
He would never apologize and
commit suicide.
Furthermore, she claims to have seen
Tamotsu-san a week earlier,
in front of a warehouse with a young man
with a young man with purple hair.
Purple hair?
To be sure,
Inspector Tomonari
went to the warehouse with Satô, Narasawa and Shiba.
It was extremely hot that day,
it was said to be over 35° C.
It's locked!
All right, we'll keep watch.
Shiba-kun, you go there!
Yes!
What kind of heat?!
What's wrong with you?
- Superintendent? - He's having a heart attack!
- An ambulance! - Yes!
No!
We're on a stakeout right now.
But, uh...
Don't worry.
I'll take a cab and go to the hospital.
The stakeout
will continue!
But when the worried Satô-kun went to check on him a little later...
Commissioner Tomonari!
Satô-kun immediately took Commissioner Tomonari to the
Tôto University Hospital
to Tôto University Hospital,
but
Inspector Tomonari breathed his last during the
his life during the operation.
Satô-san is late.
- Hm. - Ah! There they are!
Oh, man,
It's so hot today!
- Shall we go? - Wait!
Don't you know who that man is?
Huh?
That's Superintendent Odagiri's son, Toshiya-san!
After all,
also due to the death of the superintendent,
Tamotsu Jinno's death was declared a suicide...
and the investigation was closed.
The sister, Tamaki-san,
had the man investigated.
But Shiba-san told her that he had no connection to the case.
So something like that happened....
By the way, Inspector Tomonari
left behind a son named Makoto.
Ah! That man!
He was in the banquet hall!
But only for a moment.
What about the man?
Well,
it was at the wake.
Why
wasn't an ambulance called?
If you had,
my father could have been saved!
Well,
the inspector wanted...
You three killed my father!
I won't forgive you for that!
Here, Conan-kun.
Thank you, sir.
Shortly after that...
Narasawa and Shiba returned to their office.
Shiratori-kun noticed, however,
...that Satô-kun had been making inquiries...
Satô-kun had been doing some research outside of their duty hours.
At the request of Narasawa-san, they
with Shiba-san, the three of them
reopened the case a year ago.
However
Satô-san was not told about the connection
between Toshiya-kun and Dr. Jinno.
Police officer Narasawa was
shot dead shortly after.
After Officer Shiba was also shot,
we concluded that both murders were connected to the Jinno case.
with the Jinno case.
The police notebook in question
told us that the perpetrator was related to the police.

Makoto Tomonari,
son of a police officer, was killed by Takagi-san,
Toshiya-kun, son of the superintendent,
was checked by me.
I assumed
I assumed that Satô-kun would be the next target of the perpetrator...
I wanted to put her under guard.
But she refused.
Then
you approached her about it at the party.
That's right.
I've got it, Inspector!
The culprit is Toshiya Odagiri!
He wanted the three inspectors
because they reopened the Jinno case a year ago.
a year ago.
But
he didn't shoot Satô-kun.
We didn't find any gunshot residue.
Ah, that's right.
More important is Makoto Tomonari.
His whereabouts are unknown!
Besides, on the days of the murders...
on the days of the murders.
That he was at the party today...
At least we know that the perpetrator is left-handed.
Now that you mention it,
Makoto Tomonari is left-handed!
Okay.
- Put out an APB on him! - Yes!
Tell me, Inspector,
how was Jinno's carotid artery cut?
How?
The cut went straight down from the upper right at an angle.
So if the case was a murder,
the killer could be left-handed.
left-handed, right?
- Eh? - How do you know that?
- Well... - In order not to get the blood off...
In that case
...the right carotid artery has to be cut with the left.
Right, Conan-kun?
J... Yes.
I see.
But there's no connection between Makoto-kun and Dr. Jinno.
If Dr. Jinno was murdered..,
there must be another left-handed person.
Toshiya-san is also left-handed.
He held the match on the left.
There is someone else.
His father, the superintendent.
He is also left-handed.
What a stupid thing to do!
As if he could be a criminal!
H... Inspector...
BEIKA-YAKUSHINO HOSPITAL
I am Ayumi Yoshida.
This is Genta Kojima, Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya...
and Ai Haibara.
We are friends of Conan
and came by out of concern for you.
Thank you.
But unfortunately
I don't remember you.
No! I can't believe it!
You played so much with us!
Then you probably don't recognize me either.
I'm Hiroshi Agasa.
Well?
The genius scientist who lives next door to
Shin'ichi Kudô, who is a friend and classmate of yours.
and classmate of yours.
Shin'ichi... Kudô...
You remember Shin'ichi?
No.
I see.
What's wrong, Haibara?
I thought someone was staring at us.
It must have been my imagination.
Sorry, I'm exhausted.
Don't worry about it. You just rest.
Who's there?
Damn it!
What is it, Conan?
Uncle..,
Maybe Ran...
saw the perpetrator's face when he shot Sato-san.
- What?
it is possible that he is after Ran's life!
We have been expecting you.
Don't worry.
Takagi-kun and Chiba-kun will protect her.
- Who's with her? - My husband is with her.
Okay, let's go.
- Excuse me, Kisaki-san... - Kisaki-san?
Dr. Kazato would like to see you...
about your daughter.
The results of the MRI
show no damage to the brain.
I think your daughter is trying to protect herself...
from psychological damage by losing her memory.
Does that mean
we take her back to the hotel
...and reconstruct...
...and reconstruct the incident?
What are you talking about?
If she doesn't want to remember,
we don't have to force her to.
Then what?
Is it okay if she stays like that?
I'm just against making her suffer again!
Calm down. Forcing her to remember
it can cause damage to the brain.
You see!
Excuse me.
Yeah, this is Kazato.
Yeah, I got it.
I'll make the call.
If Ran saw the perpetrator, she should remember him quickly.
she should remember him quickly so he can be arrested.
But the doctor said
we can't put any pressure on her.
Well, then
I'll protect Ran!
Oops, no answer.
Sorry to bother you.
Doctor,
can her memory be recovered naturally?
It's not uncommon for patients..,
...that patients remember..,
when they are relaxed.
Got it.
When Ran is discharged, I'll stay with you.
What?
That way I can take better care of her.
Ran can relax better that way too.
You must be kidding! Then I'm under stress!
I don't care what happens to you!
This is just for Ran!
Do you understand?
This is a disaster!

TWO DAYS LATER
Ran-san,
please don't try to remember.
Understand?
Yes.
If she thinks of anything,
please tell me.
Yeah, all right.
This is the town you've lived in for 17 years since you were born.
Nothing familiar?
DETECTIVE MÔRI
This is your home.
Môri...
Detective Agency...
You're getting wet.
What's wrong, Ran?
I bet the puddle bothers you.
There was a puddle of water at the time of the shooting.
- Move forward a bit, please. - Got it.
Up here is the office.
I sit at this desk and solve tough cases.
All you ever do is drink beer and watch TV.
Here on the second floor is the living room, there's the kitchen.
And this is your room.
That guy's name is Shin'ichi Kudo..,
an impossible guy who's trying to fool you.
Who's fooling who?
Ah, Ran-neechan, you do karate!
Me and karate?
You won the karate championship.
Don't you know?
No.
So...
But please don't worry.
I'm sure I'll remember soon.
I'm sure you will!
Let's celebrate Ran's release
- and eat something really delicious! - Yeah, I could..,
I could use a wooden spoon again.
Yikes?
What about you two?
W... what's supposed to be? D... your cooking is...
I don't need to eat.
I'm not hungry.
You don't have to be so modest, Conan-kun.
I'll roll up my sleeves
I'm going to roll up my sleeves...
Beef Stew that you won't forget in a hurry.
That's the last straw!
Where do you think you're going?
Oh, well..,
I forgot to tell you..,
that I was supposed to meet the neighbors
to play mahjong with the neighbors.
It's about your daughter!
And you want to play mahjongg now?
Or are you
that my food is inedible?
That's nice.
Ran's doing better than I thought.
Well, good.
Ran...
DETECTIVE MÔRI
Bodyguards? For me?
We heard from Inspector Takagi that you might be threatened.
So we Detective Boys
decided to protect you.
With the name:
GROUP TO PROTECT RAN-NÊCHAN!
I have a water pistol with pepper in it!
Me a boomerang!
Me handcuffs!
What are you doing?
With such childish toys...
Thank you very much.
It's a great comfort.
To thank you, I'll serve you something cold.
Come on up.
Yes!
Hooray!
Doesn't she remember anything?
No.
Wouldn't it be convenient if she
if she doesn't regain her memory?
Then there's no danger of your identity being revealed.
What are you saying?!
If I... if I could,
I'd like to be without memories.
That my sister was murdered,
that I was one of them.
and made poison...
If it were all gone,
and I could just be Ai Haibara, an elementary school girl..,
how nice it would be...
Then we could
both of us forever...
like now...
Haibara!
You...!
It's all nonsense.
Are you feeling better?
Hey, little ones!
A new girlfriend?
The next pain in the ass...
In this photo, you just won the karate championship.
Remember?
No.
That one...
Ah, that's Kudô-kun..,
Your husband.
I'm not her husband!
Does he look familiar to you?
Does he? Ran-nêchan?
No,
- but... - But?
He seems very familiar to me.
But I don't know why.
You'll know when you see Shin'ichi-san.
That's right! Bring him here!
If only I could.
Isn't he a high school detective..,
who solves difficult cases all over the country?
Really, this guy,
where does he hang out? Just when Ran is in this situation!
MÔRI DETECTIVE
MAKOTO TOMONARI (25)
Yes?
Ran-nêchan, the bathroom is free.
Yes, thank you.
Tell me, Conan-kun, what kind of guy is Shin'ichi Kudô?
What kind of guy?
I think that you're the most important thing to him, but he can't
...but I don't think he's able to express his feelings openly.
I would like to meet him
get to know him.
Say, Ran,
do you want to go to the Ginza tomorrow?
When I'm with him, I get all testy!
Let's go shopping and blow off the moping!
You can come too.
Yes.
Are you all right?
Satô-san!
Satô-san! Hang in there!
Excuse me.
Hello?
Damn it!
The train's coming.
Run!
Run!
BEIKA-YAKUSHINO HOSPITAL

Ran.
She's been given a sedative.
Is she all right?
She only has a few scratches.
But this incident may cause her
she might develop a fear of remembering.
Takagi!
Where were your eyes?
- Sorry! - But
now it's clear.
That Ran-kun saw the perpetrator's face..,
when he shot Satô-kun.
Is that clear?
We have to protect them at all costs!
Yes, sir!
Just protecting them isn't enough!
We must attack!
BEIKA SUN PLAZA HOTEL
The other day
no gunshot residue was found on anyone in the hotel.
Is it possible to shoot without leaving
powder residue remaining?
Wait a minute.
There was...
The button of the umbrella was closed.
After the incident
the button was open
and it was somewhere else.
And when Ran was released...
Could it be...?!
What? The umbrella is yours?
Do you know where it is now?
Sorry, it had a hole in it. I threw it away.
I threw it away.
Of course you did. Days later.
That was a lie.
Of course I kept it.
Hey, hey.
Thanks.
Just like I thought.
Now I know
how to avoid gunshot residue!
With that, Makoto Tomonari-san,
Tamaki Jinno-san and also
Toshiya-san,
no, everyone who was at the party is a suspect!
Here it is!
You, my goddess...
Please believe me...
I see.
The reason Tamaki-san was at the party..,
was because she was shadowing Toshiya-san.
What are you doing?
Why are you following me day after day?
Does it bother you?
What?
Instead of the cops you shot,
I'll prove you're a murderer!
You're playing decoy?
You're Tamaki-san, Tamotsu Jinno's sister, right?
A year ago.
your brother had a fight
with Toshiya Odagiri.
You discovered that his father
...is a police superintendent, and he wasn't questioned.
Boy, who are you?
Conan Edogawa, detective.
A... Detective?
If you
loved your brother in real life, you must resent...
you must resent the three policemen
as a suicide.
I hated my brother!
I'm only investigating this case
because I want to know the truth!
Then let's take a risk
and go after the enemy.
POLICE SUPERINTENDENT ODAGIRI'S RESIDENCE
Swordsmanship.
Madness!
Tamaki Jinno-san, isn't it?
I have something I want to give you.
To me?
I found it last month
in my son Toshiya's room.
T. Jinno?
Is that Tamotsu's?
That's right.
I knew the name,
because it was the last case
that Inspector Tomonari was in charge of before he died of a heart attack...
...a year ago.
When I confronted Toshiya..,
...I learned that Tamotsu Jinno was selling drugs illegally..,
...and that my son was using this knowledge...
to blackmail him for money.
But
in the file at the time
Toshiya was never mentioned.
Therefore, I ordered
Inspector Narasawa to re-examine the case.
It was you yourself
who ordered the reopening?
Now that Inspector Narasawa is dead..,
Inspector Megure is in charge of the case.
If this re-investigation was Inspector Narasawa's idea,
...you must be trying to protect your son from the investigation.
In fact, I also have
I also have a motive to kill these three.
Now..,
if you're interested in the truth,
show us the files!
I can't do that!
Bringing the truth to light
is the job of the police!
ENTERTAINMENT ROOM OF BEIKA-YAKUSHINO HOSPITAL
ENTERTAINMENT ROOM - Fortunately, you are unharmed!
Thank you,
The doctor thinks I can be discharged.
Say, Sonoko-san...
No, no, no! Sonoko will be fine.
What kind of kid is Conan-kun?
He risked...
He risked his life to save me.
Well..,
for a child, he's very quick-witted, or rather,
very perceptive. A strange boy.
Well, if you ask me,
he's just a cheeky rascal.
Like this.
This year in Tropical Land
the "Island of Wildness and Prehistory" was added,
so I'm sure visitors will be more...
I know the place.
Tropical Land?
Yes, that's right!
You were there with Shin'ichi-kun!
PSYCHIATRY CONSULTING ROOM
PSYCHIATRY - INTERVIEW ROOM - I see.
Your memories are about to return.
Doctor!
If we take her to Tropical Land..,
will she remember?
There is indeed a possibility.

I will go there tomorrow.
Wait! I'm against it!
The criminal might attack you again,
and if you remember,
you'll only torture yourself again!
To tell you the truth
I am afraid to remember the incident.
But I believe that it can't stay like that.
I have to move forward on my own.
Ran...
You really have courage, Ran-san.
If that's how you feel,
then Tropical Land is no problem.
Can't it at least be the day after tomorrow?
I can't make tomorrow's appointment...
Don't worry! I'll go with you.
I'll guard Ran with my life!
Kogoro...
Ran, I'm coming too!
Thank you.
But please...
don't tell Conan-kun about this.
If you do, I think he'll want to come along.
I don't want to put him
I don't want to put him in danger again.
I understand.
It's getting pretty late.
Yes.
Conan-kun,
if you'd like to see the files, I have copies.
You do?
After all, I'm a journalist!
They're at home. Tomorrow, okay?
Yes!
I'm going then!
There he goes. Without suspecting anything.
Let's go then.
Hooray! Ran is on his way!
It was worth it to keep watch already in the morning.
I wonder if they didn't inform Edogawa-kun.
It's not that bad. He's always stealing the show anyway.
Are you okay?
No dangerous stuff!
Follow that car!
Anything yet, Mr. Detective?
YÔICHIRÔ SHIBA (31)
The notebook that Inspector Shiba keeps...
What about the notebook?
If he pulled it out of his breast pocket,
shouldn't the notebook be the other way around?
He takes it in his hand and pulls it out.... Indeed!
Maybe it wasn't Inspector Shiba who took the notebook out...
but the perpetrator.
A... I see.
It's possible.
Huh?
I'll find him!
Tamaki-san, I thought you were right-handed.
I'm actually left-handed, but I've been retrained.
When I'm thinking and smoking, or doing something spontaneous..,
I promptly use my left hand.
For spontaneous things?
That reminds me, that was a....
Wait a minute,
was that...
Was that...?
Is that supposed to mean...?
Tell me, your brother was at Tôto University Hospital, wasn't he?
Yes, that's right. I'm sorry, Conan-kun,
I have another appointment.
I'll say goodbye.
Take care, Conan-kun.
- To Tropical Land! - Yes.
I know that place.
If I remember correctly,
when Shin'ichi was here with you..,
he solved the roller coaster murder case.
Then let's ride it too!
Maybe you'll think of something else!
Um,
the Mystery Coaster is... on the Island of Riddles and Illusions!
ISLAND OF MYSTERY AND ILLUSION
You two sit in the front.
You know what I mean? I'm sure Conan Doyle meant to say that.
It's nothing.
Ah! There's Ran and the others!
- I want to ride it too. - What are you talking about?
We need to look around to see if there's a suspect running around.
- Let's go. - Okay!
Well?
Wasn't Môri-kun afraid of heights?
Darn it! A... us... time!
Are you okay?
- Ran, do you want a Coke? - Yeah, I'll have one.
There's Troppi's balloons!
Really..,
Who would build such a thing?
Here. You must be thirsty.
Here's your Coke.
Thank you, sir.
You're Shin'ichi Kudô?
But I still can't remember
who you are.
Excuse me, Môri-san,
I'm going to the restroom.
Oh, thank you!
The balloons are flying away!
Ran-san! Watch out!
Wait!
Hey you! Don't do that!
You can't escape me!
Whoops!
Water pistol with red pepper!
Take that!
You're
Makoto Tomonari?!
What's that?
E... a knife?
That's...
Makoto Tomonari.
I'm arresting you for attempted murder!
Hooray!
The group for the protection of Ran-Nekhan...
GROUP TO PROTECT RAN-NÊCHAN!
...has won!
Môri-san,
I'll take him to the presidium right away.
Wait, I'll go with you.
Hurray!
There's no danger for you anymore.
and you'll remember Shin'ichi better without me.
Va... Vate...
It's all right.
Call me that when you remember everything again.
You Detective Boys saved Ran.
What a great job!
Great performance, he said!
This from the master detective!
We got a commendation.
Now we can have a great time!

I want to see the parade!
May we stay here until evening, Professor?
Well, yes,
After all, Shin'ichi and Ran-kun were here until evening, too.
Hooray!
I wonder if it's really
it's really over?
Say, Ran, let's go to the "Devil's Laboratory."
That'll be fun!
TOTO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
You work for the famous
- Kogoro Môri-san? - Yes.
Say, if we help you,
could I have your autograph?
- I want one too! - Of course you do!
You can have as many of the old man's autographs as you want!
It's about Dr. Jinno? It's not nice to say so,
but he was unpleasant.
That's right!
He was greedy for money, but lacked talent.
He got into trouble for malpractice several times.
Remember him?
The patient with heart disease?
He cut the co-operating doctor's arm!
Exactly,
that's why the patient didn't make it.
Can you tell me more about that?
It's just as I suspected.
I have to let you know!
DETECTIVE MÔRI
Yes, this is the Môri Detective Agency.
Master detective Kogoro Môri...
- is investigating a serious... - Shit!
Kisaki Law Firm.
- This is Conan. - Hello, Conan-kun.
KISAKI LAW OFFICE
Is Kisaki-san in?
She's right after her court hearing.
MIDORI KURIYAMA (SECRETARY)
She went to Tropical Land.
To Tropical Land?
Yes, Ran-san seems to be there.
Darn!
Look!
And there!
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
How is it? Can you talk now?
A male voice called: "I'm telling you
the truth about your father's death".
I then went to the Beika Park intersection.
But the man did not appear. Instead
Inspector Narasawa was shot.
Back home, the man called me again.
the man called me again.
This time
I was to come to the Maison Park housing complex.
But the man was not there again
and on the parking deck
Inspector Shiba was discovered shot.
That's when I realized
that I was being set up.
I spent the night
I spent the night in the hotel.
The next day, I called the answering machine.
A woman, who called herself Satô,
told me to come to the Beika Sun Plaza Hotel.
If I didn't, I would be on suspicion of murder.
However, when I got there,
the hotel was full of policemen,
so I left the place in a hurry.
But then there was
Inspector Satô...
Why didn't you go to the police with that right away?
I didn't trust them.
Because of what happened to Father.
So I went to ask Master Detective Môri for help...
...so I hung around there.
Are you saying that you didn't get close to Ran-kun...
...in Tropical Land?
No,
I wanted to approach Môri-san.
Wait a minute!
You had a knife!
It was for self-protection.
The perpetrator could have been after me.
Hey...
So the perp's still on the loose?
Plus there's a female accomplice!
Ran is in danger...!!!
LABYRINTH OF ICE AND FOG
That's right, from here...
Excuse me, is the observation deck empty?
Yeah, they're all watching the parade right now.
Thank you.
Welcome to the "Labyrinth of Ice and Fog".
Ran, where are you? Where are you?
Genta! So you're here too!
Ran must be nearby!
There he is!
Ran!!!
That's right! The detective badge!
Genta! Mitsuhiko! Ayumi!
Can you hear me? Answer me!
Conan-kun. I hear you.
Conan, guess where we are right now?
Don't get scared!
We're in the Tropical...
Listen to me very carefully!
The perpetrator is pointing a gun at Ran!
Tell Ran to get through the crowds...
through the crowds of people.
Tropical Land through the crowds! Are you listening to me?
Ran, run!
You're being targeted!
Look out!
Professor!
Because of me, people are suffering...
B... Stay with us, Ran-kun!
You alone are a welcome target shi...
Ran-kun? Ran-kun!
Damn it!
Ran is on the island of "Dreams and Tales...
To get there...
Next, please!
Hey, kid!
There it is!
Conan-kun...
It's all right, Ran-neechan,
we'll blend into the crowd.
This way!
Damn it!
He doesn't seem to care about the others!
ISLAND OF SAVAGERY AND PREHISTORY
Help! There's a pervert!
Jump in the boat!
Hey, you guys!
Conan-kun,
where did you learn to do taxes?
My dad taught me in Hawaii.
Say,

are we not safe now?
No.
The cola!
Coke?
20 minutes to nine!
Conan-kun!
Waterfall!
Hang on!
Hurry up!
We're almost there! Put your back into it!
Shit!
He's on our tail!
We've got to take cover behind that rock!
Hurry up!
Conan-kun...
This place...
is closed at night.
Don't be afraid to show yourself.
You're pretty careful.
But there's no need to be.
I now know the true meaning
of Inspector Narasawa's message.
When he reached for his chest in death..,
he didn't mean the notebook,
but the heart!
HEART HEALTH
The heart of heart medicine,
HEART
so psychiatry!
Isn't it,
Dr. Kyôsuke Kazato?
Since when do you know?
The first time I got suspicious,
when I remembered your phone call.
Right-handed people don't press keys with their left hand.
Yes!
You're a lefty by nature.
Oh, that was thoughtless of me.
Seven years ago.
you were the talk of the town at ToTo University Hospital...
you were the talk of the town as the number one junior surgeon.
But one day,
...when you were operating with Jinno..,
he made a mistake and cut your left wrist.
Because of the accident
the performance of your so-called golden left hand deteriorated.
Your pride made you
throw away the scalpel
and you switched to psychiatry.
Since then, perhaps also out of pride,
you've spent your time as a right-hander, haven't you?
That's exactly how it is.
That simple keystrokes can tell you so much is amazing.
As a psychiatrist, you then
at the Beika Yakushino Hospital.
A year ago.
but there was something between you and Jinno.
We met again.
By chance.
He invited me to his place for a beer.
Encouraged by the alcohol, I expressed my long-held doubts.
I wondered if the accident wasn't intentional...?
You really are a simpleton!
The accident was intentional!
At that moment
the murderousness awoke in me!
The guy's just been charged with a surgical error..,
which would be reason enough for a suicide.
As expected, the investigation resulted in suicide.
But you must have heard
But you must have heard that the case was reopened.
Yes, by Inspector Narasawa, who joined the Beika police.
The death of Inspector Tomonari caused him a psychological shock...
caused him a psychological shock and he came to see me.
During therapy, I learned that Makoto Tomonari had a grudge against the police.
And because of the reopening
you shot the three policemen..,
...in order to remain undetected?
You called Makoto Tomonari to the crime scene..,
to incriminate him?
That's right.
In Narasawa and Shiba's case, I called...
I called in my own voice.
In Satô's case...
...you recorded female patients on tape...
and edited it,
- Didn't you? - That's right.
The fact that Inspector Narasawa...
reached into his breast pocket when he died.
Inspector Shiratori told me.
I'm his family doctor, after all.
And then you,
to incriminate Makoto Tomonari, son of a police officer,
you put the police notebook
...in the hands of Inspector Shiba.
Excellent, Conan-kun!
But there's no proof that I'm the culprit.
When Inspector Satô
I wasn't found to have any gunshot residue on me.
...there were no gunshot residue marks on me.
If you want to hear it..,
I'll be glad to tell you the trick!
What trick?
After you've been arrested by the police!
This way!
NO ADMITTANCE
He'll be waiting for us at the exit!
ISLAND OF ADVENTURE AND COLONIZATION
Where are we?
On the biggest island of adventures.
We went under the sea from there.
I see.
Go on!
We were in the middle of a conversation.
Shit, he took a boat.
I don't like it when you reveal my trick.
Then I'd be suspected of shooting Sato, too.
You mean even if Ran testifies against you..,
you'd get off because there's no gunshot residue?
That's exactly what I mean.
Ran only saw me for a brief moment.
But imminent danger should be nipped in the bud.
Let's hear it then,
if your conclusions are correct!
With pleasure!
First you caused
...you cut the power on the 15th floor..,
put on your surgical gloves,
you took the prepared umbrella and went to the ladies' room.
The tip of the umbrella was prepared with a hole..,
through which you put the gun and fired.
That means,
the umbrella protected you from the gunpowder and smoke.
That is why

I didn't find any gunshot residue on your gloves.
You probably flushed your gloves down the men's room.
That's right, Conan-kun.
I'm going to have to kill you after all.
Conan-kun...
Tell me, why...
Why are you so protective of me?
Say, why?
Because I like you.
Because I love you...
More than anyone
on this earth!
Jump!
Take a deep breath now!
Quickly!
Thank you.
Mr. Precocious...
Damn it!
ISLAND OF SCIENCE AND SPACE
46 seconds to go!
There he is!
Let's finish it here, Conan-kun!
Besides, there's no place left for you..,
...to escape to.
C... Conan-kun!
I'm okay.
My arm just got grazed.
I told you, there's nowhere left to go!
If you kill Ran here,
won't that prove Makoto Tomonari-san's innocence?
That's true.
I wanted to kill him before he was arrested.
But what the hell.
Well, isn't "lady first"
appropriate?
Ten,
nine,
eight, seven,
six,
- A magic formula? - Five,
three,
two,
one...
Don't! Ran-san!
Sato-san!
Here, you must be thirsty.
One!
Ahchoo.
If Shin'ichi...
- I know... - Say to me...
What's wrong, Ran-neechan?
Stay away from me!
After the fountains.
it's over for you! Give it up!
Kids' stuff!
There you go.
Die!
Take that!
Conan-kun.
Ran!
Don't tell me...
Damn it!
I'll settle with you first!
Isn't that right...
I remember!
That you shot Mrs. Sato!
That I won the karate championship!
Karate?
You won?
Wow!
- Run! - Run!
Mom!
Dad!
You...
You remembered?!
Then you know who I am?
Of course I do!
Sonoko Suzuki,
my friend forever!
Ran...
Ran!
Oh how beautiful!
So he really was the killer!
Odagiri personally reopened the case
and let us know.
That was mean, Conan!
Catching him by yourself!
What are you talking about? He didn't want to involve you...
That's exactly
- doesn't suit us! - We're all
to the Detective Boys!
I'm sorry, Conan-kun.
But Conan-kun, you're bleeding.
Here.
It went well...
For now...
Great job, Mr. Master Detective!
Tamaki-san!
What are you doing here?
I've been monitoring Toshiya, who had a live performance.
Didn't do much good, though.
I have to say,
what was with the "I'll protect Ran"?
It was Conan-kun and Professor Agasa who protected Ran with their lives!
Well...
I'm glad she's okay.
- Really? Is that true? - Yes!
Listen up, everyone!
Satô-san has regained consciousness!
She must be out of danger!
Oh! Wonderful!
- Miwa-chan! - Hooray!
Satô-san!
She made it, Takagi-san!
How beautiful!
That clears everything up.
Don't talk nonsense!
Toshiya's blackmail case is still open.
The victim is already dead,
but check the facts...
-...and squeeze him for all he's worth. - Yes!
It was you who first
the truth first.
Who are you?
Need not to know.
I'm just an elementary school student.

DETECTIVE MÔRI
Thank you, Conan-kun.
You wanted to help me with the words
to help me remember, didn't you?
You heard it at the hotel.
The marriage proposal that Pop's mother made.

"I love you very much.
More than anyone on this earth."
That's why you have the same words....
- Eh? That's what the uncle... - Didn't what?
- Didn't he? - Uh, well... well..,
- It's true... - I knew it!
After all, you and I are way too far apart in age!
But it was nice to meet you.
Good night, everybody!
Good night.
What the hell.
Wait a minute, that means...
The same words came into my head as the old man?!
Argh.
