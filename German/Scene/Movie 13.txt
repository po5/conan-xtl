Tonight we are at Tôto Tower in the Minato district.
Here at Tôto Tower, a Tanabata festival is currently taking place,
- where many visitors... - Yes, I understand.
Four o'clock at the professor's, right?
Don't be late yourself.
Don't be late, Genta! See you then.
All that's missing is the flashlight.
Um, I'm sure...
It was in one of those drawers...
Ah, there it is.
Is someone there? Ran-nêchan?
The old man's gone to mah-jongg...
Must have been nothing.
Long time no see, Shin'ichi Kudo.
Oh no, you're Conan Edogawa now.
Who'd have thought you'd lived to be a peck?
Really, we were flabbergasted, weren't we?
How did they know? How did they know?
Conan-kun?
Conan-kun, did something happen?
There was a loud rumbling.
Conan-kun?
Take a good look.
What a fate...
...people connected to you have to suffer.
Conan-kun, are you all right?
Conan-kun?
Are you in there?
I'm coming in.
Conan-kun?
Raaan!
Damn, what a dream.
CONAN DETECTIVE - THE NIGHT BLACK HUNTER
I'm high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran..,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on what was happening
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He administered a poison to me
and when I came to...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked my name, I said Conan Edogawa.
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
The Black Organization, surrounded by mystery....
Gin...
Vodka...
Vermouth...
Chianti... Grain...
And sherry.
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She lost her parents, who were scientists
with the organization, she lost early.
Under the code name "Sherry" she also worked for them
and developed
the said poison Apotoxin 4869.
However, her only sister
Akemi Miyano was murdered by them.
She rebelled.
To take her own life, she took the poison.
As a result, her body shrank.
So she changed her name to Ai Haibara,
is always on guard and now
and now lives the life of a first-grader just like me.
In the case of Wormwood,
I managed to get a lead.
Don't do that.
If you pull that out,
my friends are gonna get a message.
With your boss's e-mail address.
"The... the seven kids"?
Yeah, when you type in the boss's number, that's what it sounds like.
Like that nursery rhyme.
Did you send him an e-mail?
Bullshit, of course not.
Well, I'll give the e-mail address to
I'll give it to Inspector Takagi...
- and then... - He'll be killed...
Inspector Takagi.
The moment he's about to..,
that person.
And their next target will be you, Kudô-kun, because you...
because you gave him the address.
When you realize that, give up and forget about it.
Because this e-mail address must not be opened under any circumstances.
opened under any circumstances. It's a Pandora's box.
I am small, my mind is not!
No case remains unsolved!
There is always only one truth!
BEIKA FOREST
Oh, there's one!
Yes.
I've got one! A stag beetle!
Hooray!
The stag beetles are actually higher up.
Okay! I'll climb up, too.
Impossible, Genta-kun.
Wouldn't it be better if you left it alone?
That's right.
Climbing up that high..,
Only Edogawa-kun or a monkey could do that.
Monkey? Thank you very much.
That's right, you can use the suspenders.
Suspenders... did you say?
Ah, the ones you gave us at your house?
That's right, because I've improved them.
With one button, you can stretch them up to 100 meters.
As long as you press it, they expand,
and when you press it again, they quickly contract.
Ouch.
T... I'm sorry.
Seriously, you better watch out!
A stag beetle!
How nice for you, Genta-kun.
A rhinoceros beetle!
It's landing!
Wah! There's another one!
A male and a female!
Well?
This female rhinoceros beetle
has tape on her wings.
Look.
It's a fact! How mean!
Huh? There are letters on it.

Um...
Ah, it says "open."
You often find tape like that on store-bought lunch boxes.
On my box of fried food yesterday....
Fried food?
Are you sneaking back in?
Well...
Let me see that. I'll remove the tape.
Yes.
Who would do such a nonsense?
But if it's a male and a female..,
maybe they're lovers.
Then I'll give them both a name!
Um,
the boy is called Hikoboshi
and the girl Orihime!
That's good!
Now that you mention it, Tanabata is coming up.
Tanabata reminds me...
Okay, it's time...
Time for the long-awaited quiz!
Nobody waits for that.
One night during the Tanabata festival...
it was raining so hard that Orihime and Hikoboshi...
couldn't get together.
The worried two thought through their situation
and established a "day to be with the beloved",
abbreviated as "Love, Day for Both," to meet.
Now then, which day of the following is meant?
First: New Year's Day on the first of January.
Second: Setsubun on the second of February.
Third: Doll festival on the third of March.
Fourth: Tango no sekku (Day of the Child) on May fifth.
I got it! It's third, the doll festival!
After all, O-Dairi-sama and O-Hina-sama are lovers.
No, it's fourth, tango no sekku!
With your beloved, you dance the tango of passion.
I'll take first.
On New Year's Day, you eat rice cake soup together!
Oh, the ideas you all come up with.
Professor, what's the solution?
It's fourth, the fifth of May.
Hurray!
However, my idea was...
The fifth of May is Children's Day.
If you break down "kodomo no hi"..,
you get "ko, i, tomo no hi",
"koi, tomo no hi" right?
I see.
You specially abbreviated "day to be with the beloved", didn't you?
"Love, day to be with both" so....
Hopefully these two
can stay together forever.
But are
Hikoboshi and Orihime not rather inappropriate names for beetles?
Yes, do you think so?
I think they're kind of fitting.
The star of Orihime is Vega.
ORIHIME = VEGA (ENGL.)
The ribbon that was stuck on the female,
looked like the letter "V".
That's right! It is perfect!
Yes!
That was good, Haibara-san!
So... how do I get back down?
Shit! What's wrong now?
Oh no!
Don't move! Don't move!
Shit!
Hey! Are you all right?
- Quick, get an ambulance! - Yes!
T... Tanabata Kyô...
Hey! Hang in there.
The ambulance will be here soon!
Hey, don't faint!
Is that clear? I've given you a lift for a change.
- So wait good. - Yes.
Dad, your tie is crooked.
Ah, Môri-san!
Thank you for coming so early.
Good morning, Ran-chan, Conan-kun.
Good morning!
Seems like large-scale serial killings.
Yes.
The day before yesterday, a mah-jongg stone was found at the scene of the murder...
at the scene of the murder on the Odawara toll road.
Other stones were found in the cases in
Tôkyô, Kanagawa, Shizuoka and Nagano prefectures,
Shizuoka and Nagano prefectures.
With this, we are now aware of five incidents.
I see...
Very well, everything else in the conference.
Yes.
Please.
Oh, Môri-san, you're here too!
Long time no see!
You still have a loud organ,
Yokomizo...
JÛGO YOKOMIZO SANGO YOKOMIZO
I'm Sango. This is my brother Jûgo.
I know that. I know him.
- S... Sango Jûgo? - Shh.
And... that lady?
What?
Oh, sorry.
This is Inspector Ogino of the Saitama Police.
AYAMI OGINO SAITAMA PREFECTURAL POLICE
I am Ayami Ogino.
Your reputation precedes you.
Oh, to think there's such a beautiful policewoman in the Saitama Police....
She was my junior when I was on duty in Saitama.
Huh? Saitama Prefectural Police?
The apartment of the victim who was murdered in Tôkyô is in Tokorozawa.
That's why I was invited.
Why are you here, Môri-san?
He's here as a special consultant this time,
at the request of Superintendent Matsumoto.
A private detective to help? That's very pathetic.
I agree.
You are...
KANSUKE YAMATO NAGANO PREFECTURAL POLICE
Kansuke Yamato of the Nagano Prefectural Police.
And the bungling policeman of the Gunma Prefectural Police.
But don't, Môri-san.
MISAO YAMAMURA GUNMA PREFECTURAL POLICE
I have a proper name, Misao Yamamura!
Look!

But didn't the crime take place in Nagano-ken?
Why the Gunma police?
The crime scene was on the prefectural border between Nagano and Gunma.
- Therefore. - The body was lying from the knees down
in Gunma Prefecture, so here I am!
Oh dear.
It's okay, I know the name now... Huh?
In... Inspector?
You're an inspector now?
Oh, did you notice?
Thanks to you, I've been promoted to inspector!
So you and Inspector...
I wonder if the Gunma police can handle it?
By the way, didn't the boy with glasses come with you today?
Boy with glasses?
You mean Conan?
That's right, Conan Edogawa-kun!
Somehow, when he's around, the cases always solve themselves.
Now that you mention it, it was the same with me.
It was the same for me!
Ah, so it was the same for you?
To be honest, it's the same with us.
And then, in between, you pass out
and the case is suddenly solved, isn't it?
Not good at all!
Unconscious?
Really?
It wasn't like that.
Not at all.
What? Just me?
You're the only cop I can stun.
Strange.
We'd like to start the conference...
Ah, sorry.
Môri-san... Hello, Môri-san...
Who's that?
That guy who looks so bad?
KIYONAGA MATSUMOTO SUPERINTENDENT
Idiot!
That's Superintendent Kiyonaga Matsumoto!
Huh? With that face?
Don't be so cocky, or you'll get it!
Except for the sixth case, the first five have in common..,
is that the murders were committed with a large knife.
According to the shape of the wound.
with the right hand in a large arc from top to bottom.
Furthermore, the five were abducted with the help of a stun gun.
and at the place where their bodies were found
and left at the place where their bodies were found, we assume.
A question comes to mind here:
Why did the perpetrator take his hostages
to a different location specifically to then murder them?
In addition, all six bodies were found to have
a mah-jongg stone
with a red dot and a letter on the back
with a vertical line.
It is probably a message from the perpetrator.
Of the four circles below, the one on the upper right is not painted out
and the one on the lower left is also
has not been marked with a red dot.
As for the letters, we have an A twice, an E, H and Z.
As well as an L that is upside down.
The perpetrator also took an object from each of the six victims,
that they usually carried with them at all times.
A pendant, wallet, talisman bag....
keychain, compact,
a doll mascot...
Could they have lost these items during the kidnapping?
No, since each of them is missing exactly one item...
we should rather assume that the perpetrator took them.
So the question is, what does the message mean?
There is one more message.
It's "Tanabata Kyô..."
the message of the sixth victim
Ryûzaki-san, which he left when he was dying.
Ryûzaki-san could be
at the rest area where the brake oil was probably drained,
at the rest area where the brake oil was probably drained.
Excuse me, but
perhaps you are thinking much too complicated?
The mah-jongg stone points directly to mah-jongg.
The motive for the crime is quite clear
Trouble playing mah-jongg!
That he took the stones one and seven,
means that they were playing mah-jongg eight at a time.
And then
two of the seven circles have not been painted yet.
One of the circles represents the perpetrator,
the other indicates the last victim.
Will the murders continue then?
Yes, probably...
Wouldn't he rather have used the eight stone as a clue to eight players?
the eight stone?
There was another reason for the choice of one and seven.
The culprit needed these two stones
to be able to make his game with them!
A game in which he would win in one fell swoop.
What?
I see.
Someone else outplayed him with a simple combo.
As a result, our perpetrator went berserk, didn't he?
That's right.
Probably
the other players were playing mah-jongg just as boringly.
The perpetrator just couldn't take it anymore.
So that was the motive for the crimes.
Excuse me.
Then what do the letters mean?
Why is he killing them in a different place?
And what...
do Ryûzaki-san's last words mean?
Um...
Well, then...
This... that's...
well...
well... um...

Superintendent...
Do
the six crime scenes have a special meaning for the perpetrator?
If so, there's a good chance
that this gives a clue to the perpetrator.
Furthermore, the six victims.
These six
must somehow be connected to him.
Finding this connection is the shortest way
to track down the perpetrator.
It may be mah-jongg, as Môri-kun thinks.
Also think about the meaning of the letters
and the line on the back
of the tiles, as well as the death message
"Tanabata Kyô!"
Listen!
Probably the perpetrator will commit another crime.
We have to prevent that. With our pride.
Territorial disputes and glory thinking are out of place.
Share your findings with everyone.
We need to get this serial killer as soon as possible!
Go to work with all your might!
Yes, sir!
Bathroom... I have to...
I guess the conference is over.
Looks like it.
Ah, Superintendent Matsumoto...
Long time no see.
How's Sayuri-sensei?
Ah, Môri's daughter.
She's still doing fine.
Well, Môri, I'm counting on you.
Yes! Myself, Kogorô Môri.
will make a sincere effort to fulfill your expectations!
Good.
Have a nice day!
Oops? Inspector Chiba, have you lost weight?
You noticed?
I'm on that diet
that's all the rage on TV these days.
On the subject of losing weight...
Shiratori, have you gained weight instead?
L... Don't joke around, Môri-san.
I go to the gym twice a week.
How unusual that you drink the coffee black.
Yes,
my doctor restricted my sugar intake.
And you? I thought you didn't like it sweet.
This is my third murder case.
You can't handle it without sugar.
Excuse me. Inspector Yokomizo?
- Huh? - Huh?
Ah, I mean the elder.
Ah.
Is that the boy Conan Edogawa we were talking about...
earlier?
Yes.
Maybe because he always listens to Môri-san,
sometimes he gives us really surprising tips.
He also often notices interesting details
that even we professionals easily overlook.
That's how it is.
Raaabe,
why are you crowing?
The raven has
in the mountains...
Oops!
Mr. Yamamura, this song!
Listen, son,
You don't know it, but...
Why are you singing that song,
inspector yamamura?
Why? I heard it through the bathroom door earlier.
It sounded like key tones.
When i came out,
a policeman had his cell phone...
Oops?
Wait a minute, Conan-kun!
Is it possible?
Is it possible that they...
Is it possible?
There!
Hey, Conan-kun?
Did something happen?
Shit!
- Let's go to the bathroom! - Conan-kun?
The bathroom's right here.
That was a Porsche 356A.
Gin's car...
Why? What were they doing at the conference? What were they doing at the conference?
What do they want?
What?
They were at the conference?
Shh. Not so loud!
Is Haibara all right?
Yes, she should be down in the lab.
Probably Wormwood disguised himself as a policeman.
While waiting for the elevator, she e-mailed her boss...
she emailed her boss about the conference.
I see. That was what Yamamura had heard.
The sounds of "The Seven Children" as she typed in the boss's number.
- But why... - Really.
I was wondering about your whispers.
Haibara...
So? Why do you think it was Wormwood?
Just because of the key tones?
Gin's Porsche was there.
Those guys don't just walk in
just walk into the police station.
If a disguise is necessary, Wormwood is usually behind it.
Anyway, there seems to be no doubt
that the series of murders
is somehow related to the guys in black.
Well, I want to investigate the case as well.
Do you want to help me?
I'm happy to...
You wouldn't keep your hands off it anyway.
But be on your guard.
You know what will happen
if they find out who you are.
Yes, I know.

What, you don't play mah-jongg?

Yes.
According to the investigation, all six victims did not play mahjong.
did not play mah-jongg, they said.
It looks like Môri-kun's assumption was wrong, unfortunately.
I guess we're completely stuck.
If only Kudô-kun were here...
When you say Kudô,
Do you mean the high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô..,
who's helped you a lot?
Yes, I do...
By the way, you don't hear any rumors at all lately.
I'm sure he's tired of playing detective.
Ah, no, that's not the case.
He solved a case at the Teitan School Festival...
...at the Teitan School Festival.
Takagi-kun!
Huh? Ah, sorry, I forgot...
What does that mean?
At the request of the person in question...
...we've kept his involvement to ourselves.
I see...
He seems to be quite modest.
He's only become like this recently.
In the past he was
to be the center of attention.
I guess it was nothing despite two days without school.
Huh? Yes...
Well...
Do you know anything about the stones and letters?
I didn't get anywhere with that either.
Not even with "Tanabata Kyô".
Oh!
Wow, Mitsuhiko-kun! You're good!
That's a rhinoceros beetle, isn't it?
Yeah, I'm pretty good at that kind of thing.
But that was pretty mean.
Sticking something on your wings.
Ah, you mean Orihime-san.
I wonder who made something like that?
Yes, really.
By the way, Genta-kun,
Is that a snake you're making?
What? You don't recognize it?
It's an eel. An eel!
Eel again?
Genta-kun, you really love eel.
You even wrote it on your Tanabata note.
I WANT TO STUFF MY BELLY WITH EEL!
That's right, tomorrow's Tanabata.
Tanabata...
Kyô...
What does that mean?
- How embarrassing! At a conference... - Sorry to bother you.
It's me.
Ah... yes...
Well?
What?
Yeah, I got it.
Good news.
A man who may be our serial killer..,
may show up in the town of Beika.
What?!
Minoru Fukase, 27 years old.
He stabbed Shuuhei Jinno with a knife last year..,
who was murdered on the Usui mountain pass.
The manhunt is still on.
I had his mistress followed.
She came to Tôkyô from Nagano...
and got off at Beika Station.
Risa Yoshii, 21 years old.
She works in a snack bar.
So?
What was the motive of this Fukase?
They were standing in line at Tropical Land
and Jinno told him not to smoke..,
which enraged him.
Tropical Land...
Ah...
Takagi-kun?
Do you have any ideas?
Could it be...
Could it be..,
...that the victims were all in the same line?
What?
Explain that!
Yes.
There were two different mah-jongg pieces next to the victims.
Jinno-san
was the one piece, and the other was the seven piece.
If you put the sacrifices here
of the red dot...
Couldn't it be that the victims
were standing in line like this?
I see...
Then Fukase...
Okay, Megure.
You and your team go with Inspector Yamato.
Oh, man, why do you have to come too?
I always wanted to race on an elevated highway.
Tsk.
What about you, Inspector Yamato? Well?
- This way! - Yes!
Good. We'll split up.
and keep watch.
The suspect?
Or is she...
Minoru!
Fukase has appeared.
Stand by!
Don't attract attention!
Hurry up! Hurry!
Toys are in the seventh, right?
Yeah, let's have ice cream later!
I'll have vanilla and chocolate!
Inspector! There are children near Fukase!
Calm down. We'll arrest him as soon as the kids leave.
Understood.
- Where are we? - Another one, I think.
Fifth one down.
- Next one is. - Yeah.
Okay. Apprehend!
Copy that.
I got it!
Wait a minute!
That idiot! Fukase! Stop right there!
Police!
You're surrounded.
Shit!
Stop it, Fukase!
Don't come any closer!
Or I'll kill that woman!
Damn it!
Nobody move!
Move and I'll stab her!
Don't do that!
What's the use? You won't get away!
Shut up! Stay where you are!
Don't move!
Get back!
S... It's all right, take it easy.
You're wasting our time...
He's unconscious.
But why?
Get away!
Stay away from Minoru...
Stay away from Minoru...
Easy, Risa-san.
Lower the knife.
No!
There's no point in such an action.
Throw it away!

No... No...
Release Minoru!
Okay, that's good, Risa-san.
You don't need to take on any more guilt.
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
Don't worry.
My belly is very fat.
I'm sorry.
How unpleasant.
Because I was careless...
No, no, no, no. I can't let an outside cop..,
to get hurt on my beat.
What?
What's wrong?
Well, the woman who was taken hostage...
Huh?
You don't mind? Just leaving like that?
Didn't you want something from the man,
Wormwood?
I had no choice.
You made sure of that, didn't you?
Also
the man probably didn't do it.
Yeah, you're right.
Ow ow ow, don't be so rough.
I hurt my right shoulder.
A hurt shoulder?
Ah! That's right, you were...
Don't move!
He can't get his arm up. He can't swing a knife down there.
Unless he hurt himself after the deed.
Besides... That you recognized me so well?
Your leg.
My leg?
There's a bulge on the right.
That's where the gun is, isn't it?
Also, this guy's knife nicked your left cheek..,
without bleeding.
Now, really...
I'm gonna need a blood-draining mask.
You probably
...you deliberately let yourself be taken hostage..,
and, after shaking off the police.
you were going to use the gun to turn the situation around.
Well, I'm sure you could do it without a gun.
How surprising to get a compliment from you.
Why is your organization
is pursuing this serial murder case?
You're pretty direct.
Tell me!
An NOC.
NOC?
Non-official cover...
A member was victimized disguised as a civilian?
Exactly. We found out that, perhaps for his own insurance,
this NOC was carrying a memory card,
that contained our NOC list.
The organization therefore wanted to eliminate him,
but...
Before they got to that, somebody else killed him.
Yes.
And this perpetrator took the memory card.
Probably without knowing about it.
So that's how it is.
If the police arrest the perpetrator
and see the data, it will be very troublesome.
Therefore...
The fact that you are here means that there is a NOC among the investigators.
No, wrong.
You disguised one of your people as an investigator!
That's why you were at the conference, right?
To make sure that your member would not be exposed.
Otherwise, you would have stayed infiltrated.
Who is he?
Who is he impersonating? Is the real officer all right?
That's all I can reveal.
You'll have to find out everything else for yourself.
His code name is Irish.
Irish...
Yes.
A little smoky, mild whiskey.
Hello, guard!
The boy's lost.
What? Lost?
Ah, no...
Good luck!
Good luck to you.
Damn it!
Yes, Megure here.
Superintendent.
A painter named Sumire Shindô
just called us. She thinks she might know something
about the serial killer.
The address is Hachioji Shi...
Yes.
Yeah, I got it.
Sato, Takagi,
go to Hachioji immediately!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir. Sumire Shindô it is.
It's no good, Aniki.
It's too far.
Even if we get there first,
there's not enough time.
We won't run into any cops.
Yeah, it's me.
Clear! Just in time!
- I'll take the right. - Okay! Me left!
Cute kid!
Great woman.
- Ah, what was that? - Take it easy! On the shoulder!
J... j... yes!
Oh dear, we actually have a flat tire.
This side too.
Takagi-kun, inform Shiratori-kun!
Yes!
Damn it, we're too late.
There's no point in being here.
We're leaving.
What?
She's not here?
And she's not just out?
No. The room's trashed.
and we suspect the killer took her by car.
Get out an APB.
And forensics, please.
- Copy that. - See you.
Takagi-ku...
What is it?
Sato-san?
As an investigator?
Yes. The code name is Irish.
Ring any bells?
No, never heard of it.
Well...
At least if you knew..,
what kind of guy...
Don't give me that.
If this Irishman is impersonating one of the investigators..,
...I'm sure he's noticed..,
...he's probably noticed you running after Wormwood...
after the conference.
Yes......but...
Don't you see?
The more cases you solve, the more
it's proof of that,

- that you are Shin'ichi Kudô. - Ai-kun...
I understand that you are worried.
But I have to clarify this issue.
A police officer's life depends on it.
In any case, it's clear that among the investigators..,
...among the investigators who were at the conference was Irish.
I've got to find out who he is and, at the same time.
the perpetrator in front of this guy
and get the NOC's memory card.
With that card alone, I might be able
I could take these guys down.
But can you believe Wermut's words?
She knows that Haibara is Sherry.
She probably knows who I am.
But she won't tell anyone.
Right now, I have to believe her.
You should be careful of her.
You don't want to fall on your face...
It's Irish you gotta watch out for.
Well, until this is all over..,
I don't think we should see each other outside of school.
It's just a precautionary measure.

What do you want, Gin?
Where have you been for two hours?
Apparently in a place where you had to turn off your cell phone.
Does that worry you?
Very well.
Just focus on accomplishing your mission.
By the way,
...you used the drug to get rid of that high school detective...
...with that formula, didn't you?
What are you talking about?
Shin'ichi Kudô...
Remember?
What's the matter?
Sorry. I broke your rice bowl.
It's okay, but it's unusual for you to break dishes.
Yeah, really, what's wrong with me?
KÔRYÔ SPORTS PARK, AYASE TOWN
No doubt about it. The victim is Sumire Shindô.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
Yes, I understand.
Three o'clock then.
All right, see you later.
Was that Inspector Takagi?
Yes.
There's a meeting at three.
Any progress?
The body of Sumire Shindô was found.
And where?
He said in Ayase, Kanagawa Prefecture.
Is it the Seven Stone?
Yes,
the red circle is the one on the top right of the bottom four.
On the back was a triangle....
Huh?
- Hey! Off to school with you! - Yeah...
- She was there! - That's weird.
- Good morning. - Ah, Conan-kun!
It's bad! The dolphin's dorsal fin is gone!
The dorsal fin?
Ah, it's a fact.
There are leather glove prints!
We have a mysterious case!
You're exaggerating.
I'm sure someone got to it while cleaning and it fell off.
But we looked everywhere!
All right, I'll make another one.
Could they have taken the fin...?
Don't worry about it.
No doubt about it.
It was them!
You can see from up here..,
...how badly it could have turned out. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Isn't it strange?
Huh?
Both tires didn't get flat at the same time.
I wonder if there were nails scattered around then.
Snipers.
Someone could have been shooting at it.
From this bridge.
There was a car up here.
Impossible...
Say, Takagi-kun,
...it's a very wild idea..,
But I have a feeling that...
...but I have a feeling that there's a mysterious group at work here besides the perpetrator.
A mysterious group?
The same paint was stepped on twice in Shindô-san's studio.
Someone stepped on the tube. The paint came out.
Then someone stepped on the dried paint.
Doesn't that mean that after Shindô-san was taken,
someone else came?
Yes, do you think so?
Maybe the perpetrator was there until the paint dried.
One more thing.
I can't get the woman from the mall out of my mind.
Maybe she's one of those people, too.
...and she was in his neighborhood on purpose.
W... what? For what reason?
Satô-san, you think too much.
Maybe it's too far-fetched.
But if that's the truth,
there's someone inside the police force who's spying for these people.
And it must be someone who was at the conference.
What? The Black Knight's helmet?
It was destroyed! The people in the theater group were quite outraged.
The rice bowl...
Last night, I broke Conan-kun's.
And now the helmet Shin'ichi was wearing.
I don't have a good feeling.
You're seeing ghosts.
There's nothing connecting that kid and Shin'ichi-kun.
That's true, but...
I'd better tell him.
THE BLACK KNIGHT'S HELMET HAS BEEN DESTROYED.

BLACK KNIGHT'S HELM DESTROYED - The black knight's helmet?
Very bad.
My fingerprints are on the helmet.
Damn.
If the fin and now the helmet
and now the helmet...
What do I do? I have to act fast.
Otherwise I'll put everyone in danger.
The memory card!
With this card, I'll gain the upper hand!
I have to find the culprit!
It must be Shin'ichi-kun.
"Working on a risky case right now. Refrain from phone calls and text messages."
He writes.
What does he mean by "risky"?
At least let me hear you,
Shin'ichi...
That's it.
What worries me is this message "Tanabata Kyô...
What in the world...
CICADA SYMPHONY KYÔTO
Tanabata... Kyô...
Kyôto?
Oh, Kudô! It's been a long time!
So, what do you want to ask me?
It's on the exam, right?
So that's how it is.
Who are you talking to on the phone?
Don't scare me like that, idiot!
- I'm... I'm sorry. - I'm really sorry,
I thought I was going to die.
Who are you talking to on the phone that scares you so much?
Silly, Kudô, Kudô!
He's investigating these serial murders.
He asked me if I had any ideas about "Tanabata Kyôto."
'Sorry, Kudô.
Kazuha, the silly girl, had to interfere again.
- About "Tanabata Kyôto"... - Ah! The Mitarashi Festival!
The one at the Kitano-Tenman shrine.
Or the festival at Jishu Shrine. That's famous, too.
Yes, it is! Shall we go tonight?
If you want to go, go alone!
Did you hear that, Kudo?
Yes, but it doesn't ring a bell.
I bet.
What else can I think of?
Come on, let's go!
Kyoto is a day trip and we don't need a hotel.
Idiot! As if I'd stay in a hotel.
Did you forget about the big fire?
Cheapskate!
- You, Hattori... - Hattori?
What big fire?
Yes, there was a big fire in Kyoto the year before last.
Oh yeah, that was on Tanabata night.
Tell me more!
I think the hotel was called Vega.
Two guests were killed.
Hattori,
I want you to find out more about that fire.
It's urgent!
You got it!
Wait a minute, Heiji! What are you doing?
Class is starting!
Yes, you go tell the teacher..,
...that Hattori-kun went to visit...
Hattori-kun went to visit Orihime-san's Vega.
What? Hey! Who is this Orihime-san?
A fire...
The red circles and marks on the stones...
Do they indicate fire?
BEIKA LIBRARY
BUSINESS HOTEL FIRE
The cause of the fire was a guest's cigarette on the fifth floor.
The fire escape was not usable.
Another guest on the sixth floor
perished in the smoke.
Nanako Honjô of Jindai in Mitaka.
KÔSUKE MIZUTANI NANAKO HONJÔ
Mizutani-san!
Mizutani-san?
Mizutani-kun isn't here.
Do you know where he went?
So, you're Detective Môri's assistant.
I'm Shun Sawamura.
A law student at Jônan University.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you.
But please don't say anything to anyone.
The investigation is top secret.
Ah, so he sends a kid like you.
As for Kôsuke Mizutani-san and Nanako Honjô-san...
They were lovers.
Their parents were against the union and they ran away from Chiba.
Eloped...
On Tanabata of the year before last... The two of them went to Kyoto
and stayed at the hotel.
However
Mizutani-kun went alone to his friend in Kyôto.
Meanwhile, the fire occurred in the hotel.
"If only I had taken Nana with me..,
she would still be alive."
He said that to me and cried.
What does Mizutani-san do for a living?
He had many small jobs,
but since her death.
he hardly seems to work anymore.
He also didn't come to his apartment for a long time.
Where might Mizutani-san be now?
Well...
Ah, maybe he's in Chiba.
Today is the second anniversary of his death.
So he's in a temple?
It's possible.
You'd better ask Honjo-san's brother.
Wait a minute.
Before the girl died,
the brother often came here to visit her.
I should let him know if his sister is in trouble.
Yes, here she is! Look.
His business card. And this is Mizutani-kun.
Can I write down the number?
Yes, of course.
Can I have your cell phone number, too, Sawamura-san?
Yes.
Hello? Hattori?
Oh, Kudô, that was a hit,
a bull's-eye!

The names of the seven victims you emailed me,
and the names of the guests from the sixth floor match!
There were two other guests there.
Nanako Honjô-san and Kôsuke Mizutani-san.
Oh, you already know?
Well, how about that?
This guy named Mizutani
did the same research a year ago.
Apparently, this case is related to the fire
two years ago. There's no doubt about it!
But what does it all mean?
Assuming Mizutani is the culprit, what is his motive?
Her death was an accident, right?
Hattori...
This hotel, how many elevators does it have?
Elevators?
There's only one.
For how many?
Wait a minute.
Allowed for seven people.
Why are you asking for that, Kudô?
I'm getting off, I'm getting off.
Oh, I see! I got it, Kudô!
Yes. Probably on the day of the fire...
Nanako Honjo-san...
She was forced out of the elevator!
Forced out when the eighth guest wanted to get on.
That eighth guest is the one-stone, Jinno-san!
The other six stood at the places
of their respective red circles.
And the last circle was where Nanako-san was standing.
Presumably.
The mah-jongg stone itself resembles the shape of an elevator.
The line on the back represents the door.
No doubt about it.
When Jinno-san got in, the alarm sounded.
and he wanted to push someone out.
And Nanako-san became a target.
The other six looked away or have,
not to believe it themselves,
perhaps helped Jinno-san do it.
Nanako-san, who couldn't keep up with the elevator,
could no longer escape.
Am I wrong in my assumption?
No,
I'm thinking about the letters on the stones.
Yes, that the seventh is a triangle,
is quite strange.
Well, if the last circle was for Nanako-san,
there won't be any more murders.
I really hope so.
I'll try to find Mizutani-san.
Thank you, Hattori...
I really do.
Kudo...
Oh yes! I found a totally delicious okonomiyaki place!
Come visit me, and we'll go there.
J... Yes...
You have to come.
I'll wait for you.
Yeah. All right.
See you.
Kudô...
Absolutely.
What? July 7, two years ago?
And all the victims went to Kyoto that day?
Yes. The interviews made that clear.
So...
That the "Tanabata Kyô" the witness heard...
...should be "Tanabata Kyôto."
What happened on that day
in Kyôto that day is under investigation.
The question is,
what the message on the mah-jongg stones means.
On the seven stone
there was no red circle at the bottom left.
So probably another person will be murdered.
What's more
it is surely no coincidence that today is July 7.
Then... then today someone else will be....
Where and who could he...
Maybe one of us...
Ah!
I've got it!
These seven crime scenes
show the shape of an animal!
An animal?
Watch this.
If you connect the crime scenes
with a line like this...
This is how you should see it.
This long line is the neck, this is the chest..,
the front legs, the back and the hind legs.
In short, this is not Nessie of Loch Ness,
but an Assie from Lake Ashino!
Quack, quack.
Assie? Ah, ow ow ow.
There is such a thing?
No, never heard of it.
I don't see anything in it.
And if I'm still here...
How about that?
Well, now that you mention it....
It looks like an Assie.
But why an Assie?
Why not yassie from the yamanaka?
Notice the shape of the lake!
The lake Yamanaka is a whale.
Lake Ashino...
I got it, Môri-san!
The next crime scene is the tip of Assie's nose!
A bit naive, Inspector Yokomizo.
It's supposed to look like this...
But it's here!
I see! The location of the eye! Annaka in Gunma Prefecture!
I know Annaka very well.
I'm going there, too. You lead!
Yes!
I'll go with you!
Wha... what are you doing?
Let it go.
But only two people against a killer?
Two is enough.
That was fun!
Yeah, Conan-kun could have come with us.
Don't you think Conan's been acting strange lately?
He went home alone again today.
I'm sure he still has a cold.
He hasn't been to school for two days.
Ah, there he is!
A rhinoceros beetle!
This bus leaves from Beika Forest.

I see. The beetle sat down on the shoulder in the forest
and landed on the bus.
The tape!
Again?
So one was still so mean to others.
The poorest.
Not a chance. It's stuck very tightly.
We'll have the professor remove it!
And he can give us something to eat.
Kazuki-san, today it was just an anonymous bouquet.
That's right.
Good day.
Are you really detective Môri's assistant?
Yes.
I'm looking for Mizutani-san in connection with a case.
He didn't come to the requiem?
No. He came early this morning, laid some flowers...
and then left.
Just flowers?
Yes.
My parents can't forgive Kôsuke-kun for...
Kôsuke-kun for running off with my sister.
So...
Then the anonymous bouquet you mentioned..,
Is it Mizutani-san's?
Does "only one today" mean..,
does that mean there were others?
Yes, there were others besides his.
When? Do you know where they came from?
I do.
Um,
there were four at the funeral service.
From Matsumoto, Kawasaki, Numazu and Kamakura.
On the first anniversary of her death, three.
This time from Tokorozawa, Odawara and Hachiôji.
These are the addresses of the seven victims.
When I met Kôsuke-kun this morning..,
he said something strange.
Strange?
"Eight people I can't forgive.
There's still one left."
Hmm... This is the work of the same culprit.
The tape was stuck on again as a V.
Huh?
I see.
This could be a message.
A message?
Well then, do you know what he wants to tell us?
- Huh? - Nope...
The answer is "Help"!
What? Why?
Beetle is called Beetle in English.
My beloved car has a similar shape
and is therefore called Beetle.
Another thing.
If you combine "beetle" with the word "beat" you get
the name of the famous band Beatles!
Beatles, you say?
And the title of their first album is.
"Please, please me."
The second one is called "With the Beatles",
the third one "A Hard Days Night",
the fourth is called "Beatles For Sale"
and finally the fifth one is called "Help".
So, do you get it?
What are Beatles?
I think a foreign band.
Don't you know the Beatles?
Never heard of them!
That reminds me, my sister used to listen to them sometimes.
She liked oldies.
O... Oldies?
Instead of a quiz, he should have given us something to eat.
Help, that is,
someone asking for help, right?
I see.
This is a case for the Detective Boys!
Yes!
We now know the meaning of "Tanabata Kyôto."
All seven victims were hotel guests?
The victim of the fire was a young girl named Nanako Honjô.
Her boyfriend, a man named Kôsuke Mizutani,
came here last year to investigate the fire.
And two hours ago, this Heiji Hattori-kun was here,
to ask the same questions.
Yes. I'm a little interested in the case.
Oh, yes, Superintendent,
I'll tell you something.
The mah-jongg pieces represent the elevator.
An elevator?
There were nine guests on the sixth floor of the hotel.
Apart from Nanako-san and Mizutani himself, the other seven...
seven have already been murdered.
Who's left?
Oh, I know.
That's called "Chôzu," isn't it?
That's right! You know it well.
But I don't know how to use it properly.
Oh well, I'll show you.
Watch me.
What?
The position of the stars?
Yes.
The crime scenes show the position of Polaris...
as well as those of six stars from the Big Dipper.
Wait a minute.
Indeed.
This is more than similar.
If you put the star image on the map,
it's almost coherent.
The culprit is quite meticulous.
The mah-jongg tiles and the letters indicate
point to Polaris and the Big Dipper.
One and seven form
the Pole Star and the Big Dipper.
The letters are the Greek
capital letters
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta,
which are the names of the stars.
And, Haibara...
The location of the last star in the Big Dipper?
Coming up.
Yes, please.
There it is.
Minato district, near Shiba Park.
Near the oak tree should be the guy..,
who sent the help message.
- We have to help him! - Yes!
Detective Boys!
Let's go!
BEIKA FOREST
A short while ago, a boy with glasses came in..,
to ask about Mizutani-kun and Nanako-san.

A boy with glasses?
Yes. He said he was Detective Môri's assistant.
So Mizutani-san said the following?
"Eight people I can't forgive.
There's one left."
Yes.
Did something happen?
Did Mizutani-san...?
No, it's just routine.
What?
So the perpetrator is planning to kill someone else?
Yes, I think so.
And Conan-kun came here, too.
Conan-kun?
No, I would never give an order like that.
Not to a rascal like that.
Then who...
Could it have been Kudô-kun?
Superintendent, is Kôsuke Mizutani the culprit?
Yes, it's very likely.
But who else is left?
Where will he strike next?
Nana...
Kôsuke!
Hey, can I do it again?
I'm so happy!
It's the first time we're going on a trip together.
Kôsuke!
Nana! Nana!
Let go of me! Nana's in there!
Nana! Nana!
Nana...
Got it.
I'm going to start looking, too.
Bye.
Tsuburaya-kun isn't back either?
No, and it's already seven o'clock. Where did those three go?
They're ignoring my call about the detective badges.
Professor, could those three...
Huh?
- Yes? - Ah, Sawamura-san?
Yes?
What? Mizutani-kun and Nanako-san's hobby?
Yes. Could those two be star lovers?
That's right.
They moved here because the observatory is nearby.
So they are.
The two of them
especially liked Polaris and the Big Dipper.
The beautiful shape of the Big Dipper and
Polaris shining just north of it....
Looking at the stars
the two of them must have reaffirmed their love.
But to whom am I saying this.
You are a child.
Thank you.
A place closest to the stars here....
Good evening!
I'm at Tôto Tower right now, where the Tanabata event
where the Tanabata event is currently taking place.
Unfortunately, it's cloudy today,
but it is the last day
and there are a lot of visitors in yukata.
The weather outlook now follows.
A date in the yukata...
...will start to rain after 10 o'clock.
There will be thunderstorms in places.
Excuse me!
What is it, boy?
Can you hold on to this for me?
Yes, I can... Are you alone?
While I was in the bathroom,
Dad and my brother just went ahead.
Mean, isn't it?
Hitomi, your yukata looks nice!
You look cute too.
Come on, let's take a picture of the four of us!
Oh yes, lots of photos!
Well then! Laugh!
Did we really pass by here?
Huh?
The way is certainly wrong.
I'm hungry. Let's go home.
No. We have to find him on our own.
Right.
Don't you want to solve a case without Conan-kun at least once?
I do!
But... if we don't find that oak tree... if we don't find that oak tree...
Hmph.
Yeah, I got it!
We'll get help from the rhinoceros beetle!
They usually fly to trees that secrete the same sap.
That way.
What? Do we have to run?
We've identified a suspect
and he's probably going to commit another crime.
But we don't know where he is
and where the crime scene will be.
Does anyone have any ideas?
Hell, as we stand here...
...somebody could be getting whacked right now.
Hooray! The oak tree!
Oops? There's another one.
Maybe there's tape on it again.
A little more.
There is indeed tape on it.
That must be it.
That must be the guy who needs our help.
I'm sure it is.
But, it's kind of creepy.
Yeah, like it's haunted...
Knock it off.
Hm,
when you're out this far, the stars are really beautiful.
That one is the North Star.
And that's the Big Dipper.
Huh?
That shape... It's from somewhere...
What?
Polaris and Big Dipper?
So you're saying that the crime scenes represent the Pole Star
and the Big Dipper?
No doubt about it, Inspector.
Ah, the policewoman from before.
Yes...
So Mizutani-san and Honjô-san's hobby...
was stargazing?
Thank you very much, Superintendent.
Superintendent!
The place corresponding to the last star in the car..,
is Shiba Park.
Good!
Megure, you put out an APB on Mizutani and stand by.
The others go to Shiba Park! Hurry up!
Yes!
Oh, it's you.
Don't scare us like that.
What's that supposed to mean?
You can't still be prowling around.
We weren't prowling!
We want to help!

The person who calls for help through the bugs.
- You must go home. Your parents are worried... - It's still early.
Isn't it enough if we return home after the relief action?
Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!
I'll get it.
Yes, thank you.
That's nice of you.
Yes, this is Takagi's phone...
Ah, Agasa-san.
He can't answer the phone right now.
I'm sorry to bother you, but there's something...
It's a strange story...
The Beatles?
About...
Copy that. We'll be right there. We'll be right there.
Find a safe place to hide.
Takagi-kun, go to the Beika Forest.
- Yes, but... - Don't worry.
I'll take responsibility!
I understand, sir. I'll take responsibility.
Huh? Hey, where to now?
Huh? I don't know!
- To the left. - Yeah.
What? Conan-kun was on TV?
Yes. I saw him go into Tohto Tower by himself.
It was about eight o'clock.
Like this.
Don't worry. I'm sure he'll be home soon.
But he doesn't even have his cell phone on...
They're not answering.
Neither Takagi nor Satô.
It doesn't matter. Leave them alone.
Okay.
Mizutani is hiding here somewhere.
- Split up, find him and arrest him! - Yes, sir!
They won't be seen today.
The North Star and the Big Dipper,
that you and Nanako-san loved so much.
Boy...
Ah, about that visitor...
You have seen him?
Yes, he often comes just before we close, so...
I recognize him.
It was about 7 o'clock when he went to the observation deck alone.
So you're an assistant to this detective Môri.
Well...
It's a pity.
You go all the way up to the sky and you don't see any stars.
No, I see them.
Anytime, no matter where I am.
These particular stars...
What? Observation deck?
Yeah. This lady said she saw him.
Did you see him leave?
No, I didn't.
Good!
The suspect is on the observation deck.
He's waiting for someone
to commit his final act.
We rush in, apprehend the suspect...
and protect the victim.
The suspect is believed to be armed.
So be on alert.
Please keep the interior lights on.
Copy that.
- Let's go! - Yes!
Mizutani-san?
After this wine, you want to die, don't you?
"Eight people I can't forgive.
There's one left."
That one is you,
aren't you, Mizutani-san?
Wha... what?
When you found out exactly why Nanako-san died..,
you must have been shocked and angry.
I can sympathize with that.
So you went to the hotel to inquire
about the seven of them.
It is as you say.
If only I had taken
I'd have taken Nana to see my friend,
she'd still be alive.
When I think about it.
I can't forgive myself.
Suicide is wrong.
- Suicide extinguishes one's own ego. - I know!
I know that, but
I can't bear to live in a world
without Nana.
Besides
- I'm facing the death penalty anyway. - No.
After all, you didn't kill anyone.
There was someone who was willing
who was willing to murder those seven and asked you
and asked you to take the blame and commit suicide, didn't he?
You didn't refuse because you blamed yourself...
for Nanako-san's death.
But
...who that person really hated and wanted to kill..,
is you, Mizutani-san!
And that is,
because it was you who robbed him of his beloved sister.
Isn't it so, brother of Nanako-san,
Kazuki Honjô-san?
Brother! What are you doing here?
You have no right to call me that!
Kid, how did you know it was me?
I didn't understand.
At all.
Suppose Mizutani-san was the culprit.
Why would he choose the location of the stars as the scene of the crime?
He would be defiling his beloved stars by doing so.
But if it was possibly the idea of
someone else's idea to blame the star-fan Mizutani-san
Mizutani-san...
I found this thought plausible.
In addition, the perpetrator
Polar Star and Big Dipper precisely on the map,
to place the bodies there. A meticulous person.
But the sign on Mizutani-san's apartment
was a bit crooked and the writing was not very nice either.
In contrast, the number you wrote on the business card was
was written accurately.
There was even a pencil line for writing straight.
You carefully noted
the addresses of the people who had sent flowers.

That indicates a fastidious character, don't you think?
Who on earth are you?
Conan Edogawa, detective!
Thank you for coming.
Agasa-san, where are the children?
Their parents picked them up.
I'll take you there.
Yes, please.
Ai-kun, you wait in the car.
You told Mizutani-san the details about Nanako-san's death,
didn't you?
Yes.
He told me that on that day...
on the same floor of the same hotel that day...
Sumire Shindô.
SUMIRE SHINDÔ EXHIBITION OF NEW WORKS
SUMIRE SHINDÔ EXHIBITION
To talk with her, I went to the exhibition.
There I overheard a conversation between
Sumire and Ryûzaki.
You told Mizutani-san about it.
But you were lying.
On the anniversary of Nanako-san's death
the other guests on the sixth floor sent flowers.
One or two would do so because they felt guilt.
But since it was all seven,
only the feeling of gratitude can be imagined.
They expressed their gratitude
because Nanako-san had given them the elevator.
Then Nana
was not forced out at all.
She went out by herself...
Yes, that's how it was.
Nanako was a kind person.
Even so!
Even if it was like that,
she had to die because the others were in the elevator!
Mizutani-san...
Certainly Nanako-san
died for the seven of them in the end.
But if you sacrifice yourself
and take the blame for Honjo-san and commit suicide,
that is something completely different.
As if you
a bright star in the sky
with a stone on the ground.
Nana...
- I'll leave it. - What?
Sorry, I'll leave dying.
He opened my eyes.
Mizutani...
I'm sure Nana in heaven
wouldn't want me to commit suicide either, I think.
I'll give that back.
I don't need it anymore.
Please turn yourself in, brother.
Damn it.
Honjo-san...
These are the stolen things of the seven victims, aren't they?
They gave them to Mizutani-san to make him look like...
to make him look like a murderer.
That's why I came here.
Because Detective Môri was investigating..,
I was afraid I'd be found out.
I lied to you,
because I hoped you would take revenge on them.
But you didn't have the courage.
So I had to do it myself!
That's not courage!
- It's arrogance! - Shut up!
Detective Môri is not here. You're here alone!
You're embarrassing me!
That was close.
Matsumoto from Police Headquarters.
Police Headquarters?
Are you all right?
Well, yes...
We'll take you down to the station.
Oh no!
Damn it!
You won't get me.
So it is you.
So it is you, Irish.
- Police! - Freeze!
I knew it!
- Superintendent! - Superintendent?
- Snap out of it! - Superintendent?!
What's he doing here?
The other one is an impostor!
He double-crossed him.
What?!
The chief is Beatles generation.
I thought it was impossible...
Inform the commissioner!
Yes!
It's me. What is it?
They know.
That he's not the real one.
Got it.
Wormwood...
He was actually here?
Yeah, I got his skateboard.
I thought it was strange he didn't pick it up.
Could he still be inside?
No way.
If he was, that would be bad. He might run into the killer.
E... a murderer?
The police are inside investigating.
Sonoko, you wait here!
Wait a minute, Ran!
Hey! Stop!
What about Superintendent Matsumoto?
Is he...?
No, he's still alive.
I need him.
I want him to play the role of the culprit.
Is that the memory card with the NOC list?
Yes, it is...
Since when do you know I'm not the real one?
I had a vague suspicion.
Wormwood is a disguise specialist.
But someone else was planted.
That means her figure was not suitable for doubling.
In that sense, you're the best candidate for it.
I see.
As was to be expected from Shin'ichi Kudô.
Until the fingerprints matched, I had my doubts.
Have you told your boss about this?
No, not yet.
I haven't told anyone yet.
Not even Gin?
No.
Shin'ichi Kudô, remember?
I can't remember the names of all the guys I killed.
Something wrong with him?
No, it's nothing.
Concentrate on your mission.
Why?

He once shot and killed a member who made a mistake
and left the body in the burning Haido City Hotel,
so that it charred to death.
That member was
to me someone I revered like a father.
Haido City Hotel...
Pisco?
You've done a lot of research on us.
He failed to kill Shin'ichi Kudo.
And he can't see through your identity.
He messed up big time.
I will bring you before that lord...
As a witness, to put this affected
and cold-blooded guy.
My identity is known only to this guy.
If I can beat him...
You can't stun him anymore.
All that's left...
Don't worry. I won't kill you,
I won't kill you.
I just want you to be unconscious.
If I don't bring you in alive,
that gentleman probably won't believe
that you are Shin'ichi Kudo.
That's...
Inspector Chiba!
Inspector Chiba? Are you okay?
He's just unconscious.
Like the others, I guess.
Conan-kun?
Hey, you!
Wait up!
Conan-kun!
Conan-kun, what happened?
Ran-neechan...
- Are you okay? - Are you all right?
Superintendent Matsumoto!
It's terrible! There are policemen downstairs...
Yes, we were attacked.
What?
No, lukewarm...
What? What is it?
Run! Run! It's him...
You're not Superintendent Matsumoto.
Don't...
Don't worry.
Like Kyôgoku-san, I can't dodge a gun,
but a gun...
Ran, did you know..,
a rifle bullet travels at about 1,000 meters per second?
A pistol bullet, on the other hand, is only a third as fast.
It's about 350 meters per second.
What's so funny?
Do you think you can dodge the bullet?
That's exactly what it is.
Amusing.
Try it.
Amazing.
Not bad, my lady.
I'd forgotten..,
that Miss is a master of karate.
Run!
You're wasting my time.
Ran, don't get up!
Leave the rest to me,
Keep quiet!
Damn you!
You run!
I'm having a lot more fun this way.
Shit!
Too bad.
That almost worked.
What's up? Is that all?
Good! Keep it up.
Shouldn't we stop playing tag?
The situation has reversed.
Shit.
Let's have the memory card.
They're here.
The situation has reversed.
It's me.
So?
Do you have the memory card?
Yes.
I can barely see it.
Keep holding it out.
Tsk.
That's it. Further forward.
Shoot.
Bingo!
I was going to shoot.
Aniki...
Look down.
That's...
He can't get away.
Good work, Irish.
Huh?
There's another one.
Hey, come on! Wake up! Hey!
Don't worry. It wasn't a vital spot.
I'll get you fixed up as soon as I can.
Now I understand why...
- Wormwood has a soft spot for you. - Don't speak!
When the wound has healed,
I'll find out who your boss is. You got that?
Irish!
Shin'ichi Kudo...
Hunt us down for all time.
Irish!
Ts.
He used Irish as a shield.
Don't let him get down.
Use it!
Got it!
Shit!
Oh no, Ran's downstairs!
There he is. Keep going!
Aniki, now what?
Chianti, smoke him out.
Okay!
Damn.
What now?
Tear gas!?
He's coming out.
Track him to the top.
The mouse is trapped.
From the top. Shoot from the top.
Then he has no place to hide.
I got it.
Shit.
What do I do now? I'm sitting ducks.
Damn it! What do I do?
Now let's see your face.
He's... he jumped off!
I guess he realizes he can't escape.
Go, go, go, go!
- We're hit. - What's happening?
I'm losing control!
All right, we're moving out.
You got it.
What was that?
Who was that guy?
Very Silver Bullet.
Great class.
Suddenly there was a bang...
Do you guys feel that tired?
Fortunately, everyone's fine.
Sorry about that.
So, Ran-chan,
I'm sure you'll be asked about the details.
Are you ready then?
Sure.
I'll find someone to drive you home.
Please wait here.
Thank you. You sure you're okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes.
Right, I'll get something to drink.
That's not necessary.
Don't be so modest.
Thanks.
Ran-nêchan,
everything's fine now.
The case is solved, Shin'ichi-nîchan said.
Now that you mention Shin'ichi...

Ah, he's, um, he said he had another case....
He just left again?
Yes... and...
I'm probably not supposed to tell anyone
about him.
Yes...
Oh, yeah,
you can call him now.
I can call him?
Ah, no,
He asks you to call him, I think he said.
At least I could hear him. That's enough.
Besides, hearing aside,
there are people who can only meet once a year.
Yeah, alive and nowbody knows me.
I like to see your eyes chase on the highway speed
can't touch me now. Run!
It's my soul... rewind.
It's my soul... rewind.
You left the room again tonight after all.

Benz on rims ride with the nitro tell your boyfriend

In the crashed helicopter
no bodies were found, they say.
Yes.
They left it before the explosion.
In the end, Irish's identity remains unknown...
and the police have absolutely nothing on him.
I can hardly tell them anything.
But for him to be locked up
in a place like that for ten days...
Even the superintendent didn't see the face of his kidnapper.
Anyway
we have the children to thank for his release.
Yes.
Irish died before he could reveal the hiding place.
Irish...
Shin'ichi Kudo...
Keep hunting us for all time.
I'll hunt you.
Until I crush you!
