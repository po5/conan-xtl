- Here you go. - Thank you.
Have you been waiting long?
Strange place for a meeting...
Can we change languages? So no one overhears us...
You don't get funny ideas in front of other people.
You almost make it sound like I'm out to get you.
Don't I?
I thought our relationship was good and friendly.
No idle banter, please.
Just tell me your answer to my proposal.
Is it "yes"... or "no?"
Before I answer you...
Let me guess what you ordered.
Iced tea...
It's not iced tea.
It's champagne. No, it's wine.
Not red, but white. A well chilled Meursault.
Please, your Meursault.
Where... how did you know?
I read your mind.
Did you...
- Did you... - I don't want it.
What is it?
My answer is "no."
Thank you for your help.
Elevator going up.
First floor.
Is everything okay?
But what...?
Stay calm, please!
Follow our instructions!
Wait!
What are you doing?
I'm securing the crime scene.
Otherwise, people will trample over it, won't they?
Inspector!
- Where's the one I called? - Already inside.
Thank you.
I've kept you waiting, Rishi.
Inspector Aidan! Thank you for calling me in.
It happened at the mall up ahead.
This case could get a little more complicated.
This man, Leon Lowe, discovered the body.
Oh, Mr. Lowe!
You were one of his favorite students, weren't you?
Could you ask him not to get too involved?
I probably can't. But I'll give him a quick hello.
Mr. Lowe!
Rishi!
- Long time no see. - Too long.
- Long time no see. - Long time no see.
- Let's speak Japanese. - Yes.
You work as a civilian volunteer officer for the police?
Quite a career!
Thanks to your teaching
in the behavioral psychology of criminals, Professor!
Don't call me that anymore.
I am now a normal private person. But
that the perpetrator had even planted a bomb...
The car that exploded belonged to the murder victim, Sherilyn Tan.
She was an excellent lawyer.
She will certainly have had enviers. And dealings with dangerous people.
Is the inspector in?
Excuse me. Excuse me. Let me through!
What's going on?
There's something on the wall in the elevator.
What? What is it?
What is it?
- What's happening? - It's really blood!
Forget it.
I'm begging you!
- No means no. - Please!
What's wrong?
He's trying to get his hands on that drug again so he can change back.
After the whole nasty business at the school trip!
Somehow I managed to do it there too!
So don't worry! Please give it to me!
Where are you going anyway?
To Singapore.
Look!
At that tournament, even the undefeated in 400 fights will fight!
Oh! You're talking about Makoto Kyôgoku!
Sonoko said she wanted to watch this tournament.
Together with old Kogoro and Ran. She invited me, too,
but I can't leave like this...
That's right... Your passport is still Shin'ichi's.
That's why I'm begging you, Haibara!
You're a pain!
You'd better give up this time.
Oh, I would have loved to go...
Don't be so downhearted!
Okay, let's play something to cheer you up!
What, already?
Here comes... the "Asian Quiz"!
Which festive activity is most popular in Singapore?
DEEPAVALI FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS
One: the Festival of Lights!
OLD CALENDAR NEW YEAR CELEBRATION
Two: New Year's celebration according to the old calendar.
SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AT THE FLAG RAISING CEREMONY
Three: singing the anthem raising the flag.
BIG MARINA BAY FIREWORKS
Four: the big Marina Bay fireworks display!
What's with the costume?
It's simple.
SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AT THE FLAG RAISING CEREMONY
"Singing the anthem while raising the flag."
It is, after all, "Singapore."
Ha, that's the right answer!
SINGAPORE
You are really good!
- So, one more question! - Thanks, that's enough.
It's really a bit boring without the little ones.
Pah, that stupid Haibara...
MANY ACCIDENTS: PLEASE SLOW DOWN!
Ran... Ran-neechan! What's going on? What are you...
What are you... doing here...?
Ran... no-no...
I've been waiting for you all this time.
Where am I?
It's huge!
That's Ran's voice! Where am I?

I'm locked in something! Damn it!
Okay, so...
The...
Merlion...?
I'm in Singapore?!
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE STEEL BLUE FIST
I'm high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
SHIN'ICHI KUDÔ
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran,
I watched men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on it,
that I didn't notice the man behind me.
He was administering a poison to me.
When I awoke...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised me not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked what my name was, I spontaneously said, Conan Edogawa.
CONAN EDOGAWA
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father is a detective.
One of my favorite rivals is this man:
Kaitô Kid.
A mysterious master thief and master of disguise.
For some reason, he knows my true identity.
But I'll catch him eventually!
Kid's favorite rival is Makoto Kyôgoku.
High school student and undefeated in 400 fights, masterful karateka!
And apparently deeply in love with Sonoko Suzuki, Ran's girlfriend and the
and the founder of the Suzuki company.
What are you looking at! Go on, keep up the chanting!
I'm small, but my mind isn't!
No case remains unsolved!
There's always only one truth!
My hand...?
And my gadgets are gone!
Wait, Ran was around here somewhere...
Wait for me, Ran-neechan!
Ah, Shin'ichi!
Here we are!
Sorry about that! I kept you waiting, didn't I?
Where have you been? We were looking for you!
The old man was hot, so I put him in the shade.
Thanks a lot!
Mr. Môri is still the same, isn't he?
Hey, Ran!
Buy me some water, please!
Oh well, what can I do... Alright! Come on, let's go!
- Come on, hurry! - J... Yes!
Well, this looks promising...
Son of a bitch!
Now I'm back among the living!
Hey, Pops, what's that around your neck?
Ah, that! It's got my passport in it.
So it can't be stolen. Good, isn't it?
But, Pop, you don't have to do that. It's very safe here in Singapore!
Hello! Did you wake up?
So it was really you!
But how did you get out of the suitcase?
With this.
If you put the top behind the slide..,
you can also open the zipper from the inside.
And I thought I could leave it for you... You're a tough one.
Hey, that's what I'm supposed to say, Kaitô Kid!
Oh, there he is.
But what the hell are you up to?
You've already figured it out. Look, there.
WORLD KARATE TOURNAMENT IN SINGAPORE
The tournament that Sonoko...
The legendary treasure,
which is said to have sunk with a pirate ship off Singapore
off the coast of Singapore...
The largest, purest blue sapphire in the world, also called...
"The Steel Blue Fist."
SINGAPORE: TREASURE LIFTED FROM PIRATE SHIP!
A huge jewel, recovered last year by Zhon Han Chen.
Zhon Han Chen, that's one of the most powerful men in Singapore, right?
That's right. And the good man loves martial arts more than anything else.
He put the jewel in a belt
and is now holding a karate tournament for it.
So the Iegendary Jewel shall belong to the winner of the tournament.
- Super rich people and their hobbies... - Indeed.
I thought about getting the jewel in the chaos of the tournament....
But as a kid, I can't just walk in here.
If all you want is the jewel,
you don't have to drag me here!
This matter is a bit special.
I'll explain the details to you as we go along.
- You... - What?
Where's Shin'ichi?
Oh, I'm missing.
Wait, Kid!
If you touch one hair on Ran's head, you'll pay for it!
I'm afraid I can't guarantee anything.
Then I'll tell them who you really are!
Forget about that.
The only reason you were able to get into Singapore...
is because of this suitcase.
A special model, impervious to baggage screening.
It's equipped with a device that delivers oxygen for 12 hours..,
...and special padding to prevent painful pressure points..,
from developing painful pressure points.
Do you understand what that means,
Master Detective?
You don't have a passport and
and you can't leave Singapore without my help.

You can't go back to Japan.
There you are, Shin'ichi!
You always just disappear without...
There... it's the squirt! How did you get here?
Conan-kun?
Oh, he's running away!
The resemblance is really striking, isn't it?
He's from around here, though.
Really?
- You're too easily fooled! - Hey, kid.
What's your name? Or rather... Do you speak Japanese?
Uh...
This kid...
CONAN DOYLE RANPO EDOGAWA
Arthur!
My name is Arthur Hirai!
Arthur Hirai?
My mom is Japanese, so...
I am Sonoko Suzuki.
And I'm Ran Môri.
And that man over there
is my father Kogorô Môri.
- Nice to meet you! - G... Nice to meet you.
Ran, please wait a minute, I'll be right back.
Ah... okay.
Where's your mom and dad?
Ah, uh...
They're in Japan
What? And you're left here all alone?
- Yes. Don't worry, I'm used to it. - I see...
In that case, why don't you come with us?
May I?
Of course you can.
Oh, I should go check on my dad for a minute.
O... okay!
He's been a long time coming!
At least he could have written! We were supposed to meet here...
- Hey there, get out of the way! Get out of the way! - Get out of the way!
What are you staring at, huh?
Who are they?
The guy in the middle is Reijirô Nakatomi.
Nakatomi? Oh, the director of the Nakatomi shipping company!
An efficient businessman, but he's the subject of dark rumors.
Hey, sweetie! Are you all alone here in Singapore?
- Do you want to go with me? - I don't have time for this.
Get out of here.
Should you really be saying that?
If I wanted to, I could easily pull you into my car...
NOT HERE YET? I'LL WAIT OUTSIDE THE MERLION.
Sonoko!
- Shin'ichi? - You don't have to interfere.
Hey!
The lady is with me. Is there a problem?
D... you...
Makoto-san! Read your messages!
I'm not so good at modern technology...
You'll regret this! Next time, you're dead meat!
Makoto-san! I was so scared!
Sorry I'm late.
Hey man, you're really cool!
I can do that too!
Ha! And ha! Ha!
- Hey, karate boy! - How brave of you!
Come on, don't be shy, boy!
Sonoko, are you okay?
Yeah! Makoto-san protected me!
Good to see you again!
It's nice to see you, too. And who are you?
It's an honor. I am Shin'ichi Kudô.
I am Makoto Kyôgoku.
Makoto-san, did something happen?
No, no. I just feel like I've met Kudô-kun before.
Ah, it's just your imagination!
We've seen the Merlion. Let's go back to the hotel.
Well, that's...
What, you can't participate in the tournament?
We came all the way here to see you fight!
I'm sorry.
My participation
was only possible thanks to the invitation of a certain person.
- In other words, thanks to a sponsor? - Yes.
Sherilyn Tan, a lawyer, has agreed..,
to pay for all the costs of my participation in the tournament.
But unfortunately she died completely unexpectedly.
And today her successor told me to please cancel this agreement.
Oh no...
At the tournament
the strongest karateka of Singapore should participate...
I would have liked to fight him once, but...
Okay!
Then I'll be your sponsor!
Just leave it to me!
There she is, the daughter of the Suzuki conglomerate!
UNCLE JIROKICHI
So, the problem is solved!
We were able to enroll you again with a special invitation!
- Is that true, Sonoko-san? - Yes!
I had Makoto-san put up at our hotel!
Now we have a double date!
That's right.
Now that everything's settled, let's go back to the hotel!
I want to finally drink a beer!
Môri-san!
Are you Mr. Kogorô Môri?
Uh... Yes.
Rishi, civilian volunteer police officer.
- It's a great honor! - Oh...
That's nice...
- Uh... volunteer police officer? - Yes!
I'm participating in an investigation
as an expert in behavioral psychology.
- Is that so? I see... - To tell you the truth...
I had heard that you were in Singapore, and I was waiting for you here.
- You were waiting for me? - Yes, I was.

Most tourists come here once.
But why did you ask me...?
Well, I'd like to ask you to assist me on one of my cases.
That's out of the question. Because I'm on vacation now!
Ah, I think you'd better go with him...
Huh? Why?
Even if he's just a volunteer, maybe he can recommend
he can recommend you some cheap, good bars!
Or the casino...
You know what I mean?
Oh, uh... yes!
That could be good...
Good! Master detective Môri will assist you to the best of his ability, for once!
- It's an honor! - Oh man...
In Japan, my father's homeland, you're a hero,
and I'm a fan too!
Well, it's like this... A Singaporean businessman received this message.
I WILL GET THE BLUE STONE - Kaitô Kid!
I WILL GET THE LEGENDARY TREASURE GUARDED BY THE LION. KAITÔ KID
The Suzuki group of companies is now said to be the sponsor
of Kyôgoku. Can you beat him?
Don't worry.
I will defeat any opponent with a single punch.
Good to know.
Come in.
Excuse me.
Mr. Ramanathan is here with someone he'd like you to meet.
He's early. Show him into the lobby.
Very well.
So, uh... Where are we on the Kid?
I'm sorry, but we're still investigating.
As for Sherilyn Tan... There's a problem with the way the information's being handled.
I have a hunch who might be behind it.
Well, then, please, take care of it.
That's just great.
Pop, be reasonable.
Oh! That armor is really cool, too!
You all right?
J... Yeah, I'm...
Dad! Behave yourself.
I'm really sorry.
But tell me, who is this Leon Lowe anyway?
Originally, Leon-sensei
was a well-known behavioral psychologist.
He worked with the police...
...with the police.
Really? So he was Singapore's master detective, so to speak?
Two years ago, he quit and
and founded what is now a very successful private security firm.
I also studied behavioral psychology of criminals with Leon-sensei.
I see.
So this Leon received the advance notice?
No. I'll explain in order.
Take a look at this.
What the Kaitô Kid is after..,
is a jewel called the Steel Blue Fist.
It belongs to a rich businessman named Zhon Han Chen.
It was to him that Kid's advance notice was sent.
Then maybe we'd better go to this Zhon Han?
Well, the jewel is kept here in this mansion in the basement.
What, the jewel is here?
Yes. At the request of its owner.
The vault here is equipped with specially designed, state-of-the-art systems...
and is more secure than...
State-of-the-art? Well, then I guess the Kid's gonna have to...
the Kid's really going to cut his teeth this time, huh?
- Says he of all people, huh? - What are you talking about?
No matter how modern this safe is,
Kid-sama will crack it in no time!
Sonoko...
You know them too, Ran!
Kid's beautiful theft techniques!
If he wants, he can steal the heart of every woman in the world...
Stop, Sonoko!
Ah... Well... Except Ran and me, of course!
Right, Ran?
J... yes, of course.
Watch out or you'll get run over.
Well, well, well!
A beautiful indoor garden!
Yes, not bad.
Good afternoon, everyone.
I'm Leon Lowe.
And this is Hezli Jamaluddin,
head of my security detail and my bodyguard, keeping us company.
Mr. Kyôgoku!
- I was hoping to meet you. - Nice to meet you!
- I was hoping to meet you. - Thank you!
I also practice karate and have always wanted to compete against you.
I have a training room...
You are the famous master detective Kogorô Môri!
Ah, thank you very much, it's an honor!
That my name is known even here abroad...
Strange... I don't feel anything...
Strange...
I don't feel anything...
What is it?
Such a surprise...
Impossible...
And you're Shin'ichi Kudô, high school student and detective?
I'm glad.
You look more like a stage magician than a detective.
Your fingers
are slender and supple.
Well, as a detective, I don't use my physical strength so much,
but rather this up here.
I see.
Oh! And I see Miss Sonoko Suzuki over there, don't I?
You have to be careful of that guy.
You can't go in there! Wait!

Don't worry, it's all right.
Oh! Kogorô Môri-sensei!
My wife and I are both big fans of yours!
Oh... Oh yeah?
Picture! May I take a picture?
I'm sorry. He just came rushing in.
That's all right.
I would like to show you my vault now.
I'd like to show you my vault.
Oh, that's great! I'd love to go with you.
Oh, that sounds great! I would love to accompany you.
I want you to admire the "Steel Blue Fist" from up close!
Behind this door is the pride of our company: the vault.
It can only be opened by a strictly limited number of people.
The indestructible walls are made of a heat-resistant alloy.
- What's going on? - Ah, excuse me! Nothing, nothing.
...the position of each compartment is periodically changed.
The room is a unique custom-made piece,
into which my ideals and ideas have been incorporated.
What?
Please take a step back.
This is the sign of the pirate king, the jewel,
which is called the "Steel Blue Fist"!
- But that's a huge sapphire! - Do you see it?
Yes, thank you very much!
I see.
As long as it's here, even the Kid won't be able to get the jewel.
Unfortunately, that won't be the case.
Because during the karate tournament
the belt will be displayed at the venue.
This means that during the tournament
it will be kept at the venue.
Of course, it will be strictly guarded, but not as well as here.
I see...
But I suppose you will also guard the stadium....
But you will also guard the stadium....
Of course, we will ensure security at all costs.
If something happens to the "Fist"..,
you will have to pay a huge compensation.
You said that the security in the stadium is less strict.
So you think the Kid is waiting for the Sapphire to be brought to the stadium?
to the stadium?
That's right. Stealing it here would be too big a risk.
That's right. I want to do everything I can...
in protecting the jewel.
Thank you very much.
Piece of cake!
And...
And the print was mine!
Isn't that too easy?
There you are.
Kaitô Kid... I can't believe you got in this far...
You're really good.
You're brimming with confidence!
I'm sorry, but I cannot and must not give you the jewel.
I don't want to pay Zhon Han Chen any compensation.
My job is to steal treasures like this jewel.
And the more difficult that is, the more enthusiastic and passionate
I become!
It's over.
DISCLOSURE
I hope you'll enjoy Singapore's water.
That he would use a taser....
Kid!
You can't be serious!
What the...?!
- What's going on? - Kid's...
Don't worry. I'm always prepared... I'm always prepared...
Don't worry. I'm always... I'm always...
To be first class
means always being prepared for the very worst!
...and one step ahead.
...one step ahead.
I've got to get out of here somehow, right away.
There he is!
What a blow! If I hadn't jumped back, this would have ended badly!
That's trespassing on private property, right?
But what are you doing here?
I was invited to train here.
That I can fight you...
I don't want that!
Finished talking!
Get ready!
A soccer ball...?
Where did you get...
Thanks a lot, Master Detective!
This thing is great!
You can take off with it even when there's no wind! I have Jii to thank for that!
But...
For them to go that far...
You saved my life!
I was right to give you back your equipment.
Not that I wanted to save you...
But please tell me the real reason,
why you brought me here!
Leon had been searching for the Steel Blue Fist for several years.
When he was about to retrieve the treasure..,
Zhon Han Chen snatched it from under his nose.
As it seemed, someone had given away the location of the wreck to Chen.
The most likely suspect was Sherilyn Tan.
She had worked for Leon as a legal consultant,
but then they fell out.
Rumor has it that her motivation was to sponsor Kyôgoku...
...was to prevent Jamaluddin's victory.
And thus to prevent the jewel from coming into Leon's possession!
If this is true,
then it is also plausible that they

leaked the info about the wreck.
So this Sherilyn Tan was murdered.
If she was the leak,
then Leon had a motive to kill Sherilyn.
How do the police feel about that?
- Leon was unfortunately removed from the list of suspects. - Why is that?
- Because there is a much more likely suspect. - There is?
The police didn't disclose it,
but a map was found where Sherilyn Tan was murdered.
My advance notice.
I see. But...
Why do I have to see this great view with him, of all people?
I'd much rather see it with...
It's time for you to become Arthur Hirai again.
But say... I guess "Arthur" comes from "Arthur Conan Doyle."
And "Hirai"?
Oh, that...
RANPO EDOGAWA (PSEUDONYM)
I used Ranpo Edogawa's real name Tarô Hirai.
TARÔ HIRAI (REAL NAME)
+ ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE = ARTHUR HIRAI
Oh, I see.
But more important: The whole thing is clearly a trap!
That is also clear to me.
That's why I brought you along, master detective.
You're good at that sort of thing, aren't you?
Now I know why. But I don't like this method at all.
The poor kid...
...can't just let this go!
You're late!
I've been waiting all this time!
Ah, sorry.
But look!
The view is beautiful!
Really romantic...
Oh, don't be coy.
We are a couple, after all!
J... Yes...
What, really?
Damn it...
Doesn't Ran realize that this isn't the real Shin'ichi?
But if she noticed, I wouldn't be able to go back!
When you say Singapore,
of course you think "Singapore Sling"! Another one!
Môri-san?
S... S... You...
May I sit with you?
B... bi... please, with pleasure, go ahead! Let's drink together!
Well, the thing is... I...
Oh, no! How could this happen to me?
I'm really sorry!
Ah, don't be! Don't worry about it!
Mr. Môri, there's a call for you.
Call?
A call for you.
What, for me? From whom?
Môri-san!
I really need to talk to you.
Come there tomorrow!
Really...
What? He hung up!
Come on, really! I'll drink more now!
Well, who's going to win the tournament?
- Makoto Kyôgoku, of course! - He's never lost before!
Oh, really? I didn't know that yet!
We learn that if the place, direction and intensity of our efforts are right..,
they'll bear fruit!
Well, did you understand that?
Yes!
He's fast!
This Jamaluddin seems to be really strong!
The power of the heavyweight class coupled with speed and technique.
A tough opponent.
Ha, the captain of the Teitan Karate Club really has a different eye!
You, tell me...
If Kyôgoku-san wins the jewel, you'll have no chance of ever
there's no way you'll ever get it...
That's right.
I'd like to stay away from that guy as much as possible...
Oh! There's Makoto-san!
Come on, cheer him on too!
Why is that little guy with us?
Somehow he's taken a liking to me.
Take a bow!
Take a bow.
Begin!
- Scary... - Yes! Makoto-san is so cool!
I wish I was with him....
INCOMING CALL POPS
INCOMING CALL: PAPS - That's Pops!
But I'm telling you! I'm not a suspect!
Pops!
What the hell happened?
Ran! Please talk to those two gentlemen!
I turned in all the metal objects!
But still...
No entry!
- That's enough! - No!
No!
Damn... But I can't get in like this!
Môri-san! Are you all right?
Oh, Rishi-san!
He's part of the team. Let him in.
Very well.
Thank you Mr. Rishi!
Nice to meet you again.
After the presentation at the opening.
the belt is now in the vault downstairs.
If you like, I can take you there.
But what took you so long?
Ah... I was patrolling a bit.
He slept off his hangover.
The security code changes every ten minutes,
and we receive the code by computerized message.
The codes are only given to Inspector Aidan, myself and
Leon-sensei, who is also the administrator of the vault system.
There's really nothing in the room at all.
Where are you thinking!
There are weight sensors in the floor, cameras in the ceiling.

And guards are posted around the stadium.
Good! Even the most notorious master thief will come to the end of his rope!
Môri-san! Smoking is prohibited here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I completely forgot about it in my tipsiness!
Someone gave it to me yesterday because he wants to talk to me...
This is Leon-san's secretary's card.
What? Really?
I was drunk and I don't remember exactly...
How did you recognize it?
On the card is the symbol of Leon-san's company.
What? A symbol?
"I'll be waiting behind the National Stadium in front of Gate No. 3 at 3:00 in the afternoon."
That's what it says.
And, "Please don't tell anyone about this."
I see. Three o'clock in the afternoon, that means...
That's right now!
Môri-san!
Anyone who keeps a lady waiting should be ashamed!
That was a good fight.
I'm already looking forward to the semifinals and the finals.
Thank you.
Your strength is special.
How about... Wouldn't you like to be my bodyguard?
Excuse me.
Wait a minute. I was just kidding, of course.
But I want to ask you something.
Tell me...
What is your fist for?
You seek strength...
What is the goal of your quest?
What is it that drives you on and on?
You have no answer?
An imperfect fist that has no goal is dangerous.
You could make not only yourself unhappy, but also those around you.
My environment
- unhappy... - Exactly.
For example, the person you love.
Surely you have someone you love?
Your fist could cause the person you love..,
...that the person you love gets hurt.
What would you do if that happened?
I look forward to your fights tomorrow.
Is there anything else?
That was a good fight!
Sonoko-san!
You just didn't show up, so I came to check on you.
I'm sorry. I kept you waiting.
Well, let's go have lunch now!
- There's a little restaurant... - I'm sorry...
- But you'll have to go alone. - What, but why?
I'm really sorry!
But Shin'ichi can't leave because of the jewel, and...
I see...
Hm... Well, I guess there's nothing we can do. Are we going together, Makoto-san?
Yes.
See you later, Ran!
Okay, let's go...
I want you to eat your heart out!
Oh, thank you!
Be alert, keep an eye on everything!
If you see anything out of the ordinary,
report it and take immediate action. And.
report it and become active immediately!
And...
I... is everything all right? I'm so sorry!
Is everything all right? I'm so sorry!
I'm sorry too...
I'm sorry too...

Inspector Aidan!
Excuse me, but I noticed....
Ah... I'm sorry... What?
Here you go. Please keep it up!
Yes, sir!
Is everything okay with the vault?
Yes, everything's fine.
- Excuse me! I'm sorry... - What's going on?
Inspector Aidan wants to see you right away.
Um, a... but...
A... but...
I'll keep watch here.
I... all right. We'll be right back. Thank you!
All right. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. Thank you.
Well, then...
...I'm going to get the treasure!
Allow me.
Am I stuck somewhere?
A dead body?! And it's...
Rechel?!
Shit! I've got to get out of here now!
There's something written...
Damn it!
Freeze!
Put the gun on the ground!
Kid, you're under arrest!
What the...?
Come on! How long is Rechel-san going to keep me waiting?
Let's wait another ten minutes, then...
Wha... what's going on?
Could it be that Kid...?
Hey, wait!
There he is!
Wah, this is not good...
But, uh... Now I'm out in the open, it's a cinch!
What, there are so many?!
Hey, wait!
Damn it!
- Come on, let's go! Arrest him! I don't care what it costs! - Yes, sir!
There, there! I wonder if he'll be all right...
There he is! Môri-san! I was looking for you!
Ah... This is a big mess...
The Kid actually showing up in broad daylight...
But never mind, don't worry!
Kogorô Môri will immediately give chase and...
There's no time for that now!
Something terrible has happened! Come to the vault immediately!
Look!
Look! There's a giant bird flying in the sky!
There's a giant bird flying in the sky!
They'll hardly let me get that far...
D... that's just...

The victim is Leon-sensei's secretary, Rechel-san.
Rechel-san?
I see...
- Did the cameras catch anything? - Not a chance.
They've been hacked, so all they've shown all this time...
of the empty vault the whole time.
Do you have any idea who the perpetrator was?
Of course.
We're hunting him down right now with all our might.
You're hunting him? So you're saying that...
The killer is the Kaitô Kid, no doubt about it!
Your failure to disable the security system was a mistake, Kid.
Say...
Rechel-san was supposed to be meeting his uncle at the time...
and should have come to the back of the stadium.
Then why did she go to the vault?
Yes, you're right.
According to the two security guards, she came here
to give them a message from Inspector Aidan.
It seemed urgent, which is probably why she came here in the first place.
And that's when all the chaos started.
But the Kid as a murderer? I just can't imagine that.
Ah... Hey! Don't just walk in there! I mean it! I don't...
- The characters written in blood... - That's enough!
Get lost, you brat!
Look, here...
Oh, I see!
You've been had, Kid, you've been had, you've been had...
Excellent...
J... now... it's gotten really exciting... now...
Your recommendation was really good, Sonoko-san!
The chicken rice and watermelon juice were delicious!
I told you so!
What's wrong?
Ah... Now that we've filled our bellies...
There's a place I still want to go!
I'll go with you wherever you go.
That doesn't look good.
Hey, kid! How are you going to apologize for that?
A... but you bumped into me!
Huh?! I don't know what you mean.
Come here!
Maybe he has other cronies.
Sonoko-san, please don't leave my side!
J... Yes...
Your fist could cause
that the person you love gets hurt.
Sonoko-san!
There they are!
Please help me!
Sonoko-san!
- Is she okay? - I'll call an ambulance.
A foreigner?
Sonoko-san!
Sonoko-san...
Sonoko-san!
Sonoko-san!
Sonoko-san!!!
What did they say, how is it?
It's not life-threatening.
She's sleeping at the moment. She's supposed to stay here today.
and will be examined tomorrow.
I am really relieved.
But that bastard, that hit-and-run driver...
It's my fault.
Because of me...
Sonoko-san...
Thanks for waiting!
Sorry it took so long.
Thanks for coming.
Did you find out anything?
The accident happened on a quiet side street..,
there were no witnesses...
No. Actually, there were people there, but...
but they were knocked unconscious when the car was stolen...
I hope I'm not disturbing you...
Leon-sensei! What are you doing here?
I heard about the accident and rushed over.
Sonoko is still asleep at the moment...
Then please give her this for me.
Thank you very much.
It seems my concern was not unfounded.
The gods of battle have given you a test.
About whether you already
the necessary harmony of mind, technique and body.
Oh yes, let me give you a talisman.
It's like a friendship bracelet.
If it breaks,
the gods will recognize that you have achieved the necessary harmony.
But if you swing your fist first...
You understand?
Ouch...
You've got it bad...
Oh, I don't mind that kind of thing.
I mean... They just shot at it!
They fooled me this time.
Everyone thinks Rechel-san's murder is your doing.
The whole thing is a trap.
To put the blame on you.
It's almost like a magic trick, isn't it?
Even though I wasn't there,
it looks to the audience as if I was there as the murderer.
This means that if you change the point of view..,
you see how the trick works?
Exactly.
A stage magician makes people think that he's holding something
something hidden in his fist.
And a detective recognizes what's in it even before the magician
even before the magician opens his hand, right?
Please recognize what's in it, master detective!
In this mysterious fist called "murder"!
Really...
Oh, you're still here, kid?
Please... Can I stay with you tonight?

What, at my house?
When I go home, I'm all alone there.
After everything that just happened.... I'm afraid.
And if they know I'm with you, my parents will be reassured.
And a second night in the same room as him, that would really suck.
Wah, how great!
Did your father get all these?
Yes. My father was an oceanographer.
He died five years ago.
But in his research, he also discovered sunken relics.
You're proud of him, aren't you?
Yes.
Good. I have a little work to do,
but you go ahead and get some sleep.
Yes!
Say...
What are the red marks on this map?
Ah, they mark places where pirates have attacked ships.
Pirates still exist today?
Oh, yes, they do!
There used to be a lot of them around Singapore, too.
But at the moment, my concerns are
are less about the pirates and more about these murder cases...
And Kaitô Kid. Inspector Aidan lent me his files, but...
Tonight I think I'll be working through....
CONTINUE
I'm sorry for him, but he has to sleep for a while...
Say, what is this?
Have you been wearing that for a while?
Sonoko-san! You've come to!
I've been awake longer.
I'm so glad... I really am.
Is that tape some kind of good luck charm?
J... yeah... Something like that.
And hop...
Don't do anything stupid! You need to rest!
But I'm not tired at all.
I travel all the way to Singapore, and now this.
It's not good for you to overwork yourself. Stay here tonight, okay?
I've been meaning to ask you...
The patch over your eye... Why don't you ever take it off?
Ah, that... It's nothing. It's nothing.
I thought we weren't meeting until everything was done?
You bragged your plan was perfect.
But are you really sure?
You may look tough, but the truth is you're a coward.
Watch what you say!
I always keep my promises. I do.
If someone double-crosses me, I return the favor. That's my philosophy.
An important announcement: Makoto Kyôgoku withdraws from the semi-finals
from the semifinals without a fight.
from the semifinal fight.
Thus, Tan Lee will advance to the finals.
Damn!
I didn't ask for this!
You withdrew?
But why? Because of me?
The guys who attacked us might attack us again.
So I have to stay by your side.
So it's my fault after all!
Join the tournament! You wanted to fight that opponent!
Yes.
But I failed to protect you.
I feel that I'm still missing something...
Oh yes, you are missing something.
You're keeping secrets from me.
Secrets?
The friendship bracelet, the band-aid... You don't tell me anything about it!
Ah, that... But that really has nothing to do with...
Go.
I will not be protected by someone so full of lies!
I was worried about you yesterday.
I couldn't reach you...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But I was so focused on chasing the Kid...
The "Moonlight Magician"
even the famous Shin'ichi Kudo can't catch...
Oh, Arthur-kun! Good morning, Arthur-kun!
Is your friend Sonoko-oneesan okay?
Yes. I went to see her at the hospital earlier.
The doctor said she's fine.
She'll be going back to the hotel this afternoon.
Oh, I'm so glad!
Thank you for worrying.
Let's go back to the hotel. I want to pack for the trip back.
Don't you want to go to Sonoko-oneesan?
No. I want to leave Kyôgoku-san and her alone.
They seemed to have had a fight.
And Kyôgoku-san has withdrawn from the tournament...
Well? Shin'ichi?
Well, did last night work out?
According to Rishi-san's investigation documents, it did:
According to witnesses,
it's possible that Sherilyn wasn't stabbed where she collapsed,
but in an elevator in Tower 3.
But why in an elevator?
If something goes wrong there, you can't get away.
With a commercial knife in her back
she then staggered to the mall.
After her collapse
her car exploded in the parking garage.
As a result, the power went out in the entire hotel.
And this also cut off the stream of images
from all the security cameras in the hotel.
What concerns me is that Leon was there.

We were able to track him to his and Sherilyn-san's room.
But when Sherilyn was stabbed,
several witnesses saw him in another elevator.
So he had an alibi and was taken out of the focus of the investigation.
- That's right. - That reminds me...
Why did Leon have a suitcase with him?
Of course, the police examined the suitcase.
But it was empty.
Leon had given it to be repaired and had just picked it up again.
From a store near the hotel, that's verified.
So his alibi is airtight. Only one thing remains.
And that's this.
Why was it left at the crime scene?
Why do I have to be involved?
And why did they have to put it on the mirror with blood on it? And...
Rechel-san's murder is also blamed on you.
The murder weapon was a knife of the same type as Sherilyn-san's.
Rechel was placed in the base of the display case..,
before I entered the vault.
But to get in there,
one had to get past several guards and security devices.
Someone who could get past the guard and into the room without setting off an alarm?
I didn't.
The suspect here, of course, is Leon Lowe.
As the vault's administrator, he knows its security system inside out.
Moreover, the belt was brought to the stadium yesterday morning.
And until the night before last, Rechel-san was still alive, that much is certain.
The murder happened sometime between
the night before yesterday and the transport to the stadium.
But for what purpose?
Why was it necessary to kill his own secretary?
Maybe that was his motive...
Rechel-san wanted to tell the old man something.
And left the bloody letters behind.
"She"... so "she". But who does she mean with that?
SHE = SHE
No chance.
I have a bad feeling, but I can't collect my thoughts.
Is even the great master detective at a loss now?
Then let's take a break.
- Tell me in which fist I can find... - In the left one. Coconut water.
Correct!
How did you know?
You bought it earlier.
You saw it...
A magic trick...
A stage magician makes people think
that he's hiding something in his fist.
And a detective recognizes what's in it even before the magician
opens his hand.
I see.
Tell me, is the good Miss Sonoko actually having a fight with the karate guy?
It seems so, yes.
First a fight on vacation, and then an accident...
You're bound to get emotionally unstable.
Oh, is that it?
By hurting Sonoko,
you shake Kyôgoku-san's spirit.
Because Kyôgoku-san is
is the greatest obstacle to Jamaluddin's victory.
I see.
So Leon also arranged the accident!
As intended, Kyôgoku-san withdrew from the tournament.
So it is clear: the champion's belt goes to Jamaluddin.
That is, to the man for whom the latter works: to Leon.
Together with the Steel Blue Fist.
But why is Leon so fixated on the Steel Blue Fist?
I found out something that could help us.
Leon met this man this morning.
Can you find out who he is?
Well, I could, but...
You got a lot of nerve.
You say you're going to Hokkaido, and then: radio silence.
What are you up to?
I'm sorry, things happened...
Please be quiet for a moment!
Yeah...
Really. You're probably involved in some case again, aren't you?
Well... That's right.
We just sent you a picture the Kid took.
What, Kid?! Did you just say "Kid"?
Really?! Did Kaitô Kid show up?
You're talking to Conan-kun, aren't you?
And he's in Hokkaido right now, isn't he?
What's the Kid going to steal?
A carved bear?
Probably Sapporo ramen.
He wouldn't steal something like that.
Ai-chan!
- Please let me talk to him! - I want to!
Sorry, the kids are visiting right now.
I see. I'll tell you everything when I get back,
but please find out who the man in the photo is.
Okay, okay, got it.
But you're really okay, right?
Sort of, yeah.
Whatever I say, it's no use. But don't do anything stupid.
Thank you.
It's all over.
What are you going to do now, master detective?
Wait and see.
What will Leon do when he gets the Steel Blue Fist?
But first it's the old man's turn.
H... Hey, wait!

The winner of the Zhon Han Karate Cup is...
The winner of the Zhon Han Karate Cup is...
Jamaluddin!
What do you think of my plan for the city?
- We can't approve it. - Why not?
You would lose nothing.
She would lose nothing by it.
And it would benefit the country, too.
The plan is too rushed.
So much rapid development will force people to give up their homes.
We can give them others! My plan is perfect!
You're still too young. Come back when you've learned more.
You old fool...
Your time is up now.
I will build a new city!
I will build the new city!
Hands up!
Okay... okay...
We are bound by an inevitable fate...
If my plan succeeds, you and I will be partners.
Thank you, I'm glad to hear that. I owe you a lot.
You helped me when I was suspected of theft..,
on the verge of arrest. That was the beginning...
And even after that, you always helped me...
I just knew that you were the well-known Reijirô Nakatomi.
The son of Jûzô Nakatomi, also known as "Japan's shipping king."
Please don't mention my father.
Oh, I beg your pardon. But anyway,
tonight everything will change.
Wouldn't you like to watch it up close, too?
Then we'll go together.
To see the first page
in Singapore's new history is written!
Sorry, Uncle!
W... what are you doing?
Stop it! You pervert!
That's it!
NAKATOMI
Nakatomi?
Nakatomi, is that... the Nakatomi shipping company?
I guess so.
Uncle! We're gonna borrow this for a minute!
Did he just call me "uncle"?
That brat...
Why are you leaving Japan so suddenly?
Oh, I'm going on vacation.
You were in Singapore five years ago.
SUSPICION OF BRIBING POLITICIANS: DIRECTOR NAKATOMI CONFRONTED DIRECTLY
Yes, but not since then. What about it?
Director Nakatomi is...
That's the guy from Merlion Square!
The one the karate guy beat up.
Oh... Haibara?
Did you find out who it is?
Yeah, with a lot of effort.
His name is Eugene Lim. And get this: he's a pirate!
A pirate?
According to eyewitnesses, he was spotted in Singapore the other day.
Haibara, you're a man to be reckoned with.
You flatter me...
Is there something else you want me to find out for you?
J... Yes...
Do you know the name Reijirô Nakatomi? From the Nakatomi Shipping Company.
Yes, I do.
I need info on the status of the shipping company's ships.
The ones that are in the Singapore area.
There are two cargo ships and a tanker in the vicinity right now.
It is noticeable that this tanker has deviated from its planned course.
That's him! Send me the data on that tanker!
- Okay. I'll call you back. - I'll call you back.
Is there something wrong with the tanker?
The letters Rechel left: "she"...
"She" can also refer to a ship.
Is what you told me true?
That everything that happened was planned by Leon-sensei...
Explain it to me so that I can understand!
In the beginning, there is the blue sapphire that Zhon Han Chen found,
the "Steel Blue Fist."
He had it carved into a karate tournament belt,
to give to the winner.
Leon set Jamaluddin up for the tournament,
to get possession of the jewel.
But then came an unexpected interference:
to the registration of the in 400 fights
undefeated Makoto Kyôgoku for the tournament.
Sherilyn Tan, the lawyer who was killed, had invited him.
Even if that was his motive, Leon-sensei has an alibi!
When she was stabbed, he was in a different elevator.
In truth, it was like this:
After meeting Leon at the pool.
she entered the elevator to go back to her hotel room.
But the room in Tower 3 where she was staying was on the 16th floor.
So she had to
change elevators on the 34th floor to get to her room.
On the way back to her room
she was taken to another hotel room.
By the secretary Rechel.
Rechel was an accomplice? That can't be...
The restaurant by the pool is reserved for hotel guests. Leon had
Leon had taken a room for that reason. It was on the 34th floor.
And...
After coming from the pool, he stabbed Sherilyn-san there.

He packed her body into the suitcase.
Then Rechel and Leon entered different elevators.
They probably used a knife like the ones used for magic tricks.
But the blood was Sherilyn's.
First floor.
Rechel mimed the stabbed woman and collapsed.
And right after that,
during the blackout, it was all arranged,
without anyone noticing.
A... but that...
When Rechel had found out about Leon's true intention,
she was so shocked
that she planned to confide in Detective Môri.
But Leon got wind of it.
The Rechel-san who came to the vault was the Kid in disguise.
The Kid was also just used in Leon-san's plan.
The real Rechel-san was already dead by that time
And had been stowed away in the pedestal.
Leon foresaw that the Kid would mask himself,
and so he himself could get an alibi and frame the Kid for the murder.
But why should he...
Turning into what person is safest?
Well... No matter how well you disguise yourself.
you meet the real person, it's all over.
The ideal is someone you know when he will be where.
Oh yes, that's right!
Rechel had an appointment with Môri-san at three o'clock!
- And that's why... - Right.
Kid turned into the person who wouldn't come to the vault.
And thus fell right into Leon-san's trap, who had foreseen this.
Please tell me:
What is it that Leon-sensei is up to?
He's doing it all for some harebrained scheme.
Leon had contact with Eugene Lim, a pirate leader.
Rechel left the word "she" at the place where she was killed.
And had slipped Detective Môri a medal from the Nakatomi shipping company.
- AII this has to do with ships. - But what is the connection?
Rishi-san!
This is an analysis of the courses of the ships of the Nakatomi shipping company
in this area. A colleague sent it to us from Tokyo.
A tanker is deviating very far from its planned course.
If it continues like this, it will reach Marina Bay.
Leon-san wants to use the pirates to make it collide
to make it collide with the city!
But why would Leon-sensei want to do such a thing anyway?
What is the reason?
I don't know how Leon-san would say it himself.
But if this city were to be destroyed and rebuilt,
huge sums of money would surely move for it.
Leon-san was so fixated on the jewel because he could
because he could use it to make the pirates do what he wanted.
A... but... The pirates avoid the police and live scattered everywhere.
How did he contact them?
With the Merlion.
Red water came out of the Merlion the other day, right?
It was reported all over the world, so the pirates noticed it too.
That was certainly the starting signal for the action.
- But more importantly... - Yes. If we don't hurry, it will be too late!
But on my own responsibility...
And for the police to do anything, we need more proof!
- Then it's too late! - Isn't there another way?
I've got it! Let's ask Zhon Han Chen for advice!
He has influence over the military and the police!
I'm sure he'll back us up!
Rishi-san, just one thing...
What is it?
If the tanker collides with the city as planned,
where will Leon-san be at that moment?
Let me think... He is a very cautious person,
He would probably follow it from far away.
It may well be that he is no longer in the country at all.
So, I'll hurry up!
All right! And thank you.
- So, what do you think? - I have no idea.
I mean, really. Where the hell is Pop?
The show's about to start!
And Shin'ichi is still missing...
Really... Why did I get involved in this case?
Was it really Leon who left my card at the scene of Sherilyn's murder?
No.
The card wasn't found on the elevator mirror until long after
until long after the crime scene investigation had begun.
I wonder why.
Oops...
The latest analysis of the tanker's price.
W... what?!
Crap! That's how the tanker's going to hit the hotel!
Answer... Please answer it!
It's coming towards us!
Hi Ran! Having fun?
- Dad! Where are you? - Huh?
I'm not sure... But I see a big ship.
Hey, Pop, listen...
Is he on the roof?
Hello? Hello?
RAN MÔRI
Can we make it?
Yes, I think so.
Sonoko-san! Sonoko-san!
What is it?
Something seems to have happened outside. We'd better get out of here.
Yes, hello?
Yes, all right.

- Who was it? - Someone from the police.
He said I could be attacked again outside,
I should wait here.
They'll send someone.
But they...
No need. I'll stay here.
I see.
Shit... We can't get to the hotel against the current!
Then we'll go all the way!
Look! There's the Kid!
Look! There's the Kid.
There's the Kid. The Kid's come up!
We've got the roof to ourselves.
What is it?
Kogoro the Sleeper!
That guy... I can't figure him out.
I can't figure him out.
No way. I can't get through.
Shit!
Oh, come on! Where are you, Pops?
Look!
This city will be reborn!
By my hand!
What do you think you're doing...?
Why are you...?
W... wait!
I'm surprised. That you're actually so capable...
I didn't see that coming.
Rishi...
I guess now I have to admit everything.
Yes, it's true. I planned all this.
Let's have a little talk.
And put that dangerous thing away.
I think you're the one who's got something wrong here.
Don't move!
There's nobody here. We're stopping the ship.
The tanker's stopped! Kid!
- Let's leave this to the police! - Yes.
The tanker!
What happened?
I... I'm doing what you want! Please don't shoot!
Help!
Please don't kill me!
Rishi-kun! I can't believe you'd actually shoot me.
Jamaluddin!
W... Wait...
Jamaluddin, what are you doing?
I only worked for you to fight Kyôgoku.
That reason no longer exists.
- That reason no longer exists. - What?
Seriously?
Leon-sensei!
Could it be that you've slacked off a little?
It wasn't you who moved the world...
I did.
Did... actually you...
Mo... Wait a minute! Please wait!
I'll give you this!
Inside is the jewel!
That's a good deal!
Kaitô Kid?!
What are you doing here, Arthur-kun?
To get to the roof, you have to change trains on the 34th floor...
34th floor.
Hey, stop!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Are they going to the Marina Bay Sands?!
What are you doing?
I was going to arrest those two, they're the ringleaders!
Stop this charade, Rishi Ramanathan.
We know you're the real mastermind.
The first thing we suspected was
Kid's advance notice, left at the scene.
It wasn't until shortly after you arrived on the scene..,
the officers noticed the card with the pre-notification.
And earlier, when we asked where Leon-san was staying,
our suspicions were confirmed.
Such a vain, pompous man as Leon-san
would never flee abroad until his plan was complete.
No, he follows the whole thing from the place with the best view.
And you had to be aware of that.
I am flabbergasted. So you put me to the test?
It all started five years ago.
Your father's accident was the catalyst for the plan.
The suspect in the "oceanographer murder" suddenly admitted his guilt.
It was
five years ago that you visited Singapore, wasn't it, Nakatomi-san?
A... ah... I...
LEON LOWE ASSISTS IN ARREST IN MURDERED OCEANOGRAPHER'S CASE.
Leon apprehended the perpetrator, Sherilyn defended him, and persuaded him
to confess his guilt.
This wasn't just a coincidence.
What do you mean?
It was a ruse to get a tanker from the Nakatomi shipping company.
It was a set-up.
And that there had been another trick...
You realized that, didn't you?
At first I also thought it was an accident. But then...
When I was sorting through the estate, I noticed something.
When my father was exploring at the bottom of the sea, he discovered a sunken ship..,
which may have contained the Fist of Steel and Blue..,
the mark of the pirate king.
That's why you killed my father first!
To prevent him from lifting the jewel before you!
Help! Someone has pushed me in!
- Help is coming! - Quickly!
Save him!
You knew that my decent father
would jump in the water to save him.
What is the meaning of this, Leon? You...
Let go of me!
Rishi-kun! You seem to be misunderstanding something.
We found the man who killed your father...
I had my doubts about the circumstances of my father's death.
That's why I first studied with you and then became a civil servant.

I began to investigate the accident.
I approached Sherilyn Tan, the defense attorney,
and suggested that she blackmail Leon with the matter of Reijirô.
That's when she told me everything right away. And Rechel...
Yes, exactly... With her support.
I knew everything about you.
Then why did you pin Kid's advance notice to the mirror?
Will you tell us, please?
The Steel Blue Fist... And a murder he was framed for, but didn't commit...
Faced with these temptations
the master thief would surely come here and interfere with your plan.
I did not expect that high school detective.
But he also did his job well.
Nakatomi-san... When you were suspected of stealing,
Leon saved you... But was that really a coincidence?
Think hard. Could it be that...
that all this...
You bastard!
Well... You've done a good job of figuring that out, Rishi-kun.
Where am I? But that's...
Dad!
Ran! What the...?
- What is it? - Dad...
Get...!
Fall back and regroup! And inform the helicopter!
What do you want?
Well then, Rishi-kun.
The situation has reversed.
Eugene, it looks like the plan has failed.
You can have the jewel.
Please take care of all these people.
Wha... What are you doing!
What are you doing?
Don't move.
H... Help!
Now that I have the jewel, I don't need you anymore.
What?
What?
I don't have time for your games.
I don't break my promises, Leon.
I don't break my promises.
But there was just a more lucrative offer.
But there was just a more lucrative offer.
You're going after...
You sure are quick on the uptake. That's right.
The daughter of the Suzuki conglomerate also lives here.
Her kidnapping will bring a huge ransom.
The girl must have been evacuated by now.
She's still in her suite.
I told her on the phone not to leave her room.
- H... Wait, what... Makoto-san? - I'm sorry.
The elevators are all jammed.
Let's get out of the hotel!
There! Come on, let's go!
Don't! You'll hit her!
Ma... Makoto-san?!
What's the meaning of this?
Look!
In the end, everything will turn out exactly as I imagined.
The city will burn down and be reborn!
But you'll never see it!
What? They're shooting rockets at us?
What! They're shooting rockets at us?
Damn!
Damn it!
Eat this!
Get them now!
Makoto-san!
What?! What, what, what, what...
After them!
Open up!
- Open up! - They're coming, they're coming, they're coming...
What's happening?
I don't know. Most of the pirates are now in the hotel.
But what's going on in there?
It's dangerous here, too. Go back.
Are you okay?
J... Yes.
If this goes on, the city will really be destroyed!
Damn it... Isn't there some way...
If we use that one... This could work! Kid!
- Are you serious?! - I'm serious.
There's that guy again! Shoot him down!
We can't hit him!
Annoying little bird...
Hey! Before we implement the plan, we have to do something about the pirates!
And I only have one shot left!
We still have one...
A trump card that can turn the situation around!
Yes, we do. And we're gonna play it right now!
Wait!
Makoto-san?
Get them!
Stay back!
He's...
mine.
Kid!
Take me to the bow!
I know!
Ran, step back.
Ran!!
Go!!!
- What's going on? - I heard Shin'ichi's voice!
Are you all right?
Arthur-kun! What are you doing here?
Ah, I was worried about you, so...
Thank you so much.
Really! Where is he?
Thank God you're okay.
What the...?
Thank you!
Thank you!
Makoto-san!
The Kid stole the jewel! Shoot him down. Shoot him down!
The Kid stole the jewel! Can you shoot him down?
No problem, boss.
Okay, boss.
Damn it... Stand still...
Eat this, kid!
Eat it!
He hit?
It's okay, Sonoko-san!
Oh, no... What the...?
Oh no... What the...?
Kid! You...
Hi!
W... wait!
Help, mom!
We're falling!
Makoto-san, you're bleeding!
Sonoko-san, I'm sorry.
Ah... Wait, stop! What are you doing? We can't be here...

Makoto-san?
I told you no!
I tied you up piggyback. Sonoko-san...
This time...
you can't leave my side!
Right now, I couldn't even if I wanted to.
Where is he?
Kyôgoku-san!
Hold on to something!
Are you okay?
There you go again.
Because this is not the jewel I'm looking for.
Sonoko-san, please sit here for a moment.
I'm sorry.
I pulled the knot too tight.
Ah, it's come undone.
A... ah, that... uh...
is kind of like a good luck charm...
Have you been wearing this all along?
J... Yes. I couldn't tell you because I was afraid of looking uncool.
Well...
I always thought I was being protected by him....
But the truth is, I was protecting him.
Oh, I see!
Give me back the patch!
- No way. - Please!
I'll guard it all my life!
They're madly in love.
Who on earth are you?
Not just any kid.
Conan Edogawa.
Detective.

The heart throbbing with a hot foreboding....
Just as the moonlight illuminates the darkness,

Are you sure
you want to let your strong friend go back to America?
That's okay.
Makoto-san just always has to fight somewhere....
Oh, there they are!
What's the meaning of this?
Hey, don't get so attached to me. I can barely walk.
Forget it.
I'll never let you go.
Oh, really?
I've been waiting all this time.
For this moment.
Kid! We've been waiting for you!
Wha... Really?
I knew you weren't Shin'ichi from the start!
Shin'ichi would never call
Pops would never call you "dude"!
He always says it...
That's right, I've never called him that before her.
How dare you turn into Shin'ichi again!
Please don't let go of his arm, young lady!
Hold him tight!
Kid! Seize him!
I won't let you go, ever!
Don't let him get away!
Professor!
He's gone!
Shit! He got away!
Damn it! He must still be around here somewhere!
Go after him!
Conan-kun!
Welcome back, Ran-neechan.
I'm back!
Did you miss me a lot?
Silly.
I was with you the whole time.
