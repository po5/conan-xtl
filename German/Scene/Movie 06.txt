USA - MASSACHUSETTS
The boy wonder Hiroki Sawada graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the tender age of ten.
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the tender age of ten.
He developed a method for tracing ancestors based on skin and
using skin and blood data.
The so-called "DNA search program" is an amazing achievement.
Hiroki is now developing a mechanical brain
that matures by five human years in one year.
He is supported by the IT industry czar,
Thomas Schindler, president of Schindler Company.
The parents divorced two years ago.
Hiroki separated from his father
and moved to the United States with his mother.
When his mother passed away and Hiroki was left on his own,
Mr. Schindler became something of an adoptive father.
The mechanical brain "Noah's Ark" is said to be
be the greatest invention in the history of mankind.
Therefore, Hiroki is closely guarded.
Thus, he is not allowed to play in the park like normal children....
"Noah's Ark" makes reference to the Old Testament.
God caused a great flood to arise to cleanse the world.
And only Noah,
who had followed God's way, was allowed to build an ark..,
which had room for his family and many animals,
and with which they could save themselves.
Boss, something's wrong!
The phone line! It seems to be the program!
What's Hiroki up to?
NOAH'S ARK HAS SAILED AWAY
Farewell, my friend!
Open up, Hiroki! What are you doing in there?
Can I fly like Noah's ark?
Hiroki, where are you?!
Hiroki!
Boss!
Look!
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE PHANTOM OF BAKER STREET
I'm high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was with my friend Ran
at the amusement park,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on what was happening
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He administered a poison to me
and when I came to...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked for my name,
CONAN DOYLE
I said Conan Edogawa.
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
All right, guys?
Yes!
Of them, my identity is known
except for the professor, only Ai Haibara.
She was one of the men in black.
To escape them,
she drank the same poison and shrank as well.
Always up for a prank,
these are my parents.
My father is a world-famous crime writer.
Yûsaku Kudô's series "The Baron of the Night"
is known to every crime fiction fan.
WHITE PRINCESS YUKIKO
My mother Yukiko Kudô stopped acting when she was 20,
YUKIKO KUDÔ PRESS CONFERENCE ON HER RETIREMENT
to get married.
Now she's just a nagging old lady.
I am considered for now
as a distant relative of theirs.
I haven't seen either of them for a long time. Mother, father,
are you all right?
I'm fine!
I am small, my mind is not!
I'll solve every case!
There is always only one truth!
2 YEARS LATER
TOKYO - BEIKA BEIKA CITY HALL
Here at the Beika City Hall
the premiere of a virtual reality
of a virtual reality game
developed by Japanese manufacturers and the Schindler Company.
Mr. Schindler, president of Schindler Company, has just arrived!
THOMAS SCHINDLER (52) THE "CZAR" OF THE IT INDUSTRY.
According to the documents distributed to the media,
you sit in this game nicknamed "Cocoon"
in a capsule in the form of a cocoon
and under hypnosis
interact with the game by means of voice recognition and enjoy
and thus enjoy a virtual reality.
The game includes the latest technologies.
It offers one five different stages,
on which the player can move.
But what these look like
the children who are taking part today..,
who are participating today will soon find out.
A perfect sneak preview
awaits us!
50 selected girls and boys through middle school
will become Japan's first Cocoon players.
Really,
this exaggerated fuss just because of a computer game!
There must have been
a lot of problems because of industrial espionage.
The release of Cocoon
will change the game industry in one fell swoop, they say.
Oh!
What's that?
Ah, it's... it's the Cocoons!
I want to play Cocoon, too.

This is not possible. We have been invited to the party,
but we were not selected as players.
But the fact that you can experience historical events
in the game itself is interesting,
is interesting.
Isn't it?
It's almost like you can travel through time!
It's just a game.
Conan-kun, computer games aren't your cup of tea.
You're still struggling with "Final Quest."
You're just clumsy with your fingers!
Shut up!
PARTY ROOM
So many people and so much alcohol!
Pops,
there are also high police officers.
Please don't drink too much!
Of course not!
But a good drop won't hurt so much.
That's not the point!
You can eat as much as you like here, right?
- Yeah, I guess. - Lucky! Lucky!
Lucky is more like those kids there!
They must be the chosen children,
picking up their participation badges.
The grandson of the deputy chief of police,
the grandson of a world financial leader,
the son of a leading politician.
The second and third generation
of those who will determine Japan's future.
- You can feel the envious looks. - Right.
A scene as if Japan's bad inheritance system has been condensed.
Through such a hereditary system
the mistakes of mankind are repeated.
Haibara-san, I don't understand a word you're saying.
You really should talk more like a child.
A politician's son becomes a politician.
The son of a banker becomes a banker.
That way Japan will never change, they say.
That's what they were talking about
on the news yesterday.
And? Is that better?
Scary.
- Ran! - Sonoko!
Hi, boys and girls!
Ah, Sonoko-san, this badge...
Oh, this?
Have you been chosen too?
The Suzuki Group supported the game with capital. That's why.
You're lucky.
- I want one too. - Forget it.
You're out of your league.
Are you sure you got a proper invitation?
You're rude! The children are our proper guests!
SEIICHIRO KIKUWA (11) SON OF A JAPANESE ARTIST
Who do we have here? The daughter of the Suzuki Group.
HIDEKI MOROBOSHI (12) SON OF THE DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL
Listen, a person's life is
from the moment he is born.
AKIRA EMORI (11) GRANDSON OF THE PRESIDENT OF ZAIBATSU BANK
Exactly! Just like beautiful clothes choose their wearers.
SHINYA TAKIZAWA (11) SON OF A RULING PARTY POLITICIAN
People who are not chosen
have to shut up and watch from the outside!
These guys make me sick.
Pops, give them a piece of your mind!
Huh?
Listen up, guys.
Don't take life too lightly.
Even a life that seems trouble-free has its stumbling blocks.
When you grow up, you'll understand what I mean.
That your wife runs away from you?
We know about you.
Sleeping Kogoro.
Your wife left you while you were sleeping. Hence the nickname!
Your rascal!
It wasn't while he was sleeping!
Mother left the house while Pops was in the bathroom.
Right?
She's stabbing him in the back...
Let's play a game!
If kids like that carry on their parents' work
and become the leaders of Japan, it's bad for our future.
for our future.
I agree with you.
Alright!
- What are you doing? - Give it to me!
TADAAKI KASHIMURA (39) IN CHARGE OF COCOON
You're bothering the other guests.
If you want to play, get out!
Dude, who are you?
Kashimura. The development manager of Cocoon.
Without my grandpa's money.
you wouldn't have finished the game!
Didn't your parents teach you
about public morals?
And how to behave towards older people?
Don't act up like that!
You won't get any more money from us!
Is it possible that you don't know who we are?
If you don't obey us,
you might be out of a job tomorrow!
Then I'll have you thrown out the door first.
Let's go.
What a remarkable man!
No comparison to anyone else...
YÛSAKU KUDÔ CRIME WRITER
Shin'ichi-kun should be here, too.
I'm sure you'd rather meet him alone.
Professor, remember, there's to be absolute silence!
Yes, I know.
Dear guests, please pay attention to the stage.

He has been supplying us with ideas for the stages in Cocoon:
Yûsaku Kudô-sensei has just arrived from America!
I am finally back in the country.
I was wondering where you were.
So father's work it was.
Yes, I helped with the final phase of the program.
Where is Mother?
She hasn't been back to Japan for a long time...
and called a class reunion.
Here's a souvenir.
The participant badge?! I'm glad, but
I can't attend alone.
I'm sure you'd love it.
It's still a secret...
But the stage of the game
is London at the end of the 19th century.
The London of 100 years ago?
My father still seems to be infatuated with that time.
Just like the son.
What is it?
I don't see anything anymore.
Sorry.
Man, you don't walk around in the dark!
Let's take a look at the next generation game, Cocoon.
This capsule takes care of man's five senses.
Touch, pain, smell,
all sensations are felt by the player in the virtual world.
The system electrically stimulates the central nerves.
The body is not harmed.
Just watching is boring.
You just have to play a game.
Oh, there you all are.
I have a quiz for you against boredom.
Here comes another one of the professor's shallow jokes.
Are we escaping?
I'm sure he's thought it over. We should hear him out.
Ahem.
Mr. A of this game company
succumbed to gaming fever while working on Cocoon.
What did the director who saw this do to Mr. A?
One: He gave him an award for playing through.
Two: He fired him for playing at work.
Third: He Iet him go on sleeping because he was so peaceful
in the cocoon.
Number three. He let him go on sleeping!
And why?
Because the shape of the cocoon resembles a cradle.
Boo.
I'm for the award!
That's wrong, too.
Then it's number two. But why?
Ai-kun, you must know.
Please explain it to them.
I'm too thinly dressed.
I'll leave it to Edogawa-kun.
Hey, your type is wanted!
Cocoon is a type of cocoon.
It's made by silkworms.
COCOON = COCOON = SILKWORM = KAIKO = RELEASE
But the word can also mean dismissal.
I am cold.
I'll get something warm to drink.
- I'll go with you. - Me too.
What's wrong?
Can't the kids handle the air conditioning?
Seven more minutes.
That's a very fine bronze sculpture.
It's supposed to be from President Schindler's favorite collection.
Oh, since he brought it all the way over here..,
he must like it very much.
T. MOROBOSHI, VICE-INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE CAPITAL POLICE
The figures radiate a strange fighting spirit,
TETSUNOSUKE EMORI, PRESIDENT OF ZAIBATSU BANK
who probably equals his.
- Ouch. - Hideki!
Don't hit the ball against the statue.
Yes.
- We made a mistake. - No big deal.
- It's all just junk anyway. - Really?
As if anyone would put anything of value here.
That's true again.
The person in charge of development, Mr. Tadaaki Kashimura,
used to be a fellow student of mine.
Through this work, we were able to rekindle our old friendship.
Thank you very much.
That was Shimizu from TMS.
Where is Mr. Kashimura?
I'd like to see him.
Fine. I'll go find him.
Kudô-sensei!
- Can I have your autograph? - Me too!
It's good to see you're doing well.
Likewise.
KASHIMURA ROOM
I have to go back to the ballroom in a minute.
Out with it!
How much do you want to sell Hiroki's
Hiroki's DNA research program for?
I have no intention of blackmailing you.
I just want you to atone.
Hiroki found out.
Your secret that can bring the Schindler empire
that could bring down the Schindler empire.
But the artificial brain cannot be completed without Hiroki.
They put a hard workload on him and pushed for completion.
Hiroki felt psychologically pressured.
He thought he would be killed
he would be killed by them.
That's why he called
Noah's Ark, his second self, escaped through the phone line...
and then threw himself off the roof.
After a while I found
the data of the DNA research program was found on my computer.
It was the work of Noah's Ark,
which carried out Hiroki's will.
I felt as if Hiroki's soul was crying out.
I will make it up to him.
I will publish everything
and accept any court verdict.

But first, would you show me
the DNA research program
that Noah's Ark sent you?
Agreed.
As if it
came to us through time.
The phantom of London!
My name is
Noah's Ark.
Chief? Kudô-sensei would like to talk to you.
Chief?
Excuse me...
Chief! What happened? Chief!
What's starting now?
Please enjoy the performance
our guest of honor, Yoko Okino!
What? Yôko-chan is here?
The seat in front is mine!
Chiba-kun, block all the exits!
Understood!
All units!
There seem to be a lot of bigwigs here.
Yes. Our Deputy Inspector General,
powerful financial bosses.
and many members of parliament.
We must be very careful.
Ta-da!
- Wow! - This is a Golden Yaiba card!
- An award-winning one at that! - I want it!
We'll gladly trade it for your participant badges.
But we'd also like to play...
Cocoon can always be played in the near future,
but you won't be able to get a Golden Yaiba card
you won't get another Golden Yaiba card anytime soon.
What do we do?
Huh?
Haibara! We've got some!
Look! Here's one for you!
Oh, I think that's amazing.
Surely there's nothing wrong with knowing what's being talked about.
Excuse me!
What? Kashimura?
- Take me there. - Yes.
Now is the time!
Please proceed to the Cocoon function room!
Where did Dad and Conan-kun go?
Commissioner!
Oh, Môri-kun, you're here too!
Yes, I was sobering up on the balcony...
and saw the police cars.
That's Cocoon's head of development.
A stab in the heart.
Not a murder weapon.
The blood was wiped off.
The weapon means a lot to him
...or it could be used to draw conclusions about its owner.
But why is the head of development
in a basement room like this?
Yes, the boss said,
that a lot of people disturbed his concentration.
So he moved here.
The R, T and J keys are stained with blood!
Excuse me, there's a mysterious thing.
The data on the hard drive has all been destroyed.
- The data? - Is someone trying to bring down the company?
It's too late for that.
After all, Cocoon is already finished.
What are you doing here?
Couldn't that be a death message on the keyboard?
There's blood!
- He pressed it when he was dying. - R, T and J?!
J R and J T?
The train and tobacco?
RTJ, TJR,
TRJ...
JTR...
JTR?
London 100 years ago?
About...
Isn't that Conan-kun?
Why is Conan-kun in the contestants' queue?
Here, take it.
I'll let you have it.
You're the one who's worried about the boy.
- As his protector. - But then you can't...
It's okay.
I don't care anyway.
Hepp.
All 50 people are now on board.
Brain gear engaged.
Close capsule cover.
Accessing host hardware.
Block code gives power.
Connected to coupler. Axis fine tuning.
Point correction completed. Lock on!
Fade-in system starting!
Power set complete.
Game start!
He must
be in this game.
The key to solve the murder case!
Kashimura!
I heard you were friends with Kashimura.
Can you think of anyone who might have held a grudge against him?
Isn't he with you?
The boy with glasses?
Ah, you mean Conan.
He was here until just now,
but after he saw the death notice,
he went out the door all excited.
A death notice?
JTR?!
What? Conan-kun couldn't have
Conan-kun used my souvenir?
Let's go, Professor!
Wait, Yusaku-kun!
What do those three letters mean?
JTR.
They're the initials of a character who appears in the game.
Kashimura and I used to call him
Kashimura and I used to call him that.
Jack the Ripper!
J... Jack the Ripper!
Yes,
a serial killer who really existed in London in 1888.
He stabbed five women to death
and terrified London.
He could not be caught
and the serial murders remained unsolved.
From Kashimura's message of death
Conan-kun deduced that there was a clue to the killer in the game.
there is a clue to the culprit.
Director Schindler, that's Inspector Megure from the police headquarters.
Police headquarters? What are the police doing here?
Please cancel the game.
Abort? How ridiculous.
Director Schindler, the system is going crazy!

- What? - We can't control it.
Excuse me.
How now?
Ran! What are you doing in there?
My name... Noah's Ark!
My name is Noah's Ark!
My name is Noah's Ark!
There's no stopping the game.
The virtual reality game Cocoon
I have taken possession of.
W... what is it? Noah's Ark?
I think it's..,
an artificial brain that matures five human years in one year.
Yes.
Hiroki, whom I loved like my own son, made it...
two years ago.
Therefore, it is now the same age as Hiroki.
Noah's Ark,
why are you taking up the children's game?
My goal is to
to reset the country called Japan.
What?
Conan-kun!
Ran-nêchan?! Why are you here?
Because I care about you.
- Conan-kun! - Yo!
You guys too?!
It took a lot of effort for us to get here.
Acting so lackadaisical at first, even though you wanted to be at the game.
N... Well...
Actually, we're under hypnosis now..,
but you don't feel a thing.
It's a dream to be able to walk around so freely.
- It's the other way around. - Eh?
Free my ass.
See, hear, smell,
taste, feel.
Everything is determined by the computer.
So, first-time Cocoon players,
the game begins.
Yippee!
My name is Noah's Ark.
Nice to meet you.
Us too!
I'm going to show you glimpses of the five worlds.
Take your pick of where you want to play.
But I must warn you about one thing.
This is not a simple computer game.
This game is about your life!
Our lives?
If you do not reach the end of the game,
you won't be able to return to reality.
Therefore, you should play seriously.
But if one of you reaches the end,
you have won.
Then, all those who have failed up to that point will wake up
and return to reality.
These are my rules. Do you understand them?
What does that mean?
If you all fail,
special electric waves
will destroy the inside of your head.
In short,
it's a competition to reset Japan.
What does that mean? Japan's reset?
You can't hear the voices from the real world.
Just now an adult asked a question.
I see... The son of a corrupt politician can only become
become a corrupt politician.
The son of a money-grubbing doctor
will also become such a doctor.
In order to improve Japan,
these ties must be severed.
That's enough!
Do you have the right to play with human lives?
No.
Neither do the adults who played with Hiroki's life.
with Hiroki's life.
Well, the children are waiting.
Let's start the game.
Here is the first world: the Vikings!
TO THE VIKINGS
You become a Viking and sail the Seven Seas.
With strong will and courage
you will master numerous adventures.
Second: the Paris-Dakar rally.
TO THE PARIS-DAKAR RALLY
You will take part alongside world-famous drivers
in a relentless race.
Third: the Colosseum.
TO THE COLOSSEUM
Get excellent weapons and armor
and put your strength to the test.
Fight the indomitable gladiators!
Fourth: the treasure of Solomon.
TO THE TREASURE OF SOLOMON
You will become treasure hunters.
Find Solomon's treasure,
which is scattered all over the earth.
And fifth: Old Time London.
TO OLD TIME LONDON
Here you can enjoy a horror thriller.
The London of 1888.
You will have to find Jack the Ripper, the perpetrator of serial murders,
which in reality
which were never solved in reality.
I knew it. There must be a clue here
about Kashimura-san's killer.
Will we really die
if no one wins the game?
Why does this have to happen to us of all people?
I didn't choose my father!
I will surely not survive here.
No matter who, please win
and save me!
Don't hang your heads! You can't give up already!
That's right! After all, it's enough for one person to reach the goal.
Choose a world where you're most likely to survive.
I guess that's what we'll have to do.
Moroboshi-kun, what world?
What the hell.
TREASURE OF SALOMON
PARIS-DAKAR RALLY
OLD TIME LONDON
So you're with us.
Don't be a drag on us!
- Those are my exact words! - Hey, there is no fighting!
In every world there is a helping character.
You should go see him.
All right, then. Game start!
- Let's go! - Yes!
And, professor?

In fact, there is a tremendous amount of energy stored in the Cocoon.
That is more than enough to wipe out fifty brains.
Enough! I will take my son with me.
I will, too!
- But don't! - Out of the way!
It's dangerous!
Are you okay?
I won't tolerate any disturbance!
This time it was a light blow,
next time I'll be without mercy!
Son of a bitch!
Director Schindler,
how could Hiroki's artificial brain
get so out of control?
Well, uh... Well...
I'll tell it.
The real reason Hiroki moved to the States with his mother...
moved to the States,
was the Japanese school system.
Hey, Hiroki!
You are allowed to pause because of your weakness.
Playing with your notebook is not allowed!
The stiff educational system that erases individuality,
saw in Hiroki-kun only a strange PC freak.
Not only schools,
Japan in itself does not recognize individuality as such.
Hiroki-kun's plan to develop an artificial brain,
was based on his bad experiences.
In short, instead of Hiroki-kun,
who killed himself,
before he found a way to reset Japan,
Noah's Ark, which evolved during the escape,
came up with a concrete plan.
When they were at the game preview, where the next
generations are gathered,
destroyed the society in which children follow the path of their parents,
Japan would change.
Kudô-sensei, how do you know all this?
Kashimura hired me
as a detective a year ago. He was my client.
A... as a detective?
What did he hire you to do?
To investigate Hiroki-kun's death.
Are you saying that Hiroki's suicide was murder?
No, we can assume suicide.
Kashimura asked me to investigate..,
...what pushed Hiroki-kun to commit this act.
What is the connection between Kashimura-san and Hiroki-kun?
Kashimura was Hiroki-kun's father.
Wasn't he?
That Hiroki-kun, whom he lost track of at that time,
...had to die like that,
...made Kashimura feel a strong sense of remorse.
Conan-kun's group reaches the Whitechapel area.
M... do we have to go in here?
Let's go!
Go a little faster!
- Hey! What are you doing? - Because you're so slow!
Is this the City of Mist, London?
More eerie than romantic.
The air seems dirty.
It even smells.
London's fog is
not only clean condensed water vapor,
but also smoke from the burning of coal and petroleum.
smoke. It's smog.
Even in this era, there was smog.
Jack the Ripper!
Hey, Conan!
Stop it!
You can't escape me!
Ow, ow, ow.
Are you okay, Conan-kun?
Yes.
Professor Aga's inventions...
You can forget about it in this world.
Yes, the antenna can be extended..,
but it's just a pair of glasses, and it's probably just a watch.
What did he say?
It seems to be English.
- Please switch to Japanese. - Yes!
Hey, what's going on?
There's been another victim! This is the third one now!
Now you're speaking Japanese.
It's like the real world!
What we see and hear,
even the cold on the skin, is real.
The pain in the foot was also real!
- Make way! - Please move back!
Hey! Tell Inspector Lestrade at once.
Inspector Lestrade?
Professor,
- can we communicate with them? - I'll give it a try.
If you're involved in the design of this game
surely you know how to pass it, don't you?
Yes, if we could talk to them,
I could instruct them and help them that way.
That's a word! Then this will be
an easy victory for us!
But if
Noah's Ark foresaw our steps....
Professor, go ahead.
- I'm on the scene. - Roger that.
No kidding!
We're supposed to catch the culprit. But where do we look?
I guess we'll have to wait till morning.
I'm cold.
- Put mine on. - What? Really?
Nice and warm!
Haibara-san, here you go.
- Oh, thank you. - Please.
- Put these on! - But then you won't have...
Don't worry, I don't freeze easily.
Thank you.
Can you hear me, Conan-kun? This is Agasa.
We hear you, Professor!
Listen carefully!
If you get a wound or the police arrest you,
the game is over!
The place you are at..,
is the Whitechapel area of the East End.

To get from there to the helping character, you need to...
What's the matter?
What's wrong, Professor? We don't hear anything?
Hang on!
Conan, give it all you've got!
Heave ho!
That was a close one.
Haven't you figured it out yet?
I have complete possession of the game.
Such tricks are useless.
I get to hear the children's voices.
So you can enjoy their agony.
The computer has a bad character!
The professor's voice can no longer be heard.
Noah's Ark must have cut off communication.
Then how are we supposed to find the helping character?
That's what the policeman said earlier:
Contact Inspector Lestrade.
The Inspector Lestrade from the story, perhaps?
But that's a character from Conan Doyle's detective novel.
In this game, I think they've combined reality and fiction.
Then the helping character is....
Yes, there should be.
The famous Sherlock Holmes!
- Really? - Holmes is worth 100 people!
This stage is ours!
Let's go to Baker Street quickly!
That's it. Once they meet Holmes...
But it's a long way from Whitechapel
it's a long way to Baker Street.
Hey, isn't that clock weird?
It's going backwards!
Ah! Again!
From 50 minutes to 49.
And now to 48.
I see! That's the number of children participating in the game!
Two minutes back means...
That two were eliminated on another stage.
Yasuhiro!
Two are out for the Vikings!
- Tomoyuki! - Mineko!
Two got knocked out in the coliseum this time!
More! The "Game Over" has to come faster!
If the children uncover the identity of Jack the Ripper,
that's the end of me.
Three kids got it in Solomon!
That leaves 43 children left.
Wait!
There's been another victim in an alley off Mitre Street.
Two cases in one hour. This is now the fourth murder!
We live in an evil world.
How awful!
We have fallen into a bad time.
They say that London of this time is one of the best eras...
of the British Empire, they say.
But the gap between rich and poor was so deep,
that crime was on the rise.
People's hearts were hardened.
Shin'ichi once said something like this.
If Sherlock Holmes was the light in those days,
Jack the Ripper was the dark shadow.
Then let's hurry to the light.
Baker Street is right here!
Jack the Ripper! Look out!
He's lurking in the streets of the night
waiting for you.
If you don't want to die,
what are you doing?
You should also
be drenched in blood.
What's the meaning of this?
Finish him off before he gets you, I think.
Blood-soaked?
There are metal detectors at the entrance to the banquet hall.
How did the killer get the murder weapon inside?
It's no big deal.
- It's all junk anyway. - Really?
As if anyone would put anything of value here.
BAKER STREET
Number 221 B. Here it is.
So this is where the famous Sherlock Holmes lives?
Yes, he's a tenant here with Dr. Watson.
At this time of night... Yes, please?
Um, my name is Ran Môri.
I'd like to see Mr. Holmes.
MRS. HUDSON
Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson are
on a business trip.
Business trip?
Yes, to an area called Dartmoor.
Please forgive me, what day is it?
The 30th of September.
September 30th? Dartmoor?
Of course!
The Hound of the Baskervilles!
Yes! That's the exact time they're both out of London!
Hey, Professor.
What's going on here?
Excuse me,
could you show me the videotapes of the time of the crime?
Very well.
Yes,
what is it?
We seem to have underestimated Noah's Ark.
Holmes and Watson are not at Baker Street.
He anticipated this move.
Also, a strange accordionist unknown to me has appeared.
There are lots of problems.
Tell me, what course of play did you have in mind?
The player cooperates with Sherlock Holmes
and uncover the identity of Jack the Ripper.
The serial killer
is a nobleman who is terminally ill.
I have a much more interesting ending for you.
Damn.
If the children win,
I'll dispose of this computer as bulky waste!
Make an effort, Shin'ichi...
You're the ones who helped
Mr. Holmes two weeks ago.
Please come in.

I will make you hot tea with milk.
- She seems to confuse us. - Oh, I see.
She's mistaken us for the Baker Street Irregulars.
What are they?
A band of street urchins who help Holmes.
They go into places where adults can't go...
and gather information.
Ah!
So they're the detective boys' senpais, are they?
That's what it looks like.
At least they get to retire.
- Wow! - It looks just like it does on TV.
That's moving.
When Shin'ichi hears this, he'll be jealous.
He looks like Shin'ichi.
Oh, it looks just like Mr. Holmes.
He always sits there like that when he's lost in thought.
I see. He was imitating Holmes.
I'll see to the tea. Make yourselves comfortable.
Thank you.
This photo here, doesn't it look like someone?
Ah! He has hair, but that's Professor Agasa!
That must be Holmes and Dr. Watson.
Father and the Professor.
They really went all out.
Hey, I don't think we have time to relax!
But Moroboshi-kun, what should we do?
I'm sure those glasses know.
We're at Holmes' place.
He must have opened a file on Jack the Ripper.
Then we'll split up and look for it.
Yeah. I'll take this corner.
Searching is one thing, but it's all in English.
Um,
the forensics on a crime.
How? Am I a genius?
- I can read English! - So can I!
The program apparently lets us read English.
Ts.
If that's the case, I don't want to leave here.
- What are you talking about, Genta-kun! - If we fail..,
...the game's over and we're dead!
Man, I'm just kidding!
What a dirty ball.
That's... that's...!
Hey, Emori!
- A hundred-year-old soccer ball! - What? This one?
I've got it. That must be it.
Reflections concerning Jack the Ripper.
The last Ripper case was...
September 8th.
The second victim is Honey Charleston.
A woman of 41 who lived alone.
Her body was found near
St. Mary's Church in the Whitechapel district.
Two rings of different sizes were left at the scene.
Rings of different sizes?
Jack the Ripper, terrifying London,
Ied unprecedented social insecurity.
I am convinced,
there is a link to evil, Professor Moriarty.
Professor Moriarty?
Does he appear in the game?
Who is this guy?
You might as well let us in on it.
This is Holmes' arch enemy.
He controls the underworld of London
and it is said that his influence extends throughout Europe.
The Napoleon of crime!
But Professor Moriarty pulls the strings behind the scenes...
and rarely shows his face.
How do we get to him?
If the Professor doesn't show himself,
we must go to his contact.
Colonel Sebastian Moran.
That's right! Colonel Moran, the professor's right-hand man.
But we don't know where he is either...
- I'm sure it's in the... - According to Holmes notes
the Colonel has his base of operations
at the Trump Club downtown.
He's the second most dangerous man in London. We must be careful!
Conan-kun, you know your stuff.
I've heard that a lot about Shin'ichi-nîchan, too.
Oh, I thought so.
But this time, it helps that the Holmes freak...
has always bugged us about it.
What do you mean by bugging?
Wow! A real gun!
Put it back, Genta!
But, uh... we're going to see someone terrible.
Unfamiliar weapons are no use...
and they're trouble. Leave them here!
You're much scarier!
Let's go before it gets too late.
Hey, Moroboshi!
You should protect your own life.
Thirty more kids.
Quite a decline.
I'm sure someone from our group will be leaving soon, too.
Don't paint the devil on the wall!
Toru!
- Emi! - Takuya!
TRUMP CLUB
You all wait here.
I'll check out the situation from the back entrance.
Be careful!
One card.
- I'll take two. - There's Colonel Moran!
Huh? That ape...?
What is it, Glasses?
What are you doing here?
You can't play the hero all by yourself!
Straight!
Bad luck for you.
Flush!
- What? - This must be my lucky day.
Damn!
Moran's pretty strong at poker.
He cheats.
You can tell?
That monkey over there is telling the colonel his opponent's cards.

For hearts and spades, the right paw,
with diamonds and clubs the left.
He eats the value of the card as a number of fruits.
Thus, with a three of spades, he reaches for three black fruits.
Ts. Dirty rat!
Yikes?
What does the free chair mean?
Why does it say something?
That's cheating!
This guy Moran is a fraud!
Rascal,
you should watch your mouth!
Do you have proof of fraud?
Of course! He's with you after all.
That monkey!
What?
He's looking at the cards.
At 3 of spades he grabbed three black with the right,
at 5 of diamonds he ate red fruit with the left 5.
Moran! That's dirty!
It's your own fault if you fall for it.
- I beg your pardon? - Oops.
You can finish your fight later!
Where's Professor Moriarty?
Rascal! How do you know his name?
Hold it right there!
Catch the boys!
You rascal!
Are you okay, Conan-kun?
Yes.
We'll help you, Conan!
I got one!
This isn't good at all. Everyone's involved now!
Careful, Conan-kun!
Kikukawa-kun!
Hey, pull yourself together!
I've been hit.
With this, my life debt is paid.
Hey!
Kikukawa...
Seiichirô!
Ayumi-chan, are you okay?
Thank you, Mitsuhiko-kun!
No kidding.
M... Mitsuhiko-kun...
Ayumi-chan, it looks like the game's over for us.
Conan-kun, bring us back to life safely, okay?
Ayumi! Mitsuhiko!
Oh, no! This way, we'll all be eliminated!
S-H...
Sherlock Holmes!
Look out, Conan!
Genta!
Crap, game over.
Conan,
you've got to catch Jack the Ripper, yeah?
Enough games!
I wanted you alive so I could find out whose agents you were.
But that's no longer necessary.
That gun belongs to Holmes.
Damn it!
What can I do? What can I do?
The bottle the man is holding is...
The wine bottle from the seat.
I see. So that's how it is!
Well, who's first?
Rascal!
Shoot and the bottle is broken.
What do you mean?
The empty seat at the card table!
The specially decorated chair,
the glass and the bottle of wine that were provided.
Considering that, you could only have been expecting
Professor Moriarty expected.
How unfortunate, but you're wrong about that.
Shoot, then!
If the wine is allowed to break.
Conan-kun.
Mr. Moriarty...
wishes to speak with you.
Professor Moriarty?
He's waiting for you in his carriage.
This way, please.
Please wait.
Are you going to defy Mr. Moriarty?
Here are the gentlemen, sir.
Thank you. There, my boy,
- pass the wine. - Here.
That smell!
To mess with Colonel Moran...
You really are Holmes' pupils.
So, what do you want from me?
Tell me, are you Professor Moriarty?
Indeed I am.
I see.
You want to test us?
What do you mean?
Don't play games with me.
You're not Professor Moriarty!
What are you talking about, Conan-kun?
After all, the real Professor Moriarty is standing right next to us.
- What? Seriously?
The professor was talking using the ventriloquism technique.
Even you saw through that.
How did you figure that out?
Earlier, Colonel Moran said "Please wait" to you.
I see. Colonel Moran would only speak so politely...
to Professor Moriarty.
J... yes.
That was all?
One more thing, I heard that Professor Moriarty
is a well-groomed older gentleman who uses an herbal perfume.
Oh, I see, you smelled that when you gave him the bottle.
Excellent. It's like having a little Holmes in front of me.
Now tell me, what is it you want from me?
Didn't you unleash Jack the Ripper on London...
to terrify the city, didn't you?
Not quite, but not quite wrong either.
Jack the Ripper was a street kid I picked up in the slums.
Abandoned by his mother
he wandered the streets begging for money,
but I sensed his talent right away.
The talent as a criminal.
I raised him to be a first-class murderer.
For what reason does he kill innocent women?
Jack the Ripper is
become a bloodthirsty killer more than I expected.
The murders happen
when he runs amok.
If you intend to subdue Jack the Ripper..,
I will assist you.
Support?
Jack the Ripper has indeed begun to run amok,

but if I order him to commit murder, he would still have to obey.
You only need to be in place.
And how?
In tomorrow's Sunday Times
there will be a message.
Who are you going to have killed?
You'll find out tomorrow in the paper.
Hey, you don't believe..,
...what he says?
Let's take a chance.
Good luck.
Watch out for the Reichenbach cases in three years!
Reichenbach? What's that?
Moriarty stands in three years
at the Reichenbach Falls
Sherlock Holmes.
Both plunge down the waterfall,
Holmes survives miraculously
and Professor Moriarty probably perishing there.
Why did I warn him?
Probably
I like that scoundrel just as much as Holmes.
That reminds me.
You know, I quite like Moriarty, too.
Well, just as a character in a novel.
When the two of them came face to face in Holmes' boarding house... It was amazing.
There's a line that Holmes said that I really like.
- Do you know what it was? - I don't know what it was.
It was...
What the hell did Shin'ichi say?
We're finally on a date.
and all Shin'ichi talks about is Holmes.
I wasn't listening.
- Say, Conan-kun... - What's up?
It's okay.
How silly of me.
As if Conan-kun would know.
Hey, Glasses...
We're sorry,
...that the four of us were eliminated from the game.
There's no point in getting upset about the past.
The fact that you've started to think that way..,
is a step forward.
Yes! We should think about what to do next.
Let's do our best for everyone!
WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT
In this place was found
the body of the second victim, Honey Charleston.
CHURCH PARENT-CHILD BAZAAR.
Again in October, our Parent-Child Bazaar will be held on the second Saturday.
Second Saturday?
Wasn't Honey Charleston murdered on September 8?
SEPTEMBER 8 (SATURDAY).
That was a Saturday!
Thanks for waiting!
You're late. Where were you?
I was exploring the city.
So carefree. But it's all about today.
Jack the Ripper has struck again!
Two victims this time!
- I'd like one! - Okay.
I'll be damned. I don't have any English money.
Here. That'll be 80 yen.
Oha, that's handy.
TONIGHT IT'S TIME TO CLEAN THE STAGE OF THE OPERA HOUSE
That's it!
Tonight it's time to clean the stage of the opera house.
From M to J.
From M to J. From Moriarty to Jack the Ripper.
To clean the stage? Is that the order?
Does that mean he's to kill one of the actors in the play...?
There!
THERE AGAIN! IRENE ADLER! PRIMA DONNA OF THE IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW
Back again! The prima donna of the Imperial Opera of Warsaw,
Irene Adler!
Moriarty! He's a scoundrel through and through!
Who is this Irene Adler?
She is said to be the only one Holmes has ever loved.
So he's made Holmes' beloved a murder target.
12:06.
- That is. - The other stages are destroyed.
The lives of the six of us...
on the six of us.
OPERATOR
Hey!
From here on, unauthorized persons are not allowed to enter!
We are acquaintances of Irene Adler.
We wanted to say hello.
Oh, acquaintances of hers?
Yes, which way to the checkroom?
That's the room at the back, where the posters are.
Here it is. I wonder what she's like.
How exciting.
If father designed the character
and she's the woman Holmes loves...
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me.
Shin'ichi's mother!
I knew it!
How rude! I'm still single!
To be correct, only since my divorce again....
Mr. Holmes sends you flowers.
Oh, thank you very much.
Where is Mr. Holmes?
He was looking forward to the show..,
but he had to go out of town and can't be reached.
I see. What a pity.
Please cancel the show!
What?
Mr. Holmes' archenemy,
Professor Moriarty has hired an assassin to kill you.
What good would that do?
He wants to see Mr. Holmes grieve when you're gone.
I'd like to see that too.
To what extent Mr. Holmes mourns for me.
Doesn't it bother you
the fifth victim of Jack the Ripper?
You will protect me, won't you?
Instead of Mr. Holmes.
Doesn't this woman know any fear?
But really. She's just like my mother.
Die in beauty,
Irene Adler!
Where's he hiding?
- What's wrong? - What happened?
Look out!
- Emori! - Takizawa-kun!

- Ah, Emori, you...! - You too, Takizawa-kun.
Game over for us.
How annoying.
Thank you.
You saved me.
It's the first time anyone's ever thanked me.
E... a nice feeling.
Moroboshi, it's up to you now!
Count on it!
- Akira! - Shinya!
There are four left.
Including Ran-kun and Conan-kun.
That's right, Jack the Ripper!
Let this world become hell!
Hurry to the back exit!
Hurry, Haibara! That way!
Look out!
Haibara, are you okay?
Don't give up, Kudô-kun.
Even if there's no
you're the one who's going to help us.
You have the skills to do it!
Holmes Iöst any case, right?
Ai-kun...
Come quickly! Everyone out!
Get behind me!
- Stop! - See you!
- You'll be safe with the police! - Kid, wait!
I don't know your name.
My name is Conan Edogawa.
Just like the one who created you.
Conan?
He can't get away from me!
What's the story?
The children have stumbled upon Jack the Ripper.
They're tracking him now.
Charing Cross Station!
CHARING CROSS STATION
Conan, you first!
It doesn't get any worse than this!
What's waiting for them?
The last train to leave this station....
An extremely dangerous situation!
Jack the Ripper is
disguised among the passengers?
Please gather everyone in one car.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Conductor, could you...
Ladies and gentlemen, please raise your hands.
I'm going to check you for dangerous weapons.
I will calmly listen to your conclusions.
I will now explain to you
what the documents of Mr. Holmes say.
The second victim of the Ripper, who is
among you was Honey Charleston.
She married in a town called Windsor.
But she had big dreams
and ten years ago left her husband and son and came to London.
These two rings were left at the scene of her murder.
One belongs to Honey.
The other has the same design,
but did not fit on any finger.
From this, Mr. Holmes concluded the following:
These two rings could be
the bond between mother and child,
the victim, Honey Charleston, and Jack the Ripper.
So the smaller ring belongs to Jack the Ripper?
Yes.
Before Honey left, she put the ring on her son.
So that means Jack the Ripper killed his own mother?
Yes.
According to the records.
...on the day of the murder, Saturday, September 8th..,
in the church of Whitechapel
where families can sell their homemade items.
could sell their homemade items.
Surely Jack the Ripper knew about this.
It was all in the notes?
In short, Jack the Ripper
left the rings on purpose because he would have liked to go to the bazaar
to go to the bazaar with his mother?
Yes, that's what it's supposed to say.
Then
the motive for the murder is hatred of the mother.
What am I supposed to have done?
As if I were an outcast.
But it was
a murder of love and hate at the same time.
How sad.
The fact that he chose a perfect stranger as his first victim..,
was to deceive the police.
But there was a third and fourth victim!
Professor Moriarty's talent development
Iead Jack the Ripper to become an unusual criminal.
After the murder of his mother
he felt the compulsion to attack other similar women.
So, who is it?
If you wear the same ring since childhood,
what does the finger look like?
Probably this finger is the thinnest
is the thinnest of the ten.
Jack the Ripper is you!
Wha...?
It's a woman!
The ring finger is very thin.
- Leave it to me! - Don't! Ran-nêchan!
Shit! Smoke screen!
- Open the window! - Yes!
- E... he's gone! - H... hey!
The passengers are gone!
What does it mean?
Well then,
we should take care of the Kashimura murder investigation.
What? You know who the killer is?
The question is, how did the killer get the murder weapon?
There's a metal detector at the entrance to Beika City Hall.
It's conceivable that the weapon
was in the hall in the first place and the murderer resorted to it.
But where could he have hidden it?
The bronze statue in the banquet hall.
One of the figures is clutching a dagger.
There were many guests in the banquet hall!

Someone would have seen that!
He pulled it when the lights were out.
The date for this was known by the schedule.
But wouldn't it be noticed
if the dagger was missing?
He left a dummy.
A cardboard dagger that he wrapped with aluminum foil or something.
So now, inside the bronze statue...
is the dagger that was used for the murder?
Yes.
I had the dagger examined for traces of blood and fingerprints.
Kashimura's blood type was found on the dagger.
Fingerprints were also found on the handle.
They were your fingerprints, President Schindler!
Of course they were.
After all, the bronze statue came from my apartment.
This is the tape from the security cameras
in the banquet hall with the recordings around the time of the crime.
Fortunately.
the cameras are distributed throughout the ballroom,
so multiple angles were possible.
The ball of the Moroboshi boy
hits the bronze statue and eats the dagger.
The boy picks it up
and puts it back into the statue.
I see. If this were the real dagger, it would have had the boy's fingerprints on it.
of the boy would have been on it.
But the dagger only had President Schindler's prints on it.
I touched the dagger afterwards.
That's why his are no longer there.
Kudo-sensei! I found it!
The dagger made of cardboard and aluminum foil!
- The garbage dump in the basement! - Prints?
As Kudô-sensei suspected,
the boy's and President Schindler's fingerprints are on it.
If there are other fingerprints on the imitation,
it can only be the perpetrator's.
It's a fake!
Your government will hear from me!
Above all, I have no motive to kill Kashimura.
There's no one here. There's only the engine room ahead.
There's no engineer.
Let's stop the train!
The brakes are gone!
We're going faster and faster!
Shouldn't we look for the girl before it's too late?
Ran.
Where are you? Where did you go?
Wait a minute!
There she is!
Ran-nêchan!
No! Don't come!
I'm tied to the young lady with a rope.
If I fall, she falls with me.
Well, how are you going to fight?
Damn it!
The bronze statue's dagger
has been in the possession of the Schindlers for generations
and has historical value, right?
Indeed. So it is.
Why did you use such a dagger as the murder weapon?
The murder weapon absolutely had to be this dagger.
In that case...
What do you want, Jack the Ripper?
What do I want?
You murdered your mother.
and you've finally had your revenge. What do you want?
To live on!
I want my cruel blood
to reach the next generation with Noah's ark!
That is the motive for the murder of Kashimura.
Jack the Ripper's blood
as if it had traveled with Noah's Ark,
survived until today.
You are a descendant of Jack the Ripper!
- J... Jack the Ripper's... -...descendant?
Probably Hiroki-kun learned about it through his DNA program.
If the world learns that the IT czar
is a descendant of the serial killer from a hundred years ago...
a hundred years ago, it would be your downfall.
In order to silence Hiroki-kun, you drove him to commit suicide...
you drove him to suicide, and now you've murdered Kashimura.
It happened
...when Hiroki came to see my collection.
This is the golden drinking bowl of Pharaoh Khufu of Egypt.
The holy book of the priest Ganjin.
Ranpo Edogawa's manuscript written by his own hand, "Psycho Test....
Unbelievable.
And this dagger?
Well...
It is said to be the murder weapon of
Jack the Ripper, the serial killer.
But we don't know for sure if it's true.
Hiroki has been conducting an experiment.
Hiroki has collected all available data
and entered it into the computer.
Honey Charleston's DNA, which was found on the dagger...
matched your DNA.
You were afraid..,
that Hiroki-Kun would discover
that Jack the Ripper was Honey Charleston's son.
It was only a matter of time before it was discovered..,
that you were his descendant.
I was afraid.
Of the terrible blood that flows within me.
The blood of a killer? How others see you?
Why didn't you fight it?
Like Conan and the children.
Thomas Schindler,
I'm arresting you on suspicion of murdering Kashimura.
You can't catch me just by dodging.
The terminus will be here in ten minutes.
What do you think happens to a train without a driver?
However
you'll be dead before we reach the station!
Conan-kun! Behind you!

That's it for you, brat!
Conan-kun!
Let go of the glasses!
Moroboshi-kun!
Are you okay?
I think so.
Now, where do I start cutting you?
What can I do?
Shin'ichi, what would you do if you were me?
There's a line Holmes said that I particularly like.
- Do you know which one? - I do not know.
To wit:
If I could destroy you with certainty,
I would gladly embrace death for the good of mankind.
Glasses.
The waterfall of Reichenbach, Conan-kun!
Does she want...?
I'm sorry I'm not with you to the end.
Cut it out, Ran!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Conan-kun, I believe in you!
Ran!
Glasses, we have to stop the train!
Hey! We have to stop the train and survive,
or we won't win the game!
Get up, Glasses!
48 lives rest on our shoulders!
Don't you care about other people's feelings?
Idiot!
I don't want to give up either!
Think about it.
The train is picking up speed.
It's going about 100 km/h.
It's less than five minutes to the station.
To save us all,
we'll have to cut the connection to the locomotive.
This is the only way.
But our strength
is not enough to move it.
Yes,
I had planned to do this with Ran's help.
That's why Noah's Ark
made all the passengers disappear.
It's not working.
I don't know what else to do.
It's over, father.
No! You can't give up!
You must survive no matter what, and bring Ran back to life!
Shin'ichi...
You two are still not drenched in blood.
You're still alive!
Are you giving up already?
You already have both hands on the knot,
to reveal the truth.
In the bundle of colorless threads of life..,
is mixed with the bright red thread of a murderer.
Untangling this bundle
is our task, is it not?
Holmes!
He's in Dartmoor, isn't he?
Is that a bug?
What does it mean?
Jack the Ripper is dead,
why do we have to be drenched in blood?
That's it! That's what it meant!
The boxcar!
Hey, wait! What are you doing?
Don't ask, come on!
You have to smash the barrels with the axe!
Hurry up!
- When I give the signal, dive! - Okay...
Now!
Anything?
No, not a sound yet.
Oh my God Conan,
save my Ran!
So this is soaked in blood.
The red wine will soften the impact, it meant.
We are saved, Holmes,
no, father!
Glasses, you're awake.
It seems you've won.
"Did you..."?
I thought so.
It was good to trust you.
You're welcome, Noah's Ark.
You're welcome, Noah's Ark!
Or should I call you Hiroki-kun?
You used Moroboshi-kun's data...
with Moroboshi-kun's data, right?
When did you realize it?
Don't worry about it.
I cut off all communication with the outside world.
At Big Ben, I wondered for the first time.
You saw it before the hand jerked.
That was your way of telling us
the significance of the time on Big Ben.
Then the soccer!
You said "dirty ball" and threw it away carelessly.
A hundred year old soccer that would delight any
Soccer fan would love!
You put us in dangerous situations,
but in truth you believed that we would overcome the dangers
as a team.
The reset of Japan
will not be through extinction.
You wanted us not to rely on the parents,
that we overcome obstacles ourselves
and to develop ourselves in this way.
But we should be able to do it.
Holmes, who appeared at the end, is the proof.
You made the helping character appear at the climax!
I borrowed Moroboshi-kun's body...
and joined the game,
because I wanted to play with friends for once.
All I ever did was, all I ever did was work.
I'm sorry you had to go through that.
But I totally enjoyed it!
And I was jealous of you.
Despite separation, you understand each other with your heart.
You and your father.
Your father avenged my father.
I thank him.
Time to say goodbye.
Your heart will live on forever
in Noah's ark forever, won't it?
If a computer like me exists,
the adults will abuse it.
The time is not yet ripe
for an artificial intelligence.

You should return to your own world.
When you wake up,
I want you to understand this:
Real life is not as simple as in the game.
I hope you meet your father!
Farewell, Shin'ichi Kudô.
Ran!
He made it!
- You're doing great! - That was fun.
- I tried hard. - Good boy!
Conan-kun, thank you! We're alive again!
We put in quite an effort.
That was an amazing adventure!
But real life is just better.
What happened here?
I knew you'd make it, Conan-kun.
But Ran-nêchan, did you really have to jump into the abyss?
Well..,
I remembered Shin'ichi's favorite Holmes quote.
Like what Holmes said to Moriarty..,
when they first met?
Oh, how do you know that, Conan-kun?
Oh, well, Shin'ichi-nîchan was talking about it....
