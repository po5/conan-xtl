Emergency! Emergency! Car 503 to dispatch!
Emergency, car 503, please respond.
Suspect car found in connection with robbery!
Fleeing Sotobori towards Miyuki-dôri!
Understood. Information on car type, license plate number,
Suspect's appearance? Please respond.
Car 503: Roger!
Car is a black van, license plate number: Shinjuku 500, Sa-3255!
Suspect's appearance...
It's Lupin and Fujiko!
Car 503, please don't joke around.
This is no joke!
Car 503 to Central!
Lupin's turning left from Miyuki-into Chûô-dôri!
Central to Car 503: Stop that!
I told you, I'm not kidding!
I... I beg you, Sato-san!
Don't drive so recklessly!
- Aren't you going to inform headquarters? - J... Yes!
Car 503 to headquarters!
He's taking the Harumi-dôri...
...to use Lupin in a robbery...
No pardon!
Welcome to the Harumi-dôri! Good evening, sir.
That'll be 1237 yen, please.
To the car in front! Stop the car!
Must be some kind of crime.
Wow, how cool...
To the car in front!
Stop the car! I'll say it again!
You can't get away!
Pull over to the side of the road and stop!
He dares...
But an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!
Sato-san!
He'll get away!
Hold on tight!
Sato-san, what are you doing?
Don't bite your tongue!
Sa... Sato-san?
Quiet!
H... Hey, wait a minute, Satô-san!
- Takagi-kun! Call headquarters! - Got it!
Really...
Satô-san!
Reinforcements and ambulances...
will be here any minute.
Serves you right.
Using my first love as a mask like that...
Dei... Your first love?
Go check on Fujiko.
J... Yes!
Get a hold of yourself! The ambulance is coming.
Sato-san!
Fujiko-chan is unconscious, too, but seems to be only slightly injured.
Oh, yeah? But why did you do that?
This robbery, and then...
with that stupid mask!
Kô... Kômijima...
Kômijima?
I see.
You're going to take a vacation on the island with that money?
N... no...
You say no...
Is there anything on this island?
J... Jolly...
Jolly...
Roger...
Jolly Roger?
Ever heard of it?
Well...
KÔMIJIMA
Mom! Come on, come on!
- Let's go over there! - Wait!
Say, how do you use this thing?
Let me see...
Teacher! What fish are there here?
Good morning, sir!
Who do you have a reservation for?
My name is Kogorô Môri.
The master detective.
Two adults, two high school girls, five children.
One moment, please.
There's a mystery in the Nichiuri newspaper every week, isn't there?
This incredibly difficult one.
If no one solves it right,
they carry the prize over to the next one.
The amount accumulated to be 300,000 yen!
And who do you think solved the puzzle and grabbed the 300,000?
Hm... Ah, could it be that...?
Guess!
I'm a master detective! Riddles are my specialty!
Well, actually I solved it...
With 300,000, you could have a great time in Paris, couldn't you?
Because Paris, this city suits me best.
But then I thought:
Is it okay if only I have a good time?
If so, then
I want them to have a great time there, too!
That's what I thought.
Nice of me, right?
J... yes...
What is our room number?
I'm very sorry, but we don't have a reservation here in your name.
What, really?
Well, well...
Mo... Wait a minute!
I have a reservation!
But your name is unfortunately not on the reservation list...
Do we have to sleep outside now?
This is a tropical island. There's bound to be poisonous insects.
I wish we'd never come here.
Well, it'll work out somehow.
We're not in a foreign country where no one understands us.
You're so sensible and grown up...
Well, she is certainly not a child.
The receptionist is calling the tourist office, so don't worry.
I'm sorry, but...
But the person on the phone
told me, "We've received your reservation."
I'm sorry, I can't help you there...
Oh dear, I've kept you waiting!
You are Kogorô Môri-san,
the master detective...
Excuse me.
Iwanaga from the tourist office.

This month, the number of guests here has suddenly multiplied!
JÔJI IWANAGA DIRECTOR OF KÔMIJIMA TOURISM OFFICE
All the accommodations are occupied, we could almost scream with joy....
But I managed to find accommodation for you.
After all, you are the master detective Kogorô Môri-san!
Now, if you'll follow me...
That guy actually...
What kind of guys are they?
"Treasure Hunter, right?
Treasure Hunter?
You mean canal workers?
Huh?
They work in drainage, too!
No, no, Genta-kun.
They're people who search for hidden treasures all over the world.
Really?
But how do you know..,
-...they're treasure hunters? - Well...
Look at them.
The men are quite tanned,
but they're a little paler up to the wrists and neck.
This shows that they often wear diving suits.
Also, their hair is bleached from the sea water.
But they could be just plain divers.
You're right, of course,
but when you see the poster there,
KÔMIJIMA - ISLAND WITH UNDERSEA PALACE YOU WILL FIND AN ANCIENT TREASURE TOO!
the idea seems logical, doesn't it?
ISLAND WITH UNDERSEA PALACE YOU WILL ALSO FIND AN ANCIENT TREASURE!
A treasure!
Exactly.
You have a dream.
Of a treasure slumbering at the bottom of the sea.
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE AZURE PIRATE FLAG
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
What, I don't look like a high school student?
My sandbox friend and classmate Ran.
When I went to the amusement park with her..,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on what was happening,
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He administered a poison to me
and when I came to...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked my name,
I said Conan Edogawa.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
This old man is Kogorô Môri, Ran's father and a detective.
Also known as the Sleeping Kogorô.
And that's
is because of this...
And she is Sonoko Suzuki.
She's Ran's age and as nice as "daughters from rich homes" rarely are.
The old man is Professor Agasa.
He has invented various devices for me..,
he has invented various devices for me.
And she is Ai Haibara.
Real name: Shiho Miyano.
She originally belonged to the men in black, too.
To escape from them, she took the medicine they gave me,
and shrank.
I haven't found out the truth about those guys yet.
But as true as I am a detective, I will get even with them!
I am small, my mind is not!
No case remains unsolved!
There is always only one truth!
But what I wonder is...
Why are treasure hunters here?
Because a treasure was found.
About two weeks ago.
- A treasure? - So...
the silver service from the underwater palace was actually real?
I heard it was.
What underwater palace?
Look, there is a small uninhabited island.
That's the island of Yorioyajima.
YORIOYAJIMA
About 200 meters from its eastern shore
lies a huge stone structure on the bottom of the sea.
That in the vicinity of Kômijima
ancient ruins on the seabed near Kômijima first became generally known
about 10 years ago.
Countless scientists have studied them,
UNDERWATER PALACE
are divided as to whether they are the work of man or the
or a freak of nature.
Yorioyajima used to rise
apparently rose higher above sea level,
but after an earthquake 300 years ago, the island subsided
and took its present shape.
They said earthquake... Did a landslide also take place during that time?
Yes.
Because in this area
there's a layer of methane hydrate on the ocean floor.
It is said that this layer suddenly decomposed
and caused the landslide.
You, Conan...
What is that? That metal chicken wire?
Methane hydrate.
METHANHYDRATE
At low temperature and high pressure
water molecules enclose methane molecules in a lattice structure.
The substance is also called "burning ice."
Burning ice?
Lattice structure?

Gibberish to me.
To put it crudely...
You have already built houses of cards.
So you build a house of cards from water molecules
and put a methane molecule in each of its "rooms".
When the temperature rises
or the pressure decreases, the whole thing becomes unstable,
breaks apart and the methane flows out.
I see.
And if there is an island on top of it and
it loses its hold, there is a landslide.
Yes, roughly speaking, you could put it that way.
That's how they explained it on TV!
Is that so?
Idiot...
Hello! Mima-san!
This is Iwanaga from the tourist office!
Mima-san! Are you there?
Mima-san!
Quite different from the hotel earlier.
Yes, it is.
I'm very sorry.
I guess he's not in.
I called him, but...
What's that noise?
Ah, Mima-san!
KAZUO MIMA PENSION OWNER
Mr. Môri's group, like I said on the phone...
5000 yen a night, one meal included.
If you don't like it, go somewhere else.
Mo... Wait, Mima-san!
Pompous guy.
Sorry. He's a nice person,
but unfortunately a little eccentric.
Well...
Is anyone playing the treasure hunt game?
Yes!
J... yes!
The young ladies wanted to dive, didn't they?
Yes.
If you'd like to leave right now, I'll drive you there.
That would be very nice!
And what would you two like to do?
The treasure hunt game is a lot of fun!
I'm just going to relax here for a while.
What about you, Môri-san?
- Treasure hunting? - No.
But recommend me an inn
with local sake and a pretty landlady!
Uh...
Ran Môri-san and Sonoko Suzuki-san, right?
CHIKA MABUCHI OWNER OF THE DIVE SHOP
You rent all the equipment?
Yes!
Kimiko!
Yes!
KIMIKO YAMAGUCHI DIVING INSTRUCTOR
Are these two wetsuits okay?
I think the M size will fit you both.
- Yes! - Yes, it fits.
I'm glad.
We don't have too much of a selection of suits, I'm afraid.
Oh, where do you think!
The suits look great!
You think so?
Bye.
Hey, you two! You put everything away nicely again, didn't you?
We'll be back.
Those two men are treasure hunters, right?
Are they going to dive with us?
We just let them use the compressor.
There's been more and more of them lately....
Probably because of the silver service...
And there's a legend that Anne hid her treasure here...
after she escaped from prison.
Which Anne?
That one!
There is a theory that about 270 years ago,
according to Japanese reckoning
in the Kyôhô era, the underwater palace was above the surface of the sea.
As proof speak
this cutlass and this pistol,
both of which were found in the underwater palace.
The initials carved on the cutlass and the pistol indicate that they were
suggest that they might have belonged to the pirates Anne Bonny and
Anne Bonny and Mary Read,
who were active in the 1930s.
The two sailed with "Calico Jack" Rackham....
Female pirates, you say?
Yes, Anne Bonny and Mary Read.
The two belonged
of the crew of "Calico Jack" Rackham.
When the British Navy attacked their ship,
they did not hide in the hold like the other men,
but bravely fought back to back, as the story goes.
Back to back?
You leave the enemies in your back to your partner
and concentrate only on the enemies in front of you.
To do this, you have to trust your partner unconditionally.
Ran.
For me it is clear: You, Ran, are the only one to whom I would
I would trust my back to!
S... Sonoko...
Nonsense!
If it was you, Ran, it'd be Shin'ichi-kun, right?
No, not that one...
Is that right?
Yes, really!
That's because it's consistent with the theory that..,
...that after Anne escaped from prison...
from prison in the Bahamas
went to the Pacific Ocean and waited there for Mary, still active as a pirate,
it is said that she hid her treasure here on the island of Kômijima.
So let's go! Let's also look for Anne and Mary's treasure!
I wonder if these things are real?
Who knows...
FLINTLOCK PISTOL
If so, that would be a big deal.
What if it's just a PR stunt for the island?
That would be a big deal, too.
In any case: a huge thing.

Sorry!
I've kept you waiting a long time...
There, there...
Here!
TREASURE HUNTER CARD
This is the treasure map.
You start here and get a stamp from each of the five points on the map.
and solve the puzzles you find there.
The first point is here.
Press the stamp on the empty spot under the map
and take the piece of paper from the chest
with the clue for the next point.
What a kid's stuff.
Oh, don't be like that. They're almost bursting with action!
A ten and a twelve. That's the key to hiding the treasure....
The next point is...
NO MATTER IF THE EVENING SUN GOES DOWN... PIRATES SHINE AND SHIMMER.
"No matter if the evening sun sets.... pirates shine and shimmer."
What's up with that?
Well, do your best!
If you find the treasure, you'll receive a special gift!
A... A special gift? What to eat?
You'll find out when you solve it.
- Yes! I'll do my best! I'll do my best! - It's not
sure it's food!
- Say, Uncle... - Huh? What's wrong?
Did you make up all those riddles yourself?
Well... yes.
Oh, yes. There's a bike rental place in the community center next door. Use it.
Walking would be pretty exhausting.
Yes!
You're full of energy yourself, Kudô-kun.
Okay! Everything's ready.
Let's go! Follow Kimiko's instructions, and you'll be safe. And have fun!
Be especially careful on the south side of the palace.
It's deep down there.
Don't scare us!
Don't worry! I'll be with you all the time.
- Right. - Thank you in advance.
You're back early. What happened?
Sharks!
The clue said evening sun, so we
so we went to the westernmost point of the island.
But where is the treasure chest with the clue?
Oh yes! I've got it!
After all, the clue says, "No matter the setting sun....
Pirates shine and shimmer."
And that describes
- the surface of the sea! - I see.
Now what?
Is there a stamp on the sea somewhere, huh?
Ah, well... that's right, it can't be.
I see...
Look there!
What's that?
Those are fish...
What do you think, are they eels?
There are no eels here!
Ah, all right.
Hey, Conan!
- What do you mean, "all clear"? - Did you find out anything?
Do you know why fish gather in one place like this?
- Why do you think... - Maybe they're playing together.
Maybe they're hungry and eat together!
Guess!
And what do you think they eat?
Maybe plankton?
Correct.
Wow...
But what's going on here...
Look at them.
They're sea glowworms!
"No matter if the setting sun... Pirates shine and shimmer."
- That's what this place is called! - There it is!
TREASURE HUNT GAME
SKINNY PIRATES LAUGH
"Skinny pirates laugh," it says.
You don't have to be skinny to laugh.
What's going on, Haibara?
A person covered in blood in a diving suit has just been carried to shore.
What?
I don't know if it was Ran-san.
Conan-kun!
Edogawa-kun and I have to go out for a while.
You guys just keep searching!
What, you too, Haibara-san?
Don't worry! I'm right here with you!
We'll find the treasure without the other two.
You're right.
OP IN SERVICE
Ra...
Ran-neechan!
Conan-kun! And even Ai-chan...
A... are you all right?
Yes. But we've got...
SERGEANT UEHIRA
How is he, Uehira-san?
Oh, Kimi-chan!
Were you there, too?
I was diving nearby with those students.
What a surprise! That the sharks attacked a human...
And that only one was attacked, even though there were three of them...
What do you mean?
Nothing.
It's really bad... We haven't had an accident with sharks in years.
And what's more, I've never seen sharks in this place before.
Is what?
Well, the fact that, like Kimiko-san said..,
only one of the three was attacked...
Could it be a coincidence?
If the three of them are professionals, they know the precautions against sharks.
What did you find?
A plastic bag...
Fish blood?
The reason for the attack.
Yes. Someone filled the thin bag with fish blood, sealed it not too tightly...
and attached it to the jacket of the suit.
The water pressure increases by one atmosphere every 10 meters.

At the surface, it is one atmosphere.
At a depth of 10 meters, it is two.
At a depth of 30 meters, it is four.
Under such a great pressure
the seal of such a bag will inevitably burst.
Sharks hear sounds from several kilometers away and
smell blood with their sense of smell even in 100-fold dilution.
So it was murder?
Yes.
But only attempted.
Hey there, little four-eyes!
What are you two doing all alone, huh?
A case, Uncle!
What did you say?
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm the master detective Kogorô Môri...
That shark must have a big mouth.
But...
A shark attack is more like an accident than a real case.
Ah!
What? Why did you say "ah"?
What's that?
W... how is it, doctor?
We did our best, but the blood loss was too high...
My condolences.
Damn...
It's terrible... To have a fatal accident...
No, it wasn't an accident.
You're the master detective...
I'm Kogorô Môri.
- Dad... - You're here too?
Hey! What do you mean it wasn't an accident?
Someone lured the sharks here...
and made them attack you.
They did it with fish blood...
in a plastic bag attached to this buoyancy compensator.
I hear you two are treasure hunters....
There must be more to it than that.
Tell me, Ran-nêchan...
Where are these buoyancy compensators usually kept?
Well... I don't think you'd take them to your hotel room...
They are most likely to be kept in the dive store.
They fill up the tanks there, too.
Like this?
GROTTO HOT SHOWER: 300 METERS
STORAGE ROOM
If the vest was prepared, it was here.
It would have been too risky to move it.
Come here, Kudô-kun.
What is it, Haibara?
Take a look at this.
This is where the diving equipment is rinsed off.
So the ground is always wet.
Could you...
take some pictures with it, please?
I have something else to investigate.
Since when did I suddenly become your assistant?
No, not assistant,
more like a partner?
That's quick thinking. Respect.
See you later. Thanks a lot.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Excuse me, I'm...
- What's up? - Is there someone in the store at night?
Are you playing detective?
My house is behind the store
and Kimiko lives near the harbor.
So there's no one here in the evening.
So...
Besides... no one ever steals anything on this island,
so we never lock the door.
Kimiko! You closed the store last night, didn't you?
J... Yes.
Why do you ask?
The little detective there asked me some questions.
Oh, I see.
You want to find out who rigged the vest?
Yes.
It's true. Yesterday I closed the store...
and I opened it again this morning. But we never lock up,
anyone could have snuck in.
So?
Did you find anything?
No...
So far, nothing at all.
I hope you find something.
What's the matter, you ask?
What's going on, you ask?! What's taking you so long, Conan?
We'll never find the pirate treasure without you!
Why don't you try it on your own once in a while?
But we can't do it alone!
Where are you now?
On the way to the suspension bridge.
Which suspension bridge?
It's on the treasure hunter's map!
On the treasure map...
Ah, there it is.
Then get there fast!
Yes, yes.
I have no other choice.
Haibara, are you coming?
I'll pass.
That's what I thought.
What are you doing?
NO TRESPASSING KÔMI VILLAGE GOVERNMENT
You can't pass through here!
Really...
What's up?
- You're alone? - Yes, I'm alone.
I think the others are at the suspension bridge up there.
I'd like to go there too.
But it's forbidden to go there.
I'm sorry. In the earthquake last week, a landslide blocked the road.
If you go a little further, there's a path on the left.
Take that as a detour, will you?
Yes! Thank you, Iwanaga-san!
Take care of yourself!
Yes!
Let's give up. We'll never figure it out.
Don't worry. We can do it with Conan-kun.
We can do it without Conan-kun.
Let's try it alone!
There's a sign at the other end of the bridge!
I wonder what it says.
Let's take a look.
I'm hungry...
Hey! Wait for me!
Easy, easy...
Wait, wait!

Don't move!
Wh... why not?
D... that...
PASSAGE FORBIDDEN FOR PERSONS OVER 40 KG
What's wrong?
Genta-kun, how much do you weigh?
- Thirty-nine kilograms! - No way!
Ah... I've gained some weight. Forty-five kilos?
Oh no!
The bridge collapses if someone over 40 kg crosses it!
Wha... what, really?
Oh, I get it!
"Skinny pirates laugh" means..,
you're supposed to cross the bridge!
You're right!
"Skinny pirates laugh", means fat pirates cry!
Help! Mom...
There she is!
TREASURE HUNT GAME
PIRATES DON'T CRY AND MOAN.
PIRATES DON'T CRY AND SQUEAL.
What does it mean? That pirates don't cry...
It's already four.
We must continue tomorrow.
Yes.
But how do we get back?
Yeah, I wonder...
If Genta-kun stays there..,
...the bridge will collapse if we step on it.
Hello! What are you doing?
Conan-kun, we found it!
That's great! You can do it after all!
The next clue: "Pirates don't cry and moan!"
But this bridge will collapse if anyone over 40 kg crosses it!
Is that what it says over there?
Ah, no...
It says: "Passage forbidden for persons over 40 kg!"
Well, well. So that's why "skinny pirates laugh", huh?
Then everything is okay! Come back!
The sign there is only a hint!
Persons under 40 kg are either women or children.
That there is a riddle, which only they can solve,
is unlikely!
I hope you had a good flight!
But you didn't have to come all the way here!
There is something that worries me.
Commissioner!
Thank you for coming all this way...
First we'll question those involved.
I... Understood!
We'll be treated like criminals!
TARÔ IZUYAMA TREASURE HUNTER
But we are much more likely to be the victims, aren't we?
Then why don't you tell everything
honestly, like victims should?
Have you ever seen these two men before?
No. I've never seen them before.
They robbed a supermarket in Shinbashi last night...
Supermarket in Shinbashi last night.
They said you ordered them to do it.
So they'd join your gang.
I don't know anything.
MITSUSHI MATSUMOTO TREASURE HUNTER
They're talking garbage out of desperation.
You...
Do you have any proof?
You only have their statements.
There, there...
Please calm down a bit, all of you. Have a cold drink.
All right, if you have nothing else to say, we'd like to...
we'd like to go back to our room and rest.
So you really have no idea who's after your life,
Matsumoto-san?
No, I don't.
Have a nice evening.
Excuse me.
Could you give me a light? I forgot the lighter.
Here, take it.
Thank you.
Thanks again.
What a waste of time.
Uh... May I help myself?
I'm incredibly thirsty.
I don't care. Those guys didn't touch the glasses.
We wanted to get the fingerprints that way.
Yes.
But even if we had the prints,
it would take time to get the results back here.
It doesn't matter if a specialist comes here or if we send them the information.
But Takagi-kun... I didn't know you smoked.
I don't.
Does anyone have any superglue?
If we're going to sit here and eat like this...
A quiz with bad puns!
Guess.
Here it comes...
- Finally. - I was wondering where it was.
In the kingdom of fishes next to the underwater palace came out,
that the king had done something bad and
the sea bream was chosen as the next king.
I wonder who among these three was the previous king?
One: the octopus.
Two: the octopus.
Three: the crab.
Which of the three was it?
I got it! Number three, the crab!
And why?
He beheaded the ones he didn't like with his claws!
That's mean!
Come on, Conan!
That would be almost a little brutal.
Sorry.
It was the Kraken!
And why?
The octopus, as king, has claimed all the riches of the realm for itself.
Imagine what an octopus looks like.
You mean it was rich like a bigwig?
That's exactly how it is!
But it isn't.
Then it's No. 1, the octopus!

But why?
Leave it to me!
This time I'll give you the right answer!
The king has first...
...a clean slate.
He's an octopus. Ink stains.
Therefore, he has......a stain on his vest. A stain on his vest?
He doesn't have a clean slate anymore!
D... That's right!
That's suspicious.
Ah, Conan-kun!
KING HAS CLEAN VEST INK STAINS...
- That's the guy... -with the stain on his vest.
It's a nice moon, isn't it?
I'm curious... Why are you running a boarding house?
Well, since I live alone, I could actually get away with fishing.
The municipality asked me to open the boarding house.
They want more visitors to come here.
I see.
So I guess we're intruders into your private life, which...
Compared to the treasure hunters, you're still a saint.
Speaking of treasure hunters... Do you think this treasure really exists?
Hyenas don't congregate where there is no prey.
But maybe it turns out to be something else entirely.
I just don't get it!
"Pirates don't cry and moan..."
Think about it a little more seriously, Genta-kun!
Hey, kid!
The clue says, "Pirates don't cry and moan?"
Yes, that's right.
Where the pirates cry, I'd know.
Where the pirates cry, you mean?
Maybe that's a clue, too.
Shall we go and look?
You want to go out now?
It's already dark!
Better postpone it until tomorrow...
We don't know what the weather will be like tomorrow.
You mean it will be bad?
If the wind blows dancing from the south, we won't go out fishing.
Then the sea will be stormy.
You know a lot about living here!
Then let's all go together! As a digestive walk!
Yes!
So? What are you going to do with it now, Takagi-kun?
Well... This is called the "cyanoacrylate method."
The vapors of the cyanoacrylate contained in the superglue react with the
water content in secretion residue. One can use this effect
to make fingerprints visible.
After some time, the prints should become visible.
When did you learn how to do this?
Well, I
saw it in a movie once and then asked Tome-san if it worked.
Well, let's hope it works as well as it did in the movie.
Can we find the answer to "pirates don't cry" here?
I don't know if it's an answer, but here they cry.
They cry...
Could it be the wind?
It sounds like someone is crying.
Indeed!
But we already heard it on the way here.
I know that myself.
The sand here has quite a high quartz content.
And the grains are very fine.
Oh, I see.
Hey, Conan!
Did you find out anything?
Listen carefully!
This is squeaky sand! That's why they say, "Pirates cry and moan!"
You'll have to figure out the rest for yourselves.
Yeah, all right!
So, it was, "Pirates don't cry and moan."
Over there?
Come here! Nothing moans here!
So pirates don't cry and moan over there?
Almost too cliché.
THE SOUL OF THE PIRATES ASCENDS TO HEAVEN.
The next clue reads, "The soul of pirates ascends to heaven."
Again, something so incomprehensible...
Really quite imaginative, the director.
I mean Iwanaga-san, the tourism director.
He said he came up with those clues himself.
Well, that's his job, isn't it?
That woman is cold as a fish!
Did something happen?
Conan-kun, what's wrong?
This is getting more and more interesting.
Conan-kun?
I have to go somewhere for a while. Go back without me!
- Hey, Conan-kun! - Again?
He can't fit into any group.
Conan-kun?
Here they are!
We'll email them to the central office and get the results.
Great job, Takagi-kun!
Well...
Tell me right away that you want to go to Forensics!
I'll be happy to write you a recommendation.
Oh, don't say that...
Well, I'll have to send this to headquarters.
Copy that.
What are you doing here?
I got lost on a walk...
Where's the Kômi guesthouse?
It's over there.
Thank you very much! And good night.
How's it going, Takagi-kun? Have you heard back from headquarters yet?
No, not yet.
Well, well...
What's going on?
TOURIST CENTER

A... Alarm at the tourist center!
That means something happened there, right?
Not necessarily. Often there are false alarms.
In any case, we have to check it out.
Where is it?
- Right next to the community center. - We'll take your car!
J... yes...
Dispatch should answer soon. Take care of it!
To... too commanding.
Why does one incident have to follow another?
D... the answer!
Uh...
INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANT
That's... this is...
Quick, get in!
UMI ECONOMY
A pretty landlady...
I asked if there was a place with a pretty barmaid.
Yes, there is.
You there! Let me drink in peace! That's why I hate resorts.
Now Uncle's getting mad!
Hey! Not so loud!
What's going on?
Hey there, wait!
What's going on?
Is this a store with a beauty in it, huh? Mr. Director!
Oh, it's not so bad. She's beautiful in the dark.
- Take responsibility! - I'm busy.
What do you mean?
Someone broke into the exhibition at the tourist center!
What? Broke in?
Get out of the way!
- Hey, wait a minute! - Come on, get on!
- Or I'll leave you here! - Wait a minute!
- Now hold on tight! - Hey, wait a minute!
What about the bill? Hey, the gentleman!
What's wrong, auntie?
Oh, Uehira-chan, a bill collector! Please catch him!
What's wrong... Another incident?
The display case was smashed with a crowbar.
Pretty brazen.
Yes, what is it, Satô-kun?
Well... Like Conan said, someone was hit.
There are traces of blood.
Well, well.
Can you secure the crime scene?
That could be difficult.
I thought so. So take pictures of everything first and then come back here.
Got it.
Cutlass and pistol...
Are the objects of value?
They are treasures from the bottom of the sea.
They are Anne Bonny's cutlass and Mary Read's pistol.
But I'm here now. So don't worry anymore.
Môri-kun, your face is all red.
Ah, well... Since you're all here already, I thought...
- Kogorô Môri! -I'm embarrassed...
I'm arresting you!
You're under arrest for drunk and disorderly, bicycle theft, and drunk driving!
There, there...
I... is it really true?
Yes. He cheated on his bill at the tavern,
stole Iwanaga-san's bike and ran away. That's what the innkeeper said.
He didn't steal or escape.
I had the director on the back of my bike the whole time! Didn't you?
J... Yes.
That reminds me... Commissioner, the results of the fingerprint match.
Hey! Is this for real?
Mitsushi Matsumoto. Robberies involving the theft of artifacts...
from excavations and museums worldwide, as well as murder.
INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANT
- Big fish. - So these guys are
wanted on an international warrant?
So they're actually after Anne and Mary's treasure.
That's what they're after? By treasure, did you mean something more than a gun and a cutlass?
Yes. Anne Bonny and Mary Read were female pirates.
They were active about 300 years ago.
and there's a legend that they hid treasure here on the island.
So this treasure really exists?
Yes. The stolen pistol and cutlass are proof of that.
Tell me, Uncle, didn't you go to the store with the beautiful landlady?
There is no such thing as a nice landlady's store. There's only an old aunt's.
I knew it. That smell is really...
Uncle, you've got something on your shirt.
What is it?
Ah...
How can you leave this island?
The course boat leaves once a day in the afternoon.
Otherwise there are only fishing boats.
Good. So appeal to everyone not to let their boats be stolen.
Yes, sir!
Hey! What about these handcuffs? Hey!
Listen, Commissioner Megure...
That man Matsumoto...
Mabuchi-san, the owner of the dive store..,
...something that looked like money.
- What? - Inspector Megure!
We're back.
Good. But I'll send you right back.
Matsumoto contacted the owner of the dive store.
Please go to the dive store. You and I will go to Matsumoto's hotel.
- Understood. - Superintendent! The handcuffs!
How's the weather?
The wind is strong, but...
The sun is shining, so don't worry.
Let's zoom in.
The profile is quite different.

The trace does not come from this wheel.
Conan-kun?
J... Yes!
Conan-kun! Breakfast!
I'll be right there!
What is it?
- It looks like a GPS transmitter. - A GPS transmitter?
What's it doing on this bike?
Come on! Where is this guy again?
He's right here. Just a little patience.
- There he is. - Sorry.
You're late, Conan! I'm almost starved!
Sorry.
Well?
Where's the old man?
At the town hall for an investigative session, he said.
Well, we're all here!
Bon appetit!
Bon appetit!
It was pretty close, wasn't it?
More!
Did you run into Iwanaga-san on the way to the suspension bridge?
Iwanaga-san?
Ah, the tourism director?
Yes.
No, we didn't see him. Didn't we?
No.
We found the place all by ourselves!
So...
So, do you have enough to eat?
Yes, it's quite enough! Thanks a lot!
Do you want to go diving again today?
Oh, no. After yesterday's incident I'm a bit scared.
Tomorrow we won't have time, so we'll take a boat trip today.
You'd better not go out again from this afternoon on.
There's a storm coming.
It's really coming...
Then we'd better get started on the treasure hunt!
You're right. We just have one more puzzle to solve.
Let's do our best, Conan-kun!
I have to go out for a while. You guys go look for the treasure together.
Let's leave the guy who can't fit into groups to the left,
We'll find the treasure on our own and divide it between us.
Agreed!
There is actually none to be found on the other bikes.
Here, the latest report from the low pressure area!
Oh dear... That's a little typhoon!
Inform the fishermen's cooperative and the hotel.
- Yes. - Ojemine...
Matsumoto and Izuyama have not returned to the hotel.
They haven't left the island, but are probably hiding somewhere.
At least one of them was hit by a rifle shot.
They must be getting treatment for that.
I checked with the clinic, they didn't show up.
As for Mabuchi from the dive store.... At the scene Conan-kun witnessed..,
Matsumoto asked them to get a ship to help them escape.
I'll put it bluntly: I have no idea where those guys are hiding.
I can barely keep my head above water with the store.
That's why I went along with Matsumoto's suggestion.
It was the worst move I ever made.
I see.
And the bullet casings Takagi-kun collected...
They're pretty old. They've probably been stored somewhere for a long time.
We checked with the hunting association about the rifle.
Come in!
Excuse me, sir.
I heard that Mineo-san's hunting rifle went missing.
- Oh, really? - Who is this Mineo-san?
Well, he's... An elderly gentleman who lives alone.
His niece, Chika Mabuchi-san, who runs the dive store,
takes care of him a little.
Go to Mineo-san immediately and question him.
Then bring Mabuchi-san here with her consent.
Yes!
Find the cutlass and the pistol again!
I'm asking you to do that!
We will do our best.
But... Why do you think they went among the thieves..,
why did they go among the thieves?
Good question... Normally, Uehira-san is here alone.
It would be easier to leave the island then.
They were afraid their identities would be revealed if they waited too long.
Uh... What about your support from Tokyo?
No helicopters or ships are taking off because of the low-pressure system.
We'll have to solve this on our own.
We have to find Matsumoto and his buddy...
and the criminal who's trying to kill them.
There she is!
I found it!
Great!
The last task was quite simple.
The pirate's soul rises into the sky. This must be the lookout tower.
THE NUMBERS ON THE STAMPS ARE THE CLUE.
"The numbers are the clue.
So, now look for our treasure!"
SO, NOW LOOK FOR OUR TREASURE!
Chika-san is looking at wind and weather right now.
Wait a moment.
Yes.
Thanks for waiting!
I'm sorry, but we can't go out to sea right now.
The waves are too high.
What a pity!
Nothing to do.
Let's just pass the time on the coast as a substitute.
Good morning, Uehira-san.
Ah, good morning.
Why are you looking so serious? Is something wrong?

Chika-chan, would you please come with me?
Commissioner Megure wants to talk to you.
Uncle...
What's wrong?
Why do you think the treasure hunters
stole the cutlass and the gun from the tourist center?
Treasure hunters are mainly interested in treasure hunting, aren't they?
So if they stole those things...
Do they need them to find treasure?
That's why I think
they're already on their way to the treasure.
Do you know where they might be?
Why are you asking me this question, kid?
Couldn't it be that you were once a treasure hunter too?
Suppose I used to be a treasure hunter?
That doesn't mean I know where the treasure is hidden.
You said yourself yesterday...
Since you're talking about treasure hunters... Do you think this treasure really exists?
Hyenas don't congregate where there is no prey.
But maybe it turns out to be something else entirely.
"Maybe it turns out to be something else entirely..."
That means you know something about what's hidden there.
Come on.
Why are some numbers blue and others red?
TREASURE HUNTER CARD
- Scissors! - Huh? Ah... right away.
We have two questions. Why some numbers are red, others blue.
And what the numbers themselves mean.
Maybe they are house numbers?
Here on the island.
I've got it! We'll ask our host!
Hey, uncle!
SHOWERS FOR A FEE
But what does Megure want to talk to Mabuchi-san about?
- with Mabuchi-san? - I wonder if it's about that incident.
Probably some misunderstanding. Get in the car.
Yes!
Would you invite these too, please?
How dare you!
You get in the car right now!
You don't want your girlfriend to get hurt, do you?
So you used to be a treasure hunter?
Yes, when I was young.
I came to this island looking for Anne and Mary's treasure.
And then I settled here.
Fell in love with a local woman, got married and started fishing.
This map here is 300 years old.
So it is...
This map was the template for that.
Iwanaga, the tourism director, used it as a template.
with a similar map as a template.
Because no one has ever solved the riddle of the numbers.
It was invented 300 years ago.
And it was invented by Anne Bonny.
Yes.
Does that mean that if this puzzle is solved, a real treasure...?
That's right.
If the puzzle is 300 years old, it's hardly house numbers.
Let's start with the most familiar one. The alphabet.
Then the number 5 means....
- 5 means... A, B, C, D, E... E! - Correct!
The number 7 is G.
And 12 is... A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
H, I, J, K, L... hm...?
The number 12 is L.
L!
These are all the numbers.
Above are the red ones, below are the blue ones, all converted into letters.
Now we have to arrange them.
Is it a name, perhaps? Red is the family name, blue is the first name?
A good approach.
Probably it will have something to do with pirates.
Yes, maybe!
Look! It actually looks like a name in that order!
"Jolly," you mean?
Jolly...
Quick, run away!
Hey!
Don't move!
Run!
So, you know a little karate, kid?
Be reasonable, or your friend's life is forfeit.
That's our boat!
What's it doing here?
Your boss was so kind...
When we paid her.
But this...
We don't need you anymore.
We don't have enough bottles.
- Kimiko-san! - Don't move!
Don't move a step!
Get in the boat!
I'm not good at this kind of thing...
Hm... What do you think?
How do you pronounce it?
Maybe something like "Gro"?
- Jolly Gro? No.
Roger.
Jolly roger.
Jolly Roger?
- Who's that? - A famous pirate?
Literally, "The Jolly Roger."
The Jolly Roger was something that sailors in the 18th century
did not want to behold at any price.
There is a theory that the name comes from "jolie rouge", "red flag",
or from the name "Old Roger" for the devil.
- Flag? - Devil?
That's right. "Jolly Roger" refers to the pirate flag,
that's on the map there.
You're really great, Conan-kun!
You solved it.
What's that?
It's a painting,
that was painted by a Spanish sailor who sailed past this island...
about 300 years ago.

Later, the island sank into the sea.
It is said that this happened because of a gas, methane or something.
Yorioyajima used to rise
apparently higher than the sea level,
KÔMIJIMA YORIYOYAJIMA
but after an earthquake 300 years ago, the island subsided
and took its present shape.
Yorioyajima...
So the treasure is there?
Yes, probably.
But there must be something else.
Something, some clue that will pinpoint the location even further....
- What have you got, Conan? - Did you find something?
The Jolly Roger on this old map...
The teeth of the skull... Don't they look like letters?
Yes, they do! They look like Latin letters!
The top row reads: D, O, S.
The lower
D, I, O, S, A, S.
I wonder what that means.
Dos Diosas.
DOS DIOSAS = TWO GODDESSES
That means "two goddesses" in Spanish.
- Wow! - That's great, Haibara-san!
So that's it. Now we have to go to the island to....
But the treasure hunters were looking for the treasure in the water.
Does that mean the treasure is hidden in the sea?
No. Because if it were, there should be a clue pointing to the sea.
The god Poseidon is a male god....
Probably they were looking for another entrance.
The entrance to the two goddesses was half buried in an earthquake.
Adults can't fit through there anymore.
They found another entrance!
That's why, even though the cops are here,
they took the risk of stealing the pistol and the cutlass!
The diving instructor!
What happened?
- W... where's Môri-san? - He's not here.
He's at the community center.
Ran-chan and Sonoko-chan have been kidnapped!
With the boat...
Who did it? Who took them?
Ma... Matsumoto...
The treasure hunter...
They went there! Yorioyajima Island!
You go to the town hall and inform the old man!
- All right! - Yes!
- Be careful. - Yes.
Excuse me.
Could you
in your boat to the island, please?
What are you saying?
I'm not doing it for the treasure. I want to save the two girls.
Shin'ichi!
Conan-kun! I heard Ran and Sonoko were kidnapped?
Yes.
You'll go rescue them no matter what I say?
Wait a minute. I have something to give you.
I'll go ahead and get the boat ready.
All right.
Please take these.
They're little scuba tanks.
Pull them apart like this,
and you can breathe in them for ten minutes.
Unfortunately, I only have two of them.
So don't use them unless it's an emergency!
Thank you, Professor.
You two dive with the one bottle.
But from here on you don't need us at all!
Yes, we do. We want you to keep working for us a little longer.
Go on, get ready!
They don't want...
Sonoko!
It's your turn now, kid.
What on earth are you going to do with us?
You're a little late.
What?!
Matsumoto kidnapped Ran and Sonoko?
Where did he take them?
- Where? To the island, of course! - Yorioyajima Island.
The men found out where the treasure is and are going to get it!
Get a ship ready.
We're going to rescue Ran and Sonoko!
We... got it!
But why did those guys take the girls hostage?
They'll just get in the way of the treasure hunt!
They have a use for them.
A use?
They were both injured by the gunshots.
And they are now diving in the place where the sharks attacked them yesterday.
They're using them as bait?
Probably yes.
Over there!
So it's true...
What do we do? We're running out of time...
Take me to the island.
What?
I should be able to get past this entrance, right?
The air...
Well, well, well!
You even survived!
Take that torch and come here.
You don't know your way around.
If you stay here, you'll only die miserably.
Come on, let's go!
Don't push me!
Where are we?
We've come this far many times before.
But today we're gonna get our hands on Anne Bonnie and Mary Read's treasure.
You guys stay here for a while.
Follow the path upwards and you'll come to a shrine.
There are statues of the two goddesses.
- Behind it is the entrance. - All right!
You only have half an hour.
- Otherwise we can't go back. - Yes.

Thank you very much! I bring back Ran-nêchan and Sonoko-nêchan with me!
Anne Bonny and Mary Read...
Strange... An adult could get through here too!
During the earthquake last week a landslide
blocked the road.
Aha. The earthquake has widened the entrance again.
Did they bring the girls...
They didn't have to bring them here for that.
But...
Matsumoto and his buddy were hit by the gunfire.
When they dive, the sharks are attracted by the smell of their blood.
What does this have to do with Ran?
Maybe they want to use the two girls as bait.
Wait up, Môri-san! What are you doing?
Let go! I can't abandon them!
This is crazy, Môri-san! The weather is getting worse and worse!
I don't care! Let go of me!
Forgive me.
What should we do now?
I guess we'll have to go back.
Though I'm sorry...
Come inside, children. It's dangerous out there.
It's even more dangerous there.
Where Conan-kun, Ran-nêsan, and Sonoko-nêsan are...
- Yes, they are. - That's right.
- The water is getting deeper and deeper. - So it's low tide.
- If you want to go through that hole... - That's right.
That hole is the secret way to the treasure.
Okay. Take the scuba tanks and follow me.
So it's true. The legend of the pirates...
So it seems.
Leave the tanks here and go ahead.
- But... - Shut up! Go on!
Bone! Bones! Bones! There are bones!
Everything seems to be okay this time.
- The gas, I mean. - Gas?
Depending on how the wind blows, gas accumulates in this chamber.
That's why you sent us ahead?
Why do you think we brought you along?
Come on, keep moving.
What's that?
That's it!
We found it!
Miserable idiot.
No wonder you die trying to open the door...
with something like this.
But with this...
You open it.
- What, me? - I'll do it.
Ran!
Damn... So it's not working?
Give it up already!
I see! So that's how it is.
You get it?
Anne and Mary are supposed to have fought back to back.
So that means...
...means this!
We did it! We did it! We did it! We did it!
Give me the torch!
Wow.
The treasure! Where's the treasure?
Don't be rash!
Ran, what are we going to do?
We could run away now.
But then we'd be floating on the sea without any oxygen.
You're right.
We can only wait here for help.
You're right.
A draft! So there is a connection.
Damn!
It's not here! There's no treasure here!
Neither a treasure nor the smallest, most worthless coin!
Somebody, I don't know who, beat us to it...
and grabbed the whole treasure!
Hey, you miserable word-breaker!
I'm only here because there should be mountains of treasure!
Shut the fuck up!
We'll just have to get out of here as quickly as possible.
First we get rid of the useless ballast.
I'm sorry, but...
But that's your fate.
Don't move!
- Ran! Watch my back! - You watch mine!
You miserable...
Oops.
Damn it!
That chick is strong!
That's right, she's strong.
But no matter how strong she is, she can't fight this.
Against this.
You should always play your trump card last.
Quick, get down!
Are you okay?
Ran-nêchan and Sonoko-nêchan?
Well done, boy!
I'm amazed you found us here!
The cave is connected to Yorioyajima.
So it really was true.
About the pirate treasure.
According to them, there's nothing here.
They shouted that someone else had taken the treasure away.
Did you hear that? Pity, isn't it?
You're welcome to show yourself slowly.
You've been following me all the time.
Commissioner! Can we slowly clear the ship?
The wind has calmed down a bit and...
Môri-san...
According to the weather forecast...
won't let up until dawn.
S... look! It has actually weakened!
Please calm down...
I can't calm down! Ran has been kidnapped!
And the only one who went to save her is the little spectacled snake!
We adults are supposed to wait and bite our fingernails?
Môri-kun!
I understand, but it can't be helped: We can't go out there!

As soon as the wind dies down a bit, we will rescue the two girls!
Get a hold of yourself, please!
Damn it!
You're welcome to show yourself slowly.
They've been following me the whole time.
Iwanaga-san!
Don't do that. You make it sound so dishonorable...
I only wanted to save the kidnapped girls!
Why did you take the rifle?
We are dealing with internationally wanted criminals...
This is the rifle that was stolen from Mineo-san.
N... no!
You took it with you so that the treasure wouldn't be stolen!
The treasure has nothing to do with it.
Iwanaga-san,
the riddles from the treasure maps... You said..,
You made them up yourself?
J... Yes.
But at Mima-san, we saw the same number code as on the maps.
It was on a treasure map that was over 300 years old.
Anne Bonny's treasure map.
That means you must have seen this map at least once.
In short, you wanted the puzzle you failed to solve..,
by the people who come to visit this island.
I remember: he suggested that Pops should join the game too!
I see.
The master detective would be able to solve the puzzle sooner than a couple of kids!
And to be able to follow the movements of the treasure hunters,
you have attached GPS transmitters to the rental bikes.
I did that just for the safety of the participants!
If you convert the numbers from the treasure hunter card into letters,
you get Jolly Roger, that is, the pirate flag.
Because this island used to
looked like a skull,
Anne Bonny left this clue.
Perhaps the "Yorioya" from Yorioyajima is also
is an abraded form of "Jolly Roger?"
By then, you'll probably have solved the mystery as well.
But "Jolly Roger" had another meaning.
What?
On the original card there was a picture
of "Jolly Roger," the pirate flag.
In the teeth of the skull on the flag was the second clue.
"Dos Diosas,"
translated "the two goddesses."
C... Conan-kun...
Yes, you passed by that one when you followed me, didn't you?
At the small shrine of the two goddesses.
The shrine marked the entrance.
Oh... I see...
Why didn't I...
Damn it! So I made a mistake right at the beginning!
The one who manipulated the vest
and shot the treasure hunters, wasn't it you?
it was you, wasn't it?
At the back of the store
and also at the place where the cartridge cases were lying,
there were the tire tracks of your mountain bike.
All the mistakes that even an elementary school student would notice....
Not an elementary school student.
But the old Kogorô!
I heard it all from him.
The old man also said
that Iwanaga-san smelled like gunpowder.
Because the gun was old,
a lot of gunpowder got into the environment when it was fired.
- Well, I'll be! - So that's how it was...
Kogorô Môri lives up to his reputation as a master detective.
An earthquake?
It's calmed down.
- Oh no! Let's get out of here! - And we have to take the others with us!
Yes.
Iwanaga-san, help us!
J... Yes.
Darn it!
Now what? The entrance is...
It's gas!
Let's get to the ship!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Damn... If this keeps up...
Conan-kun, what should we do now?
First, we'll take the others to the cabin...
...and let them breathe air from the scuba tanks...
So they don't breathe in any gas.
And you two, please use this.
What's this?
Scuba tanks the professor designed.
And where's yours?
I've got them here, don't worry.
I see...
Damn, what now?
That's how we'll get the gas...
Gas!
The gas is probably methane gas.
It's collecting under the ceiling.
With this gas, we could...
Is there something here? Something we could use?
There!
Ran-nêchan and Sonoko-nêchan, listen to me carefully.
Sea water coming in here means..,
means the rock above us isn't thick.
We'll let the gas explode, the ceiling will collapse and we'll be...
with the ship...
You want to escape from this cave with the ship?
Is that gonna work?
I don't know.
But we could just be waiting to suffocate or drown anyway.
If there's no hope anyway...
I guess we'll just have to try.
What should we do, Conan-kun?

I kick the chain links that are lying there up to the ceiling,
they hit the rock.
If everything works out, they spark and the gas explodes.
You also go into the cabin and use your scuba tanks.
When it explodes, all the oxygen in here will burn up in one fell swoop.
What about you?
Don't worry. As soon as I get my limbs up..,
I'll escape to the cabin, too. Don't worry.
I'm fine.
Commissioner...
Prepare the ship! We're going to rescue her!
Yes!
We're all ready, Conan-kun!
Okay!
Darn it...
Conan-kun!
Conan-kun!
Conan-kun, hold on!
Hurry...
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Hurry up!
A... A pirate ship?
Ran!
Are you okay, Ran?
Yes, I'm fine!
We're saved.
Get off the ship!
- Look out! - Jump off!
Sonoko!
Hurry!
Well? Was he there? The treasure.
There was only a rickety old pirate ship.
But that ship was the treasure!
I mean...
The map that Anne Bonny left behind..,
wasn't really a treasure map at all,
but a message to Mary Read.
who had stayed behind in prison.
A message?
"I am here! I will wait for you here forever and ever,
Shin'ichi!"
- Just kidding. - Sonoko!
What are you babbling about like you've got it all figured out, you peck?
Don't. Maybe he's got a point.
Anne had this ship built
because she dreamed of sailing the seven seas with Mary...
to sail the seven seas again as soon as Mary...
Mary had broken out of prison.
But Mary fell ill in prison and passed away.
And Anne also died while she was still
waiting for Mary.
The ship, left alone,
waited in the cave like in a coffin for the day
when it would finally be released onto the open sea.
And today, after 300 years,
it has finally set out on its first and last voyage.
and brought you from the bottom of the sea to the surface.
And then, as if to follow its mistresses, it disappeared again.
I'm sorry, that was inappropriate. Forget what I said.
Well, there's no way of knowing if it's true..,
after all, 300 years have passed.
Well, that Anne was waiting for Mary, there's no doubt about it, dude.
You can clearly see the proof of that under the Jolly Roger.
Anne's and Mary's pistol and cutlass, I mean.
Say, uh...
I want to ask you...
How did you know I didn't have a scuba tank?
for me?
Because you looked just like him.
It was in the 2nd grade of middle school.
On the way home, I was caught in a downpour.
I'm in a jam...
Come on, take this.
You have to hurry home, don't you?
Yes... Thank you.
But what about you?
What do you think, I'm a detective!
I knew something like this would happen...
so I took another one.
You did? I'm so glad!
I have a date with my mother! Then I'll borrow it!
- You'll get it back tomorrow! - Okay!
But Shin'ichi didn't really have a second umbrella.
He came home soaking wet and caught a cold.
That's right. And you looked just like him.
Just like that stupid super-explorer, the same pretend equanimity.
I'm sorry I'm stupid.
