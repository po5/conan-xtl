LUNCH PACKAGES RESTAURANT MATSUKAZE
Crap. Got overtaken again.
You should have rented a better car.
Yes, that's right.
The train would have been better.
- Yes. - But really.
Shut up!
The client wanted me to bring all of you,
which is why I borrowed this bus.
Five more seconds.
- Huh? - If you don't move this bus right now,
we're going to crash into that wall.
What?
This is insane!
It almost looks like a castle!
Does a king live here then?
Idiot!
Of course not. It's a hotel.
Well, we're standing right in front of Miracle Land.
Rich people could stay here longer
and live in luxury, feeling like royalty.
That reminds me,
the hotel is supposed to have over 100,000 overnight guests.
It seems to be quite prosperous.
It looks like it.
Excuse me.
Are you Detective Môri?
Yes...
We've been expecting you.
I'm Takada, your employer's secretary.
May I show you in?
- Park the car. - Yes.
Here you are. Here it is.
Wow!
You can sure see all of Miracle Land!
Excuse me, but...
please sit down and wait.
What?
Come on, shut up and sit down.
Yes.
Good. Please be patient.
Unbelievable! I'm all excited.
What's wrong, Conan-kun?
These chairs don't match this room somehow.
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe we ran out of money.
That's impossible.
It's such a luxurious hotel!
Thank you so much for waiting.
To give you this,
the children were also invited.
What is this?
This is the Free Pass ID for Miracle Land.
While Môri-san goes about his work,
the children can
can have fun at Miracle Land.
Is the client also the owner?
No. It's not like that.
But this suite was rented for the whole year.
Very impressive.
Now, please fasten your IDs securely..,
so you don't lose them.
If they are lost, they cannot be replaced.
Please you too, Môri-san.
No thanks, I'm not going to the amusement park.
Don't say that.
After your job, you're welcome to have fun with the others.
In that case...
This ID is valid all day today...
until Miracle Land closes at 10:00 pm.
Food and drink are also free.
Enjoy yourself to your heart's content.
Hooray!
Thank you very much. Come on, Conan-kun.
Yes.
You stay here, please.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Maybe he's the 100,000th visitor to this hotel?
Well, something like that.
- Seriously? - You got it.
We'll go ahead and get in line.
The wait time for the Super Snake is two hours.
Yeah, okay. Well, Conan-kun. See you later.
What do you think you get for being the 100,000th visitor?
I'm sure it's not a radio or anything.
You're a real lucky guy.
If you get 100,000...
you'll get great service.
So that no one disturbs us.
Bother us?
I'm not number 100,000, am I?
There was confetti outside the hotel.
What? Is that right?
Yes.
About an hour ago, the 100,000th guest checked out of the hotel.
Then why would Conan stay here?
Because the client wanted him to.
Hey! What are you doing?
What's going on here?
Thank you for coming. I'm your employer.
I apologize for having to cover my face.
I called you here today to help you solve a certain case.
What kind of case?
That's part of your job.
What?
I will give you several clues.
Draw your conclusions
and please solve the case.
A... but why are you coming to me with this?
You're the fifth detective I've hired.
What about the previous four?
I still have one,
I took two off the case.
and one couldn't solve the case
and is still here.
Ryû!
You know him?
I've worked with him before.
You have my report!
How long are you going to hold me? Let me out!
Detective Ryû.
You couldn't solve the case.
What?
An incompetent detective has no right to live.
W... what's happening?
- The same device we're wearing. - Yes.
Damn! What about this thing?
Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.
It'll go really fast.
Is that...?
Is that how Mogi and Sôda disappeared?

Goodbye, Detective Ryû.
Hey, wait. Wait! Damn it!
Composition 4.
with plastic explosives.
The Miracle Land ID bracelet that Detective Ryû was wearing.
Hey, are Mogi and Sôda that Ryû mentioned like that...?
Yes.
Those two were generally praised as great detectives.
But they were just fools who wasted my precious time.
I'll give you until 10:00 tonight.
Find out the truth about the case by then.
If you don't do it in time,
your ID will explode, too.
and you will share Detective Ryû's fate.
What?!
You'd better not.
The ID won't be solved by that little bit of tugging.
And if it's removed without me shutting it down,
it will explode immediately.
You...!
Ran...
Yes! The children!
What about the children's IDs?
The children's IDs are also
are almost as prepared as yours.
What are you saying?!
Almost?
An additional function has been integrated into the children's IDs.
This is a sketch of the Miracle Land.
Several sensors have been installed to frame Miracle Land.
When they pass the entrance to Miracle Land,
the sensors react and arm the bomb.
Upon exiting Miracle Land
the bomb interacts with the sensors and
explodes.
It would be too tedious to track the children.
Therefore, I chose this method.
Ran.
Haibara! Can you hear me? Haibara!
Damn it! Haibara!
Haibara!
What?
Haibara! Don't go in!
- What's the matter? - Don't ask, stop them!
Don't go in!
That's easy for you to say.
We're already in.
- Oh, you're a VIP. - Huh?
This ID is issued only to very special guests.
That's right.
Enjoy your stay.
Thank you very much.
Did something happen?
I'll get back to you.
What about Ran?
Damn.
If you solve the case by 10:00 p.m...
and find the real culprit..,
you'll get as much money as you want.
But
But if you don't, I'll make the IDs explode.
Go! Take us to this guy! Right now!
I can't do that.
I don't know where he is.
Excuse me?
Môri-san,
Their movements are completely monitored.
That's because the IDs are equipped with GPS.
It's also useless to run to the police.
Then set off the bomb,
you son of a bitch?
Talking long will only waste your time.
The first clue.
I'm only going to say this once, so listen carefully.
T, A, K, A. 3 minus 8.
What are you doing? Say it again!
I told you, only once.
You have 12 hours left.
Then solve the puzzle.
For me...
and for the children.
Damn it!
Môri-san, here you go.
This is the hotline to the client.
However,
you can't contact him by yourself.
You will only receive his instructions.
When you have solved the case,
please call me at the number in your cell phone
and come back here.
We will then listen to your resolution.
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE DETECTIVE'S REQUIEM
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
HIS NAME IS SHIN'ICHI KUDÔ
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on what was happening
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He administered a poison to me
and when I came to...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked my name,
I said Conan Edogawa.
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
Knowing my true identity
Professor Agasa,
my parents, the West Japan high school detective Heiji Hattori and
my classmate Ai Haibara.
Professor Agasa made up various things for me as Conan
various things for me as Conan.
Haibara originally belonged to the men in black.
In order to escape from them,
she took the medicine that was given to me,
and shrank as a result.
And there is someone else! Kaitô Kid!
When he gets involved somewhere, it always becomes difficult.
I am small, my mind is not!
No case remains unsolved!
There is always only one truth!
Damn it! What's with this traffic jam?!

My daughter's life is in danger!
- Move! - No one leaves Miracle Land!
If you leave the area, the ID will explode!
Even the Super Snake is off limits!
This roller coaster makes a swerve out to sea!
Are you even listening, Haibara?
Yeah, got it.
If you don't solve the case by 10:00 PM,
you and I are going to be little dust particles.
Sounds interesting.
Interesting? What are you talking about?
Hey, Haibara!
What are you doing? Come on, hurry up!
Then I'll leave our lives in your hands.
Mr. Master Detective.
It's a mystery to me.
What does TAKA 3 minus 8 mean?
It could be read as a house number.
- Is TAKA the name of the district then? - Yes.
And 3 minus 8 equals minus 5.
Without the "equal", it's 3-8-5.
I got it! Takashima!
Takashima, third section it is.
Hey, where does Section 3 go?
- There isn't. - What?
There's no Section 3 in Takashima.
What? Give it to me!
Damn it. Now we have to start all over again.
Not necessarily.
Didn't the recent redevelopment
with the recent redevelopment?
Yes!
- Takashima 3-8-5? - Yes.
Did the addresses in this area change due to the redevelopment?
Yes, due to the new port.
Section number 3 existed.
Is this a map?
Yes.
11:25 AM.
I wonder if this place is really related to our case.
We'll just have to assume it does.
And why
is he giving me a grade-schooler like you to work with?
I guess you alone weren't enough for him.
Oops.
That's strange.
Why did he let me go with the old man?
What's the reason?
Ah! What was that?
W... who is it?
You can't live here.
We're demolishing it next week.
What?
With a kid... It's hard for you.
Hey? No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Uncle, have you lived here long?
Yes, since the hotel went bankrupt two years ago.
Anything strange happen lately?
Anything at all.
Let's see.
Ah, that reminds me,
once a big white bird flew by.
A big bird?
It flew right in front of the sun.
When was that?
On my birthday, April 4.
There was a strange car parked outside since morning.
The real estate agent came and locked the basement.
A strange car?
Cars hardly ever come in here.
When I left in the morning,
there was a brand-new car parked in the backyard.
But in the evening when I came home, there was an old used car.
During the night
but all the parts were stolen and only the frame remained.
Why was the basement locked?
The basement is where the machines are.
They must still want to make money out of them.
What time was that?
In the evening.
W... what was that?
Hey, kid! What happened?
Whew. So this is where you are.
Don't scare me like that.
Ouch!
What's that?
Huh? What is it?
Look what I've got.
What might be in there?
That's...!
Hood, gloves. Even a gun.
A receipt.
RECEIPT TOLLGATE MINATO-MIRAI
April 4th, the new Yokohama Street.
Uncle, I heard there was a strange car outside on April 4.
Yes. The car was replaced.
Exchanged?
I got it! This is where he changed his getaway car.
The criminal who did something with a hood and a gun.
We have to find out what happened on April 4.
Once we know that, the rest is easy.
What are they?
- P... Pistols! - They're not ordinary citizens.
I wonder if they came to get the bag.
Could be good.
Okay, all right!
You jump out
and distract these guys. Meanwhile, I'll get in the car,
rescue you, and we'll get out of here.
Don't worry.
Those guys won't shoot kids.
What's the matter?
Don't you believe me?
No.
Anyway, go!
Don't move!
Stop!
Jump in!
Typical again.
Shit. Now, when it counts.
This piece of junk!
You're under arrest!
Arrested? Are you guys...?
Cops?
There's that big bird again!
What?
It's him.
With white wings, it flies through the darkness.
Kaitô Kid!
Kid?!
Inspector, the Kid has been sighted!
He's standing on the demon statue of the Miyama Building.
Right, got it.
President Miyama, the Kid has appeared.
Roger. Let's go there.
Well, our current alarm system will even let someone like the Kid...

can't outsmart.
Kid!
Damn it! Yokomizo here!
Kid's escaping from the building towards Landmark Tower!
I repeat! The Kid's escaping to Landmark Tower!
Make preparations!
It seems the police guard was useless.
Well, alarm systems abound.
Commissioner!
We may have the Kid's accomplice.
We're taking him away now.
Understood. I'll be right there.
I told you, I'm not Kid's accomplice!
I'm Kogoro Môri!
Not good at all. If we don't do something...
Your movements will be fully monitored.
The IDs are equipped with GPS.
No use running to the police.
ID number 1, ID number 2
are approaching Kanagawa-ken police headquarters.
The shrieking gets you all excited.
But you know, I don't feel like waiting in line anymore.
I wonder how much longer it will take.
Let's see...
3 PEOPLE 1 METER
When there are three people in one meter,
and we have 150 meters to go, that's 450 people.
450 PEOPLE 150 METERS
ONCE 22 PEOPLE
The Super Snake can fit
22 people at a time.
450:22 ≈ 20
With 450 people, that works out to about twenty times.
The time for one round
is about 10 minutes with stopping time, so 200 minutes.
That works out to about 3 ½ hours.
Amazing, Mitsuhiko-kun!
Do we have to wait that long? I'm hungry.
The professor would give us a quiz to pass the time.
That's right.
Do you want me to give you a quiz today?
You, Ran-san?
No?
Sure you do!
All right. Let's answer it.
Okay, let's go.
Ta-da! The Miracle Land quiz!
Everyone wants to ride the Super Snake once.
Now, which of the Detective Boys...
does this attraction best suit?
I know! The answer is Ai-chan!
Huh? Why?
She looks like she likes snakes.
I don't like snakes.
Boo.
Then it's me.
I always have to wait like Super Snake, too.
What do you mean?
In the morning on the way to school,
when I come to pick you up, I always have to wait for you.
Also wrong. What do you think, Genta-kun?
Maybe it's me?
Snakes look like eels.
And eel on rice is my favorite dish.
Almost.
What about Genta-kun who loves eel?
What about him?
He seems hungry.
I see. Super Snake means "super snake."
SUPER SNAKE
SUPER HEBI (JAP.)
VERY HEAVY (HEAVY)
Or also "super heavy".
Therefore, the answer is Kojima-kun, who weighs a lot.
Ping Pong!
And I thought Ran-san was different.
It was just a stupid word joke.
KANAGAWA-KEN POLICE HEADQUARTERS
12:17 P.M.
Oh, Conan-kun. Are you all right?
Superintendent Megure!
What's gotten into Môri-kun?
You arrested Kid's accomplices?
Oh, Nakamori-kun.
That sly Megure. What are you doing here?
Môri-kun was arrested by mistake.
Huh?
So the Kid's accomplice...
...was the sleeping Kogoro?
A detective has a duty to keep the client a secret.
If it's Kid, that makes you his accomplice!
But why were the Kanagawa police shadowing the building?
An announcement letter arrived from the Kid.
The building is the headquarters of the Miyama Company.
On the top floor, President Miyama has
...President Miyama has displayed the jewels he collected as a hobby..,
but unlike last time, nothing was stolen.
He's had burglaries before?
Yes.
On April 4, a huge diamond was stolen.
As a result, the alarm systems were greatly improved
and Mr. Miyama is very pleased with the results.
On April 4?
But Yokomizo-kun belongs to the first division.
The second is in charge of Kid.
Lately, strange guys have been trying to take Kid's life.
There have also been casualties. That's why the first division is helping the second.
So, after Kid's life.
Someone's calling me. Hold on a second.
Detective Môri...
No, you must be Kudô-kun.
It's you, actually.
The high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
I was surprised that you came along.
The truth is, I wanted to hire you, too.
But
I didn't know how to contact you.
Did you go to the police to ask for help?
No, that's not the reason.
Môri was arrested by police officers who raided the abandoned hotel....
You're honest.
He must have known there were policemen there.
Well then... So, did you find anything in the hotel?
A gun and a hood, probably accessories to a crime.
Not bad, Kudô-kun. Here comes the second clue.

Go to the café terrace in the evening.
Café terrace in the evening?
I'm sure you know where it is.
I'll solve the case for sure!
Free the others from their ID!
Hey! Are you listening?
Damn.
To lose a loved one...
losing them, how painful that is...
To avoid that, do your best,
Kudô-kun.
How come?
How come that guy knows who I am?
Who is he?
Who is this guy?
The line isn't moving and I'm getting hungrier.
So am I.
Yeah, we didn't have lunch.
Then I'll stay here in line
and you can go eat in the meantime.
Really, Haibara?
We can't leave Ai-chan alone.
True again.
Then I'll stay with Haibara-san.
I'll stay too.
Then me too.
Fools. It's no use like this.
Then we'll do it like this. We take turns every 30 minutes.
Ai-chan starts first. Well?
Agreed!
Then in 30 minutes.
- Yes! Let's go! - I'm sorry.
Please. You can go ahead.
How long do you think this will last?
YOKOHAMA PORT ÔSANBASHI PIER
If you take it apart, you might find something out.
But it could also explode in the process.
There's nothing we can do here.
I see.
1:28 PM
Oh yeah, here.
It has even more power now.
Thank you.
Did you find out
where the café terrace is in the evening?
Yes.
And where is it?
The "Café Terrace in the Evening"
is a picture painted by Vincent van Gogh in 1888.
A café terrace is lit by gas lanterns
and a carriage is coming from behind.
At gas lanterns and carriage one comes
the carriage way, where in Japan first gas lanterns
were gas lanterns in Japan.
Way too much power, professor.
Haibara-san!
- Here. - Thank you.
Thanks for waiting!
Is that as far as we go? I guess I miscalculated.
We'll get you out of here.
We'll get you out of here.
You really have a penchant
for such childish pleasures.
Sonoko! What are you doing here?
There, the Red Castle Hotel,
they're expecting their 100,000th guest today...
so they're throwing a party in the evening.
The hotel was kind of built by my dad.
I'll pass the time here in the park until tonight.
What? Where did you find that?
Oh, no.
We got these from Pops' employer.
The guy must be a VIP.
I lost my ID and thought this was it.
Yeah, right!
I'll invite you and the kids to the party.
We could go to the Red Castle Hotel right now.
If the kids have ID, they don't need us.
She especially here is very reasonable.
But...
They're having a cake buffet in the restaurant there right now.
And with that ID, you can go in and out of Miracle Land.
What do they have here?
MINATO-MIRAIBA
Don't move!
Hattori?!
Well, did you get a fright?
Shut up.
How fortunate that we meet.
I need your advice, Kudo!
What do you mean, Kudo? You too?
You too?
Yes, he took Kazuha hostage.
Well, she herself doesn't know about it and is probably having a good time there.
The number you have dialed is not in service at this time.
The subscriber is either out of...
Oh, man. What are you doing?
And he said have fun, I'll be right there.
I feel like Ran-chan who's just waiting for Kudô-kun.
- Well, Kazuha-chan? - Huh?
Ran-chan, you?
Kazuha-chan, long time no see! I didn't know you were here.
Where's Hattori-kun?
Working. Ar-bei-ten!
I see. That's too bad.
Oops, Kazuha-chan!
Sonoko-chan!
That's right! We were just going to the cake buffet. Are you coming?
Oh yeah, I love cake!
- Then let's go. - Let's go.
- Come on, Ran, let's go! - Ah! Wait!
CUTSIDEWAY
That's how it is.
The girl was taken hostage too.
Yes. Not only Ran, but the four children as well.
2:25 PM
Also, the principal seems to
seems to think that I am Shin'ichi Kudô.
Do you think he knows your identity?
Well. I don't know exactly.
Hey!
Do you think they found out that the poison
has shrunk you?
Those men in black.
BEIKA SECURITY
BEIKA-SECURITY
Hey!
What's up?
Head hood, a gun, and a getaway car.
Ah! An armored car robbery!
Yes!
That must be what he was talking about.
Probably.
TRUE
Question.
What is it, kid?
This armored car has been robbed before, hasn't it?
Yeah, that's right.

That would have to have been on April 4.
If you have your booth here,
the police must have questioned you.
Would you also tell us more details?
J... Yes,
I think it was around the same time.
Don't move from the spot!
It was like a brief moment.
I didn't know if I was dreaming or awake.
They must have been very routine.
Thank you, Auntie.
Wait a minute!
You two,
today is the worst day of your lives.
You better go home and get some sleep.
Yes, we will.
After we make this day the best.
So long.
Don't walk around like that! I was looking for you!
- That hurts! - Calm down. No time to argue.
Huh?
What's that dark boy from Osaka doing here?
Same reason as you.
Huh?
Môri-kun.
Give me back the client's cell phone.
Would you mind telling us the truth slowly?
The truth is a tricky thing...
Even for detectives, there are limits!
It would be better if you left it to us.
Môri speaking.
- Detective Môri this time. - Eh?
Never mind. You're at the carriage road now?
That's right.
You're not going to call the police, are you?
Are you watching us?
Them?
Are you going to break your promise?
Of course not!
That was an act of God!
Môri-kun, who are you talking to on the phone?
Idiots! Idiots! Incompetent police! Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Idiots! Idiots! Incompetent...
Damn it. What are you doing?
Idiots! Idiots! Incompetent police...
I have a bad feeling.
Watch out! Get away from that doll!
- It's going to explode! - What?
Explode in ten seconds.
Nine. Eight.
Seven. Six.
Five.
Four.
- Damn it! - Three. Two.
One.
Mom!
- Yokomizo-kun! - Get an ambulance! Quick!
You!
The other kids will be next,
Môri-san.
Huh? What is it?
Since earlier, this ID started blinking.
Mine too.
- Sonoko, do you know something? - No, I don't.
It's the first time I've seen it, too.
We can ask at the exit.
Really.
Can't even dodge an explosion like that.
Today's police are good for nothing.
What do you mean?
You're the reason this happened.
Stop it! There's no proof of that!
Honestly, you're just a nuisance!
Stop following me!
What?
You were right to quit being a cop.
After all, I want to live a long time.
- Come on, you two! - Yes...
Inspector. You're letting him go?
It's all right.
RAN AND THE KIDS WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE IN MIRACLE LAND...
Ran and the kids were taken hostage in Miracle Land.
If they leave it, their ID will explode.
Please secretly protect the children. Môri.
I entrusted the children to the commissioner.
Now, whether the outcome is good or bad..,
depends on our minds.
So? Did you find out anything?
It seems that on April 4th, an armored car was robbed...
was robbed.
On that day
Kaito Kid stole a diamond from the Miyama Gallery...
...from the Miyama Gallery, according to a police officer.
That's how it is.
Well, I'll look into it further.
Kids, don't get carried away!
What are you thinking?
The clue with the carriage road ends here, I guess.
What are we going to do with this little bit of evil?
There's still one unsolved mystery.
What?
My clue went like this:
The café terrace in the evening and "You cry".
You'll cry.
Your clue was different from ours?
Exactly.
You cry...
Spelled out, it's Y, o, u, c, r, y.
Y, O, U is...
Yes.
This is the Yokohama Oceanic University,
Yokohama Oceanic University.
That leaves C, R, Y.
This is as far as I can go.
Then we have to go there.
To the Y O U.
You're right.
Ran, quick!
Excuse me.
Yes, please?
- This ID is flashing red. Why? - We ask for your
- attention. - Well, what do you think?
- I'm seeing this for the first time. - I see.
...and her companion Ms. Kazuha Tôyama.
Please proceed to the emergency room.
- What do you think? - Maybe something with the children?
Hurry up!
Sorry, Sonoko.
You'll have to go alone.
It's all right. You're worried. So hurry up and run.
Sorry.
I guess I'll have to go eat.
What happened?
She fainted in the park.
Probably a mild case of heatstroke.
That's how it is.
I'm sorry.
Don't be. Don't worry about it.
But why would Kazuha-chan come?

I am talking to the girl for the first time.
This... well...
It's obvious!
Because it's safer to call two people.
Yeah, right!
Rest for a while. Will you stay with her?
Yes, of course!
Stay with me, please.
I thought she was cheeky, but she can be sweet.
Quite exhausting, this theater.
UNIVERSITY OF OCEANOGRAPHY YOKOHAMA 4:47 PM
Cry, cry, cry...
A lecture or a shortcut?
- Or a club. - Possibly.
Otherwise, it could be...
Crime Research of Yokohama.
Crime Research of Yokohama.
I'm sure this club is just the solution you're looking for.
Who are you?
My name is Saguru Hakuba.
I'm in the same position as you.
In more ways than one.
The same position?
He's the police chief's son and a high school detective.
Yes, even though I can't compete with someone like you.
I see.
Just as my father is the chief of the Ôsaka police headquarters.
That's not all.
You were also...?
Someone important to me is in Miracle Land.
We'll discuss everything else as we go.
A waste of time would be Cry,
...a reason to cry.
Also true.
Hello? Is anyone there?
Hello?
We're coming in.
Quite a collection of material.
Take a look at these pictures.
They appear to be photos of the members.
We'd better photograph them.
You're right.
The client?
Yes. What is it?
It's more than I expected, Heiji Hattori.
I can't believe You Cry made it this far.
You guys amaze me.
You know, if you want us to solve this case..,
you should make the clues easier.
If the case is solved just like that, it's no fun for me.
Besides, I want to test you.
To see if you're good enough detectives
to qualify for my case.
Huh?
There are no more tips now.
I expect a lot from you, young detectives.
Hey! Wait a minute!
Shit. He hung up.
No more tips.
So what do we do now?
YOKOHAMA OCEAN UNIVERSITY
TARGET IS LOCATED IN OCEAN UNIVERSITY. EDIT THIS.
TARGET IS LOCATED IN OCEAN UNIVERSITY. REVEAL THIS.
Who are you?
Do you want something from us?
Oh, well, we were just...
We're gonna apply here next year.
and we're looking around.
Oh, well...
When you're at the university, come to our club.
Yes, of course.
You, you, tell me,
what do those photos mean?
Oh, I see. These are from the left
the successive club leaders.
Then why did you remove the third generation leader?
Take a look for yourself. Next to the last picture
there are two hooks
and from the third photo on, next to the following
a gap can be seen, which did not get any sunlight.
So someone must have taken down the photo of the third club leader
and moved the rest up.
Didn't they?
He was banned.
The third club leader, Itô-san.
Ah, wasn't his name Jirô Itô-san?
No, his name was Suehiko Itô-san. Do you know him?
Yes, somewhat.
It's him here, isn't it?
No, it's him.
Oh, so it is.
What an actor.
Sorry,
It looks like it's another Itô-san after all.
ÔSAKA PREFECTURAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS
ÔSAKA PREFECIAL POLICE - Suehiko Itô?
Hei-chan, who is that supposed to be, this Itô?
Because I don't know, I'm asking you to investigate.
Does your father know?
- No, don't tell me. - He doesn't? Hei-chan!
I'm waiting for news.
Hey! Hei-cha...
Let's take a break first.
Well, do you want to go eat at the cafeteria?
I can't think with low blood sugar.
Idiot! Like we have time for that.
I'm expecting a call.
A warrior doesn't show his hunger.
But it's hard to fight on an empty stomach.
Besides, I've long had the answers to your questions.
The Yokohama Police Headquarters...
...is closer than Ôsaka.
That guy really pisses me off.
Yes... Yeah, right.
If you're ever here, I'll buy you a drink.
Yes.
Okay, I'm counting on you, Ao-chan. Hurry up!
What's wrong, Otaki?
Oh, inspector!
Was that your cousin
your cousin Aoki, who works for the Kanagawa police?
Yes, I've been wanting to know how he's doing for a long time.
Go ahead and admit it.
It's about a request from Heizô's son.
I also received a call.

What? You got one, too?
Got you, Ôtaki.
Is something wrong with my son?
Chief Inspector!
You can tell me everything quietly in my office.
Yes...
It would be better for you if you sang well.
Well...
This situation is not easy.
Then I'll leave it to you.
Commissioner Megure!
I'll go say hello.
I'll come with you.
He often took care of Heiji.
Well, I'll go test the Super Snake.
You can do this by yourselves.
Wait!
Don't get up!
You have to stop him!
- Yes. - Got it!
Superintendent Megure!
Oh, Ran-kun, Kazuha-kun.
What are you two doing in the park?
Did something happen?
No, no.
We're off today. Shiratori-kun and I.
And then the two of you are going to Miracle Land?
Nah, right? Oops? Ran-chan!
The kids!
Superintendent.
What? That can't be!
SUPER SNAKE OUT OF SERVICE FOR INSPECTION
That's the punishment for going it alone.
Come on, let's go back.
We apologize very much.
Please understand the security check.
I'm now handing out number cards.
A thief!
A thief! It's a thief!
- Ayumi-chan? - Ran-kun!
Superintendent Megure? What's he doing here?
Hey, Takagi-kun, what are you doing?
Ah, well... Well...
Ah! You must have been looking at a cute girl.
Oh... What... what nonsense! I... I would never do that.
What do you mean? What's that supposed to mean?
Yes, sorry.
I... I'll pretend I didn't see the inspector.
Oh, but the curry looks good.
Enjoy your meal.
Hmm, the curry is really tasty!
Yuck! The curry consists
almost nothing but flour!
So, who is this Suehiko Itô?
Itô is wanted by the police..,
for robbing an armored car on April 4...
on April 4th.
I see. That's why they took his picture down in the club room.
That's not the only interesting thing.
After graduation, he ran an investment
an investment consulting firm.
In that office,
the Far East Office, there was also a murder.
What?
So, isn't that interesting?
Okay!
Then let's go there right now.
To this company called Far East Office.
He ate it all?!
- I'm back! - Welcome back, Sensei.
Excuse me, Kuriyama-san,
- do you have something cold to drink for me? - Yes.
Yes, Kisaki here.
Hey, you? What's wrong?
Aren't you at Miracle Land with Ran and the kids?
What's that? A case file?
What are you doing there?
Well, a lot's happened.
and I'm in trouble.
Got it.
It's about the armored car robbery on April 4.
I'll check it out and get back to you.
Yeah, that helps me.
Kogoro?
Tell me, Eri,
do you think I can solve this case?
Investigate with your legs.
Wasn't it? Mr. Ex-Cop?
Yes, you're right. Check the footage, please.
Yes, got it.
Come here.
Yes, please?
Excuse me.
Oops, didn't you just get a call?
Yeah, I did.
From a really nasty guy.
Right, Goro-chan?
That must have been her husband.
6:30 PM
NO OUTSIDERS ALLOWED
When something is forbidden...
...you want it even more.
The essence of a detective.
Murdered was Masaharu Nishio,
head of the Far East Office.
Shot with a rifle.
In his university days, he was a fellow student of company boss Itô.
This means...
...that Nishio was also in the same club, right?
That's right.
Come here.
Come here? Hey, that's my phone!
- When did you...? - Watch this.
The front row of the photo.
In the middle is Suehiko Itô, the club president at the time.
To his right is the murdered Nishio.
Tell me, who is the woman on his other side?
Ah, that's Reiko Shimizu.
She also worked in this office.
But on May 15, she committed suicide.
Suicide?
Yes, when she voluntarily gave herself up to the police for questioning.
About the Nishio case?
She must have been interrogated pretty harshly.
This is the scene of the shooting.
It's pretty dusty here.
But everything looks the same.
Well, the blinds and windows were open.
The blinds and windows must have been open.
Nishio was shot from a restroom over there.
The weapon used was a Charter Arms AR-7
with long-range sights and a silencer.
They found eight cartridge cases
eight shell casings.

The perpetrator fired the full capacity of eight bullets,
and one of the bullets hit Nishio in the back of the head.
He was probably killed instantly.
Later, Nishio's desk was found to contain
a plan by Itô to rob an armored car.
Now the surviving Itô is wanted by the police.
And why was Reiko Shimizu questioned so intensively?
I don't know that either.
Look, Hattori.
Not much blood for a bullet in the head.
Yes, that's right. But there's a huge bloodstain...
there's a huge bloodstain.
What does that mean?
The bloodstains run vertically down to the seat.
And look at this.
A roll from the chair was shot through.
That's it. All right.
That's how it happened.
Hattori here.
You seem to be one step ahead, Hattori-kun.
Yeah, you could say that.
Do you know which case to solve?
You mean the crime against Masaharu Nishio?
Yes.
Hey, are you...
Damn it.
- What was that? - Motorcycles?
Anyway, that doesn't sound good.
What are they?
Maybe they're to make the game more interesting.
- For the client. - That's overdoing it!
It won't work like this! Split up!
- Got it! - Got it!
Okay.
Man to man!
Attack from wherever you want!
What's wrong with you?
Oh, your sore spot?
Shit.
That's cowardly! Fight without weapons!
Do you think Kudô managed to escape?
Oh no, that's paint. Now my shirt's ruined.
Stop!
MIRACLE LAND 7:32 PM
The man was wearing a baseball cap and windbreaker.
Maybe not anymore.
Also true again.
What's going on?
Isn't this guy suspicious?
You mean the man in the yellow T-shirt.
Yeah, his hair is flattened on top.
He must have had a cap on.
Probably dumped it with his jacket and bag.
Just like you would expect from the girlfriend
Shin'ichi Kudô's girlfriend.
I am not his girlfriend.
The perpetrator's shoes are full of Coke, aren't they?
Yes, on purpose, to leave a proof.
Ah! My purse!
Oops.
Wow, Genta-kun!
That's not what happened, Ayumi-chan.
It's not polite to lie, Genta-kun.
A thief!
I saw it clearly!
Oh, yeah, was that it?
There he is!
A woman...
There!
Hey, Ayumi!
You mean him, Ayumi?
Yes, there were cola stains on his left shoe.
The way he keeps looking around, it's very suspicious.
- There's no doubt about it. - There's no doubt about it.
Let's follow him.
Not good. Where did those kids run off to?
- A thief! - Wait!
You can't get away!
Out of the way! Make way!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
You're in the way! Move aside!
I'm borrowing this!
THANK YOU FOR YOUR VISIT.
Freeze!
- Damn. - Give it up!
Security will be here soon.
Don't interfere with other people's business!
Shit.
Oh no!
- Ayumi-chan! - Ayumi!
Don't move!
If anyone moves, I won't guarantee anything!
WARNING
Number 5 is approaching the main gate.
Who is it?
Number 5: Ayumi Yoshida.
Like this.
Don't come any closer! Or this brat will die!
Hey you! Release the child!
Take me hostage instead!
Shut up, grandpa!
Then me!
I'll be his hostage. What happened was my fault.
No way!
It's out of the question that you civilians...
Stop talking!
I'm not exchanging the hostage.
Is that clear? Nobody moves until I get through the barrier.
The girl's life depends on it!
No!
If she gets past the gate...
Hey, you!
This is the entrance. The exit is next door!
I don't care! Get out of there!
Yelling doesn't help!
There are rules!
Really. At your age.
To break a rule like that.
Arrest him!
Get out of the way!
There are lots of hostages here!
Don't come any closer! Or I'll...
What are you going to do?
- W... what am I going to do? - What you're going to do.
Will you tell me?
Forgive me. Please let me through.
Excuse me. I got us some soft ice cream...
Sato-san...?
K... Commissioner Megure?!
What are you doing in a place like this?
We could ask you the same thing.
Ah, well...
Kudô-kun...
Kudô... Kudô...
Hey, Kudô! Kudô!
Ah, you've finally woken up.
Where are we?
In Professor Agasa's car.
Professor? Ow!
Don't overdo it.
I splinted the leg,

but the bone may have cracked.
Hattori. Did you save me?
No, that was Hakuba.
He went for the professor, and when he came..,
Hakuba was holding you in his arms full of wounds.
Then the Professor told me and I joined him.
Hakuba...
Yes, he said he had some research to do.
and went somewhere before I did.
What time is it? How much time has passed?
Two hours. It's now 8:30.
Another 1 ½ hours.
We're on our way to Red Castle now.
Do you know who killed Nishio-san?
No. We're going like this.
It's no use just sitting around anyway. Oh, yeah,
Ôtaki-han called while you were sleeping.
A lot of things have become clear.
There's an encore to Nishio's murder.
On the night of Nishio's murder
a car overturned at the container pier.
Total loss.
The driver was Suehiko Itô.
It was a miracle that he was still alive.
He had to stay in intensive care for a month.
When the car was examined, it was found that the oil pressure line had been tampered with,
that the oil pressure line had been tampered with. In addition
a rifle with a silencer was found in the trunk.
There were no fingerprints,
but it was undoubtedly the gun that killed Nishio-san.
So, was Itô arrested?
No. Two months after the accident.
the police finally got permission to visit him, but...
We're coming in.
Itô was no longer there.
He hasn't been found since.
untraceable, so the police
are looking for him by name.
In addition, they suspect him of participating in the robbery.
So this Itô is the perpetrator?
There is no doubt that Itô shot Nishio.
His footprints were found where the shots came from...
and his clothes showed traces of gunpowder.
Also, the number of bullets found at the scene
matches the number that fit into the magazine.
And other characteristics also match the gun....
IDENTIFICATION SERVICE
Mascara?
On the rifle's scope we found,
even if only slight, traces of mascara.
Does that mean they came from the person who looked through the
through the telescope?
That's right.
The mascara is rare.
When the women in Itô's and Nishio's circle were questioned
and Nishio's circle, they found one woman who used this brand.
It was Reiko Shimizu.
CRY 3. SUMMER STUDY GROUP
Ah, the one who later killed herself.
She was considered the Madonna of the crime research group...
and is said to have gotten along especially well with Nishio
and Itô.
After graduation, she joined Itô's company together with Nishio
and worked there as an executive secretary.
Nishio and Itô robbed the armored car, didn't they?
Itô might have had a motive to kill Nishio,
but what about Reiko Shimizu?
According to her colleagues
Nishio made a pass at her. But she didn't want to.
The police questioned her about the mascara...
...and her lack of an alibi...
for the time of the crime.
But she didn't say a word until the end.
Then, on May 15...
Hey!
She jumped off!
Reiko Shimizu's body was not found.
But because of the strong current, the police decided..,
she didn't stand a chance.
20 days later, Itô disappeared from the hospital.
The police had no more suspects, and the case was left
and the case was put aside unsolved.
Without her boss, Itô's company went bankrupt, of course, and was
bought up by the Miyama trading company.
The Miyama gallery is also involved?
Where did the Kid get the jewel?
Right.
The president, Sôichirô Miyama, was a colleague of Itô's four years older
and also in the same club.
Itô seemed to have admired him very much.
Ah,
about Kid, I remember Ôtaki-han found out something interesting.
The Kid who broke into the Miyama Gallery on April 4..,
...crossed the escape route of those..,
...of those who robbed the armored truck..,
and a shootout ensued.
A shootout?
Well, since the Kid didn't use a firearm,
only the robbers had shot the Kid.
The reason was probably...
The Kid had seen their faces. Didn't he?
Yes. Shell casings were found at the scene...
from a pistol and the Charter Arms.
And ever since then, someone's been trying to wipe out Kid's life..,
every time he goes on a thieving spree.
Interesting, isn't it?
Yes.
But that's not enough to determine Nishio-san's killer.
Yes, that's right.

We are still missing one crucial point.
That reminds me,
Môri-kun said on the phone earlier..,
...that he had found an important witness.
On the day Nishio-san was shot..,
...one of the cleaning staff heard a metallic sound coming from the restroom...
from the restroom in question, and then saw Itô-san
and then saw Itô-san hurriedly leave the restroom carrying a golf bag.
The noises must have come
from the sleeves falling down.
And in the golf bag
he had the Charter Arms AR-7.
So the case is clear.
Where is the old man now?
Since the case is solved, he has already
he's already gone to the client's office to report back.
He's not going to...
If he tells the wrong story...
Huh? Is that so?
Professor, step on it!
V... Got it.
I knew you'd come, Kaitô Kid.
You were preparing the roof during the day
and you finally came in.
But you won't get my jewels.
I don't steal jewels without notice.
What?
I just wanted to say goodbye to you,
because I don't feel like being a target anymore.
All Kaitô Kid.
You've got me pegged.
Yes. A little.
What I didn't understand, however,
...was why my life was still being threatened..,
even though I had returned the diamond.
I realized that today.
You are attached to your clubmates at the time.
It's your own fault that you
Becoming an eyewitness to my juniors' game.
Shooting a guard, you still call that play?
Accidents are part of a game.
You were one, too.
If one of my juniors needs advice,
I should help him, shouldn't I?
W... what kind of magic is this?
You don't really think I'm going to show up here...
unprepared?
Go! Shoot him down!
W... what's that?
Don't worry.
It's just a sleeping pill.
Didn't you notice anything?
After April 4.
I came here several times.
W... what?
And today at noon I
I made a conspicuous effort on the roof,
so you'd know I was coming tonight.
To lure you and your hired assassins...
to lure you and your hired assassins here.
Impossible!
Save your excuses for the police.
Just like that cute junior of yours sleeping behind the curtain.
Ah! She seems pretty cool.
Well, the two of them will certainly
have a lot to talk about.
Including about this gallery full of stolen goods.
It's the Kid! Kid showed up!
Your game is over!
With the worst possible outcome of an own goal.
Open up! It's the police!
Open up!
9:07 PM
Be patient, Ran!
Thank you for your efforts, Detective Môri.
Your client is expecting you.
Here you go.
Detective Môri has returned.
I know you're tired, but time is short.
Please report.
The case you are investigating concerns
of the April 4th robbery of an armored car...
on April 4th in Carriage Lane.
and the truth about the murder
Masaharu Nishio's murder.
I'm going to see the kids at Miracle Land.
- Good. - Take care of Kazuha, too.
All right.
Suehiko Ito and Masaharu Nishio robbed the armored car...
and Masaharu Nishio robbed it together.
But Nishio
shot the one guard who resisted.
Four days later
Nishio was shot again by someone.
The police suspect Reiko Shimizu
from the same company who had been strongly harassed by Nishio.
But I do not believe that.
The motive of the perpetrator
was revenge against Nishio, who had tarnished his beautiful plan.
Yes.
The killer who shot Masaharu Nishio....
Wait a minute!
Oh, you two!
Excuse me, but Detective Môri is reporting...
Shit.
Hey, what's going on?
Are you alright?
Detective Môri, quickly continue please.
So..,
what I wanted to say, Nishio-san's killer...
Ow...
Sorry, dude.
- Oh no, the screen! - Damn it!
Darn it, which button is it?
W... what's that?
Maybe that's where the client sits?
What?
When I called Takada earlier, I heard something...
I heard something in the background.
The sound was also heard in the background of the principal.
I see.
We don't have time. Go!
Quite dark.
We have to go through. Come on.
9:28 PM
Welcome, Shin'ichi Kudô
and Heiji Hattori.
Thank you. At last we meet.
Director of the Far East Office.
Suehiko Itô-san.

Quite as expected.
It was the right thing to do, putting you two together.
That's what I thought.
Forgive my appearance.
I'm afraid I'm handicapped.
The accident at the pier.
Yes.
When I knew I was going to be disabled, I came here.
An acquaintance invested my capital for me.
Miracle Land is one of them.
You mean Sôichirô Miyama?
Wonderful! You even found that out.
May we report? Time is running out.
- Have you uncovered the truth? - Yes.
I won't live much longer.
That's why I needed a detective to uncover the truth.
Not just a detective with brains,
but a real master detective.
Please tell me.
The truth you have uncovered.
April 8.
Masaharu Nishio is in the Far East Office.
From the toilet in the opposite building shot
Reiko Shimizu.
She blamed you for Nishio's murder...
...and tried to kill you by accident as well.
You're lying!
I shot Nishio!
Are you just like the cops? Totally incompetent?
You did indeed shoot with a rifle.
After Reiko Shimizu fired.
What?
WE ARE CLEANING, PLEASE MOVE TO OTHER FLOORS
You missed your target.
The seven bullets you fired.
Seven shots?
The rifle can be loaded with eight bullets.
I'm sure you don't know how many times you fired..,
the way you rushed out of the bathroom
without picking up the shells.
By that time, Nishio-san was already dead.
That can't be.
I saw it!
How Nishio fell to the floor from my bullet.
Well, one of your bullets just
accidentally hit a castor of the chair.
Then another bullet just happened to hit Nishio.
Are you stupid?
No one would sit still under that kind of fire.
Then the first bullet just happened to...
The bloodstains on the back of the chair Nishio was sitting on..,
run down to the seat and have dried like this.
That's how we know.
There was a sniper
who hit the back of Nishio-san's head...
...and an amateur who, after the blood
who shot wildly after the blood dried.
But that alone is not enough to name the sniper.
But through the testimony of the witness Môri found,
everything was clear.
After several times metallic noises
metallic noises came out of the toilet,
you rushed out of it, carrying a golf bag.
The sounds came from the sleeves as they fell.
The fact that there were several shells means,
means that you are the cross-shooter.
In short, the sniper was Reiko Shimizu.
And you're the one who, in his shooting spree...
and now thinks he shot Nishio.
Nishio.
The golf bag contained the Charter Arms AR-7.
You were given the bag by Reiko before you did it.
Wasn't it?
That's......that's true, but why...
why would Reiko shoot you?
The telescope showed traces of a rare mascara
of a rare mascara used by Reiko Shimizu.
That's impossible!
They got the bag from her, shot all the bullets...
and then went to the pier to dispose of the gun and car.
It was probably also Reiko who had tampered with your car.
Her motive was probably,
she wanted the money from the robbery all to herself.
She was in the van with you, wasn't she?
When you robbed the van.
On the run, you ran into the Kaito Kid..,
who saw your faces.
...so you decided to kill him.
So you took the winding back roads and began..,
to shoot at him.
In the side streets you found
Shell casings from rifle and revolver.
No matter how well you can drive a car,
steering a car through curves with one hand
while shooting at the Kid flying in the sky is impossible.
In short,
there were two others.
One with a pistol, one with a rifle.
Namely, Masaharu Nishio and Reiko Shimizu.
Now,
the evidence to support our conclusions is almost all from the police.
And the witness of the old man Môri
had certainly been interrogated by the police as well.
The police recognized the truth
and therefore turned their attention to Reiko.
Exactly.
From the beginning, this case didn't need
a great policeman or a master detective.
There. The mystery is solved.
Free the others from the ID.

A lie! Reiko would do such a thing...
Lies! Lies! Lie!
You're not lying.
So you are alive after all.
Reiko? Is that you, Reiko?
You were too unreliable
as my partner.
Just like Nishio-kun.
He was just violent.
If I'd been with him too long, I'd have been dead.
Itô-kun, you were always too timid.
And when people talk to you, all you do is brag.
Your company is boring.
Hiring detectives...
Because you took the blame for me,
I kept you alive.
But no more.
As for your fortune, which Miyama-san manages..,
I have arranged to have access to it.
With Miyama-san...?
Miyama-san is finished.
He has been finished off by the Kaitô Kid.
In the end, only I will be left.
Wait!
Kudô! Don't move.
This is a Walther PPK!
It has eight shots.
After the eighth bullet, I'll finish the job.
Six. Seven.
Eight.
Now!
Hattori!
Oh, I'm sorry. I shoot with both hands.
Use this, Kudô!
In the air, one leg is enough.
I see.
Reiko!
What about Reiko?
What's wrong, Reiko?
Reiko!
Please cancel the ID.
Just press "CANCEL"?
Yes. We need an ambulance here urgently.
What?
What's wrong?
Error?
She's done something.
Hey, Kudo, what's going on?
It's not all dead.
All that's left to do is search!
It looks like I'm coming to the end of the line, too, Kudô-kun.
Your voice sounds like a child.
Hattori. Does it still say "error"?
Yes. It's unchanged.
They really do explode when the time is up.
What time?
Exactly ten o'clock.
Damn it! Which one should I press?
I would have loved to ride the Super Snake.
It stayed out of service until the last minute.
My dessert is late, though.
Don't complain.
The commissar invited us.
You have a big heart, commissar.
- Among other things. - That's right.
Excuse me, Commissioner Megure,
did something happen?
What do you mean?
Well, with so many cops...
Huh? I see...
Superintendent Megure.
Oh, Shiratori-kun. Excuse me, Ran-kun.
What does it look like?
The restaurant's patrons and staff...
...have been evacuated. Now it's just the kids and us...
...and the police.
Good.
What's taking you so long, Shin'ichi?
Shit!
When a husband and wife share a secret,
their relationship becomes deeper.
The most intimate secret
is to commit a crime with the woman you love.
That's why
I wanted to show Reiko
I wanted to show her how much I loved her.
But when Nishio shot the guard..,
he ruined my perfect plan.
Perfection doesn't exist.
There's always a cog that doesn't fit.
If you force it, you can destroy everything...
or you can start from scratch..,
and try to make up for lost time. Everyone has that choice.
They were just afraid to,
of hitting "reset."
Yes, that can be good.
I wonder if it will work.
What now?
The ID is only Iösbar if the time is canceled.
Damn!
Are you okay?
Are you still sick?
No, I'm fine.
There. Let me know if you don't feel well.
Yes, I will.
Conan-kun didn't come at all.
He must be out with Detective Môri.
He's always doing everything by himself.
He's really good at jumping the queue.
Have you heard from Môri-kun?
No.
Here we go.
I'm going in at one minute to ten.
I can't leave the kids to their own devices.
You're right.
9:56. You're out of time, Kudô!
I see! He's using a wireless LAN!
J... yes.
If the wireless LAN is damaged,
a direct cable connection might help.
One more thing.
Yes, it's on.
Okay, it's working again!
- Done! - The time
cancel.
Please enter the password.
Hey! The pass...
Hey, Kudô, he...
Don't worry. He's just unconscious.
FORGET PASSWORD?
HERE
Surely the aftermath.
What is the name of the person you love the most?
NAME OF THE PERSON YOU LOVE THE MOST
59.
Yes.
You are staying here.
J... yes...
That was a real scare.
I stayed cool.
So, did you have fun today?
Yeah, it's too bad the Super Snake didn't work.
But that rocket thing was really fun.
I could ride that again right now!
Itô has a crush on Reiko Shimizu.
REIKO SHIMIZU
The password is wrong.
What?!

Reiko Shimizu is not the one?
NEXT TIME AN ERROR OCCURS, THE SYSTEM SHUTS DOWN
The password is wrong.
- The next wrong one... - We're out of time, Kudô!
...the system shuts down.
Who is it? Who does Itô love the most?
Who?
When people talk to you, you're just bragging.
But by Nishio shooting the guard..,
he ruined my perfect plan.
I got it!
SUEHIKO ITÔ
What are you typing, Kudô?
SUEHIKO ITÔ
The timer has been canceled.
Do we have it?
Yes. That takes care of it.
Well done, Shin'ichi.
The time mechanism is off.
But the area barrier is not.
You must collect each one, Professor.
Yes, I'll collect them right away.
Kudo-kun and Hattori-kun..,
...you're really...
...great detectives.
And you're the very worst.
Hey, you guys! Are you guys all right?
So, take off your IDs and put them in here.
What? We have to take them off?
Yeah, the park's closing now.
Too bad.
Handkerchief... Handkerchief...
Oops? I thought I'd lost it.
What's that?
Looks like paint.
Where did it come from?
- All right, I'll draw them all in. - Ah! But this...
Sorry for today's inconvenience.
The Super Snake has been repaired.
Our opening hours are over,
but we are still offering a ride.
Anyone who would like to ride, please go to the boarding point immediately.
Hooray!
Are you okay, Hattori?
Of course, it's just a scratch.
I was just wondering..,
...why he mistook you for Shin'ichi Kudo.
That's why.
You mean fingerprints?
Remember? Those chairs?
Yes, I remember. They didn't match the decor of the room.
I was suspicious of the armrests.
Probably
there was a fingerprint scanner built into the armrest.
This fingerprint belongs to Shin'ichi Kudô.
If Itô is visually impaired,
it's quite possible that he thought I was Kudô.
Ah, I see.
Oh no!
It's after ten! I'm going to explode!
The ID belt can be opened.
Belt?
This thing here!
Oh, really! How nice!
- I'll take it. - Huh?
Now wait a minute!
That jerk.
If he behaves like that, the case is closed.
By the way, you can put me down.
Forget it. Your leg hurts.
Yes, it does!
Being carried by you is the best medicine for him.
Stop it, you nut!
Kids.
Inspector! I've collected the said IDs.
The number is also correct.
Good. Give them to the bomb expert.
But do it in such a way that no one will notice.
Yes!
Okay! Super Snake or whatever, I'll drive it!
Have a good trip!
Lucky!
A car just for us!
Heiji, you're lucky. They even sell underpants.
Idiot! I'm not wetting myself.
Come on, guys. Raise your arms!
Yes!
You're in a good mood.
Scared? Hold on tight.
Who's scared here? I can let go. I wouldn't even need
I wouldn't even need this...
You're exaggerating, Heiji!
Hey! You!
Take it off, Genta! Genta!
What are you waiting for? Take it off, I said!
The sea's coming!
We'll be out of the area by then!
Genta!
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't, or you'll die!
Yes.
Got it!
- Kudo! - She's in the back!
Oh, no!
Go!
No, stop him!
Stop!
The brackets are linked. If you destroy one...
...the others will...
That's great!
That there were even fireworks.
I wonder if that was a special service.
I didn't think it was funny.
Why is he here?
Because he's been with us
He's been with us since the investigation.
Huh?
Warai nagara wakarete
Laughing, we part.
mune no oku wa myô ni blue
Deep in my heart, it's strangely melancholy.
What I want to say, I could not say.
iitai koto wa iezu
Before you will always be
anata no mae ja itsudemo
kokoro to kotoba ga urahara ni nattchau.
my heart and my words
become the opposite of what I mean.
Nothing I have started, today is the end.
Nani mo hajimaranai de kyô ga owari
karasu wa utai nagara mori e kaeru.
The crows return to the forest singing.
Jibun ga iya de nemurenai
Because I don't like myself
I can't sleep.
konna koto nanben kurikaesu no?
How many times am I going to repeat this?
One solid thing
Yuruginai mono hitotsu dakishimetai yo.
I want to hold in my arms.
Dare mo ga sore o waratta to shitemo

Even though everyone should laugh about it,
let me just share with you my blazing feelings.
moesakaru omoi dake o tsutaemashô.
If you want to have a proof of life,
Inochi no akashi ga hoshii nara
then let us sing. My life.
utaô my life.
As for God, I guess,
Kamisama nara tabun ne
sonna ni ooku no koto motomecha inai yo.
That he doesn't ask for so many things at all.
Yokubô kara jiyû ni narenai
I cannot get free from desire.
At random I create misfortunes.
boku wa teatari shidai fushiawase unjau.
I'm always being egged on by someone.
Dareka ni keshikakerarete bakari ite
hitori ja maigo no yôni urotaeru.
Alone like a lost child, I lose my temper.
Stop and think.
Tachidomatte kangaero yo
What is it that I really wish for?
hontô ni hoshii mono wa nandarô?
A solid thing I want to hold in my arms.
Yuruginai mono hitotsu dakishimetai yo.
Even if no one can see it,
Dare ni mo sore ga mienai to shitemo
let's live sincerely and kindly.
massugu yasashiku ikite yukimashô.
Like the light, let us pierce the darkness
Hikari no yôni yami o tsukinukete
and sing. My life.
utaô my life.
Escape somewhere,
Dokoka ni nigetari
kakuretari shinaide ii yo ne
to hide. I don't need that.
tamashii yo motto tsuyoku are.
You, my soul, be stronger!
A solid thing I want to hold in my arms.
Yuruginai mono hitotsu dakishimetai yo.
Even though everyone should laugh at this,
Dare mo ga sore o waratta to shitemo
zetsubô no mannaka o mitsumemashô.
let's aim for the middle of despair.
Inochi no akashi ga hoshii nara
If you want to have a proof of life
then I want you to
omoikiri anata o dakishimetai yo
in your arms.
Let's walk through the heavy rain
doshaburi no ame o kakenukete
and sing. My life.
utaô my life.
Nido to nai my life.
There is no second time. My life.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
Really, that Ryû.
Playing a dying man for a lot of money...
The two detectives he was talking about..,
he was talking about was just a bluff.
To go that far for money...
How pathetic.
Yes, this is Môri Detective Agency.
What? Appearing in a commercial?
What kind of ad is that?
Huh? For a sleeping pill?
I'm supposed to act like I always do?
Are you kidding?
Who do you think I am?
No matter how much you offer me...
What? That much?
Of course I'll be happy to do the job.
Yes. Yes.
I knew it.
He's just "Sleeping Kogoro".
You're welcome.
