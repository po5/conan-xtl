She got away.
Take care of the rest.
All right.
TÔTO-AQUARIUM
DETECTIVE CONAN THE DARKEST NIGHTMARE
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran..,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on it,
that I didn't notice the man behind me.
He was administering a poison to me.
When I awoke...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised me not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked what my name was,
I spontaneously said: Conan Edogawa.
In order to track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father is a detective.
By the way, there is another person besides the professor,
who knows who I really am:
Ai Haibara. Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She originally once belonged to the men in black.
In order to escape from them,
she tried to kill herself,
She swallowed the same poison as I did and shrank as well.
The mysterious Black Organization...
All we know is..,
is that their code names have to do with alcoholic beverages.
But several undercover agents
have become members of it in order to uncover the truth about it.
Central Intelligence Agency CIA agent:
Rena Mizunashi, aka "Kir."
From "Division 0" of the National Police Agency of Japan:
Tôru Amuro, aka "Bourbon."
From another point of view, the organization hunt for the FBI,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation:
James Black,
Andre Camel,
Jodie Starling...
And Shûichi Akai,
one of the FBI's sharpest minds and best marksmen.
Fateful ties seem to connect Amuro and him....
I am small, my mind is not!
No case remains unsolved!
There is always...
DIRECTOR: Kôbun SHIZUNO
one truth!
Professor! There's nothing left to nibble on!
- You ate it all? - Even our share?!
I'm sorry, really...
You're so absorbed.
What are you watching?
News. I thought it was strange that it hasn't been announced yet,
TIP: TOTO AQUARIUM
why the power went out yesterday.
Oh.
A special broadcast about the aquarium we're going to!
Show me, show me, Conan-kun!
Okay...
Show it to me, too! Ah, this seatbelt is getting in the way!
No! Keep your seatbelt on while we're driving!
This is really stupid...
We'll be there soon! Just be patient, Genta-kun!
- Ah, it's starting! -on the occasion of the reopening...
OUR TIP FOR THE GOLDEN WEEK: THE TOTO AQUARIUM!
present the most important novelties in picture and sound!
REOPENED TODAY: THE FASCINATING TÔTO-AQUARIUM
There were three important innovations during the reconstruction.
First, we look at the fact
that attractions and stores are now all located inside the buildings.
This means that visitors can enjoy all attractions
enjoy all the attractions during the entire opening time
without having to worry about the weather.
Next, we turn our attention to
to the main attraction of the aquarium:
The wonderful dolphin show!
Already a crowd puller before,
its content has been completely renewed!
With even better elaborated tricks
the dolphins will surprise and amaze us!
- Bye-bye! - Wah, how great!
And last but not least we would like to introduce
the main attraction after the reconstruction: the world's first
first Ferris wheel with two wheels!

It has two wheels: the North Wheel and the South Wheel,
and from each one you can enjoy a different view!
In addition, with fountains arranged around the wheel, a special
a special light and water show is shown around the wheel,
whose interaction with the view can be enjoyed at a height of 120 m!
Hach, I am so excited about it!
- Let's ride this Ferris wheel! - Good idea!
But didn't you guys want to go to the aquarium?
We'll just look at both!
- We won't? - Yes! - Great idea!
- Let's do both! - Professor...
Thank you for both cards.
Wah, I see it! This thing is huge!
- It sure is! - It's amazing.
We'll be there in less than five minutes!
TÔTO-AQUARIUM
TÔTO-AQUARIUM
Here we are!
- Come on, let's go! - Yeah, yay! - Wait up, Genta-kun!
Professor, come on!
Haibara-san! Conan-kun! Come too, quickly!
What did you decide? The aquarium or the Ferris wheel?
- What?! - What are you talking about!
We're doing both, of course!
Good! Then we'll play for it!
If you answer the quiz question correctly, I'll take you to both.
So, let's go!
COLOR
If you keep painting with it without mixing them....
Which of these four colors
is the one that will change?
One: red.
Two: Blue.
Three: Brown.
Four: black.
Without mixing them...
Color that transforms when painted?
Ah! I haven't the faintest idea!
Professor!
That's childish.
If you call the colors different, the whole thing becomes a little easier.
- Different? - Conan, you're not allowed to guess!
For example:
Aka (red) becomes makka (bright red), ao (blue) massao (deep blue).
- Ai-kun, if you give that away.... - I got it!
And chairo (brown) becomes matcha!
Oh! It's transformed!
- Yes! - What are you guys talking about?
RED (AKA) --> BRIGHT RED (MAKKA)
Aka gives makka.
BLUE (AO) --> DEEP BLUE (MASSAO)
Ao gives massao.
BROWN (CHA) --> DEEP BROWN (MATCHA)
Cha gives matcha.
BLACK (KURO) --> PITCH BLACK (MAKKURO)
And kuro gives makkuro.
Take a closer look at brown, chairo!
BROWN (CHA) --> DEEP BROWN (MATCHA)
Only chairo gives matcha, right?
DEEP BROWN (MATCHA) --> MATCHA --> MATCHA GREEN TEA
Oh! Indeed! It has become green tea!
Hold it! Giving you tips is unfair!
Come on, let's go buy the cards!
Yes!
Hey there!
I want to go on the Ferris wheel first!
Can't do both, can't do both! Wait for me!
Come on kids, this way!
- You have to wait a long time for the bike... - An hour, I'm sure...
- The Ferris wheel is huge, isn't it? - Can you see our house from up there?
What's wrong with you? Hey, what...
...I'll buy you one.
Hello, are you all right, miss?
Your face is dirty!
Oh!
You have two different colored eyes, don't you?
- Maybe she doesn't know Japanese. - Yes, she does. I understand.
What happened? Why are you sitting here alone?
You don't seem to be here with friends. And...
You're hurt!
On your knees and your hand. Your smartphone is also broken...
- Can I look at it? - J... yes...
How long have you been sitting here?
Uh...
Where are you from?
I don't know.
What's your name?
What's my name? I'm sorry. But I don't know.
Show me your head.
J... yes...
The injuries aren't bad, but they're fresh.
She probably hurt her head in a car accident.
Then it could be post-traumatic retrograde amnesia...
How do you know it was a car accident?
This smartphone suffered
a shock that completely destroyed it.
And look: the fragment of a windshield.
She hit her head while driving?
It was an older model of car.
In modern cars, there is a film
foil between the window panes.
And there's a faint smell of gasoline on her body.
That's right.
Tell me..,
do you have anything else with you?
What do you...?
Show me.
Here.
- What's that? - What's that?
Like vocabulary cards,
but semi-transparent and colored.
- What are these cards? - Hellooo!
Conan! Haibara!
We bought you cards too!
Oh dear, the pests are back.
Well, who's that young lady?
Oh!
Her two eyes are different colors! How beautiful!
- Are you wearing a fake eye? - Of course not, Genta-kun!
I think she's "odd-eyed....

"Odd-eyed?
That lady has a strange name!
Ah...
That's not her name.
The eyes are different, in English: odd!
English otter?
You mean her eyes, don't you?
J... yes.
Oh, sorry.
The young lady is laughing at us...
But tell me, what are you two doing here anyway?
That's good.
The woman seems to have had an accident and now she's lost her memory.
What, really, Shin... Uh, I mean Conan-kun, of course!
Yeah. Maybe it has something to do with...
-...with what happened yesterday. - We have to go to the police.
No!
Is there a reason why you don't want to go to the police?
I... I don't know...
But somebody has to take care of you!
- Don't just take her picture! - Wait!
We're not going to the police.
But we need photos to look for people who know you!
People who know me?
Yes. We'll help you get your memory back.
- Are you serious, Conan? - Let us help with that too!
We are...
...after all
the famous Detective Boys!
We're going to find your friends
get your memory back!
You can feel safe now!
Thank you very much.
So, let's look for people you know first!
- Yes! - But what about the Ferris wheel?
What are you talking about?
We don't have time for this now!
- Let's ask... - I bought tickets!
Get out of the way!
- Come on, let's go! - Yeah, let's go!
Let's go find them!
Come on, quick, quick!
But kids! You don't do this for fun!
Are you sure you don't want to inform the police?
Where are you thinking.
RAN MÔRI
DETECTIVE MÔRI
There was an accident on the Tôto Highway No. 11 last night...
an accident occurred in which
a passenger car crashed into a warehouse district and burned.
- Go back and... - Dad?
Okay, Yôko-chan?
...police are searching for the driver. Under what circumstances was it...
HIGHWAY ACCIDENT: ORGANIZED CRIME TRAIL?
Dad!
How long are you going to keep avoiding work?
Shut up!
Detective brains need a rest now and then!
In other words, you drank too much and now you have a headache.
Wha... why... No... I don't...
I haven't done anything... like that s...
Conan says:
The woman has memory loss, pass it on to the police.
I told Inspector Takagi, but...
you'll back her up on this too, right?
- She's beautiful! - Are you listening?
Where is this lady now?
S... they're at the ToTo Aquarium.
All right!
- Yo! - Wait, Pops!
The master detective just took over this case!
No, it's not an assignment, it's... For real.
Superintendent! These are the photos Ran-san sent us earlier.
Good.
According to the report.
she may have been in a traffic accident.
A traffic accident... There was a big one last night.
And the driver of the crashed car disappeared.
Not only the media, but also we don't even get
more detailed information about such a big accident...
Does that mean...
We should look into it.
Commissioner.
How did it go?
Investigation Department No. 3 doesn't have any information about it either.
I see...
What?
Last night someone broke into the National Police Headquarters.
The National...
But the information hasn't reached us at headquarters.
What does that mean?
Maybe there's some big, powerful force at work here, who knows....
Thank you for visiting the Tôto Aquarium Shopping Center!
Please enjoy your shopping at your leisure and to the fullest!
There she is.
I found it, Gin.
Where is she?
At the To To Aquarium.
The aquarium?
Yes.
Don't worry. I'll bring her right back.
Thank you very much for honoring us
with your visit today!
In a few moments, our dolphins' special show will begin.
I wonder if she's actually been here before?
Hm...
It is really strange that nobody remembers
her striking hair and eye color.
So, where do you want to go ask now?
We've passed the above-ground part through....
TOTO AQUARIUM PLAN
Give it your all!
This is the last one! Stay very calm!
These little...
- Amazing! - Congratulations!
That's today's record!
Come on, you too!
Both hands out!
Yay!

- With me too, please! - And with me!
Yes...
- Whoo-hoo! - And now with me!
You smiled again!
It really suits you better when you smile!
Yes!
- I think so too! - You think so?
I sure do!
You may now choose three pendants as your prize!
- Oh! - Yay!
We get to have three?
- I want that one! - I'll take that one! - I'll take that one!
Fine. You get that one...
What about the lady?
I don't need one. Don't bother.
But I...
- After all, you won her for us! - Hey, you guys!
Oh, Conan-kun!
Ai-chan!
You guys are having a great time!
But you wanted to get her memory back, right?
50 POINTS ON THREE THROWS: A KEYCHAIN AS A PRIZE!
- Well... - We were going to start right after this game!
And then she won for us
won this one!
You guys just want to start now?
We'd better take over this area, too...
Hello!
Here I am, up here!
Up here is your old Hiroshi!
- Here I am! - What are you doing up there?
The Ferris wheel line is really short right now!
If you want to ride, this is your chance!
What, really?
So let's ride the Ferris wheel first!
Good idea!
Maybe the view will bring back a memory for her!
Okay, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
- Let's ride the Ferris wheel! - Hurry up! - Come on, let's go!
Come on...
Let's keep the Ferris wheel mad professor company.
So he's the one most anxious to ride it?
Bull's-eye!
Excuse me. Excuse me. Did you ever see that woman playing darts..,
before?
You mean the woman with the silver hair?
Yes! Do you know her by any chance?
No, I don't remember her.
And such a good player
I certainly wouldn't forget!
All into the Double Bull? Something like that doesn't just happen by accident.
Thank you very much!
Ah, that reminds me...
Would you please give this to your friends?
What's this?
A surplus unpainted sample pendant.
There was no pendant for her, after all. Maybe she would like to have it?
It's still unpainted, so she can paint it however she wants!
Yes! I'm sure she'll love it.
Thank you so much!
You're welcome! Have fun, okay?
Let's go, Haibara.
J... yes. Where are we going now?
Let's check out the area in the warren first...
then join the others.
As the dart game showed...
It's probably better to stay with her than to search for clues separately.
DEEP SEA AQUARIUM COMING SOON
I would like to see them...
I like the jellyfish!
I'm getting all excited!
I wonder what we can see from up there?
The Bell Tree Tower for sure!
What are you doing here?
Let's go.
Hey, missy! Don't daydream or you'll be left behind!
Sorry.
I felt as if someone had spoken to me.
What? Was it someone you know?
No. I think I just imagined it.
All right, you're all set?
Yes!
Then follow me!
Change of plans. There seems to be some difficulty.
Hurry up. We can't let them run too long.
I know.
Mom, wait!
No success even in the area that's still under construction...
Could you contact the professor, Haibara?
What's the matter?
Why are you so lost in thought?
- You think so? - Hello, Conan!
Conan! Haibara!
Here we are!
Up here! Up here!
Here we are!
- Do you see us? - Here we are, look!
Genta, get back!
- Huh? What do you mean? - Genta-kun!
- Watch out! - No, don't!
Genta!
Genta-kun!
- I'm gonna fall! - This isn't the way...
I... I... I can't go on!
Genta-kun!
Are you okay, Genta?
Genta-kun! Are you okay? Come here!
- Why are you...? - You're lucky! You're okay!
Ah! I remember!
I fell from up there!
Are you all right? Are you all right?
The young lady saved me, I'm fine!
Thank God!
Please come to the first aid station anyway.
What is the meaning of this?
Please.
Everything is all right now.
Ah, thank you.
And hop...
Ah, ouch ouch ouch...
Why are you pretending to be the most injured?
- It's pathetic. - Oh, yes. Like a little kid.
When you're older, you'll understand.
The professor's all right, let's ride the Ferris wheel!
- Thank you, miss. - Let's go!

Yes, let's go!
Yes... But...
Am I really not disturbing you?
What are you saying now?
I owe you my life, Miss!
- That's right! - All right, let's go.
Wait!
Edogawa-kun, I need to talk to you.
Okay, let's go.
- Then we can go ahead and... - No!
Wait a little longer.
N... All right.
What do you think she has?
How boring!
What's the matter?
Listen carefully!
While Conan-kun and Haibara-san are busy talking...
Are you really sure? That she's one of them?
I can't say for sure.
But you felt it too.
And her right eye... It feels like it's not real.
Not real... You don't mean...
Yes. Exactly what you say...
Number Two of the Black Organization.
Rum.
Miss!
Huh? What is it?
Pssssst!
Assuming she is Rum,
it's doubtful she's lost her memory.
It's true, Rum's gender and age are unknown....
Yes.
When I was in the organization, there were rumors that Rum was...
a strong, tall man.
Or a feminine man.
Or an old man. Everybody said something different.
And also...
He had lost an eye in an accident and was now wearing an artificial one.
What if one of their different colored eyes is artificial?
I see...
And the memory loss would be just an act.
But why would she go through all this trouble to get to us?
That...
It's true: Given her physical abilities.
one can't help but suspect she might be one of them.
But if her memory loss is real, one could conversely....
No! You can't bring back her memories!
Do you want to retrieve
to get information about the black organization?
about the Black Organization?!
If you do that, you risk eliminating not only the two of us..,
but those kids over there will be eliminated as well!
They're gone!
What's the professor doing!
- They're cute, huh? - Professor!!!
The putt-putt pigeons!
This is not the time!
Where are the children?
Huh? Well?
CONAN-KUN INCOMING CALL
CONAN-KUN CALLING
It's Conan-kun!
You'd better not answer it.
He'll just rant anyway.
You're right.
Ha! Look!
Pigeons are flying!
So they are!
- Do you see them too? - A huge flock, isn't it?
-...not available at the moment. - Damn! Those miserable...
They must be on the Ferris wheel. That's where they wanted to go.
Yeah, let's go!
Ha... wait, wait, wait for me!
Maybe you were doing some kind of sport, miss!
Otherwise,
...you wouldn't have been able to save Genta-kun so boldly!
That's right! And you have a great figure, too!
A great figure?
You think so?
Yes, I do! You look like a supermodel!
Oh!
The fountains are getting bigger!
- Ah, they're reaching up higher and higher! - How great!
WELCOME TO THE TOTO AQUARIUM
- Can you see them too? - Yes, really beautiful!
Oh! There, look down!
There's a rainbow! Come forward, too!
Yes.
Is everything all right?
Did something happen?
No. I just felt dizzy.
You must be afraid of heights!
Oh! We're almost at the top!
Yes, we are!
This is what I've been waiting for!
- This is the "Top of the Tops!" - Yes!
It's amazing.
The view is amazing.
You all right?
Hello. Come to.
- What are we doing? - Just a minute. I'll call for help.
- The NOC... - Ayumi! Mitsuhiko!
What are we going to do? Miss is saying strange things!
- Maybe she remembers! - The NOC...
Ayumi-chan! Please use it to call Conan-kun!
Yes!
Genta-kun! What did she say?
Something about gnocchi...
- Gnocchi? - Kir...
Bourbon...
She's saying something again!
- Shh! Please be quiet, Genta-kun! - Stout...
Aquavit... Riesling...
STAUT, AKWAWIT, RIES...
STAUT AKWAWIT, RIES...
Please! Hurry up!
It's ringing!
What's the matter?
It's a call. Maybe it's...
I knew it.
Mitsuhiko! Listen, Conan-kun.
Conan-kun, please help us!
Ayumi? What's wrong? What's wrong?
We're on the Ferris wheel, and something's wrong with the lady!
What? What exactly is her condition?
Uh...
She's holding her head and in pain! She's saying something,
- but we don't understand... - I'm taking notes!
- Mitsuhiko-kun's writing down what she says! - All right.

Conan-kun, please! Help her, quick!
Conan-kun! Where's the woman?
They're taking her to the ambulance.
- Takagi-kun, let's go. - Yes!
Haibara, Professor! Take care of the rest.
- Then let's... - No!
You can't do that.
STAFF ONLY
Excuse me.
Ah, please sit down.
As I told you before,
we, the police, will take you into custody.
I don't mind if you do,
but please give a message to the person in charge at the police hospital.
The cause of the memory loss was probably a violent blow to the head,
that's for sure.
Furthermore...
We found a very rare damage in her fornix.
It's right here.
This isn't from the accident?
No. I suspect it's congenital.
Is it related to the seizure?
Well, in everyday life, the damage doesn't cause any disability,
so I don't think so.
All right.
I'll set it up that way.
- Then, uh... - Wait, please.
There's one more thing.
When I examined you, I found this
in your right eye.
- What's that? - A colored contact lens.
Yes. A contact lens that makes the eye...
look black.
- Well... - So it was just imagination that she has different colored
or a fake eye?
...share it anyway, just to be sure.
Excuse me!
We are now ready for transport.
- Then we recommend ourselves as well. - Good.
Thank you.
Well?
Don't you have to go with them, my boy?
No. Because I want to ask you something, Doctor.
What is it?
It's about this colored contact lens...
So you only made one eye look black.
Then both your eyes are really blue?
- Well... No, her right eye is transparent. - Transparent?
No, maybe I'd better say it looks transparent.
IRIS SCLERA
It's extremely rare,
but when the iris is practically the same color as the sclera..,
it looks as if it is transparent.
So it doesn't change
that she has two different colored eyes...
Or more simply explained...
Doctor.
Thank you for everything!
Is that all?
Yes!
Goodbye!
- Take care of yourself. - Is she here?
Is my client in here?
My lord! Unauthorized persons are not allowed in here!
But I'm telling you, I'm an authorized person!
Hello, uncle!
What are you doing?
Kid! That's a good one!
Where's my beautiful client?
She's not here.
She was just taken to the police hospital.
And she's not your client either.
- What? - You didn't listen to Ran-neechan again, did you?
Do you still have things to do here?
N... no...
- I wonder what happened? - I don't know...
I was still thinking that she seems strange.
She lost her memory.
Where is she now?
Where is she now?
She's being taken to the police hospital.
So the police have become active too...
Yes. And there's something else that worries me.
What's that?
When she was on the Ferris wheel,
...she had some kind of seizure.
- A seizure? - Yeah, a seizure.
All right.
Continue surveillance.
A seizure on the Ferris wheel. She's not going to...
DETECTIVE MÔRI
But why does Haibara hate the miss so much?
CAFÉ POIROT
Indeed!
I've never seen her so angry.
Don't you know why she's so angry?
Ah... No, not really...
When I asked her, she said she felt unwell and went home.
Ayumi-chan, asking the professor won't do any good.
That's how it is!
Haibara always scolds him, too, after all.
Indeed!
Oh, that reminds me... Conan-kun gave me this.
...this for you.
Oh, that's...
One of the prizes from the dart board!
But why isn't it painted?
Ah... Conan-kun told me something, but I forgot.
Oh, never mind. We'll just ask him directly.
Who's that?
Oh! Speak of the devil! It's Conan-kun!
Hello?
Professor!
Are you with the kids?
Yes... We're having tea at Café Poirot.
Good. I have a question and a request.
First tell me... Is the woman all right?
She was taken to the police hospital earlier.
CONVERSATION IN PROGRESS
TALK IN PROGRESS - She's fine.
Thank God!
So, what request do you have for me?
That you recover the data on the smartphone she had.

I'll be happy to, but I may not be able to do a complete recovery.
Good.
As for the question, when she had her seizure on the Ferris wheel...
...she said something?
I'd like to know what.
Ah, not quite from the beginning,
but I diligently wrote it down!
Uh... She said...
"Staut...", "Akwawit..."
And "Riesling."
- What might that mean? - Alcoholic beverages? Oh no!
Professor, you are in the "Poirot"?
CONVERSATION IN PROGRESS
Huh?
J... yes.
Get me Amuro-san, please!
Amuro-san, you mean?
I haven't seen him today.
Amuro-san is off today.
What?
He called this morning to ask if he could take the day off. That's all he said.
I tried to call him back, but I can't reach him.
You heard.
I hope nothing happened. I'm worried.
Amuro-san...
Does he have...
Stout here. I'm on the bus.
Wait for further instructions.
Copy that, sir.
Stout...
Stout...
I trusted you.
Too bad.
Stout's dead.
Okay. Come right back.
All right.
For 32 years, the CN Tower
For 32 years.
the CN Tower was the tallest building in the world.
the tallest building in the world.
The tour along the outer edge leads around the whole building.
The tour along the outer edge
116th floor, at 356 meters above the ground!
leads around the entire 116th floor,
at 356 meters above the ground!
- Well, would anyone like to... - Look, the helicopter!
That helicopter... Impossible...
How pathetic.
This is how a spy deserves to die.
I killed Aquavit.
Great, as usual. Get back here right now.
You don't have to tell me.
Now, now! How far are you going to run?
I told you, you have one minute left.
I told you I'm not an NOC!
Then it's time for you to show your colors.
Don't,
Riesling?
Gin...
Are you on their side or ours? Take a stand now.
And spit out the names of the rats that have infiltrated us besides you.
Go on, spit them out. You don't want to suffer, do you?
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm not an NOC! Threatening me won't help.
Threaten you?
Do you really think I'd do something so nice?
Five...
Four...
three...
two...
One...
Zero.
Let's go. Hurry up.
Where to?
To Japan.
You don't mean...
Two left.
DANNY'S RESTAURANT
From british MI6,
Canadian CSIS,
the German BND...
One agent after another has been killed....
- Do you mean... - Yes.
They all had one thing in common: they had infiltrated that organization.
Then they were killed by people from the organization...
Akai-san reported to us
that one of their spies had stolen data...
stole data from the police department.
A spy from the organization...
Jodie-sensei!
They called me here
because I saw the person suspected of being that spy?
Yes.
I thought so. But she's suffering from memory loss.
Her cell phone, probably her data storage device, is broken.
A cell phone?
She had one with her?
Yeah. She left it at home, so I took it.
- We should send it to Division and analyze it. - You're right.
You're right.
Wait. The professor will have the data back soon,
having him do it will be faster.
Then inform us immediately when he's done.
We need to know as soon as possible what was leaked to the organization.
Otherwise, panic will break out all over the world.
- What data was stolen? - About "non-official covers...
But that...
Yes. The NOC list.
With agents from all over the world that the police department knows about.
That means...
The undercover agents in the organization will be eliminated.
And not only that.
If the NOC list becomes public,
intelligence agencies around the world could go under.
But then they will have
the linchpin of the information war...
Yes. And if that's true,
the three assassination attempts
on the agents may be just the beginning...
We are actually here...
Are you sure you didn't tell Ai-chan and Conan-kun?
Of course it was! They would've just told us not to come here!
- Let's give it a try. But it's easy for us not to see them. - Yeah, let's do that.
Yes.
Yes. Tôto Police Hospital.

In case of emergency, it doesn't matter. I'm counting on you, Kazami.
Yes, sir!
Bourbon! Why are you here?
To bring her back, of course.
And I thought you wanted to get rid of her
before she got her memory back.
Why would I do that?
I don't understand what you mean.
How were you planning to get to her?
She's under strict guard and can't have visitors.
Or is it that you could easily see her?
Maybe because you have special relations with the police?
What are you talking about?
Never mind.
I don't want to chat standing up. Let's go somewhere else.
If that's what the organization tells me to do, I guess I have no choice.
- What did they say? - Not a chance.
No one's allowed to visit.
What, really?
Is she in such bad shape?
We'll have to check more carefully.
But how are you going to...
Like this.
I see.
INSPECTOR TAKAGI
Exactly! We have a strong ally!
Professor!
How does it look?
At least the last data I sent, I think I can recover it.
Please hurry!
J... yes...
So, what do you
now?
Genta-kun! You can't put anything there.
Really? Then I made a mistake. Oh! Inspector Takagi!
So it is! He's back at last!
- How is she? - Can we see her?
Keep your voices down!
No one can know you're here!
Who can't know what?
I'm sorry, I... I brought her out of old habit...
Oh! Miss!
How nice! You're all right.
Your head doesn't hurt anymore?
No. I'm fine now.
Thank you.
You're not supposed to be talking to her,
but since she seems to trust you, maybe this will help her...
it might help her get her memory back.
- Really? - Thank you very much.
But just,
Until the next interrogation begins, all right?
Yahaaa!!!
Here!
Where should I put the next stone?
Hmm...
How about here?
Okay! And... Well, what do you say now?
- What do we do now? - Now we have a problem...
- We did it, Miss! - Yes, we did it.
That reminds me...
Here, this is for you, miss.
Is that...
The man from the dart game sent it to us!
You can paint it however you like!
Can I really keep it?
Of course you can. I owe you my life.
I owe you my life.
Miss!
Now we all have the same one!
Yes!
How are you going to paint it?
Red? Or pink?
I would take black, then he looks like an orca!
But white suits you better than black...
Your hair is white too.
Maybe it's a bargain to just leave it as it is!
Genta-kun, I think I was wrong.
You sound like you're at a sale.
It doesn't matter! Do you?
Are you okay?
Ah... I'm really sorry.
Are you okay?
Yes!
And I was about to win!
But it's all thanks to Miss!
You just followed her instructions.
N... Well...
Excuse me!
Kazami, security police.
Commissioner Megure is in charge here?
Are you Inspector Megure?
Yes, my name is indeed Megure.
We request that you transfer the woman there to us immediately.
Why should we do that?
We have the right to investigate, don't we?
She is suspected of infiltrating our authority.
We need to question her as to what her objective was.
Now that that is clear,
you will proceed with the transfer formalities.
Because you have no right to refuse to do so.
All right.
Follow me.
The application papers are ready.
What will happen to you now, miss?
I don't know.
- That concludes your visit here. - Go home now.
And you go back to the sickroom.
Yes.
- Ah... Miss! - Do you really have to go?
Ah... F... Miss!
Thank you all very much. I will cherish the figure.
Yes...
Let's ride the Ferris wheel together again sometime!
- Yes! - I promise! - We will!
Come on, let's go.
I wonder if she'll be okay.
Yes... I'm worried about her.
Yes...
ANALYSIS RUNS
COMPLETED
Oh, Shin'ichi! The analysis is finished.
What does it say?
Look.
"NOC" are: Stout, Aquavit, and Riesling. And the ones you suspect....
Bourbon and Kir...
Damn, I knew it!

Find out immediately to whom this message was sent!
- J... yes... - Then call immediately!
Haibara!
Don't do it.
Please.
I told you once not to run away from your destiny.
I don't want to run away either.
Kudô-kun...
Thank you, Inspector Takagi!
Sorry for asking so much.
So, take care of yourselves on your way home.
Yee-ha!
Come on, Genta-kun, cheer up!
I'm sure we'll see them again.
But...
I've got it!
Let's go ride the Ferris wheel again right now!
Yes!
Miss wanted to go again. Let's take a picture of the view for her.
But it'll be evening by the time we get there,
and there might be too many people around.
Don't worry.
The Suzuki family has also invested in the Tôto Aquarium.
Here.
- Aha! - I see!
SONOKO-ONEESAN
That's right. That's another exceedingly strong ally.
So we are suspected of being NOC.
On the NOC list that Curaçao sent us,
apparently your names were on it.
Curaçao? That's Rum's right-hand man, isn't it?
Yes. Specialist in intelligence gathering.
So you know her?
She has two different colored eyes. She's an odd-eye...
It's common knowledge in the organization.
For old friendship's sake... Spit it out like a good boy,
and I'll kill you painlessly.
The reason you're taking us instead of killing us..,
is because Curaçao's information was incomplete,
Am I right?
You're living up to your reputation, Bourbon.
Everything was fine until she stole the NOC list.
But then she got caught and crashed her car while running away.
And lost her memory in the process.
You better get Curaçao back and try to find the NOC list!
Gin. It wouldn't be too late if you checked
check the list to see if we are NOC!
That is indeed the case.
But...
- Gin! - Brother?!
Punish all suspects.
That's my policy.
So...
Time to judge the traitors!
- Are you done yet? - Don't push it!
- The analysis will be ready in 30 seconds. - Good.
As soon as you find the addressee, do as I say.
All right.
Make it look like the message came
from the broken smartphone.
RECEIVER ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS
Yes. Hurry up! We don't have time!
FINISHED
Oh! It's finished!
He hung up...
Over here, Cool Kid!
Read this first!
D... this...
Kir!
What's up, Kir?
Go on.
You want to be freed, don't you?
Colleagues only on suspicion...
You're not the ones judging whether you're colleagues or not.
I'll give you one minute.
The first one to betray his partner gets to watch..,
while the other rat dies.
Vodka! Count it down.
Copy that.
60 seconds.
That doesn't intimidate me!
If I say she's a NOC,
I'm admitting I'm one, too.
And you'd never let that one get away.
50 seconds.
Are you so sure about that?
I'm a surprisingly nice person,
Kir...
40 seconds.
So you're protecting each other in complete harmony.
I'm not protecting anyone! I don't know if she's an NOC or not!
- Neither do I! I can tell you one thing... - 30 seconds.
I am not a NOC!
That's what I said!
So...
20 seconds.
Which one of you is the rat?
Gin... Are you sure you want to...
Which one of you is gonna sing first?
Ten seconds. Nine,
eight,
- seven... - Well?
Is it bourbon? Or Kir?
...four,
three,
- two, one... - You go first!
Zero!
Bourbon!
- What's wrong? - The lamp...
Kir! Bourbon! Don't move!
B... Bourbon's gone!
He's gone.
Damn it! Damn it! How did he...
After him!
Sorry, Kir.
You won't see a rat carcass now.
But don't feel lonely.
I'll send Bourbon over to you soon.
- Goodbye, Kir. - Gin, wait!
Don't shoot!
Orders from Rum.
So? What do we do now?
Yes. Understood.
According to a message from Curaçao, the two have nothing to do with it.
She got her memory back?
That should dispel
should dispel any doubts you may have had about us.
So will you take these handcuffs off me, please?
No.
Rum's order goes further.
It must be verified that the message
was actually sent from Curaçao.

To do that, we have to kidnap her from the hospital. It's going to be pretty hairy.
Don't worry about it.
If my reading is correct,
we're gonna see some action soon.
Good timing, Gin.
The sleepyheads from the security police have become active.
I knew it.
And they have no idea that we're listening in on their...
And where are they going?
To the place you suspected, of course.
They're putting them in the car right now.
Launch that aircraft.
Are you serious?
This is an ideal opportunity to test
to see what it can do.
You don't want to start a war, do you?
Those are Rum's orders.
We have to carry them out dutifully, don't we?
Understood, sir.
Gross, gross, gross! I'm having so much fun right now, I can't stand it!
I feel the same way.
Gin! Are you planning to use that thing?
Brother! No luck.
He got away from me.
It doesn't matter.
Bourbon and Kir are later.
First we get Curaçao back.
But the hospital is crawling with cops and PSOs!
Curaçao has left the hospital.
Where is she now?
On the way
To the ToTo aquarium.
Gin! Did you put it there because you knew what would happen?
Vodka, let's go.
- Bring the car around! - Yes!
All right. Get over there right away, please.
We'll take care of the rescue.
Copy that.
The two have escaped their predicament.
Thank God!
Great! Your plan was a complete success, kid!
It was nothing...
The last sentence of the message broke off,
we just had to
"... have nothing to do with it, rest assured." and send it.
Very good. That makes both of them...
- Yes. - Nope.
This is just a breather.
They're prioritizing the release of their agent
and are on their way to the To To aquarium.
Not the hospital?
No.
The security police took her to the aquarium.
The aquarium?
- We should also... - No, we shouldn't.
Akai-kun is already on his way there.
We'll rescue the two agents from the warehouse district...
-...and look for the NOC list. - Yes, sir.
Conan-kun!
You get out.
We have no idea what's going to happen now.
But, uh...
Don't worry.
The FBI will solve this problem.
Okay.
I'm counting on you.
Yes.
I'll let you know how it turns out.
I'll let you know how it turns out.
Oh, that reminds me.
How much did Akai-san know about the agent?
Apparently not much.
Only that she was Rum's right-hand woman.
and that her code name is "Curaçao".
Thank you. Good luck!
So she's not Rum, she's Curaçao....
Curaçao is a liqueur flavored with orange peel....
The main varieties:
White Curaçao,
Orange Curaçao,
Blue Curaçao,
Green Curaçao
and Red Curaçao.
Could it be...
There are five colors...
I have the combination before... But where?
Remember!
Is this the key...
In her fornix......a very rare lesion...
...is holding her head... is in pain... says something...
-...we don't understand.... - "Staut"...
"Akwawit"... And...
"Riesling" said.
I see. This conclusion also explains
the behavior of the organization and the security police!
That means...
Crap!
Hurry up! Otherwise, the organization will get the list!
Yes. Yes. She's in our custody as ordered.
What, we're supposed to ride the Ferris wheel with her?
Yes. Success is not certain, but we must bet on it now.
You're doing it?
Yes. But we should meet again.
No. We don't know if the organization is watching us.
I'll get to the Ferris wheel alone. See you.
Wait, Furuya-san!
Really! Why do I have to go to that aquarium
I have to go to that aquarium?
And then with you little brats, too!
Like this! Here we are!
- This is what I've been waiting for! - Yay! - Let's go!
Wait a minute!
Stay right there!
Yahaaa!
What are you doing, Pops?
I don't feel like looking at fish today.
I'm taking a siesta here. Have a good time!
Thank you.
- I'll talk to them. - I'll talk to them.
The aquarium? Again?
I thought they were taking her to the crash site...
The woman had a seizure here on the Ferris wheel,
maybe there's some kind of secret...
- Let's observe the situation from here for now. - Yes.
Sonoko-neechan isn't here yet...
- Yes, she is. But she'll be here soon. - I want to ride the Ferris wheel.
I'm very sorry,
but the ticket sales for today have already ended...

Then please inform the person in charge
that the security police request assistance.
- Ran! Here I am, here! - Please wait a moment!
Ah, she's finally here!
Sonoko!
Hi! Sorry the formalities took a while.
Whoo-hoo!
Sonoko-oneesan, you're the greatest!
Oh yes, you can really be grateful to me!
Yahaaa!
I'm sorry I'm about to benefit too.
That's alright! After all, the effort remains the same.
- Then we'll turn the kids over to you! - Yes!
I'll take you to the Ferris wheel now.
So follow me, yeah?
- Yaaa! - Yep!
Is it okay to saddle her up?
Sure. She works here as a tour guide, that's fine.
But shouldn't you have invited Shin'ichi-kun too?
What?
- What should we do? - Take over the rest of the guard.
Do you know these people?
No... I don't, but I feel like
I think I've seen that woman before.
They're security police?
I wonder if something happened.
What was that all about? What a bully!
Let's go!
Sorry, Sonoko.
But I can't get those people out of my head.
Come on, take this opportunity to call him!
Shit! When this phone rings...
RAN MÔRI INCOMING CALL
RAN MÔRI - I knew it!
What's wrong, Ran?
Shin'ichi? I need to talk to you for a minute.
About what? Please be brief.
- Are you very busy right now? - Well... yes.
J... Listen, Sonoko!
- Ha, Ran's embarrassed! - Seriously...
There's a lot going on right now!
- I'm hanging up. - Ah...
Wait, Shin'ichi!
- I'll call you when it's quieter! - Is that...
Say, where are you?
Really, the...
He said he was busy and hung up?
Yes.
I wonder where that guy hangs out...
He seems to be here too!
I'm sorry?
I heard an announcement from here on his phone.
I see. The question is, who is he with?
You're really stupid! Do you really think a boy would come here alone?
Come on, let's catch this guy red-handed!
What? Wait, Mom... Sonoko!
ATTENTION HIGH VOLTAGE LINE
Looks like there's more than one power supply.
SUPPLY LINES SEPARATED BY SECTIONS
The old plant is powered separately.
Nothing to do.
I'm done.
Now you can show up without being spotted right away.
Thank you.
Hurry up! The action starts in 15 minutes!
Yes, sir. Let's go!
WELCOME TO THE TOTO AQUARIUM
Thank you for visiting us today
on the Ferris wheel of the Tôto-Aquarium!
It's almost time for our light and water special show.
Due to an inspection of the North Wheel
unfortunately only the
only the South Wheel is open to visitors.
NO ADMISSION
So, here we are!
- Yay! - A shortcut!
Wait a minute, please.
Who are those kids?
They're here with Suzuki-sama.
Oh! Then...
was the North Wheel reserved for them?
Apparently so.
Damn it!
I won't be able to find them like this! I've got to stop them before they get in!
What are they up to?
Hey! Something big must be going on!
I wonder if something happened.
Does that mean...
Kudô-kun, where are you?
I knew it!
On the Ferris wheel!
The security police are here.
What? Is the reservation...?
Yes. We asked for it.
I'm terribly sorry. I'm terribly sorry.
But I let a group of children on...
about ten minutes ago.
Should we wait until they get back?
If it's just kids, it doesn't matter.
Now that we have control of the safety on the bike,
they will undoubtedly not attack until we are back on the ground.
So stay extremely vigilant.
Yep.
Let's go.
I've been separated from my friends!
Please let me through!
Stop!
- Don't get in! - Whoops.
You're not allowed in here.
Damn it! Just a moment too late!
NO ENTRY
Let me through!
NO ADMITTANCE
If they've planted anything,
it's here, inside,
where it is not conspicuous and not so strictly guarded!
I have to uncover their plan as soon as possible and inform the ÖS and the FBI!
This is Akai-san?
What's that?
All these cables...
Are those... And if so...
Shit! I've got to check this out right away!
There she is. Exactly as predicted.
Spotted Curaçao in a gondola. With a security police officer.

You will reach the highest point in about 10 minutes.
In 10 minutes... How's it looking, Vodka?
We're ready to go.
And the rest of the ÖS?
There are several officers posted in each section,
but they won't interfere with us, will they?
We'll launch on your signal.
Roger that.
Tell me...
You really don't remember me?
No.
Well, never mind.
As soon as you get your memory back.
you're going to tell me where the NOC list is..,
and any other information about the organization.
I should have beat them to it...
He's here?
It looks like he got away.
So the fact that he's here means that this is actually...
What's going on?
After you shot down the lamp and blocked their view...
Kir! Bourbon!
-I couldn't move in the warehouse. - After him!
So you pushed open the gate to make them think I escaped.
Sorry, Kir.
That way I could hide in the shadows
and find out what they were planning next.
I knew that if it was you, you would come here.
But please tell me what purpose you had in saving us.
You could have overheard this information
without putting yourself in danger.
Did you come here just to have a nice chat?
Yes, I did. To tell the FBI to back off.
And that we in the security police are grabbing Curaçao.
What if I say no?
Then you'll have to take them by force.
Back off, Shuichi Akai!
To have so many wires leading to that hydrant...
That's suspicious!
I can't just open it. Ah... But from here...
An ignition device?
If so...
...there are probably explosive devices attached to the ends of the cables..,
are probably detonators.
What do I do now?
The device is remote-controlled. If I make too much
If I make too much noise and these guys find out, it's all over.
I got it! He's here too!
Dear guests! Your wait is over!
What's going on? There are no people in there!
Oh no!
Why are they...?!
I told you, Amuro-kun..,
I told you not to go after the wrong person.
Yes. I'll hunt down their organization.
After I defeat you!
What if, while we're fighting,
Curaçao's memory returns and those guys strike?
Why don't you make it clear?
That you don't trust the stolen Japanese police anymore!
Let's go!
Damn it! Where the hell did you go, Akai-san?
Please pick up!
Up there?
Where is he?
Stop it.
You're giving up already?
Okay, let's move on to round two.
Akai-san!
You're up there, aren't you? Emergency! Please help me!
If they can't get Curaçao back,
they're gonna blow up the whole Ferris wheel!
I'm begging you! If you're up there, help me!
We have to defuse the explosives before they get here!
- Otherwise, there'll be a disaster! - Is that right?
Amuro-san! How did you get here...
I'll explain later. Tell me, where are the explosives?
There are several between the wheel and the axle!
They could be blown up at any time from a distance!
We've got to disarm them fast!
Good.
All right! The FBI guy and I will be right there!
Okay!
- Oh... That was beautiful, huh? - J... Yeah...
Come on Ran, cheer up!
I'll find him, no matter what!
Ah, that's not what I meant.
I'm worried that I might interfere with his investigation.
How good-natured and naive are you?
Listen to me carefully! I'll catch him cheating on you.
Oh, come on, stop it, Sonoko.
No! We haven't looked in the most important place yet!
The most important place?
Yes, the most important place. Right there!
You mean in the aquarium?
Exactly!
- And, Amuro-san? - Just a little more...
Now nothing more happens.
The box was indeed tampered with.
Yes. It was the right decision not to open it.
What about the explosives?
It is indeed C4. The explosives are cleverly placed.
If they all detonate at the same time,
the axle won't be able to withstand the load and will collapse.
I see.
So we have no time to hesitate.
Is that it?
Well? Can you disarm it?
No problem. The model is common.
I can disarm it.

So you know about bombs?
A friend at the police academy taught me a few things.
He later became the star of the bomb disposal squad.
Then, however, he flew
he got blown up defusing a bomb on a Ferris wheel...
A bomb on a Ferris wheel?
Don't worry.
His technique was perfect.
I'll prove it to you.
Use this.
There's a tool kit in there. You do the disarming.
And you?
If they plant the explosives here, they'll start their operation here.
And the only way they can get back to Curaçao
without being damaged by the bombs is...
From the air!
That's right.
I'll go to my post and stall for time.
And you have to defuse the bombs!
He says it so easily...
Amuro-san, here.
Yes, thank you.
The question is how much time
he can buy us to disarm...
Indeed.
If they can explode at any time...
No, wait. The timing of their attack...
ATTENTION HIGH VOLTAGE
What's the matter?
I have to protect the list!
I mean, really. You're both...
That's it! These headlights have
the same colors as Curaçao's color films!
And at night, the transparency level is practically the same!
If I am right, Curaçao will remember the NOC list as soon as she sees
sees these colors!
Curaçao's brain itself is the searched memory medium!
And...
The gate to her memories opens when the gondola is at its highest.
Now the arrangement and concentration are right,
and her memory will return completely!
It is time.
Gin! This is the final check. We start in three minutes.
Ready?
We are ready. Please start.
Chianti!
Stand by on Point Alpha. Activate silencer mode!
Roger that!
I have to disarm it quickly and then join Kazami!
Now I've got to get this...
No!
Phew, that was close.
If this lights up, it's all over.
"Impatience and haste are the greatest traps," huh, Matsuda?
What does that mean? Soon half the trip will be over!
If it wasn't the fireworks from earlier,
was Furuya-san's information wrong?
Hey! What's going on?
Stop it! Calm down!
What's going on?
Didn't she have her memory back?
Was the message Rum received about...?
Calm down! Sit down!
Hey! No! Stop it!
It's your own fault, Curaçao.
You've stored things in that special brain of yours
that are uncomfortable for us.
Your abilities are wonderful.
But used wrongly, they become
they become a great threat.
That's why... You understand, don't you?
In the end.
your destiny.
Farewell,
Curaçao.
Wait.
U... impossible...
Wh-what are you doing here?
Step back, Wormwood.
Curacao... You have no color.
You have only pitch black darkness.
R... Rum?
But if this darkness torments you,
why don't you change color?
Use your special skills for me, for me alone.
Your input
and also your output.
And become my right hand,
Curaçao.
Hey, you okay? Get a grip!
Really. Wait.
I'll call an ambulance.
That won't be necessary.
So she had them back after all.
Curaçao has reached the interception sector.
Two minutes to the highest point.
You can start slowly, right?
- Vodka! Extend the arm. - Roger!
Open the hatch.
That rotor noise... They're close.
What the hell are those guys up to?
Is that...
Who is it?
Long time no see, Wormwood.
So you got your memory back.
Yeah. But tell me, when do I get picked up?
The place is crawling with security police.
No problem. Gin will be along shortly to pick you up.
Gin?
Yeah. But tell me, when did your memory come back?
Rum got a message from your smartphone.
If that message wasn't from you...
Oh, the message? Sure, it was from me.
Is there something wrong with it?
Is there?
Then Kir and Bourbon are innocent.
And Bourbon fled because he didn't want to die unjustly?
It's about time, Cinderella.
Wait where you are, for your pumpkin coach.
Okay.
Five more seconds.
Three,
two,
one,
zero.
What the...?
Shit! It's started!
Wormwood's signal locked.
Ground is shrouded in darkness.
Okay.
Bring the machine down.

And grab Curaçao!
Yes!
Please keep calm!
Please don't run around, it's dangerous!
Look over there! The light is still on in the aquarium!
- Let's go there. - Yes.
Come on, guys, let's go!
Don't go! Don't move!
I got a bad feeling... I gotta get the kids out of there!
What are you doing? A power outage, here of all places?
We're really out of luck.
We could have gotten out soon...
And?
Nothing. No connection.
What's Kazami-san doing up there?
Satô-kun, Takagi-kun!
They don't seem to know what's going on here either.
- I knew it. - What should we do?
Let's offer our support.
But they...
In this situation, we can't be hostile to each other anymore.
- Is that clear? - Yes.
- It looks like he's not here either. - No, he's not here.
I'm sorry, Sonoko. Maybe I just imagined it.
Hey! Look outside! There's something going on!
- Get out of the way! - Let us see, too!
- That's... - What's going on?
I can't see the wires in this darkness!
And it's almost disarmed!
At the crucial moment, I can't see a thing!
If I sit here, I can go back to the organization...
Are they going to take the whole gondola?
Who's...?
Engine under control.
2-0 to go.
I'll keep it up, okay?
The investigator of the ÖS! That is...
It was Curaçao who jumped off!
Shit!
Hello, wake up!
Wake up!
I can't do it with this rifle.
But it must have a weak point.
Damn it!
At this range... impossible.
All right, let's get out of here. Let's get out of here.
- Let's go! - Towards eight o'clock
there's movement on the Ferris wheel.
Did the PS guy pile out?
- Check the gondola with infrared! - Yes!
D... that shape... that's a man!
And there's a kid too!
- Brother! Curaçao is not in it! - What?
Curaçao...
Drop the gondola.
Ve... got it!
Hey, hey!
That's not true?!
Gin! What are you doing?
Curaçao is gone.
Change of plans: Curaçao is eliminated.
How impatient.
She must not have betrayed us.
Would there be any other reason for her to leave the gondola?
Find Curaçao, now!
- Understood. - Chianti!
- Fly away from the Ferris wheel. - Yes!
Grain! Get the IDWS ready!
Got it.
Oh, no...?!
What is it?
Do you want to take me back to them?
To "them"? You mean the organization?
Her memory's back, all right.
Are you Sherry,
the one who betrayed the organization?
Come on, let's get out of here. It's too dangerous here.
Leave? What do you mean, get out? Stop with the bad jokes!
Gin's here.
Surely you know what that means.
But why did you let me...
I don't know. I don't know why I saved you.
But I'm Curaçao, which can take on any color.
And the present me feels better than the old me.
That's all!
Now let's go, Sherry-chan.
Wait!
The kids are still in the gondola!
We have to get them out of there!
I don't know what happened, but...
I don't know what happened, but this... I can make out the wires and the detonator.
Concentrate!
Careful, don't rush.
And yet fast!
Hello!
Hello! Come to!
Shit!
Not yet?
Haven't you found Curaçao yet?
There are shadows inside the wheel.
Two kids, one adult...
That's not good at all... Brother!
Someone's at the detonator!
What?
Look, here!
The ignition device is inside the hydrant.
Shit.
The security police noticed them?
Now, just these two wires to the detonator...
If I cap this, we're home free.
We did it!
That was a close one.
Douse them, Korn.
With a hail of bullets!
That's what I'm talking about! Finish them off, Korn!
All right!
Wha... what's happening?
Damn it! I gotta do something!
Shit. I've got to hurry!
I can't do it from upstairs...
No way. Everybody's using their cell phones, you can't get a connection.
I wonder if the kids are okay...
Hurry up! Jump!
Run! Run!
Damn it! Damn it! As soon as you move, they shoot!
I can't do anything like that!
They want me.
You want to be a decoy?
Take care of the kids.
Don't! They'll kill you!
Oh! That movement... that silhouette...

That's Curaçao!
Well? The fire is concentrated in one place!
They're targeting someone!
This is my chance!
Die, Curaçao!
Oh no...
Curaçao's signal has disappeared.
Mission accomplished!
No.
Not yet.
The rats aren't done yet.
Aim for the bombs.
A... on the bombs?
Yes. With Curaçao, there would be a danger..,
that she would use the collapse of the wheel to escape.
But you can deal with guys from the ÖS that way.
Grain.
Reload immediately and blow up the wheel axle!
Be ready before the air force gets there.
Roger that. I'll take care of them.
Haibara-san!
Are you all right?
J... Yes...
Ai-chan...
What happened?
I'll explain later. Now you have to be good.
Yes...
Akai-san!
Amuro-san!
I'm here.
Akai-san!
Are you all right?
Yes.
Hide. I can still hear the rotors.
Where's Amuro-san?
I don't know.
But the fact that they attacked directly means..,
he was able to disarm the bombs.
The question remains, how do we...?
Is that gun just for decoration?
Amuro-san!
Don't you have a way to fight back, FBI?
I do, but...
but my night-vision scope is broken.
I can only use this normal spare scope.
I can't shoot the steel night crow with it.
- You could if you saw them? - Yes.
But how...
If I hit the connection point on the rotor....
I didn't see any connection there!
You can't hit it from the front.
If we can blind the guy...
and shine a light on the rotors and the surrounding area for about five seconds...
I could light it up, but...
but until I know what that thing looks like...
Do they want to detonate the explosives?
They want to bring the whole wheel down?
Not good. Half the explosives are still in the wheel axle!
Shoot, shoot, shoot!
Yes.
Damn it!
We know where they're shooting from,
but not where the rotor is!
It's enough if you see the approximate shape?
Okay...
So look closely!
See them!
Go!!!
That light...
Fireworks!
Wha...?!
What the hell is that?!
- Fireworks? - They're shooting at us!
A... but from where?
Fall down.
- Hit? - Good.
Not good. Not good!
We're going to crash!
Grain! Get out of the way!
Damn it!
If the axle breaks, we'll have a disaster!
That's enough. We're getting out of here!
Run!!!
Run! Everyone away from the aquarium now!
Damn it! If it keeps rolling, it'll hit the aquarium....
But who were those guys?
Pah, guys who are about to die anyway don't interest me.
REPTILE HOUSE DOLPHIN SHOW
Go to the dolphin show stage immediately! It's dangerous here!
- The Ferris wheel is... - Ran, we have to escape!
Crap! The slope's speeding it up!
Conan-kun!
Amuro-san!
- Can you stop it? - I don't know. But I have to!
- Amuro-san! - I'm all right! Concentrate!
Let's go!
Make it last!!
Akai-san?!
You have a plan, right?
Well?
Okay... No, not yet?!
- It's not stopping! - Sonoko, run! - Get out of here!
It won't work with this.
There's still a way!
Kudo-kun...
Damn it! I'm not going to make it in time!
Just take it easy.
Akai-san!
What about...
about this?
Ran?
This ball...
Blow yourself up!
Faster!
Bigger!
- Let's go! - Nooooo!!!
No! It's still not stopping!
All of you...
Stop!!!
It stopped, didn't it?
We did it! It's stopped!
I'm sure it was Conan-kun!
A devil boy.
To stop such a huge Ferris wheel...
That crane truck...
Who was it that...
Well done, Conan-kun,
kid.
J... yeah...
Wait. I want to see the body.
Go ahead. But I don't think he's very identifiable.
All right. Thank you very much. You can go.
Well, that's...
Yes.
Boy!
Show me what you picked up.
What do you think it is?
A memory stick?
No.
It's not a memory stick, it's a souvenir.
However, it's completely charred.
Tô ni akirameta no kai?
Have you been resigned to this for a long time?
Kodoku na tabi ni deru no wa
That you are going on a lonely journey,
itsuka hanashiteita daro,

Kurikaesareru fujôri,
absurdities that are repeated over and over again,

an absolutely crazy schedule,

drenched in sweat, totally exhausted,
chiisana kôkai no renzoku.
an endless chain of small regrets.

No matter how close we get to each other,

- Yesterday's bombing of.... - Ah!
I almost did it!
Well! You're a real loser!
You try it next time and do it better.
I'd love to. Just leave it to me.
She said..,
She said she'd save us.
Yes.
Otherwise, she wouldn't have held the pendant until death.
But why do you think she...
Yes! We played Othello with her!
And we gave her a pendant!
She was so happy about it! Wasn't she?
Yes, we all have the same pendant.
- That's mine.
That's mine.
But now she's disappeared.
She got her memories back and went back?
It looked like we were going to be friends...
Yes...
But listen... Don't you think you are friends already?
If you think of her so often and so hard...
Oh yes, that's right!
- You're right! - Yes!
Maybe they were the ones who changed her...
Yes...
They gave her her own color at the very end....
