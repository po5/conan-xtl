Mother!
No, don't come! Run!
A dream?
What? A dream where I'm being shot at with a gun?
Is that why you called so early?
Well, it makes you worry.
Aren't lawyers often hated by people?
You're exaggerating, Ran.
You've witnessed so many crimes..,
that's why you're dreaming.
But luckily you're fine.
By the way, when I saw you in my dream..,
you were younger than you are now.
You're so naughty! I still feel young now!
Well, then I must apologize. Forgive me.
The main thing is that you understand.
See you tonight at seven. Father and Conan-kun are looking forward to it.
Do you think she'll remember?
Conan-kun!?
What's wrong? So early in the morning?
No, it's nothing. I'm sorry I woke you up.
I'm supposed to meet Ran's mother for dinner tonight.
That woman doesn't suit me at all.
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE 14TH TARGET
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran,
I watched men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on what was happening
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He administered a poison to me and when I came to,
my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised to keep my true self a secret.
When Ran asked my name, I said.
Conan Edogawa. To learn more about these men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
That's right. This old man is Ran's father.
And meanwhile he is the master detective Kogoro Môri.
But in truth, he's a jerk. As for who really solves his cases,
I hope you all know.
The secret lies in the two devices that Professor Agasa invented.
First, this one!
ANESTHESIA CHRONOMETER
My anesthesia chronometer!
When you press the button with the visor
a needle shoots out..,
which immediately puts you to sleep.
Next up, the voice transposer in the shape of a fly.
VOICE TRANSPOSER IN THE SHAPE OF A FLY
MICROPHONE SPEAKER
By adjusting the dials
you can create different voice pitches.
My secret weapon are the power-kick-boots.
POWER-KICK-BOOTS
The pressure points on the foot are stimulated
and thus increase my muscle strength.
For the crime hunt I have a skateboard with turbo drive.
SKATEBOARD WITH TURBO DRIVE
And then this great piece: my elastic suspenders!
ELASTIC SUSPENDERS
With the push of a button, they tighten.
An absolutely unique part.
I don't know the identity of the men in black.
I don't have the time. I am small, but my mind is the same!
A master detective for every case. There is always only one truth!
BEIKA PRISON
JÔ MURAKAMI (35), PROFESSIONAL CARD DEALER
KOGORO MÔRI, BEIKA
Genta-kun, are you going to eat that too?
Who cares how much I eat!
- Dark chocolate. The adult ice cream. - Really?
What nonsense. Boy, does he take a long time.
Oh, look! Conan-kun and I are a perfect match!
YOU AND HIM ARE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER!
Is the vending machine broken?
Not necessarily, Genta-kun,
Those horoscopes you get from vending machines are complete nonsense anyway.
Now I'll make one for Conan-kun. The birthday...
Hey, you can't do a horoscope for me!
YOU'RE GETTING CLOSER TO YOUR LOVED ONE ALL OF A SUDDEN!
Yay! That must mean Conan-kun and me!
THERE'S AN "A" IN THE AIR!
There's an A in the air?
A? What century is this game from?
Tell me, what does the A stand for?
A? Well, in short, A comes before B.
They mean fried shrimp!
I see. It doesn't mean the kiss at all.
What?
Sorry, I overslept.
Really! You're late, Professor!
Sorry.
AVIATION MUSEUM TO
- Wow! - So many different airplanes!
There's supposed to be a helicopter simulator here, too.
- That sounds fun. - Yes!
- I'm sorry to disappoint you. - Why is that, Conan?
It says here that you can't fly a helicopter...
until the fifth grade, it says here.
What? That's stupid.
You poor things. When I was in fifth grade, I spent a lot of time there.
Instead, I'm going to tell you an interesting story.

If we don't stop him, there will be a long story.
Leave it to me.
In Greek mythology, there was a horse, Pegasus....
- Tadaa! And here's a quiz! - What's this all of a sudden?
Three people born on New Year's Day, April 1st...
and on the day of the child form a group.
Now, what is this group called?
Here's a hint: like Pegasus, it's an animal that can fly.
An animal that can fly?
Oops, Conan-kun, you know?
Of course. You just have to add up the birthdays.
Birthdays?
1 .1 ., 1 .4., 5.5.
- October 7th? - That's right. The 7th of October.
The reindeer (=tonakai). Ten (=to), seven (=na), group (=kai).
TEN (= TO) SEVEN (= NA) GROUP (= KAI)
At Christmas it flies with the sleigh in the sky.
That is correct! As was to be expected from you, Conan-kun.
Ah! Look! It's Eimei Shishido!
EIMEI SHISHIDO (45), PHOTOGRAPHER
Oh, how cool!
- Thank you very much. - Next, please.
MINORU NISHINA (37), ESSAYIST
MINORU NISHINA (37), ESSAYIST - There you go.
Thank you very much. I'm a big fan of yours.
Please keep writing such delicious books!
"Delicious book" is what I like. Thank you.
He looks much better in real life than in the photos!
- This guy is right up my alley. - For real, Sonoko.
- What a thuggish way to drive! - Isn't that...
NANA OSANAI (21), PHOTO MODEL.
It's really the model Nana Osanai!
Women don't interest me. Let's go to the cafe.
- What time is the dinner with your mother? - At seven.
- You set it up again, didn't you? - Yes, I did.
You're trying hard.
Ten years ago, right, your mother moved out?
Yeah. That was when I was seven.
They had a big fight.
I guess they separated because they were too different.
And it was only shortly after that, wasn't it,
that your mother began her glorious career as a lawyer?
And in contrast, your father quit the police force...
- and opened an unsuccessful detective agency. - What?
Exactly. He suddenly became a famous detective..,
but if you hadn't been there, he would have ruined himself.
I don't think so...
...but my mother was even more determined.
- I'm back! - Welcome back!
Oops. Uncle, you're not dressed yet?
He's been at mahjongg since noon and just got back.
Really. Why do I have to have dinner with Eri?
Stop complaining. Get ready!
Today, Aqua Crystal Resort Island opens in To To Bay..,
whose owner, Katsuyoshi Asahi, we now hope will be our home,
KATSUYOSHI ASAHI (61), OWNER OF AQUA CRYSTAL
- to learn more about it. KATSUYOSHI ASAHI (61)
- Conan-kun. - Eh? I'm going to change!
LE FLEUR, FRENCH RESTAURANT
Mother, I'm sorry. We're running a little late.
It's okay. Someone must have been playing mahjong
playing mahjong late again.
She's very perceptive, as always.
I can't say anything wrong in front of her.
- Good evening, Conan-kun. Good evening.
Tsuji-san, you really are a carefree person.
- Yes, I am. - Oh, long time no see, Môri-san.
Oh, hello, Tsuji-san!
- Who is this Môri? - Well, that detective!
HIROKI TSUJI (36), PROFESSIONAL GOLFER
- What? The master detective? - Kogoro Môri?
Yes, I'm Detective Kogoro Môri.
Ah, Tsuji-san, may I introduce my family to you?
This is my wife Eri, my daughter Ran, and our freeloader Conan.
Freeloader? Can't he say it any other way?
My name is Tsuji. I know Môri-san from professional amateur golf.
By the way, Tsuji-san, isn't the U.S. Open starting next Thursday?
Yes, I've been training for this championship for a year, you can say.
This year I'm going to make it into the top ten!
- We're counting on you! - But every now and then you need a break.
Tomorrow I was going to take the ladies for a spin.
Tsuji-san has his own helicopter and can fly too.
That's right. I also want to fly next Sunday.
I invite you to join me.
What? Really?
- That sounds wonderful. - Hooray!
I'm having trouble flying. Thank you very much, maybe some other time.
Oh yes, that's too bad.
Ts. How boring.
This is Sawaki-san. My parents knew him
from when they were young.

- What does this grape brooch mean? - This is the sign of a sommelier.
Sommelier is the name of someone like Sawaki-san,
KÔHEI SAWAKI (36), SOMMELIER
who is an expert in the wine field.
And what does he have hanging around his neck?
It's called a Taste-Vin and it's used to taste the wine.
Oh, you know your stuff.
It was in Nishino-san's book. Red wine is drunk at room temperature,
white wine and rosé slightly chilled.
It's true that many people say that.
But you can adjust the temperature to your own taste.
- It is good that way. - Light reds also taste good chilled.
The important thing is that chilling softens the acidity in the wine.
- I see. - Hard to believe that Ran
is already at the age to be interested in it.
You can tell by that that we've both really gotten older.
Yes, that's true.
They seem to be starting to get along well.
But Conan-kun, what do you look like?!
- No, it's okay. - Now come on, hold still.
THERE'S AN "A" IN THE AIR!
There's an A in the air?
Really, kids are so annoying.
Oh, man.
That was delicious.
The wine and food here are just as good as they were back then.
Say, remember?
Fifteen years ago, when we first came here..,
you gave me a present.
Yes, the Zigoba chocolate you like so much.
We ate it on a bench in Beika Park.
Yes, that's how it was.
Oh! Towako-san!
Ah! Who is that man there?
Isn't that Peter Ford? He's often on TV as an anchorman.
TOWAKO OKANO (32), BAR OWNER PETER FORD (40), HOST
Damn. Why is she with someone like that...
Who the hell is this Towako-san?
She runs a bar on Ginza.
Oh yeah, she's always so good to me.
I'm going to apologize now.
There's still time. Let's have coffee at home.
Forgive me. I have work to do. Thank you for the food.
Mother! Mother!
Father!
Ah! Now Towako-san is out of sight!
The old man is beyond help.
ONE WEEK LATER
MIDORI DAI POLICE HOSPITAL
Please!
JÛZÔ MEGURE
Thirteen megures?
That's what Jûzô reads.
- I see. - How embarrassing, Genta-kun.
Uh? Inspector Megure's first name is Jûzô.
Oh, Môri-kun. Did you come all this way? And the rest of you, too.
We were just about to go hiking together.
Inspector, are you badly injured?
The arrow didn't hit any vital points. His life is not in danger.
- But he must stay in the hospital. - Tell me, Inspector,
why do you always have your hat on?
Well, it doesn't matter.
- He must have hardly any hair. - Or he's got a big bump on his head.
A handgun was used, probably a crossbow.
Did the perpetrator know the inspector.
or did he shoot at a passing policeman for fun?
We're investigating the case both ways.
Hey, tell me, Inspector, you do have a gun, don't you?
And yet he was able to escape?
Like carrying guns while jogging.
And even if I had one,
I'm not as good at shooting as Môri-kun.
What? My father was good at shooting?
He was one of the best shooters in the whole police department.
Hey, everyone really does have their strengths.
By the way, we found something strange at the suspected shooting site.
And it's this.
- What is it? - It looks like a sword.
Eh? I've seen it somewhere before.
Where was it?
KISAKI LAW OFFICE
- Good morning. - Morning.
A fancy brooch.
Sensei, this is the plan for today.
Also, this was in the mailbox downstairs.
Oh, from Zigoba.
That's your favorite Swiss chocolate, isn't it?
So, he sends me some.
But there's no return address on it.
Don't worry. I know who it's from.
Water. What the...
Sensei!
TOTO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
- What about my mother? - Don't worry.
We flushed out her stomach. There is no danger to her life.
- I'm glad. - Are we dealing with a poison?
Yes, we suspect an agricultural pesticide.
Mother! Mother.
- Ran. - Eri.
You came.
Are you okay, Auntie?
You too, Conan-kun. Thank you. I'm fine.
Just in case, we'll keep her here for a day for observation.
Take good care of her.
I can't believe that something happened to Eri after the inspector. Is that a coincidence?
The moment she ate the chocolate, she fell down?

Yes, it was supposedly in the company's mailbox.
It's chocolate from Zigoba! And this paper flower!
But not... the same culprit?
This flower... Where was it? Where did I see it?
HOUSE OF PROFESSOR AGASA
But why does such a level-headed woman like her eat poisoned chocolate?
Well, at dinner the other night, the old man upset
Ran's mother, and she thought that
the chocolate as a way of making amends.
Ah, I see. Here, it's fixed.
Who did that? Who's been up to this kind of mischief?
Professor! Don't open it!
Professor!
- I'm okay. After him, Shin'ichi! - A... but?
- After him! You have to go after him! - Got it.
Where'd he go? To the left, Genta and the others.
Good.
Ah, Conan-kun!
- A black off-road motorcycle? - What's a black Ofroud motorcycle?
That's it! That's an off-road motorcycle! Genta-kun!
- Conan! - Got it! He turned left after all.
Conan-kun, he just turned toward Beika Station.
Got it. I'll take the shortcut!
Yes, there he is!
You can't get away from me! No way!
Are you all right?
Yes, thank you.
This is...
Oh! Got it!
BEIKA CENTRAL HOSPITAL
Cards?
Yes. The perpetrator commits his crimes according to the pictures on the playing cards.
The first victim was Inspector Megure.
JÛZÔ MEGURE
His name is Jûzô. He is spelled like 13, that is, King of Spades.
The king's sword looks like what was found.
Next, the kisaki of Ran-nêchan's mother
KISAKI
means "queen" in English. Hence the queen of spades.
The flower in the lady's hand matches the one on the wrapper.
Indeed! It is the same one.
But what does Professor Agasa have to do with the elf?
The professor's first name is Hiroshi. The shi is
HIROSHI AGASA
as ten and one. Hence the jack of spades.
The jack represents a soldier with a pole weapon.
It is the same. No doubt about it.
But why cards? And then the spade?
The spade symbolizes death. Just as the heart stands for love,
the diamond for money and the cross for happiness.
So according to the playing cards, the culprit wants,
the perpetrator wants to kill people with a number in their name in order
from 13 to 1?
In addition, they all have to do with you.
But who on earth...?
The license plate that was our only lead was stolen.
- Inspector!? - What are you doing here?
I heard that after Eri-san, Professor Agasa was also attacked.
But your wound is still...
The wound has been stitched. Don't worry.
I've been told everything. The culprit is probably Jô Murakami.
Jô Murakami.
- Who is he? - He's a dealer in card games.
Ten years ago he committed a murder.
and was paroled last week.
What is a card game dealer?
Someone who deals the cards in a card game of chance.
That's Jô Murakami ten years ago.
Murakami, that is.
In fact, he might have a grudge against me.
- Why? - Because I arrested him.
So what? It's normal for a policeman to arrest criminals.
- That's true, but... - I've heard about this case too.
When he was taken to the Inspectorate, he...
Shiratori-kun, let's drop this story.
But why doesn't Jô Murakami attack me first?
- If he has a grudge against me, let him directly... - He does that to torture you.
It's like slowly squeezing your throat.
Uncle, is there anyone among your acquaintances with a ten in his name?
That could be the one who becomes the next target.
Ten? Ten? Ah!
Towako-san!
CLUB TOWAKO
Welcome!
Oh, Môri-sensei.
Towako-san! You are unharmed!
Unharmed? Did something happen?
Excuse me, what were you going to say at the hospital earlier?
You know, something about a Murakami.
Well, since you can find out anyway, I might as well say it.
An older colleague told me about it.
Ten years ago, when Môri-san was still a policeman,
he and Inspector Megure, or was he a police chief?
Anyway, they arrested the murderer Murakami together.
They took him to the authorities and recorded the protocol,
when he suddenly wanted to go to the bathroom.
Môri-san and the inspector ordered the officer,
Murakami to the restroom
and positioned themselves in front of the interrogation room.
That's when your mother showed up with you,

to bring Môri-san changing clothes.
At that very moment, it happened.
Murakami had overpowered the policeman
Murakami overpowered the policeman in the restroom and took his gun.
I remember.
I was...
Get me a car!
I'll show this woman the end of hell!
- Mom! - Ran! Don't come!
Môri-kun.
What's wrong? You're so thoughtful.
Oh, no, it's nothing.
Then did Uncle shoot Auntie?
I'd completely forgotten all about it.
I'm sure you didn't want to remember it.
But... but why did my father shoot?
He must have been very sure of his abilities.
He could only shoot past the hostage at the perpetrator.
But the bullet hit your mother.
The fact that he shot without considering the hostage
became a problem for the police.
Shortly after, your father resigned from the police force.
- Hello? - Hello Ran, it's been a long time.
Shin'ichi?
Professor Agasa told me everything.
It seems to be very bad.
Bad is no word at all!
Where are you? Please come home!
I'm sorry. All these cases here will keep me here for a while.
- There. - Don't be so sad.
The Professor and Inspector Megure are keeping me informed.
As soon as I hear anything, I'll let you know.
Tell me, would you shoot?
I know now. Why Mother broke up with Father.
So Kogoro-san...
No matter how confident you are in your abilities...
I can't trust my father anymore.
Shin'ichi, you would never do such a thing, would you?
Well, I don't know.
Just because your father shot your mother..,
doesn't have to be the truth.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Anyway, that's all I can say.
- Keep your head up. See you soon. - Wait up!
Shin'ichi! Shin'ichi!
The truth.
Inspector, I'll cover the emergency exit.
Wait! Môri-kun!
He's full of zeal when it comes to a beauty.
DETECTIVE MORI
In the end, the old man didn't come home.
But why did Jô Murakami leave clues behind,
that point to him as the culprit?
I wonder if he wants to challenge the old man and the police.
But how could he, sitting in prison
how could he find out about his circle of acquaintances?
He even knew Ran's mother's favorite chocolate.
HIROKI TSUJI
Hiroki Tsuji. Tsuji. Ah!
TEN
Hiroki Tsuji? The professional golfer?
Yes, Conan-kun noticed.
There's a ten in that name, too.
Tsuji... Indeed, the ten.
When I called Tsuji-san's house..,
he left for the heliport 30 minutes ago.
Understood. Notify the authorities.
and send a guard detail immediately.
Yes, sir!
Conan-kun. Let's go, too.
Come on, Môri-kun!
Where are you going? For breakfast?
Dad!
Hey, you two! What are you doing here?
What do you mean? We're both involved in this case.
I'm your daughter, after all!
Môri-san's acquaintances are being attacked one by one?
That's right. In addition, one after another down from 13.
That's why you're in danger with the ten.
You should definitely refrain from flying.
I'll be fine. If you're so worried,
how about you and Môri-san flying with me.
What? No, don't fly.
By the way, where are you going today?
To Toto Airport. But I'll make a few detours on the way.
When did you file the flight plan?
Um, the day before yesterday at the airport authority.
There's a risk that Murakami will be waiting for him at Toto Airport.
Good. You're going to Tôto Airport by car.
Yes.
Môri-kun! As a precaution, we'll go with you in the helicopter!
I understand how you feel, but this is the stop!
What? But...!
I understand.
I'll ride in the car with Mr. Shiratori.
- You want to pinch yourself? - No, but I have to go to the bathroom!
Inspector! I don't want to die yet!
- If we're going to die, we're going to die together. - So we're going to die?!
I'll go then.
Conan-kun! Let's also...
Where is he?
It's not...?
A sheep. Two sheep...
Is this an anti-drop spell?
- Conan-kun? When did you...?
I've always wanted to sit in the co-pilot's seat.
Welcome to my cockpit!
We'll be flying over your home, Beika, as well.
Hooray! Yuppie!

Not to be changed. We can't very well fly back.
For this you are quiet, otherwise you fly out!
Everything seems to be all right.
What are you looking for? You're in a helicopter,
you'd better look outside.
- Is something wrong? - Huh? It's nothing.
You took eye drops earlier, didn't you?
Do you always take them?
Yes, when I'm driving or flying the helicopter.
- Soon we'll be over Beika. - Yes, we are!
- Môri-kun, I can see your house! - I don't want to see it!
- Aaaah! - What happened?
- I can't keep my eyes open! - What?
- About the eye drops! - That means...
Uncle, we're going to slide off to the left!
Môri-kun, can you control this thing?
- That's a stupid question! Of course not! - We can't fly like this.
Is there a place to land?
- Teitan Elementary School! Good. - What?
We'll land in the schoolyard. You operate the pedals and levers.
Fool! Don't do that! Are you trying to kill us?
Don't worry. I've been in the simulator since I was a kid.
You're just a kid now.
Tsuji-san, if we don't do something, we're going to crash! Give me a hand!
- Got it. Let's do it. - Do what? Seriously?
Altitude 300 feet, speed 40 knots. Okay.
Let's go.
Altitude 200 feet, speed 30 knots.
Right pedal down ten degrees.
Schoolyard dead ahead! Range 500 feet.
- Genta, can you hear me? Genta! - Conan?
I'm gonna make an emergency helicopter landing. Clear the square!
A helicopter?
Everybody run! A helicopter's about to fall!
We're not gonna fall.
We're rotating left! Right pedal harder!
Damn it! We're not going to make it!
- They've really fallen off. - Is Conan-kun in there?
We're saved!
Conan-kun. Are you all right, Tsuji-san?
The fuel's leaking!
- It exploded. - Aren't helicopters expensive?
The rotor blades alone cost about 10 million yen.
How many rice dishes with eel are there?
BEIKA CENTRAL HOSPITAL
Fortunately, everyone is okay.
HIROSHI AGASA
But Professor, Conan is pretty mean.
Piloting a real helicopter all by himself.
That's not the point! We almost died!
Speaking of which, Tsuji-san's vitamin eye drops...
have been replaced by a mydrama drug.
Mydratic?
A drug for the medical treatment
for pseudomyopia, which dilates the pupils.
I see. That's why sunlight made him dizzy.
However, Tsuji-san used drops that are used for iritis.
Iritis?
What's the difference?
One is effective in five minutes.
and the regression is also fast.
The remedy for iritis works only after -zig minutes. The regression
- also takes a long time. - A lot of time? How much time?
Different, but between ten and 14 days
the pupils remain dilated.
That long?!
And what about the U.S. Open, which starts soon?
He'll have to cancel.
When did the criminal replace the drops?
That's an important point.
Tsuji-san took the eye drops in the car..,
he took the eye drops in the car.
Shortly after, he heard glass shattering.
He put the drops on the center console
and returned to the house.
Someone had thrown a rock, and the window glass shattered.
A rock? Just like Professor Agasa's!
However, Tsuji-san thought it was a child's prank,
left it to the maid and went away.
The one who threw the stone was undoubtedly the culprit.
The eye drops were exchanged when Tsuji-san returned to the house.
had returned to the house.
Yes, probably.
Inspector.
The culprit is undoubtedly Jô Murakami.
We found this.
The ten of spades.
Môri-kun! Next is the nine.
Who among your acquaintances has the nine in their name?
- I can't think of anyone. The eight, yes. - Eight?
The sommelier Sawaki-san. His first name is Kôhei.
KÔHEI SAWAKI
EIGHT
The upper part of Kô is an eight.
Good. Let's go see this Sawaki-san.
So this so-called Murakami
wants to take revenge on Môri-san
and is attacking his acquaintances one by one.
Yes.
You're surprisingly calm for that, Môri-san.
Well, I am the number five.
It's still a while until I'm the target.
Hmm, this is wine.
This is called a wine cooler.
The wine is stored there at the right temperature.

There are a lot of bottles in there.
Sawaki-san's parents have a fruit farm in Yamanashi.
They store several hundred bottles in their wine cellar.
Isn't that how it was?
Yes, they are for my own store that I want to open later.
I have a weakness for wine, may I have a closer look at them?
Yes, please.
Ow. The floor is damaged.
Are you all right? I dropped a bottle there.
Conan-kun, you're not wearing slippers. Please be careful.
Margaux, Lafite, Haut Brion...
They're all just fine wines.
That reminds me, what's it called?
Your precious treasure? The Pet..., Pet...
- You also have a Château Petrus? - Château Petrus?
Poirot drank it in Death on the Nile.
I had a bottle, but I finished it the other day.
Didn't you say it would be years before it was ready to drink?
- Yes, but I couldn't wait any longer. - Sawaki-san,
let's talk about wine another time.
Please tell us what your plans are for today.
Are you familiar with Katsuyoshi Asahi-san?
He runs several restaurants in Tokyo and is a businessman.
I met Asahi-san once when I got an order from him.
He's opening Aqua Crystal, a recreational island
in Tokyo Bay.
Yes, he wants to entrust me with one of the restaurants there.
That's why I'm meeting him at three.
Katsuyoshi Asahi.
- Asahi? - Wait a minute!
The nine! There's a nine in there!
That means the next target is Asahi-san.
But I should just find his pet cat for him.
Otherwise, I don't know him anymore.
It may be that Murakami doesn't think that way.
In any case, in addition to protecting Sawaki-san...
we should meet with Asahi-san. Can we do that, Sawaki-san?
Yes, I don't mind.
- Well, Ran-kun and Conan-kun... - We'll go with you.
Conan-kun and I are coming with you!
Give me a break, Ran! This isn't a game!
That's right! A lot of people are being attacked because of you.
How am I supposed to wait at home?
Ran.
This is the Aqua Crystal?
- Incredible. - A magnificent building.
How rude!
But a little off. Well, it's okay.
Hey, that's dangerous, miss!
- What? - Really.
Hello, Nana-chan. You're here too?
Oh, Shishido-sensei. Asahi-san asked you here too?
Excuse me, miss, but who are you?
What? You don't know me?
This is Nana Osanai-san. A famous model.
The three there are, starting from the left,
the writer Nishina-san,
photographer Eimei Shishido-san and...
Peter Ford. And they're both police, right?
And you must be the master detective Kogoro Môri.
What? You're this famous master detective?
Oh, I'm seeing the real one for the first time! Shishido-sensei, photo, photo!
Weren't you mad at her until recently?
This is sommelier Kôhei Sawaki-san
and Môri-san's daughter Ran-san. And Conan Edogawa-kun.
You're the girl who wished for more delicious books.
What? You remember me?
Wine and women stay in the heart when they are beautiful.
Yeah, sure.
You were all asked here by Asahi-san?
- To three o'clock. - Me too. Three o'clock.
Me too.
Inspector, is there any incident?
Yes, to be honest...
It's almost 3:00. Come on, hurry up.
Right. Let's go to the restaurant for now.
These four who have gathered here...
Is the only way to get to Aqua Crystal is by this monorail?
AQUA CRYSTAL
- Oops? There's no driver. - I guess you just have to push the button.
START
This is really impressive.
Well... Nishina-san, do you also have problems with floating things?
No, I'm afraid of water. I can't swim.
Oh, so everyone has their fears.
The fact that your father shot your mother..,
doesn't have to be the truth.
It's like being in an aquarium! Literally an underwater restaurant.
Ah! That's a Ferrari F40. How did they get it here?
Asahi-san is nowhere to be seen.
That's strange. He invited guests.
Maybe Murakami has already...
What do you mean? Maybe Murakami already has him?
Oh, that's right. We'll have to talk about it.
- Inspector, I'm going to take a look around. - I'll go with you.
Thank you, sir. As a precaution, please sit with your back to the wall.
So here is the emergency exit.
WEINKELLER

Only here is locked.
Ah, I see. That's how it is.
It's all right.
Hmm, if that's so, I could be the Six.
- Why? - In the sign Shishi there is the six.
SHISHIDO SIX
Yeah, right!
The other three also have numbers in them.
- What? - Look. Nana-san has seven,
NANA - SEVEN
NISHINA
Nishina-san has two, Ford-san has the English four, Four, in it.
FORD - FOUR
I see. If we still have Three and One, we have all the numbers together.
Three is present. Right in front of you.
- What? Not possible!? - My name is Ninzaburô Shiratori.
NINZABURÔ SHIRATORI
- Ninzaburô? - But one is really missing.
- Shin'ichi. - Huh?
Target number one could be Shin'ichi.
Is Kudô-kun on his way here?
I don't think so, but I have a feeling.
It's true. If I hadn't shrunk,
I would have been interested in this case and come along.
So the one actually means me?
Just to be sure, do you have anything to do with Murakami?
Of course not! Not with someone like that.
- Neither do I. - But I am.
Before I became an essayist, I was a crime reporter.
I reported on the Murakami case.
I know him, too.
I photographed Jô Murakami for the coffee-table book Portrait of a Murderer.
- Did anything happen then? - No, nothing.
Nana-san, is something wrong?
He was released eight days ago, wasn't he?
Yes.
Then it has nothing to do with this.
What is it? Everyone, don't be so serious. Let's change the subject.
You there! You're the one who wrote
that lousy book "Restaurants in Paris".
The restaurants recommended in it were all inedible!
- Can you even taste? - You're impudent!
- Of course I can taste! - Then prove it.
- Prove it? - This is a gift for Asahi-san.
Can you guess what kind of wine it is?
Blind taste, then. Very well.
That elegant scent of violets. The velvety feeling on the tongue.
It's the Chambertin beloved by the French Emperor Napoléon.
Fooled me. As if I would buy such an expensive wine
- as a souvenir. - Well then...
- You are a sommelier, aren't you? - Yes.
Give this imposter the right answer.
This is a Beaujolais Moulin à Vent.
- Absolutely right! - What? This is a Beaujolais?
When you age a high quality Beaujolais for a long time,
you get the flavor and aroma of a premium Bourgogne.
Now you get it, right?
You should drop your moniker as a gourmet essayist.
Now I'm kind of in the mood for wine.
Well, let's all have a glass. I'll get something.
- A beer for me. Where's the kitchen? - That way.
Right. Show me the way, Bürschchen.
Yeah. Who's a lad here?
Ah, lots of them. Rejoice, laddie, there's juice too.
There is? That's great! Stop it with that little brat.
- Here, Ran-nêchan. - Oh, thank you.
Oops.
It's really delicious. Like Sawaki-san said.
- Sawaki-san, would you like some more? - No thanks, I'll have mineral water.
- Thank you. - Uncle, don't you drink beer?
Of course! You never know when Murakami will strike.
Inspector. Here you go.
Conan-kun, here, you can have mine.
It's okay. I'll get another one.
Hey, don't run around so much!
There's mineral water in the bottom drawer of the fridge.
Ah, thanks. I found a rare spice I had to try.
- Your juice is up here? - Yes.
Asahi-san is pretty late. Where the hell is he?
What? What's wrong?
- I'm kidding. - I'm serious.
Ford-san! This is not the time for bad jokes.
By the way, what's the reason for your invitation today?
His secretary called me.
He said Asahi-san is a fan of mine and wants to meet me.
He probably wants me to promote this institution.
I received exactly the same call from the secretariat.
I even got a gift.
Look. This nail polish. It's from France and it's really expensive!
Was it the same for you, Nishina-san?
- Yes, the same. - What are you doing, Nana-chan?
I drew something on the cork. Cute, huh?
What's that supposed to be? A badger?
Really, Sensei. How mean. It's a cat!

Sawaki-san, this is for you. He was lying on the floor.
Kôhei Sawaki-sama. Since I might be late,
I ask you to take any wine from the wine cellar, shelf M 18,
and offer it to the guests.
The key is next to the cash register.
Thank you. Katsuyoshi Asahi.
When I picked up the juice earlier, was there a note like that lying around?
- I'd like to see the wine cellar. - Me too.
I'd like to know what wines he has here.
Then let's go there together.
- Oh, that's...! - A magnificent sight!
- It's cool. - No, it's even a little too warm.
A temperature of 10 - 14 degrees
is ideal for storing wine.
However, it is 17 degrees. That's too high.
Oh, inspector, look. All just precious wines!
Romanée Conti, La Tâche, Le Pin,
Côte-Rôtie, Clos du Mesnil. Unbelievable!
Shelf M18...?
In the back! Watch out!
It was a trap! Uncle! Inspector!
The same arrow that hit me!
Inspector! The crossbow is placed here.
A picacht. Then Murakami planted it.
and the letter is from him, too.
Why does Murakami skip the nine and attack Sawaki-san?
Could it be?
Inspector, we should leave this building.
Oops? They're closed. Wasn't the entrance here?
- Yes, the entrance is here. - May I get my coat?
Please do.
- Asahi-san! - The nine of spades. He actually...
The door is electronically locked and can't be opened.
I beg your pardon? I'll call for backup. I'll call for backup. Shit. No network.
NO NET
It's dead! Damn it!
Inspector! I'll check the emergency exit!
What? The door is blocked with cement.
It's your fault! You're the reason bystanders are being dragged in!
Exactly! What are you going to do?
The fact that Murakami kept the order means..,
that you, Nana-chan, are the next target.
Stop it.
Why would someone I don't even know attack me?
But you're worried about something, aren't you? Well, earlier...
He was released eight days ago, wasn't he?
I told you, it has nothing to do with this.
Whether it's relevant is for us to judge. Please tell us about it.
Three months ago...
...that's what I heard. Ah!
There was no collision, but I got scared and fled.
What kind of motorcycle was it? Was it an off-road?
No, a normal one.
Inspector, as Nana-san said, it has nothing to do with the case.
We should get out of here.
Yes. Let's search the building. Maybe we can find a way out.
We should split up and search together.
I don't think there's any other way.
Listen up. Ran and Conan, you stay here.
Nana-san, you stay here too.
Yes.
They're taking a long time.
Don't you think they'll find a way out?
Don't worry. They'll find one and come right back.
I'll go look, too.
I told you to stay here!
I mean it. You're too curious!
Yeah, but...
Power failure?
What happened? Why are the lights out?
Fluorescent paint!
- Help! - Don't move, Nana-san!
The power outage is on purpose?
What, what happened?
- What, what was that scream? - Inspector!
- Môri-kun, the power supply! - Yes.
Nana-san?
Here it is.
Nana-san?
- Oh no! - Nana-san!
Get away!
- She's dead. - The Seven of Spades and the Joker?!
It's Murakami. He's somewhere in this building!
Damn it! I'm looking for him!
Môri-san! It's too dangerous to go alone! I'll go with you!
Shishido-san. Please refrain from taking pictures.
Why? Since no one will be around for a while,
you'll have to do the autopsy.
Therefore, isn't it advisable to photograph the crime scene beforehand?
That is true.
Good. You'll deliver the pictures to the police later.
Of course.
But how could Murakami aim so accurately in the dark?
It's luminous paint. Nana-san's fingernails glowed.
What?
The nail polish that was sent to her..,
was mixed with glow-in-the-dark paint.
The nail of the middle finger!
Look, inspector, that one nail is weird.
The nail polish is off. No, the nail is broken off.
I guess the wrong nail came off.
- Wrong nail? - It's not your own.
There are all kinds of designs
and you glue them on your own.
Hmm, so for some reason it fell off.
Here it is.
It doesn't seem to be part of the case.

I see.
An impression of the left hand.
It must have been gripped very strongly.
That means the perpetrator is right-handed!?
Wasn't Murakami...
Left-handed?!
Murakami didn't kill Nana-san!
Wait a minute, didn't the perpetrator...
Think! Think!
It was the right hand!
Oh, no!
I was way off!
Inspector! Nothing. Murakami is nowhere to be found.
Maybe he's already escaped from here?
That can't be. There's no way out!
He must be hiding somewhere.
No, the culprit is not Murakami.
It's one of us.
Who? Who killed Nana-san...?
Eight yes, the culprit knocked over...
...tipped over the can that was on the floor.
The contents spilled out.
When I put it down,
more than half of it was still inside.
If he kicked the can,
the juice spilled out and left stains.
On the perpetrator's pants.
Nana-san's killer is one of the four.
Him?! But why?
I'm sorry, Sawaki-san.
Through my fault, Asahi-san was killed
and can no longer leave his business to you.
No problem, I was going to refuse anyway.
In fact, I'm going to quit my job...
and return to my parents.
I am an only child
and I have to take care of my parents.
Anyway, we shouldn't move away much.
- Especially you, Shishido-san. - Yes, I know.
The next target is me, right?
I'll make sure I don't get killed.
Inspector, there's no way I'm going to die!
I'm going to get out of here alive!
Wait a minute, can it be that he...
What are you doing?
I thought you might all be thirsty.
Fool! You shouldn't be wandering around by yourself!
We don't know where Murakami is hiding.
But there's no number in my name.
- Really. - Here.
Here you go, Sawaki-san.
- Thank you. - Hey, kid, give me some!
Yes!
Japanese water is really delicious.
Hmm, delicious.
There's no doubt about it.
But I have no proof.
Or do I? Where did he go?
There it is! The proof!
- What was that? - There was an explosion somewhere.
Shiratori-kun! Shishido-san! Protect him!
Yes! Shishido-san? Where are you, Shishido-san?
- I'm here. - Turn off the light!
Do you want to die?
I'm Two. I have a little time left.
Sawaki-san, are you hurt?
No.
- Do you think he'll attack me again? - Well...
Thank God, the emergency light!
What now?
Help! I can't swim!
Hang on!
Hey, boy, you're still alive.
Oops! Ran! Where's Ran?
Oh, about...
Hey Conan, where are you going?
Ran, where are you?
Ran, it's okay.
Calm down.
Shin'ichi.
Conan-kun!
I can't do it. That's right.
My elastic suspenders!
Oh, no! My foot's stuck! Damn it.
I can't breathe...
Hey! Ran! Run!
Damn it!
I did it! Hurry up!
Hey Ran! Ran! Get a hold of yourself!
Va... Father.
You should thank Conan.
Thank you, Conan-kun.
Uh? Well...
What's wrong?
The wound seems to have opened up.
- What?
The six of spades to the two of spades.
Damn! Is he trying to kill us all at once?
It's a joke!
But this way he succeeds.
There is no exit!
- There is an exit! - What?
The window glass that shattered!
Of course! So we can swim out into the sea.
Impossible. I can't go on.
There will be no weakening! I'll take you with me!
All right, I'll take the boy.
I can manage on my own.
I'll take you. Can you manage a little longer?
- You're coming with me. - Thanks.
Then I'll take the lead. Let's go!
Let's go! Take a deep breath!
Hold on tight and don't let go!
Yes.
Take my hand!
- Take care of Ran! - Yes.
We're saved, aren't we?
Yes, everything's fine again.
Nishina! Nishina!
Pull yourself together!
I'll give him artificial respiration.
I'm trained in first aid.
Please wait. Mr. Shiratori, perform
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Huh? I didn't do anything...
Hurry up! Shiratori!
Got it.
That's strange.
Môri-kun?
Inspector, in this crime spree.
Murakami isn't the culprit.
What?
Because the perpetrator who shot Professor Agasa...
and who killed Nana-san..,
is a right-handed man.

A right-hander?
You are saved.
The perpetrator probably
Murakami, who was released from prison.
and learned that I once shot him,
that he used to be a card dealer.
and that he has the nickname Joker.
He took advantage of that.
- Used it? - Yes. The killer noticed
that in the names of his murder candidates
and in his own
and in his own.
So he combined these numbers and the playing cards,
to disguise his own crime
and pin it on Murakami.
Then he attacked Eri, Professor Agasa
and me,
to make it look like
revenge?
Exactly.
Then who did the perpetrator really want to kill?
Asahi-san and Nana-san. Those two.
And Tsuji-san. In his case.
he replaced the eye drops,
which probably would have resulted in death.
So I'm pretty sure.
Ah, Môri-kun, who is the culprit?
The culprit is among us!
What?
That reminds me, Nana-chan made a fool of you.
No, it wasn't me!
Yes, you should become a murder victim yourself.
The perpetrator destroyed the underwater restaurant
in the hope that you would drown.
By the way, Mr. Shiratori,
when you were supposed to breathe on Nishina-san,
what did you do first?
What did I do?
Tilt your head back, lift your neck..,
made sure the airway was clear.
If you don't make sure the airway is clear,
close your nose and mouth, and just pretend..,
what happens then?
Then he will die, of course!
It's not like...
Exactly! He killed Asahi-san and Nana-san.
and tried to kill Tsuji-san and Nishina-san.
The murderer is you,
Kôhei Sawaki-san!
Môri-san, I was also shot at by the crossbow!
You placed it yourself beforehand.
Last night, after you were here
after you killed Asahi-san here at the Aqua Crystal.
He dropped the letter under the table?
And the secretary who called us?
That was all Sawaki-san. Of course
he was the one who sent Nana-san...
the nail polish.
And the motive? What is the motive?
Probably it has something to do with taste disorder.
Taste disorder?
When you can't taste food and drink anymore, right?
Yes, Sawaki-san suffers from a taste disorder.
A taste disorder is caused by psychological stress...
or a head trauma, so they say.
Head trauma? Meaning,
Sawaki-san was involved in Nana-san's traffic accident?
Wait a minute,
You're talking about taste disorder,
but he recognized Nana-san's wine, didn't he?
He guessed the name of the wine
from its color and smell.
- That's possible? - Sawaki-san,
relying only on his eyes and nose,
thus continued his work as a sommelier.
But this did not correspond to his desire or pride,
to be a perfect sommelier.
Therefore, Sawaki-san,
to give up his work and return home.
Before doing so, however, he wanted to work on everyone including Nana-san,
who were to blame for his taste disorder,
including Nana-san.
It must have tormented him quite a bit.
So much so, that he had to take his precious wine,
he had saved for his restaurant opening
for his restaurant opening, and threw it on the floor.
So that's where the damage to his floor came from?
But how could you find out such details?
Well, because he had tasted spices.
The one he had tasted was chili powder.
So a very hot spice.
Someone who depends on his sense of taste,
would not put something so hot in his mouth.
That he suffers from taste disorder,
I checked with the mineral water
which I handed out to Conan.
The mineral water?
The glass Conan gave you
also had salt in it.
And I drank it without noticing.
It is true that I suffer from a taste disorder.
But that alone is not proof
that I killed Nana-san.
There is one proof.
In your jacket pocket. Left or right.
The cork that Nana-san scribbled on!
Nana-san was holding that cork in her hand...
Nana-san was holding that cork in her hand.
How did it get into your pocket?
When you grabbed Nana-san from behind and stabbed her,
she turned around, clung to you...
and dropped the cork into your pocket.
The false fingernail
must have fallen off at that moment.

That you as a sommelier
by a wine cork is very ironic,
is very ironic. And one more thing.
There is probably another card in your pocket.
there is another card.
Namely, the missing picture,
the ace of spades!
The card for Shin'ichi Kudô.
The ace of spades!
Môri-san.
Everything is as you described.
Three months ago, when I was on my way home,
there was almost a collision and I fell.
Then I noticed that I couldn't taste anything.
The doctor said stress could be the trigger.
In despair, I realized
that I could no longer be a sommelier.
The accident causer Nana Osanai,
the stress-causers Asahi, Tsuji, Nishina...
I decided to take revenge on them.
But what did Asahi-san and the others do to you?
Asahi wanted to take advantage of the wine boom...
and used his fortune to buy
to buy valuable foreign wines.
But the storage is miserable.
Nishina. You act like a gourmet.
You pretend to be all-knowing in your book
and inoculate the readers with false wine knowledge!
And then Hiroki Tsuji!
He trampled on my dignity as a sommelier.
Four months ago
I attended a party at his house.
Oh, there he is!
As a sommelier badge, that's okay, right?
And the Taste-Vin.
Oh, I like that!
You tried to kill Tsuji-san over a thing like that?
Such a thing?
You can't understand my feelings at all.
For me, it was a calling:
the dignity of a sommelier, prestige and pride.
All of which that man trampled underfoot with his filthy feet!
Did you kill Jô Murakami?
Yes.
When Murakami was released from prison,
I happened to meet him in front of Môri's office.
The day the old man was at mahjongg.
I thought about using Murakami,
and introduced myself as Môri-san's acquaintance.
At the time of his crime
Murakami hated Môri-san.
But now he wanted to apologize
and came to visit him.
That's when I got the idea to use the playing cards...
and frame him for the crime.
Killing the drunken Murakami
was easy.
So you didn't have any hatred for Môri-san
and the inspector?
That's right.
Why did you call me and Shishido-san?
To have the missing numbers four and six?
That's right.
Five and three, Môri-san and Shiratori-san,
would surely come along like this when I tell them
that I'm meeting with Asahi-san.
Actually, I had hoped
that Shin'ichi Kudô would also be there.
Unfortunately, that didn't work out.
Didn't you ever think that innocent people might die?
might die?
I only destroyed the underwater restaurant..,
...was to kill Nishina.
I didn't care what happened to the others.
This place will collapse,
Murakami is untraceable and the case should remain unsolved.
The place is going to collapse?
Sawaki-san.
There is no escape route anymore. Give up.
Shiratori! Arrest Sawaki-san immediately!
What?
What's wrong?
Oh no!
Come with me!
Damn it!
Huh? Why is Sawaki-san holding Ran?
What are you talking about?
You're the one who exposed his crime!
What? Me?
Don't move! One step and she dies!
Damn it. Ran is too exhausted to use karate.
Because of the explosion earlier, the building
the building is losing its balance.
- Ran! Where are you, Ran! - There they are!
Where's he going?
- He's going to escape in the helicopter! - What?
To escape from here,
he must have ordered one.
- I won't let him! - Hey!
Môri-kun! Leave the rest to us! Oh, Conan-kun!
You have to get out of here right now!
- I can't swim! - Don't worry.
I'll get you safely to shore with a piece of wood.
- Let's go, Shiratori-kun! - Let's go, Shiratori-kun!
- Where to? - Up the stairs!
The elevator it is.
Môri-kun, the other one!
Faster! Faster! Faster!
Inspector, how good is Shiratori at shooting?
As good as me, so not great.
What's going on here?
What are you doing? Land the fuck up!
Who's that? Why does he have a knife in his hand?
Damn it, why doesn't this elevator go up to the roof?
Get down here right now! I ordered you!
Emergency! Emergency alert!
On the Aqua Crystal, a man with a knife
has taken a girl hostage.
The building is collapsing. Request assistance!
Ran!

Don't come any closer!
Or the girl will die!
Stop it, Sawaki-san!
Let go of Ran-san! Or I'll shoot!
How funny!
If you can shoot, then shoot!
His hand is shaking. He'll only hit Ran like that!
Shiratori-kun, let it go.
Ah, Inspector, are you all right?
It's useless to try to escape with the helicopter.
Let go of Ran-kun!
Shut up! I'll take her and go kill Tsuji!
Tsuji-san? He can't compete in the U.S. Open.
Isn't that enough?
No. I'll kill him and then myself.
She'll be my escort.
Sa... sawaki-san?
Shin'ichi.
Help me, Shin'ichi!
If he takes Ran with him,
she will be killed!
Damn it!
We'll all be dead before we can help Ran.
- Throw me the gun! - What?
I'm gonna stab her!
Hey, Shiratori,
- give me the gun! - What?
I said, give it to me!
Are you kidding? I'm not giving it to you.
What are you waiting for? Hurry up!
Got it.
Hey, kid, you bring her to me!
Or do you want the girl to die here?
No, it's too dangerous for a child!
Hey!
Hurry up!
No!
Conan-kun, you can't!
Don't give it to him!
Good boy. Now bring it to me.
Go! Go! Hurry up!
Hurry up, I said!
I see. Now I understand.
That's why the old man...
Shi...
Shin'ichi...
Shit! Hey! Get up!
Hey! Hey!
You look down. In your back
The aching rain stings.
In my memory
Ran!
I saw you praying.
If in this world an umbrella
That was a close call, Ran.
only exists once,
I see.
That's why Môri-san shot back then.
so I'm looking for him
Not to arrest the culprit,
and hand him over to you.
but to save the hostage.
Yes, a hostage with a leg wound
Even if I can't do anything else
is nothing but a millstone to a fleeing perpetrator.
to a fleeing perpetrator.
I can in your place
To save mother!
get wet.
I don't mind.
So that's the truth.
Father!
Please, your grief,
entrust it to me.
Kôhei Sawaki, you are under arrest...
for murder, attempted murder and kidnapping.
Let go of me. Let me die!
I won't let you die! You will
think about the gravity of your crimes!
We escaped by a hair's breadth.
Uncle, your fear of helicopters seems to have gone.
Huh?
Put me down!
Here.
It suddenly went off. I was totally scared.
Really.
Luckily, the bullet only grazed Ran-san's leg.
That could have been really bad.
Sorry about that.
My father taught me to shoot at the shooting range
at the shooting range in our Hawaiian resort,
I can't tell you that.
But Ran had
a painful experience.
Inspector, this is a good opportunity. Have a good rest!
Yes, I will.
Ah! I'll keep the hat on.
Say, do you think Shin'ichi would have shot like you?
Well, if he can shoot as well as I can..,
I'm sure he would have.
I think so, too. Don't you, Shin'ichi?
What's that?
Shin'ichi's card. The ace of spades.
I've been holding it tightly all this time.
Maybe Shin'ichi really was protecting me.
Fool. The ace has me...
AN A IS IN THE AIR
in the air.
That's how it was.
When I wake up from my dream,
which I see over and over again,
I notice that my heartbeat
is accelerated.
Love does not beat
in a regular rhythm.
On the comfortable sofa
I fall asleep again.
As if I were a little girl again
a little girl again,
you caress
lovingly my hair.
For these warm hands I have
always waited for.
Only you
can wrap me so softly
wrap me.
I love you so much.
Only you
can wrap me
so softly
Envelop me.
I love you so much.
With a red heart.
Lovin' you.
With you...
WEEKS LATER
What? You knew the reason why father shot you?
Of course I did. After all, we're married.
Well, isn't it natural for a husband to protect his wife?
But then why did you leave?
That night he found my food inedible and didn't eat it.
Even though my leg hurt so much and I prepared it with gratitude,
that man...

If that's all you can cook, you might as well stay in bed!
That was the real reason for the breakup.
When I think about it, I get angry. Unfeeling tramp!
So that's how it was.
There's no way to reconcile so quickly.
That reminds me. Mother's cooking...
...were absolutely inedible!
