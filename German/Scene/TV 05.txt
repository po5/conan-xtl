Looks like the CIA is active.
Apparently we're being targeted.
But they said it wasn't a problem.
Can we trust this Japanese guy?
Yes.
They call him the Legendary Assassin in Japan.
That's going to be expensive for us, isn't it?
Money can buy anything, huh?
That's right.
I can finally show this guy that there are worse things in the world
there are worse things in the world than dying...
I don't know anything!
I just left the port in a truck.
I wasn't even told where to go.
Again. I want to know who the order is coming from.
How many times? I don't know!
The order came over the phone.
They do call you "Joe the messenger," don't they?
Are you trying to tell me that all it takes is one phone call..,
for a professional like you to take on a dangerous job like this?
I didn't know there was a bomb in that truck!
Damn liar!
I'm high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran
at the amusement park,
I saw men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on it,
that I didn't notice the man behind me.
He was administering a poison to me.
When I awoke...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised me not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked what my name was, I spontaneously said, Conan Edogawa.
In order to track the men in black,
I moved in with Ran, whose father is a detective.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
These are my classmates:
Genta,
Mitsuhiko,
Ayumi.
They have formed a detective group
and made me a member without being asked.
And...
this man is Kogorô Môri.
I don't have to explain them to you, do I?
These gadgets are Professor Agasa's inventions.
Professor Agasa is always developing useful items for me.
The soccer belt.
When you turn the knob on the buckle,
a ball inflates and pops out.
By the way,
the professor is not the only one who knows my true identity.
Ai Haibara.
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She originally once belonged to the men in black.
To escape from them, she swallowed the same poison as I did...
and shrank as well.
So we, including Ai, who now lives with the professor,
began our lives as elementary school students in the first grade.
I am small, my mind is not!
No case remains unsolved!
There is always...
one truth!
Let's go, Mitsuhiko!
I'll get him!
Let's do it!
Ayumi, above you!
Way to go, Ayumi!
Yay!
Okay...
TODAY'S TOPICS AT A GLANCE
Last night at around 10 p.m., the police received a tip-off that there was a bomb
there was a bomb in a courier truck traveling in the Haido district.
The police immediately examined the truck
and actually discovered plastic explosives on the loading area.
Broke down while playing soccer....
Heard already. The professor has a new one ready for you.
It was the shoe's fault.
It's defective and so the ball just flew somewhere else.
I've been having bad luck lately...
Where's the professor?
He's fixing something in the bathroom...
Well, well.
...revealed that the explosive device
EXPLOSIVES FOUND IN COURIER TRUCK
from a cargo ship docked in the harbor...
Pretty close to where this explosive was found, right?
That's right.
But...
The organization doesn't make mistakes like that.
They have nothing to do with this.
Yeah. Let's hope...
I'm sorry, but the repairs will take a while...
COFFEE POIROT
DETECTIVE MÔRI
Huh?
Take a bath at our place?
Sure you can.
Ah, or we all go to a public bathhouse?
A bathhouse?
Sometimes it feels good to bathe in a really big pool.
You wanna come too, Pop?
I'm too shocked to leave.
YOKO OKINO SPOTTED ON LATE NIGHT DATE?
It's all made up, isn't it?
But what if it's true?
Then the three of us will go.
- Are you coming to the women's bath, Conan-kun? Huh?
I'm just kidding!
You're welcome.
Hey...
Will you be long?
Just a little while longer.
I'm so jealous of you two!
Tell me, Ai, is there a boy you like at school?

I can't imagine falling in love with children.
Okay...
Tell me...
Is that your safety deposit box?
Huh?!
Well, th... you could say that...
I see...
Hey, kid...
Are you here alone?
- Nope. - Conan?
Don't you feel too lonely over there?
Everything's fine here!
I ran into someone I know earlier.
Really? Who?
Uh...
Someone you know too, Ran.
What? Conan fell?!
Yeah. A friend of his drove him to the hospital.
Do you know which one?
Well...
Probably one nearby.
I'm sorry, I...
I should have asked which hospital they were going to.
It's okay, I'll find them.
Let's go, Ai-chan.
Aren't we going to the hospital?
That kid looked in the locker...
You're... You're one of us, aren't you?
You noticed right away, didn't you?
I heard someone was standing guard...
It was obvious... You've got that shifty look in your eye.
What do we do now?
We wait for instructions.
Pfff!
Don't tell me you have a better idea?!
You're just a little gangster who does what he's told?!
You're lucky I changed gears so fast.
Saved our asses.
You're living up to your name. "Tatsu the Improviser."
Your tattoo.
I've heard of you.
You can get into any situation, no matter how unexpected,
You get the job done thanks to your ability to improvise.
"Tatsu the Improviser" with the dragon tattoo.
You are a celebrity in the underworld.
K... I don't know who you're talking about...
Hey...
Who are you guys?
D... You hit your head in the bathhouse...
Conan-kun, right?
Conan?
Son...
Do you know what your name is?
What's my name?
Ah, Professor...
How is he? Is Conan-kun okay?
They said that he wasn't brought here...
What are you saying?
It's strange, isn't it? But this is the nearest emergency hospital.
Hm... The only other emergency hospital in the area is...
SHIN'ICHI KUDÔ
A message from Shin'ichi...
I see.
The acquaintance he was talking about was Shin'ichi.
- Huh? - We shouldn't worry,
The injury is not serious. Here...
DON'T WORRY, IT'S NOTHING. WE'RE GOING TO EAT NOW.
A... aha, well then... Good luck, huh?
But the mail is already annoying...
If you are going to eat,
why don't you ask us to join you?
- Ah, Shin'ichi... - This phone is currently
- out of radio range... - Well, well...
Let's go home.
O... okay...
A strong sleeping pill...
I think he won't wake up for quite a while....
I also sent an email to that Ran girl from the bathhouse..,
I sent an email. So for now, everything is fine.
The little guy's memory seems to have been affected anyway.
It would be best if he didn't remember anything.
You... You're Maru the locksmith, aren't you?
What's a burglary pro like you doing here?
I was told to open the door here...
and get a sleeping pill... I'm leaving!
You're not going anywhere.
Why aren't you?
I don't know.
I got an e-mail, though. We're all supposed to wait here.
Shit...
You don't know who you're working for either, do you?
I got my assignment over the phone.
"Assignment"? Don't make me laugh.
What are they holding you on?
Either way, we better do as we're told.
I've been in the underworld long enough to know that.
Whoever we're working for is definitely not to be trifled with.
Tomorrow morning, Prime Minister Babeo of Nihorika will arrive in Japan.
The Secretary General of the Cabinet announced in a press conference
PRIME MINISTER BABEO ADDRESSES CABINET ON SITUATION
on the summit meeting to be held tomorrow,
"that due to the air strikes carried out by Nihorika against Arasen,
- the security situation in the region..." - Hey!
I'm starving from the shock! Make some food quick, will you?
How about eating down at Poirot's?
Huh?
I'm pissed off! That's why I'm going to bed!
What the hell was that all about?
She looks more and more like Eri...
Yes?
I'm sorry, I...
Sorry, I've already closed...

I understand. Then I'll come back tomorrow.
But don't! For such a beauty
- I'll make an exception. - Huh?
I'll manage.
Barely.
So you want me to find out if your husband's having an affair?
Yes.
He denies it, but he's acting so strange. I don't believe him.
I don't have the time or the energy myself..,
to pursue the matter personally.
It would only have a negative impact on my work,
so I've decided to hire a professional.
I understand.
Any idea who the mistress might be?
No, but... when I cleaned up his car this morning,
it smelled like women's perfume.
What kind of work does your husband do?
He's unemployed at the moment.
Hmm...
It's unforgivable to let such a beautiful woman work...
and have an affair on top of that...
All right!
Then let's go straight to the public bathhouse,
where you last saw your husband?
Yes.
We'd better hurry.
Because afterwards...
why don't we have a bite to eat?
Yes...
I knew it.
- They're still in the bathhouse. - Huh?
I mean, his stuff is still there.
His clothes are still there...?
That would mean he's naked?!
Let's go.
Huh?!
S... his mother?
Yes, just now.
She said she was going to pick up her son's things.
And that everything is fine with the little one.
They're on the move.
And fast. They're on the move with the car.
W... what's wrong, Ai-kun?
Keep track of his things, Professor.
U... what are you doing?
Hurry!
So we'll go there first
- and then we'll eat... - Good evening.
Ah, you're the girl with the glasses...
Who are you?
Hey, I'm working here, so don't bother!
I'm hungry.
Then go home!
But the professor's not home.
Huh? But just now...
Do you want to eat with us?
May I? Thank you very much.
But, she must be bothering you...
It's no problem. I have nothing to hide.
Let's go.
So this is the apartment house where your husband worked?
Yes, but he has to leave soon...
He worked as a handyman, among other things...
Here you are...
He still has to take all his things with him.
There's a lot of cleaning up to do.
I understand...
This place is indeed
made for having an affair.
Yet he looks so honest and serious.
All men take their affairs seriously!
What have you got in your pocket?
- Hey. - Huh?
Work stuff...
I'm a magazine editor.
When we're done here, I have to go back to the office today too.
Oh, my God.
- I have a deadline to meet. - Oh, well...
As expected, he's not here.
Huh? H... hey!
You...
It's open...
Hey...
Hey!
You can't just walk around here!
The professor wants me to come home...
Hey, what about dinner?!
I'll pass.
A... Ai-kun...
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here, Professor?
I followed Conan's things and ended up at this house.
Oh! That's them.
Let me see.
Yoo-hoo. Are you going to be long?
I saw that woman at the bathhouse...
- After her! - Okay!
I was wondering...
As a craftsman...
Do you really earn that much?
Such a luxurious apartment...
Well...
A detective knows his own business...
But what a huge difference!
- One question... - Did you know about this room?
Did you know about this room?
I see. A "handyman" then...
Dear lady, it's very likely that your husband is not having an affair....
What the hell is going on here?
I don't know...
But...
I don't have a good feeling about this.
Kondo, you say?
Yes...
The guy who gave me the key to the truck said:
"Don't fuck up! We work for Kondo. You know about it!"
Kondo? Like, that guy they call the Legendary Killer?
That guy's just some urban legend, right?
Or do you have proof that he really exists?
D... the police will protect me, right?!
Come in!
- Cho-san, can I talk to you for a minute? - What's up?
The information from the CIA and the number of explosives we found..,
- actually don't match... - What?! Are you sure?
Yes. I've had it checked several times, but so far it's been too few.

Damn! So that means there are still some in circulation....
So what now, Ai-kun?
I'm going to take a look around.
- Stay here, Professor. - Huh?
Don't overdo it, okay?
Don't worry.
Time to go. We'll take the kid, too.
W... who are you?
It's better for all of us if you don't know.
I was just told to get the kid's stuff...
You messed that up.
And you forgot this, too!
Then you don't know who you're working for?
I have an idea.
Who do you mean?
My work is done, right?
Correct.
All your work is done.
Shall we go, Kondo-san?
Professor, call the police.
- Say you heard gunshots. - Sh... Shots?!
Hurry up!
A... Ai-kun.
- Follow that car! - O... okay!
Maybe they're planning something with the boy?
What do you mean?
That bug is up to something, isn't it?
Nothing's moving on the radar...
Broken again?
Don't get too close.
We've got to track them without being spotted.
All right.
Where in the world are they taking him?
Don't panic. If they wanted to kill him, they would have done it already.
Professor!
W... what the...?
Hey, watch it!
A... Ai-kun!
This is the place, right?
It was probably just some firecrackers or something.
Yeah, it must have been something like that.
Prime Minister Babeo of Nihorika landed this morning...
at Haneda Airport in Tokyo this morning on the presidential plane.
PRIME MINISTER OF NIHORIKA ARRIVES IN JAPAN.
His schedule this afternoon includes a visit
the Imperial Palace with his family.
- And now for the other news.... - Poor you...
You'll be all right soon.
Now your mom and dad are with you.
EXPLOSION IN DISUSED FACTORY
Everything will be all right.
I'll be right back with your breakfast.
I'm scared.
I'll stop by Shin'ichi's place and then go to school.
What's wrong with you? Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed?
You can say that again!
I didn't eat last night, so I'm starving,
and Conan was out with Shin'ichi, but he's not home yet.
Uh, I didn't eat either. Hurry up and make something.
Didn't I say I was leaving?!
I can't believe that girl...
You work all night and this is the thanks you get...
UNDERWORLD SPECIAL "KONDO," THE LIVING LEGEND
Conan-kun's running late...
Ai-chan is not here either...
I wonder if they'll stay home today.
Oh no... We said we'd go to Yokohama after school, right?
Yokohama?
Isn't that what we decided yesterday at the soccer game?
That we'd go to the Kamen-Yaibâ exhibition at the Red Brick Warehouse.
In Professor Agasa's car.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Do you think Conan even asked the professor?
I hope so.
Yes, hopefully...
Kamen-Yaibâ exhibition?!
I... is this a joke?
Well, the prime minister's kids are big fans, apparently.
He really wants to make this happen for them.
Unbelievable...
It hasn't been announced that they're going there.
Only his wife and children are going. The prime minister himself is not...
So, where is that?
D... the whole thing is taking place at the Red Brick Warehouse in Yokohama.
In Yokohama?!
J... Yeah...
Nothing but trouble...
All right, I'll call the Kanagawa Prefectural Police for backup.
- You get on with your work. - Yes, sir!
Can't you cook anything good?
I'm not a cook, sorry...
Didn't our brilliant impostor Nana here like it?
You know my name, don't you?
That's to be expected from the hacker genius Emu.
I... I...
How did you...?
I just found out.
It's almost time.
The boy's backpack.
I'll make sure his family doesn't cause any trouble.
What's up with you? How was school?
I got another mail from Shin'ichi!
He says he's going to the Kamen Yaibâ Exhibition in Yokohama.
Can you believe it?
Yokohama?
The place is called Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse!
I'm going there now!
The Red Brick Warehouse...
What?!
You're saying that her husband
TRUE DYNAMITE STORIES
is this "Legendary Killer"?
Yes...
As soon as he gets an order, he devises a perfect plan

and eliminates his target without ifs and buts.
You never find even the body in his murders.
KONDO, THE MAN FOR EVERYTHING, JUST AN URBAN LEGEND?
At her husband's workplace there were all kinds of notes and material
NO BODIES TO BE FOUND
to cases allegedly committed by this Kondo.
TRUE DYNAMITE STORIES
Can you really believe such magazines?
I don't know...
In any case, there was a folder for a completely new order on the table.
There were also instructions on how to handle explosive devices
and blueprints of the Red Brick Warehouse.
That's suspicious, isn't it?
Wouldn't you rather report it to the police?
I need something solid...
I can't do anything until I have something.
Did you tell the wife?
She had to go to work right after.
I haven't been able to reach her since.
- I feel really sorry for her... - Huh?
DON'T WORRY, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. WE'RE GOING TO EAT NOW.
- Ah, Shin'ichi... - This phone is located...
And I feel sorry for myself too!
Why are men always so stubborn!
Hey, watch it! That's dangerous, isn't it?!
I had an accident...
Can you give me a ride?
I'm sorry, but get another car.
It all had to happen fast...
But the image from the surveillance camera for the square is transmitted clearly...
and the sound is okay, too.
We were rehearsing in the disused factory,
if the remote trigger works...
Our targets will be there soon.
Yes, the bomb is standing nicely and alone where it should be.
But I'm not really comfortable with this...
Well, the targets were always kids..,
so what difference does it make...
But me being the one to push the button....
Here they come!
Fifteen more meters.
When I press here,
boom!
Ten meters...
Seven meters...
Five meters...
Conan-kun!
I finally found you!
Where's Shin'ichi?
Who are you?
Huh?
Three meters...
Two meters...
One meter...
Zero!
Don't you like it?
Huh?
Yes, yes...
Don't you like me anymore?
What?
Why do you ask?
You've been acting strange for a few days... I'm worried...
It's not what you think. I didn't want you to worry....
Are you getting cold feet...?
No...
Excuse me, I have an appointment.
Oh, you do, do you?
I'm really sorry.
No, it's okay.
The courier truck will arrive shortly and unload something at the corner in front of you.
Take the things and drive straight on.
What is it?
You don't need to know.
But we have a little problem.
The truck is under police surveillance...
That's why I want you to take the things to a safe place.
That's it?
Yes.
If everything goes well, your work is done.
Are you ready?
Yes.
Four is the maximum.
We can't fit more.
Okay.
Right when you turn the corner, you throw the bag out.
Nice and inconspicuous.
Threw it out. Now what?
That's it.
Huh? I'm supposed to drop off some cookies and that's it?
Pah... "Joe the messenger"? That's ridiculous.
What?!
Haven't you noticed that the police have been following you the whole time?
Where's the stuff?
What's this?
I put them in a locker in a bathhouse.
The place was crawling with police.
I couldn't just walk around with a suspicious bag like that.
I can't go in there. It's the men's locker room, right?
I had no idea you were a woman.
This is the situation... Yes...
Yes. I understand.
You can go for today.
For today? Is there something I have to do?
I don't know. You don't have to ask me that.
They said you'd be in touch.
I'll have a man pick up the bag.
You'll guard him...
Guard him?
Mingle with the other people.
and watch him until he picks up the bag.
If there's a problem, take care of it.
Why can't I pick up the bag myself?
I have my reasons for that.
I guess I don't want to know.
It's best for both parties...
This is your last assignment.
I promise.
An adult.
Welcome to our home.
Tell me...
Is that your safety deposit box?
Huh?!
You okay, kid?
Hey, you...
I'm taking the kid to the hospital. Help me.

Please.
Don't tell me you have a better idea?!
You're just another little gangster who does what he's told?!
You're lucky I switched gears so fast.
Saved both our asses.
You live up to your name. "Tatsu the Improviser."
Your tattoo.
Hey...
Who are you guys?
D... you hit your head in the bathhouse.
Conan-kun, right?
Conan?
Son... Do you know what your name is?
What's my name?
Where... are we?
I don't know.
You really don't remember anything?
Here, kid, this is medicine for your head.
Take this and lie down.
Okay...
Correct.
All your work is done.
Shall we go, Kondo-san?
The kid lost his memory...
Shouldn't be a problem to leave him behind.
I was told to bring him...
So it's not up to you.
Will you also turn me off when I've finished my task?
If I'm told to.
If I don't, I'll end up getting killed.
What do they have on you?
Not as much as they have on you.
Kondo, the "Legendary Killer,"
was really just someone who let his targets go.
You pretended to kill them..,
but you let them all go...
You must have made a lot of money.
You were paid by both sides.
How do you know all this?
They told me.
Probably so I wouldn't be more afraid of you than I had to be.
What are they going to do with the kid?
Well... Maybe they're planning something with the kid.
What do you mean?
That bug is up to something...
Is he asleep?
Yes.
We'll have to wait till morning.
Do you want to?
I'll say.
I must say, you've got guts.
There's no point in resisting now.
You're awake, aren't you?
I gave the sleeping pill I gave the woman earlier.
She's fast asleep.
You don't have to be afraid.
I'll let you go, so get up quietly.
And what will become of you?
You're being forced to do this, aren't you?
Yes.
There are explosives in the bag from the bathhouse, aren't there?
Huh?
I saw it on the news. Explosives in cookie jars...
You really don't know anything about their plans, do you?
They have all kinds of people working for them,
but nobody knows what the real plan is.
That's why I need to find
the real criminal behind all of this.
- You have to leave here and go to the police. - If I disappear,
they'll suspect you.
Besides...
So..,
So you're the famous Kondo-san?
Who are you?
I'm on your team.
Are you...?
No, unfortunately I'm not the leader.
I'm keeping an eye on him with this, so you can rest.
Yes...
The Red Brick Warehouse?
Yeah. The ticket for the event that's going on there..,
was in the kid's pocket.
There's gonna be a lot of kids there.
So I was told to take him there and leave him there.
He didn't regain his memory, did he?
No.
It's a lucky thing, isn't it?
What would you have done if they told you to take care of the kid?
...visit to the Imperial Palace with his family.
- And now for the rest of the news... - Poor you...
You'll be all right soon. Now your mom and dad are with you.
EXPLOSION IN DISUSED FACTORY
Everything will be all right.
I'll be right back with your breakfast.
I'm scared.
You can do it. Keep pretending,
- like you don't remember anything. - I've... I've...
I know who the real criminal is now.
I want to talk to someone from
"True Dynamite Stories magazine.
Gladly. Your names, please?
It's true that we ran several specials on him
in our magazine...
So this Kondo really exists, right?
Yes.
That's a fact.
In fact, just recently
I was even offered information on his whereabouts.
Oh?! And where is he?
Well, the informant wanted so much money for it..,
that I had to refuse the deal.
I haven't heard from him since.
Uh, Mr. Otani... Have you seen our chief editor?
No, I haven't. Is something going on with Kanae-chan?
Well, since she left earlier, I can't seem to reach her.
And we have a deadline today...
It's almost time.

The backpack of the boy.
Smaller...
What?
Oh, nothing...
Yes...
Once you deliver the kid, your job is done.
Good job.
First you threaten me, and then that's all I have to do?
Hey, hey, lay off, you're not a "Legendary Killer."
I know you're helping people escape...
A couple of "errands" like this is just what you need....
Just don't flatter yourself.
After you drop the kid off,
keep an eye on him until he's picked up.
If the police get involved, I'll hold you responsible.
But even a small-time crook like you can do that...
Hey, I gotta go to the john. I have to go to the bathroom.
Okay, no problem.
The backpack is rigged with explosives.
What?
They can be detonated remotely.
When the time comes, someone somewhere will have to push a button.
How do you know...?
I never had a ticket for this Kamen-Yaibâ exhibition...
I don't know what they're after yet..,
but I've got the rest figured out.
You're the "Legendary Killer" Kondo, aren't you?
I read about you in a magazine.
Yes.
But the truth is, you just let people go.
That's right.
I thought so.
My father once worked on a case..,
involving a man named Kondo...
He told me about it...
When Kondo is ordered to kill someone..,
he tells the target about it,
gets money from both sides, and makes everyone think..,
that he's killed the target, but then lets him go.
Unfortunately, I don't have any proof of that.
It's all so true.
If this truth comes out,
then it will also be known that those who should be dead are still alive...
Is that what they're blackmailing you with?
Yes.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Conan Edogawa...
A detective.
A detective?
The real criminal is probably "Tatsu the Improviser".
What?!
Yesterday at the bathhouse, there was a suspicious man..,
who kept washing his upper body.
He was always looking in the direction of the lockers.
Are you going to be long?
A little bit more.
I thought it was strange, so I went into the locker room,
and that's when I saw you.
You weren't wet at all and you looked pretty suspicious....
I wondered what was going on, but that's when Tatsu came in...
and took the locker key out of his pocket.
So I just had to talk to him....
Then I saw this cookie jar in the locker....
So there I was, naked, with these three suspicious people.
Something couldn't be right.
I grabbed my cell phone and my transmitter....
- Transmitter? - Yes!
It's like a sticker... I can put it anywhere.
And my glasses pick up his signal.
It's a radar!
Hey, kid...
Are you here alone?
- No... - Conan-kun?
Aren't you feeling a little lonely over there?
Everything's fine here!
I ran into someone I know earlier...
I put the transmitter on his clothes...
and I was going to tell someone, but...
But there wasn't time.
So I fell on purpose to cause a little commotion.
Well, and then...
You all right, kid?
He drugged me,
and I really did lose consciousness...
Stunned?
Yeah. That means they were trying to take somebody out anyway.
Probably...
Yeah. That was for me...
They put me there as a guard
and they wanted to keep me quiet.
They were going to kidnap you while you couldn't fight back, and then...
...pin it all on me...
I guess the plan was to frame me for the attack.
But... Wouldn't that be sloppy planning?
First the police find these explosives...
And it was just a coincidence that I was in the bathhouse, wasn't it?
They probably only had a rough plan, which they changed as needed.
So it was all improvised.
You mean "Tatsu the Improviser" is behind all this?
But...
It looked like he died in the factory, I know.
But...
PRIME MINISTER OF NIHORIKA ARRIVES IN JAPAN
The news mentioned only
the body of an unidentified person, right?
If the bodies of Tatsu and the other man had been found,
would there have been two bodies?

That's why I looked with the radar glasses and saw
EXPLOSION IN DECOMMISSIONED FACTORY
and found that it was on the move. "Tatsu the Improviser..."
I now know
who the real criminal is.
He's in the house now...
I'll buy us some time.
You check Tatsu's whereabouts and go to the police.
All right.
That still leaves the explosives...
I'll take care of it.
Yes, please.
And...
They probably have my friends.
Huh? Your friends?
Do you have them?
Yes... She was there as soon as I said
I had something to tell her about her husband.
I put her to sleep for a while...
But do we really have to go that far?
I'm just scared.
Anyway, come back.
I'm on my way.
Okay.
Are you cold?
Huh?! Why do I have to do this crap?
I'll explain later...
You owe me that.
O... okay...
Did you forget that I let you go?
Hm... Today is bad...
Gotta take care of my cat and stuff...
I don't have anyone to trust but you!
You can't have many friends...
You reached my answering machine.
She must be at work...
Hello...
What the hell is this?
Who are you?
Who are you?
I don't believe it.
Hey, watch it! That's dangerous, isn't it?
I had an accident...
Can you give me a ride?
Take it easy.
The boy told me about you...
Here they come.
Fifteen meters to go.
When I press here,
...boom!
Two meters...
One meter...
Zero.
It actually exploded...
What was the warning?
It just said,
evacuate people because there was a bomb planted there.
W... what the...?!
What's going on? Why isn't anything exploding?!
Damn it!
Forget it.
- D... you?! - Don't move!
Ai-kun, are you okay?!
Professor...
- Da-da-da! - I want a turn too!
Conan-kun... Hey, are you okay?
Yes.
Everything's fine. Your friends are fine, too.
I know who the target was now. This is inexcusable...
Is Tatsu with you?
No, he's not.
ACTIVE TALK
Hey, Conan-kun?!
Oh...
Ran, what are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
I'm going to look for him now.
I was looking for you, Conan-kun!
Shin'ichi's here too, isn't he?
Where's he...?
It's a bomb!
Everyone run!
Hurry up, Ran!
H... Hey, Conan-kun!
Hurry up!
Run, all of you!
Run!
Run! It's dangerous here.
Come on.
Where's Tatsu?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
He was supposed to be here, but he said he'd be late because he was still...
He's not coming.
That means you were just being used by him, too.
As soon as you're done here, he'll take you out.
You can see the proof of that up there on the ceiling.
He says he wants to talk to you.
What an idiot you are.
Did you blow up your apartment to get even with your past?
Who's the idiot here?!
The Tatsu the Improviser I know..,
is a much smaller fish with much smaller ambitions.
Your wife really has a pretty face.
What?!
Are these people here
your friends?
Falling in love with a woman and turning your back on the underworld...
You're making it easy on yourself, aren't you?
You're going to work for us a little longer.
If you make one wrong move,
If you screw up and get caught by the police, your wife will die.
Ah, Conan-kun?!
Conan-kun?! Where are you?
Conan-kun?
Wake up!
W... What's wrong?!
Hurry up! Get going!
Man, man, can you believe it?!
Was that... was that...?
Pop?
Just like I thought.
It's definitely Kondo's fault.
That car...!
Huh?
Give it to me!
Keep an eye on her for a while, okay?
Sure.
And you're coming with me.
Yes...
It's okay.
We still have time...
Yes... You'll be fine.
You and Tatsu, what's your relationship?
Originally, I was the one who found you...
About a year ago, I happened to see you and that secret door...
You must have been working...
Hey, come here.
- Huh? - Come on!
It's all right.
Look at this.
He suddenly became very interested in you.
and started watching you.
I see. So that's how it went.
Do you mind?

There, turn left.
Was that you who dropped off the folder about the Red Brick Warehouse
at my place yesterday?
He changes gears very, very quickly...
Don't underestimate him.
What the hell is... is all this?
You cheeky bugger.
There's a lot of security cameras in this house, you know.
Hey, where'd you go?!
This goofball is your friend, huh?
Ouch!
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, you!
I'm just helping out, I've got nothing to do with it!
Really! I'm just...
Will you shut up?
Don't shoot!
Well...
Then I'm curious about your explanations...
Ah, that's my cell phone...
Huh?
That girl...
She was...
Hello! Is nobody home?
Hello!
Conan-kun! Are you in there?
Shin'ichi?!
Ran, isn't it?
Conan-kun is indeed in there....
And the guy with the stupid look on his face..,
who was with him, is that Shin'ichi?
Now, be a good boy and...
Huh?
What's going on here?!
The explosives are in the truck.
I want you to get in and wait...
You'll get the details later.
This is your last chance.
If you want to save your wife, make no mistake.
If the explosion at the red brick warehouse had worked,
...the plan was for you to return to the mountain house as well, wasn't it?
He was planning on taking you out after, too.
Forget it. You can't convince me like that.
There's a message on the machine from your husband...
This is probably the last time you'll ever hear his voice..,
so keep your ears open.
VOICE MAIL
Hello...
Sorry to bother you, but...
We can't see each other for a while.
I have to turn myself in to the police
because of things in my past...
I don't know how it will turn out...
I won't ask you to wait for me....
I'm a really lucky guy to have met you...,
despite the life I've led.
For that I am infinitely grateful.
End of message.
About the message...
If he had not met you,
he would have remained a little gangster forever.
Probably he would have led such a happy life...
But you had to spoil it for him...
The Prime Minister's wife wants to know..,
when they'll be able to get out of here?
We're still doing some security checks,
so please be patient.
Are you ready, Kondo-san?
What do you want me to do this time?
The car carrying the children of the prime minister of Nihorika...
will soon cross the bridge you have in sight...
You will involve that car in an accident.
The trigger for the explosive device we press here.
Why the kids?
Because that's what I was told to do.
The deal is I blow them up with an explosive device.
Business is business...
And anyway, this assignment was originally for you.
What?
I gained access to your workplace..,
after I took an interest in you...
I was amazed...
That the "Legendary Killer" Kondo actually existed...
When I looked at your files, I found out..,
that you hadn't killed a soul...
I realized that you are nothing but a fraud,
who just lets people go. At that very moment...
It was an order from abroad.
It seems they were looking for the best killer in Japan...
Took forever to figure out how to contact you.
Then you...
you got this assignment...
Right... When I heard what they were paying!
I gave them my number and took the job.
And I took the liberty of using that list of notorious gangsters..,
that you had so neatly compiled.
Get moving.
Get to the bridge access...
And don't turn off your cell phone.
Damn it!
A little more...
A little bit...
Hey...
W... what's going on? I told you to go back to the house.
He didn't have his phone on him.
He said he gave his phone to the kid at the Red Brick Warehouse.
- So I gave him mine... - Huh?
If you want to contact him, you'll have to call my cell.
I was gonna let you know real quick,
- but there were police everywhere. - But I have...

Freeze! Police!
W... why...
You better give up.
This job was too big for you from the start.
By the way...
I taped our whole conversation - as proof.
- But how did you know where I... - Hey, who are you talking to?
Who are you talking to?! Hello?
Hello?
Hey, hey. You can't go on here.
Let me through! Please.
Do you live in this house?
No, I don't, but...
Officer...
This is the husband of the woman who was taken hostage.
Is that right?
Yes, it's true...
Why didn't you say so?
Your wife seems to be all right.
She should be coming down soon.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Wasn't it you who slipped the transmitter to that woman named Nana?
Yes...
Quick, the police! There's a bomb down there!
- What?! Hey, Conan-kun!
What's the meaning of this? Tell me!
- They're on the move. - What?
- You there! - Huh, what?
There they are!
There, the light blue car.
Huh? Good...
Are you ready, Kondo-san?
What should I do this time?
I see.
Where's the explosive device?
Huh? I see.
I left it with the police...
Uh, hello, is this the police?
I... I... found an explosive device...
Yes... In a cookie jar...
Yes...
Okay... But how did you find this place?
Oh that...
Tatsu just knew way too fast that the apartment had exploded....
So I figured he must have been somewhere in sight....
I took the risk.
You are the "Legendary Killer" Kondo...
How many times, I don't know anything!
An acquaintance asked me
to take the boy to the Yaiba exhibition.
Hey, kid...
It's dangerous there. You can't go in.
Do you live around here?
Yes. Sorry.
Hey!
Can't you explain to them?
They just don't get what I'm telling them...
I lost track of myself,

before I knew it.

Who was that man back there with Conan?
I don't know.
Oh...
And anyway! Where is Shin'ichi?!
I really don't understand anything anymore...
So, men!
I'll explain it to you!
Everything that happened here was the work of the "Legendary Killer" Kondo.
Fortunately, I took the case...

My feelings
are totally out of control.

It's just killing me, this depression.

For my fake ID.

Don't let it end

I'm gonna be your DYNAMITE...
Explode with a big bang!
According to police reports, a government official from Arasen is allegedly
was involved in the incidents with the seized explosive devices.
Plans are underway through the embassy to...
Please! I have to change back into Shin'ichi! Only this time!

No way.
Don't be like that, please!
I just can't think of a good excuse why Shin'ichi's cell phone sent
from Shin'ichi's cell phone...
As Shin'ichi, there's nothing you can do about it.
Yes, yes, I can!
Please! Give me the cure.
No way!
Cheapskate...
It's for your own good.
I guess it won't help.
I'll have to think of some reason...
Oh yeah...
Thanks for...
You took quite a beating looking for me.
You're welcome.
It looks really bad...
I forgot the bathroom was broken.
What do I do now?
