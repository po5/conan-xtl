Ayumi-chan,
bedtime. Off to the bath with you!
Not yet. It's so exciting right now.
Don't you have swimming lessons tomorrow?
Yes.
Who are you?
Mr. Dracula?
No,
I was exhausted from flying and rested.
I am a simple magician.
Young lady.
There he is! Don't let him get away!
Get Kaitô Kid!
Take care,
Young Miss.
TEITAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
What?!
You saw Kaitô Kid?
Really, Ayumi?
Yeah, he's totally cool!
He's like the Arsene Lupin of the modern era.
So? What's the Holmes of the modern age up to?
It's obvious!
I'll get him one day!
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE MAGICIAN OF THE LAST CENTURY
HIS NAME IS SHIN'ICHI KUDÔ
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on what was happening
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He administered a poison to me
and when I came to,
my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive,
my life
and that of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised
not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked my name,
I said Conan Edogawa.
To go after the men,
DETECTIVE MÔRI
I moved in with Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
I am Master Detective Kogoro Mô...
Known as the "Sleeping Kogoro." Because I'm him...
ANESTHESIA CHRONOMETER
put him to sleep with the anesthesia chronometer
and then by means of the voice-transposer
VOICE-TRANSPOSER
with his voice to solve the case.
Both devices are inventions of Professor Agasa.
Believe me, he is quite a genius.
Besides the skateboard with turbo drive,
the radar goggles and
the power kick-boots
he's always inventing new, unique gadgets.
SKATEBOARD WITH TURBO DRIVE
The skateboard can be charged only during the day,
so it will work for another 30 minutes at night.
By the way, there are two other people
who know my true identity.
High school detective Heiji Hattori and
the new classmate Ai Haibara.
She was one of the men in black,
but drank to escape,
she drank the same poison that was given to me
and shrank as well.
During my hunt
I always encounter other tricky cases.
This time it is
an equal opponent!
Into dark confusion I bring light.
Even if I am small, my mind is the same!
There is always only one truth!

SHINTARÔ CHAKI (49) HEAD OF THE CAPITAL POLICE DEPARTMENT
a new announcement letter.
From dusk Leo to dawn Virgo.
FROM DUSK LION TO DAYBREAK VIRGO
When the clock reaches the 12th letter without the second hand,
GINZO NAKAMORI (41) POLICE OFFICER
I pick up the "Memories Egg" from a tall building shining in the sky...
THE MAGICIAN OF THE LAST CENTURY KAITÔ KID
The magician of the last century, Kaitô Kid.
Kaitô Kid?
The "Memories Egg" mentioned in the letter is a treasure of the
is a treasure of the Romanov dynasty,
which was discovered in the Suzuki
in the Suzuki warehouse. An Imperial Easter Egg!
The Imperial Easter Eggs
were given by the Russian Tsar to his wife for Easter.
JEWELER FABERGÉ
He had them made by the jeweler Fabergé.
THE BLUE SNAKE WATCH EGG, 1887
FLOWER BASKET EGG, 1901
From 1885 to 1916
he made 50 eggs.
SWAN EGG, 1906
MOSAIC EGG, 1914
Consequently, the egg just discovered is the 51st.
The Suzuki family will exhibit the 51st egg.
At the Suzuki Gallery of Modern Art, which will open Aug. 23.
in the park of Ôsaka Castle.
- Now for the decryption. Nakamori-kun! - Right.
"From dusk Leo to dawn Virgo."
From the last evening in the zodiac sign of Leo, which is August 22,
until the dawn of the first day of Virgo.
It is the date of the crime.

WHEN THE CLOCK WITHOUT SECOND HAND...
Then, "When the clock reaches the 12th letter without a second hand..."
This seems to indicate the time, but we haven't been able to decipher it yet.
decipher it yet.
A tall building shining in the sky,
that's a castle tower, in other words Ôsaka Castle,
that is, the place where the Kid appears.
So the letter states,
that on the night of August 22
to the 23rd of August
on the tower of the Ôsaka Castle
to steal the Imperial Easter Egg.
to steal.
That is why this time we will investigate together with the Ôsaka police.
In addition, at the request of Mr. Suzuki
Master Detective Kogoro Môri has also been asked to assist.
Ha... Hello.
Our goal is to protect the egg
at all costs!
Even if we have to let it escape, the egg...
We can't think that naively!
The egg is secondary! Listen, colleagues!
With our pride and dignity
as police officers, we must
we must throw this poncey thief
to the cold jail!
Yes!
I've got myself into a fine mess.
Run! Over here! Over here!
Sonoko!
A limousine.
As you'd expect from the Suzukis.
After all, today is a special day.
- Special? - For my dear Kaitô Kid-sama...
it has to be special.
Really, Sonoko!
Your revered Kid-sama?
Oh yes, at the wheel is Papa's secretary, Mr. Nishino.
MASATO NISHINO (29) SECRETARY TO SHIRO SUZUKI
Nice to meet you.
He travels a lot abroad
and speaks fluent English, French and German.
That's impressive!
AGASA ANNUAL
That's mean, Professor!
Conan went to Osaka all by himself!
And I would have loved to see the Kid again.
He's always been good at leaving us behind.
Don't say that.
Eat some watermelon and cool off your anger.
Hooray!
Bon appétit!
Wait a minute!
Before you eat, you have to solve a riddle!
Do you have to, Professor?
What are you talking about?
Don't get into the habit of thinking it's easy to get something.
Here we go!
I have many grandchildren.
I (WASHI) HAVE MANY GRANDCHILDREN. HOW OLD ARE THEY?
How old are they?
Professor, you have grandchildren?
This is a riddle!
We can't do it without Conan-kun.
Then what about the watermelon?
Zero years.
They're still eggs.
WASHI --> ME OR EAGLE
Washi" means the eagle.
MANY GRANDCHILDREN --> EGGS
Many grandchildren makes the word "eggs".
EGGS --> 0 YEARS
Eggs are zero years old.
That is totally correct!
Great, Ai-kun. I was expecting you to be able to solve it.
Haibara-san, you are...
...unbelievable.
Haibara is one of us Detective Boys.
That means...
Bon appetit!
I wonder what will happen to the egg over there?
I can't wait to see how you get along,
Kudô-kun.
ÔSAKA POLICE DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS
SUZUKI MODERN ART GALLERY
So many guards!
As if even an ant couldn't crawl past.
It's obvious! They're expecting Kaitô Kid-sama!
- After all, he is the... -...versatile gentleman thief.
The sharpest guards, the safest safes...
As if by magic, he breaks in everywhere.
He can imitate face, voice and behavior
and behavior to perfection. A master of disguise.
He really is,
we've made a nuisance of ourselves.
Kudô!
Hattori!
Him again!
No kidding,
Hattori-kun, why do you always call Conan-kun Kudô?
I'm sorry.
When I'm analyzing problems, he's so similar to Kudô.
It just slips out.
That's so stupid!
He's been talking about Kudo coming since this morning.
Shouldn't you go to the hospital and get checked out?
Is that Western Japan's high school detective Heiji Hattori-kun?
He looks pretty good.
Forget it.
Hattori-kun is Kazuha-chan's boyfriend. They've known each other since they were little.
Even though they fight like that,
they're still one heart and soul.
I can see that. They're just like you and Shin'ichi-kun.
- Eh? - You're the one who started this.
Oh, if only I had a childhood friend, too.
CHAIRMAN'S ROOM
SHIRO SUZUKI (51), SONOKO'S FATHER CHAIRMAN SUZUKI GROUP
Huh?
Oh, Môri-san!
Thank you for coming from so far away.
Well, good afternoon.
Ran-san, Conan-kun, thank you for coming.

Uh, Sonoko, who are those two there?
That's Heiji Hattori-kun and Kazuha Toyama-san, Dad.
Heiji-kun is the name of the high school detective in western Japan,
He's very famous in Kansai.
That's right. I'm counting on you.
You can count on me, dude!
Hey you!
You don't say "dude" to the head of the Suzuki Group!
It's okay, Môri-san.
Let me introduce you,
from the Russian Embassy: Sergei Ovchinikov-san, First Secretary.
SERGEI OVCHINIKOV (41), FIRST SECRETARY OF THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY.
Pleased to meet you.
Sitting next to him is art dealer
Shôichi Inui-san, who is here on business.
SHÔICHI INUI (45), ART DEALER
The lady is Romanov Dynasty specialist, Seiran Hoshi-san.
SEIRAN HOSHI (27), ROMANOV DYNASTY SPECIALIST
Ni-hao.
And this is
Ryû Sagawa-san, freelance reporter,
who wants to do a report on the egg.
RYÛ SAGAWA (32), FREELANCE REPORTER
Hello.
You're talking about business. What kind of money are we talking about?
About 800 million.
800 million?!
I'll pay more if you let me have it.
Chairman! The Imperial Easter Eggs actually belong to the Russian people.
Before you sell it to a shady broker like that,
please donate it to the Art Museum of Russia.
Shady, you say?
Keep it up.
It seems more interesting to film the people than the egg.
You look unconcerned, of course.
But you, as a specialist.
you must be crazy about that egg.
Yes,
But 800 million is...
Exactly! If I put it all together, I come up with just 200 million.
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
It's not just the Kid.
everybody!
Anyway, let's talk about the egg again later.
Roger that.
Can't be helped. Then I will retire for today.
Mr. Chairman, I bring the egg.
Ah, thank you very much,
- please put it on the table. - Yes.
Please, come closer.
Oh, we get to see the egg.
It doesn't look very impressive.
I thought it was a toy when I was a kid and played with it.
A toy?
So this is an Imperial Easter Egg?
Nishino-kun, serve something cold.
Yes.
It doesn't blow me away like I thought it would.
It looks like an ostrich egg.
You can open that, right?
That's right, you got that right.
The model shows the family of Tsar Nicholas.
It's made entirely of gold.
That's not bad at all.
The egg has an interesting mechanism.
- That's crazy! - In Fabergé's old documents
there is a design sketch of the egg's interior.
Based on this, the authenticity of the egg was certified.
Is "Memories Egg"
the title of the egg translated from Russian?
Yes, it is.
VOSPOMINANIE
In Russian it is called Vospominanie,
which means "souvenir" in Japanese.
Say, what does reading a book have to do with souvenirs?
Fool!
Gathering one's children and reading to them,
is a souvenir.
Are those gems on the back of the cover?
No, that's just glass.
Even though it's a gift from the tsar to his wife?
Doesn't that make you think?
Well, at the time the 51st egg was created,
Russia was already in financial trouble.
What makes me think is Kid's writing.
Tall, shiny building...
Why would Ôsaka Castle be luminous?
Fool!
The builder Hideyoshi Toyotomi
also laid the foundation for Osaka, and is therefore
is something like the light for the city.
That's exactly how it is.
The Kid will appear on the tower of Ôsaka Castle.
There is no doubt about that. But.
"When the clock reaches the 12th letter without the second hand..."
We just can't figure it out.
Could he mean the 12th syllable of the Japanese alphabet?
The twelfth character of the alphabet is...
Shi?
So 4:00?
No, it would be too easy for a code from the Kid.
I got it, commissioner!
Not the Japanese alphabet,
- the English alphabet! - The English...?
The twelfth letter of the alphabet is "L".
So...
3:00!
You really are a master detective. Well done.
No doubt about it! 3:00 is before dawn...
and it's just like he said.
Just you wait, Kaitô Kid!
This time we'll arrest you!
NAMBA HÔTEI SHRIEK
- I am very lucky! - Let me see!
"The expected visitor...

You'll meet your lover again."
That must mean Shin'ichi-kun.
Oh, how nice for you. Introduce him to me next time, will you?
I'm standing right here.
Well..,
The problem is, how are we going to kill time until 3:00?
First, let's have something delicious...
Kazuha, show them around.
- What about you, Heiji? - I'll show the little one around.
Why? Let's go together.
We men prefer to keep to ourselves.
Don't we, Co... Co... Conan-kun.
Yes.
- Get used to it quickly! - Don't give me that lip!
- You want me to expose you? - Please try a little harder.
Better. When you ask someone to do something,
don't forget to smile.
Son of a bitch!
Strange how well those two get along.
Who cares? That's how we women are among ourselves.
Let's find a good-looking guy to take us out to dinner!
In that case, we could go to Hikkakebashi.
You must be bothered by the twelfth letter.
Yes, if L was the twelfth letter in the Russian alphabet...
In the Russian alphabet?
It's "ka", the English K.
With the K
you can't form a time.
Also, the last line, magician of the last century, makes me think.
This guy is really affected!
He's never called himself that before.
And above all, why does the Kid, who until now has only targeted gems,
is going for the egg?
By the way, tell me, what did you pull earlier?
I don't know at all.
Why? It's an important oracle for the encounter with the Kid.
Really!
LITTLE LUCK
Huh,
Little Luck. That's pretty meaningless.
You don't know if you're going to win
whether you're going to win or lose the fight against the Kid.
The expected visitor is coming?
Journey.
JOURNEY. THE SECRET COMES OUT. DON'T.
Oh, dear.
Does that mean...
It can't be.
The prophecies here are often true.
It's not true?
Yes, it is.
A luxury restaurant?
Yeah, now that we know the Kid's gonna show up at 3:00 tomorrow morning.
Until then, how about it?
That sounds wonderful!
Mr. Chairman. It's about time.
Yes, all right. I am asking for it.
Will you take it to the showroom?
- Yes, the imitation. - Imitation?
So far we have
in the announced places like idiots and let them steal it.
and let it steal from us.
Therefore
we take it to a place no one knows about.
I see.
And where is this place?
I won't tell you under any circumstances!
Only my two subordinates and I know about it.
Of course, I have
...I've made sure that no one...
is the Kid in disguise.
What's the point?
You too could be Kid in disguise.
The same goes for you!
Don't give me that!
My name is Natsumi Kôsaka.
This is my administrator Sawabe.
It's about the Imperial Easter Egg from the pamphlet.
I really need to talk to the chairman about it.
I'm sorry, he's out of the office right now.
If you want, I can help you.
The egg in the photo looks different
than in great-grandfather's picture.
Oh, that's funny. If 3:00 a.m. is "L,"
it's now "He."
"He"?
Now it's 7:13.
At 7:20, we have a perfect "He."
FROM THE DUSK OF THE LION TO THE DAWN OF THE VIRGIN
The "He" in "From Dawn of Leo to Dawn of Virgo"
is the 12th character in the sentence!
Hattori. Kid's announced time
is not 3 a.m., but now at 7:20 a.m.!
What? Where are you going, Kudô?
To Osaka Castle. You watch the egg!
Rain? According to the weather forecast, it's supposed to stay dry...
Wait, Kudo!
That tall building is the observation tower!
- The observation tower? - At the top of the tower
the light tells the weather!
What?
Ladies and gentlemen!
Well, the show is starting!
Wha... what's going on?
JAPANESE RESTAURANT KAKEI
Oh, fireworks.
This is perfect for setting the right summer mood.
DÔTONBORI
How beautiful!
In Ôsaka, apparently, the fireworks are tremendous, too.
Strange. There were no fireworks planned for today at all.
Inspector. Fireworks are going off in the castle area.
A huge crowd!
Stay calm! It's not Kid.
We have more than seven hours until the announced time.
It won't occur to him that we're hiding the egg in a place like this.
in a place like that.

Hattori, which way is the lookout tower?
That way!
There are no fireworks there.
The fireworks at the castle are to divert attention from the tower.
But why? What's he doing on the lookout tower?
Damn it, even if we go there now, we'll be too late.
We have to ambush him here.
Nishino-san,
where's the egg now?
Inspector Nakamori took it to a place I don't know.
What?
And next...
POWER OUTAGE
Power failure?
What's wrong? What happened?
That's strange, isn't it?
A drink by moonlight.
That's also very tasty.
Don't panic!
Turn on the emergency power!
- Hurry up! - Yes!
Now I know what he's up to!
Hey!
Hoenzaka, Mikado Hospital,
Hotel Dojima Century.
Tenman Emergency Center.
Hotel Channel Ten. Naniwa TMS Hospital.
World Kansai Hotel.
Bingo!
- Go that way! How should I turn? - Straight ahead is the priority!
He knew about the real egg being taken to another place.
To determine that location,
he cut the power.
The emergency power supply kicks in.
And there,
except in hospitals and hotels...
Kid!
Damn it! Damn it!
Oh, no!
It's a dead end!
Get on, Kudo!
I see.
To see where the lights come on..,
the observation tower is ideal.
He must have foreseen this scenario when he announced it.
In addition, the hiding place, in order not to attract attention...
...the hiding place is sparsely guarded.
We must hurry,
or he'll get the egg!
Hattori!
You stand guard here!
What? Hey, Kudo!
Kid!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Hurry up, Kudô!
Hey!
For a hang glider pilot.
a light headwind is ideal.
So he'll be flying against the wind!
He's reducing his altitude!
Ahead of us is Ôsaka Bay.
Kid will go down there for sure!
Hattori! Are you okay?
What are you standing around for? Hurry up!
Don't let him get away!
Hattori...
Are you all right, son?
Please call the police and ambulance!
Yes.
I'll get him, Hattori!
Who...?
This wound...
The egg's intact.
That's Kid's monocle!
He's not going in the sea...
Then who was the man
who was that man?
Despite the police's intensive search that night...
Kid's fate remained uncertain.
The next day
the exhibition was cancelled
AUGUST 23
and the egg was taken by ship
to Tôkyô for examination.
My great-grandfather
was called Kiichi
and worked in the Fabergé workshop.
He married a Russian woman on the spot
NATSUMI KÔSAKA (27), CONFECTIONER
and returned with her to Japan after the
to Japan, where they had a daughter.
However, my great-grandmother died shortly after.
After nine years
at the age of 45, my great-grandfather also died, or so I heard.
And this baby...?
Is my grandmother.
My grandfather and parents died, I was five, in a traffic accident.
I grew up with my grandmother.
KURANOSUKE SAWABE (65), BUTLER OF THE KÔSAKA FAMILY
The lady of the house passed away last month.
I worked in Paris as a pastry chef
and returned to take care of the estate.
In the process, this sketch appeared,
which seems to be great-grandfather's.
Unfortunately, it is torn in the middle.
Memories.
It is undoubtedly the Memories Egg.
But there are gems on this one.
Maybe there were some on it in the beginning,
which were later removed?
Couldn't it be that there were two eggs?
Look,
for one egg, the outlines don't really match.
Probably there were two eggs
on a larger sheet and the center is now missing.
I see.
But why is it called Memories?
There's a mirror there!
Oh no, it fell off!
What are you doing?
There was a mirror, but it fell off.
What's that?
- Conan-kun! - It's okay.
The mirror always came off easily.
It was probably added later.
What's that?
It's a picture of something.
Could it be...
Nishino-san, turn off the light!
Eh? Yes.
Hey! What are you acting like?!
Where did that picture come from?
The magic mirror.
Magic mirror?
I've heard of them.
They say they existed in Japan and China.
Yes, the mirrors were made in a special way.
It is said that the Christians living undercover in Japan...

have prayed to the cross projected on the wall.
- Sawabe-san. This castle...! - Yes,
it is without a doubt Yokosuka Castle.
Yokosuka Castle,
which is often seen in commercials?
Yes.
It was built by my great-grandfather...
and managed by my grandmother.
Then the castle belongs to the Kôsaka family.
Natsumi-san,
couldn't it be
that your great-grandfather made the two eggs?
Your great-grandfather returned
after the Russian Revolution
he returned to Japan with his wife and the eggs he made.
Probably
he sold some of the gems from the second egg, used the money to
built the castle
and hid the egg somewhere there.
Then he put the message about the hiding place
in the form of a magic mirror on the other egg.
Honestly, I have found to this sketch
I found this old key.
Does it have something...
For sure
this is the key to the hiding place
of the second egg.
The mysterious jeweled egg.
If it's found, it'll be worth a billion..,
no, 1.5 billion yen!
Is that why the Kid is after it?
No.
Môri-san, when we get back to Tôkyô, would you accompany me to the castle?
With pleasure.
- Please let me come with you! - Me too!
- Let me film the whole thing! - I also want to...
Yes, let's go together.
What is it?
All of a sudden everyone looks so greedy.
Are they also keen on the second egg?
That's a good boy.
The bleeding has stopped.
When the wound is healed, it flies again.
Really? That's nice.
Fortunately, Hattori-kun also only has a slight sprain.
I wonder if the Kid died, though.
Something like that won't kill the guy.
Maybe
Maybe he's already on board.
Yes!
Very nice, that expression.
That's mine!
What was that all about?
Hi, Ran! We thought we'd stop by.
Even Natsumi-san and Nishino-san.
Here you go.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I'll pass after all.
Oops?
Oh, all these beauties are embarrassing him. How sweet!
I forgot one beauty. I'll get her.
Yes, Seiran-san.
- Come on, kid! - Do I have to go?
Yes, thank you.
I'll get my things. One moment, please.
Grigory?
Is that a picture of your boyfriend?
Well, yes.
Have a good time. Everybody's got a partner.
If that's the case, I should have nailed the Kid better.
If you could do that, the police wouldn't have to struggle so much.
Natsumi-san,
So you've been living in Paris since you were 20?
That's right. So my Japanese
a little strange sometimes.
Ah, strange Japanese my ass,
There's a saying I've heard since I was a little kid.
And what is it?
Barushe, nikukattabeka.
I think it's supposed to mean "whether Barshe bought meat?".
But I can't think of anyone who was called that.
Natsumi-san, your eyes are...
Yes, they're gray.
Just like mother's and grandmother's.
I guess we inherited my great-grandmother's color.
Speaking of which, Seiran-san's eyes are gray, too.
Really! Do Chinese people have gray eyes too?
Um, your name is written as "Blue Orchid," right?
My name also means orchid.
Seiran is the Japanese reading.
My real name is Chinlan.
Chinran?
CHIN
"Sei" is "Chin" and "ran" is "Ian."
LAN
"Hoshi" reads "Pu-su." So Pu-su Chinlan.
PU SU CHIN LAN
"Ran" remains "Ran" in Chinese, then.
Yes, "Môri" reads "Maoli".
So my name is Ran Maori.
That sounds kind of cute.
And what about me?
Sonoko Suzuki-san gives Linmu Yi Antsu.
Ri-rinmu yu antsu...?
Um, Seiran-san, I guess you're about my age?
Yes, I am 27.
- So you are! Which month? - May, it's the fifth of May.
What? Me on the third of May! Two days apart!
Then you're both one day apart from mine.
One day apart? May 4th?
MAY 3RD / MAY 4TH / MAY 5TH
The same day as Shin'ichi!
It's such a coincidence...
Is it possible...
Is Conan-kun possibly...?
That's bullshit.
As if that's possible.
Just because I keep thinking about him...
I'm so stupid.
Oh!
Natsumi-san and Seiran-san!
Will you join us?
- Aren't we interrupting? - No, not at all.
You are a truly sensual appearance!
A hopeless case, the old man!
There you go.

Thank you very much.
Sagawa-san, this pendant...
You really are a Romanov specialist.
Good point.
Want to take a look?
Oops,
did he already have it on?
Maria.
Is that the ring
of Maria, the third daughter of Nicholas II?
If you say so, it will be.
Where did you get it?
Is it real?
Well..,
...you'd have to examine it closely.
Nishino-kun, your pen's about to fall out.
Oh, thank you.
Môri-san! Is Môri-san here?
- Is there food at last? - That's terrible!
Sagawa-san...
He's dead in his room!
What? Sagawa-san...
Sagawa-san...
His right eye!
When he was shot... Kid's right eye too...
Hey, kids don't belong here!
Are you okay?
The cheeks are starting to stiffen.
He can't have been dead for 30 minutes.
His ring is gone!
Mr. Chairman, this is a homicide.
Notify the police!
J... Yes.
Yes, sir. I'll be right there.
Ah, Inspector Megure.
Shiratori-kun. I thought you were on vacation in Karuizawa.
POLICE OFFICER SHIRATORI
It was so boring at the cottage.
A case?
That's fine.
You come too.
Inspector, we've been expecting you.
Why do crimes always happen where you go?
Well, I guess it's God's will.
Aren't you that God yourself?
Also called the Angel of Death.
Shiratori was quite biting.
Huh? You've got a band-aid there.
Eh? Well, I had a fight with the perp yesterday.
The victim is Ryû Sagawa, 32.
A freelance reporter.
Inspector!
It was a robbery-homicide. The killer stole a ring.
- A ring? - Yes.
The ring of Maria, daughter of Nicholas II.
Sagawa-san wore it as a pendant around her neck.
He could have just taken the ring from him.
But he trashed the room
and even slashed the pillow!
What are you doing here again?
This was on the floor.
A ballpoint pen?
M. NISHINO
M. Nishino?
So this pen is
undoubtedly yours, Nishino-san?
J... Yes, but why was it in Sagawa-san's room?
It was you who discovered the body, wasn't it?
That's right.
Dinner was served and I went to get him.
Did you enter the room?
No.
Then why was your pen on the floor
if you weren't in the room?
I don't know.
What were you doing around seven thirty?
Um, around ten past seven I took a shower in my room and then went to bed.
and then went to bed.
Dad, Nishino-san wouldn't...
No, that's completely unthinkable.
If Nishino-san killed Sagawa-san, it's very likely...
it's very likely that he shot the Kid as well.
Inspector Megure,
we found no videotapes in the victim's room.
in the victim's room.
- What?
That's why the devastation!
Hey, Conan! Don't just walk around here!
It's okay. I'm going.
Ran-san. There's a murderer on the loose with a gun.
Please go join the others.
- But Conan-kun is... - I'm going to...
I'll get him back. Please, please...
Please...
Leave it to me.
Ah, Professor? It's me.
I need you to do some research.
What? A sniper aiming for the right eye?
Got it. I'll check it out. Call me back in ten minutes.
Ten minutes it is.
Imagination?
I got it, Shin'ichi!
According to ICPO's crime information...
there is a robber whose age and sex are unknown.
His name is
Scorpion.
Scorpion?
Here he is! He was under Nishino-san's bed!
That's impossible!
Here's the smoking gun.
Wait, Inspector! I didn't do it!
If you didn't do it,
why was the ring there?
I don't understand!
The perpetrator is nine to one the Scorpion.
In that case, Nishino-san should be the Scorpion.
Huh?
Rice husks in the pillow?
Conan!
Nishino-san, could it be that you are allergic to feathers?
Yes, that's right.
Then Nishino-san can't be the culprit.
What?
It's okay, go ahead.
J... Yes.
After all, Sagawa-san's room was full of feathers.
The culprit had even shredded the feather pillow.
Someone with a feather allergy wouldn't do that.
Are you really allergic to feathers?
Yes. I can testify to that.
When he gets near feathers..,
he can't stop sneezing.
That's why Nishino-san's pillow is not made of feathers.

I see. That's why Nishino-san escaped from Ran's room,
because there was a pigeon there!
If that's so, then who is the culprit?
Inspector, do you know the Scorpion?
Scorpion?
He steals the treasures of the Romanov dynasty and kills his opponents...
and kills his opponents with a shot in the right eye.
A bad guy.
Oh, now that you mention it, there's an international manhunt
there's an international manhunt.
Eh?
You mean the killer is...?
I think it's that Scorpion guy.
He probably shot the Kid, too.
- Kid's monocle had a crack in it. - Kid's monocle was cracked.
The scorpion shot the Kid..,
to get the egg that the Kid was carrying.
How do you even know about the scorpion?
- Uh, well, uh... - Professor Agasa told you about it.
Isn't that right, Conan-kun?
Yes.
Oh, dear,
That look I felt earlier..,
...was Shiratori's.
The secret's coming out. Let it stay.
"The secret comes out."
Does that mean Shiratori?
But if the Scorpion is the culprit..,
why did he hide the stolen ring in Nishino-san's room?
That doesn't make sense to me either.
Too bad.
I can't use the anesthetic chronometer in front of Shiratori.
Never mind.
Nishino-san, you and Sagawa-san..,
You know each other, right?
Yesterday at the museum, Sagawa-san was really scared at the sight of you.
Really?
You've traveled a lot abroad.
You must have met him somewhere there.
You met Sagawa-san?
Yes.
That was three years ago when I was traveling in Asia.
He was filming a girl whose house had been burned in the civil war.
I admonished him in vain, and that's when I spontaneously hit him.
Then Sagawa-san was angry with Nishino-san.
- For sure! - I got it!
Nishino-san, you were the scorpion!
Hey, hey.
Môri-kun, we know now that that's not the case.
Oh, that's right.
You were really lucky.
Well, if the Scorpion hadn't killed Sagawa-san..,
you'd be the one who stole the ring.
Wait a minute.
I see.
This case is not about two eggs,
but two cases that overlapped.
Two cases.
That's right.
In the first case.
Sagawa-san wanted to frame Nishino-san.
He wanted to make
Nishino-san as a thief.
so he intentionally showed his ring.
While Nishino-san was taking a shower, he sneaked into the room
and hid his ring under his bed.
Then he took the pen,
to draw suspicion to Nishino-san.
But before that
the second case occurred.
Sagawa-san was
murdered by the scorpion.
The perpetrator was probably
a tape that might have exposed him, and the ring.
But
the ring was no longer around Sagawa-san's neck.
He searched the room for it and devastated it.
Madness, uncle.
Great deduction!
That was child's play for me!
That means the Scorpion is still hiding aboard this ship.
For that matter,
there's a lifeboat missing.
What?
Are you saying the Scorpion took the lifeboat?
I've sent out a search for the boat,
but it's gonna be hard to find.
He got away.
I wonder if the Scorpion really escaped.
In any case, I'm relieved that the murderer is no longer on board...
is no longer on board. Isn't it?
Yes. Very reassuring.
However, the scorpion is probably hungry for the second egg...
and will probably appear in the castle of the Kôsakas.
No, he'll already be on his way there.
Inspector Megure, when we arrive in Tôkyô tomorrow,
I would like to go with the others
with the others.
Understood. Do it.
You heard him.
- There's no way you're coming this time! - No,
- let's take Conan-kun with us. - What?
His unique ideas might come in handy.
His...?
Yes.
TÔKYÔ, AUGUST 24
Man, Conan really drives me up the wall!
That's right! Since he's been in Ôsaka, he hasn't called in once!
He has no sense of what it means to be a member of the Detective Boys.
Professor,
haven't you found that driver's license yet?
I left it here, didn't I...?
If we don't hurry..,
Edogawa-kun will arrive before us.
Ai-kun, you're really good at finding misplaced things.
I just found another nuisance.
Hello, Professor!
Môri-san,

Sagawa-san's ring, I wonder if it was really Maria's?
Well,
For the time being, Inspector Megure has taken it to have it examined.
Maria was the gentlest of the four sisters.
and is said to have had large, gray eyes.
Gray eyes?
Just like Natsumi-san and Seiran-san.
You must know that after the Russian Revolution...
the entire tsar's family was shot.
However, the bodies of Maria and the crown prince were not found.
So that's how it was.
YOKOSUKA
A beautiful castle!
It resembles Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany,
which served as a model for Cinderella's castle.
Yikes?
Why is it a German-style castle anyway?
Natsumi's great-grandmother was Russian, wasn't she?
- Hello, Conan! - Conan-kun!
Are you okay?
Professor, what are you doing here?
Conan-kun called me.
So I thought I'd stop by.
Here. I improved it like you asked.
Thank you.
But why did you bring those three?
They snuck into the car without my knowledge.
It's like a fairyland!
So there's treasure hidden in there.
How much "eel on rice" do you think it is?
Listen, kids!
You can't go in there!
- Yes! - We know that!
Know what? They're very obedient.
Inui-san is late.
Yes, he said he had to stop by somewhere.
Sorry, the preparations held me up.
What's with the luggage?
This is not going to be an expedition!
Oh well, well prepared saves worry, they say.
Be alert!
The scorpion could be unexpectedly close.
Yes, I know.
Ah, please lock up.
- I beg your pardon? - So the children can't get in.
Yes, sir.
Okay, let's go. Let's go.
What are you going to do?
We'll find the treasure first!
There must be another entrance!
Let's search!
- Let's go! - Hey!
This is the knight's room.
It's furnished with western armor and tapestries.
KNIGHT'S ROOM
LADIES ROOM
This is the ladies room.
The lady of the house liked to spend her time here.
She could relax best here, she said.
EMPEROR'S ROOM
You are now in the Emperor's Room.
I would
like to go to the bathroom.
Out to the right at the end of the hall.
Just as I thought.
The egg doesn't seem to be there. Never mind!
What's going on?
Kiichi-sama installed
installed this crime trap 80 years ago.
There are other such devices in this castle.
So be careful.
That is,
You should not try to run away, Inui-san.
A flashlight should be enough as a tool.
Kiichi-san really has a penchant for gadgets.
That means...
Does the castle have a basement?
No, there isn't.
Did the great-grandfather have a room on the first floor?
Well, he had an office.
Here you go.
Here are pictures of Kiichi-sama
and pictures of everyday sights he had in his day,
that he had in those days.
Natsumi-san, isn't there a picture of your great-grandmother?
You know, there is not a single one of her.
So I don't know what great-grandmother looked like.
That's strange.
There are so many photos of Kiichi-san.
Hey,
isn't that man Rasputin?
Yes, he is without a doubt.
There is also his signature "G. Rasputin".
G. Rasputin?
Pop, who was Rasputin?
Well, all I know..,
all I know is he was a big bad guy.
He was called
the mysterious preacher who was taken in by the tsar's family and who caused
caused the downfall of the Romanov dynasty.
For a while he held some influence,
but was eventually replaced by Prince Yusupov,
a relative of the tsar by marriage.
The body discovered in the river had a broken skull bone.
skull bone
and one eye was knocked out.
One eye...?
Inui-san, now it is not Rasputin but the second egg that is important.
That's easy to say.
But how are we going to find it in such a big building?
Uncle, give me that.
- Hey! - Air is coming up from underneath!
There's a secret cellar underneath us!
What?
That means that trick-loving Kiichi-san...
must have hidden a button here somewhere.
What's that?
The Russian alphabet.
Does it open the door to the secret cellar?
There must be a password.
Sergei-san, please take over pressing.
Good.
Reminder! Vospominanie, that must be it!
Vospominanie.
VOSPOMINANIE
Oops?
Then Kiichi Kôsaka!
Kiichi Kôsaka.
KIICHI KOSAKA

Nothing happens at all.
Natsumi-san, are there any words that have been passed down to you?
No, none.
Barushe Nikkukattabeka.
The phrase you told us about,
could be Russian.
What is he talking about?
Shh. Be quiet!
Natsumi-san, Barushe... What was that?
- Nikukattabeka. - Barushe nikukattabeka...?
Maybe you have to separate the syllables differently.
Baru sheni kukatta beka?
Barusheni...
Could it be "Volshebnik
Consa Veka"?
Exactly! It's "Volshebnik Consa Veka".
VOLSHEBNIK CONSA VEKA
What does it mean?
In English it means "The wizard of the last century".
Um, in Japanese...
The magician of the last century.
The wizard of the last century?
That sounds familiar...
It was in Kid's letter!
That's right! What a coincidence.
Coincidence?
I wonder if it's really a coincidence.
Well, let's try it out!
Volshebnik Consa Veka.
What's that sound?
Something... here?
You did it, boy!
Don't go! It's locked here too!
Damn, if we
the others will find the treasure before we do.
Hey, Ai-kun, where are you going?
I just want to take a look at the tower.
Haibara! Is there...
- Is there anything there? - It must be the treasure.
That sounds good.
It's open here.
Oops.
What, Haibara, there's nothing here.
I didn't say there was.
Hey,
give up and let's go home...
What?
Oh, my God!
Hey you, that hurt!
You have a soft stomach.
We didn't hurt ourselves at all like that.
What's that?
A snake!
Not a snake, it's a rope ladder.
It's quite old.
Apparently it was once attached at the top and snapped off.
It scared the hell out of me.
What do we do? Wait for the professor to come to our rescue?
Or do we go on?
- Well... - Of course...
Let's go!
- Say, Natsumi-san... - Yes?
Why is the password "The Magician of the Last Century"?
I think that's what my great-grandfather was called.
At the age of 16, he exhibited mechanical dolls...
at the World's Fair in Paris in 1900
and from there he went directly to Russia.
That's right. 1900 is indeed
the last century.
It's still going on.
Quite deep.
What is it?
- There was a faint sound. - The scorpion?
- I'll go check it out! - Conan-kun!
I'm going.
Môri-san, stay here with the others.
Got it.
Ah! You...?
Ah! It's you!
Conan-kun.
Really.
In this world, your love is something
...is something I desire.
What are they thinking?
It's no big deal, Môri-san,
- the more, the merrier. - Yes, but...
...the mystery is solving itself.
You haven't...
Oops?
- A dead end? - I wonder if we went the wrong way.
It can't be. There was only this way.
That means there's a trick?
Oh, so many birds!
Yikes!
That's strange. The big bird has two heads.
The double-headed eagle.
The emperor's coat of arms.
Behind the crown you can see the sun.
The sun...
Light...
About...
Shiratori-san,
shine a beam of light...
on the crown.
Yes, good.
It lit up.
What?
Everybody back!
An entrance?
I see.
In the crown
there must be a light meter.
Wow!
W... what mechanism?!
It's like we're inside an egg.
What's that?
A coffin.
The construction is western,
but it's local wood.
What kind of huge castle?
Natsumi-san! The key!
Oh, yes.
That's what the key was for...
That is,
the egg is in the coffin?
Do you mind if I open it?
Yes, please.
It's heavy.
A person's bones.
And the egg.
He holds the egg in his arms while he sleeps.
Natsumi-san, do these bones belong to your great-grandfather?
No, probably
my great-grandmother is here.
In Yokosuka, there is only great-grandfather's grave.
I always found it surprising.
It is quite possible
that she, being Russian.
she could not be buried
in the family grave.
Natsumi-san,
I feel uncomfortable saying this,
but could you please show us the egg?
Yes.
Please.
There is a small opening at the bottom.
Empty?
- That can't be! - What do you mean?
Empty?
Is this a matryoshka?
Matryoshka?
We have one of those at home.
A friend of Dad's brought it back from Russia as a souvenir.

What is this? This Mato Ryo Shika?
It is a Russian doll, which contains other, smaller
dolls are included.
In fact, this is quite possible.
Look.
The inner grooves are apparently to fix the second egg in place.
Heck, if we had the other egg, we could check it out!
I have the egg.
I was expecting something like this, and I borrowed it
from the chairman.
You wouldn't have taken it without permission, would you?
A... well, really, as if I would do such a thing.
Let's try it out right now!
It fits perfectly.
So Kiichi-san didn't make two different eggs,
but two eggs in the shape of one.
- You look dissatisfied. - Yes.
I have a feeling that the egg has some kind of mechanism.
A mechanism
worthy of the magician of the last century.
That's a magnificent diamond.
No, it's not a diamond.
Isn't it just ordinary glass?
Glass?
Wait a minute. Wasn't there
on the back of the lid?
Kiichi-san's room...
Light and mechanism...
And then that pedestal!
No doubt about it! The glass in the eggs
has the function of lenses!
Sergei-san, give me the egg!
You again!
Please wait, Môri-san!
Can I help?
I need light!
Please focus the light and
- and put it in the socket. - Good.
Sergei-san, Seiran-san, put out the candles, please!
What on earth are you up to?
Just watch.
We can see inside the egg.
No one has raised it, yet the figures are rising.
Inside the egg is a light knife.
What's that?
That's...
These are pictures of the family of Tsar Nicholas!
I see,
the figures inside the egg didn't just
reading a book...
A photo album.
So that's why it's called a Memories Egg.
If the tsar's family hadn't been murdered and got
had received this egg...
One cannot imagine a more beautiful gift.
He was indeed the magician of the last century,
your great-grandfather.
If great-grandfather
could hear this, I'm sure he would be pleased.
Tell me, Natsumi-san,
isn't the one in the photo your great-grandfather?
The photo where they are both sitting on the bench.
That's right.
Then the woman next to him must be my great-grandmother.
That is my great-grandmother.
I finally get to see her.
Only this photo was taken in Japan.
Kiichi-sama must have added it later.
Oops? That woman...
She looks like...
Natsumi-san.
This egg is Kiichi-san's,
no, it's Japan's great inheritance.
Russia renounces the right of ownership, also concerning the inner egg.
In your hands, the egg has the greatest value.
Thank you very much.
But the inner egg belongs to Chairman Suzuki.
I will explain the situation to the chairman.
I'm sure he will understand.
Where did Inui-san go?
There was no picture
of Rasputin.
He was a friend of the tsar's family.
Yes, even in Kiichi-san's room...
Is the "Ge"...
Oh no!
In any case, it had a happy ending.
That's...!
Well then...
Look out!
What are you doing, Conan?
Don't pick it up, Ran!
Ran!
Shin'ichi...
On the floor!
The egg!
- Shit! You can't escape me! - Don't!
Môri-san, watch the others!
Shin'ichi...
Inui-san!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Surely there's a button somewhere to open from the inside.
Only here, the shape is different.
Wait a minute!
That's out of the question,
for you to leave here on your own!
I know your identity!
You may pretend to be Chinese..,
but you're really Russian. Aren't you?
A descendant of the preacher Rasputin.
Seiran-san.
W... what is this?
The way is blocked!
Does that mean we can't get out?
Come with me, all of you!
What?
I said follow me!
J... yes.
I didn't notice it at first.
The voice of Sagawa?
If your Chinese name
PUSU CHINRAN
Pu-Su Chinran in a different order,
you get Rasupuchin.
...RA SU PU CHIN
S... You...
I killed you, didn't I?
The treasures of the Romanov dynasty
were supposed to go to Rasputin, who had a deep connection
who had a deep connection with the tsar's family.
That was your idea,
so you wanted to seize the treasures for your ancestor.
Your shooting in the right eye
is probably because you want to avenge his murder.
I... Inui?

I am alone.
What?
This is a voice transposer.
You can imitate voices with it.
Who are you?
Conan Edogawa,
a detective.
You killed Sagawa-san because your identity would have been revealed.
Sagawa-san had visited each room...
and recorded them on tape.
Surprised, you forgot to turn over the photo.
Which showed not your friend,
but Grigory Rasputin.
The initial letter in English is "G."
In Russian, however, it is "Γ."
Therefore, when I saw the signature of Rasputin,
I didn't know what to make of it.
When you thought that Sagawa-san might have taken Rasputin's picture,
you killed him.
Didn't you, Seiran-san?
No, Scorpion!
You got that right, kid.
You killed Inui-san,
because he probably
because he probably saw you screw the silencer onto the gun.
Oh, almost like you were watching.
But you shot the old man because he talked bad about Rasputin.
Pop, who was Rasputin?
Well, all I know..,
all I know is that he was a big bad guy.
Besides, you were gonna kill Ran!
You've talked enough.
I'm sorry..,
but you're going to die too.
This gun is a Walther PPK/S after all.
The number of bullets in the magazine
is eight!
Inui-san and the old man, one on Ran
and just five shots.
There are no bullets left.
Then I'll tell you something nice.
If there's already
one bullet in the gun, and you load the magazine with eight rounds..,
that's nine shots!
In short,
it means that this gun still has one bullet in it.
Then shoot it.
If there really is a bullet in it.
Silly boy.
Why?
Tough luck, Scorpion.
These are the glasses the professor
...with special hard lenses.
Conan-kun, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Come on, let's go,
Let's get out of here!
Conan-kun!
Phew, saved.
That's terrible! The castle's on fire!
Conan-kun...
Shin'ichi...
Fool...
- Conan-kun! - Conan!
What's wrong?
Don't shout like that.
Conan-kun!
This egg was retrieved by Mr. Shiratori from the scorpion.
Shiratori?
So? What happened to the scorpion?
He arrested him and took him away.
The scorpion named Seiran-san.
What?
Seiran-san was the Scorpion?
Here, I'm supposed to give this to you.
Thank you.
That Seiran-san with the beautiful legs was the scorpion...
Natsumi-san,
I'm so sorry it's come to this.
Well, the castle is on fire,
but I still have the precious egg that great-grandfather made.
Also, the basement room will surely remain intact.
Yes,
when everything has calmed down, let's go to
bury the dear great-grandmother in Kiichi-sama's grave.
In the end, the Kid did not appear.
I wonder if he died after all.
No, the guy is still alive.
Uncle is already asleep.
He must have been pretty broken.
That's just the way it is.
It's been a tough day.
Ran-nêchan?
Thank you for..,
for saving me.
You were really great.
Almost like Shin'ichi...
Really...
just like Shin'ichi...
Ran...
But
you're someone else?
That's right, isn't it?
Conan-kun?
I guess that's it.
You know..,
Ran...
To be honest...
I'm...
Shin'ichi...
Are you really Shin'ichi?
What's that supposed to mean?
I came to check on you because I heard you were involved in a case.
That's impossible!
Idiot!
Where were you? Not even a note!
I'm sorry. There was so much to do.
I have to leave tonight
I have to leave again tonight.
Wait! I'll get you something to dry off with.
Wait a minute, Kaitô Kid!
I fell for it.
You coming on the ship disguised as Mr. Shiratori...
Oh! Shiratori-kun!
What a great performance!
What are you talking about?
I've just returned...
I just got back from Karuizawa...
You knew..,
what was going to happen on the ship.
I wasn't sure.
But just in case, I had tapped the ship's phone.
One more thing. You were going to steal the egg...
to its rightful owner, Natsumi-san.
You knew that Kiichi Kôsaka had made the egg.
and that he was called "the magician of the last century".
Hence the phrase in your announcement.
What else did you notice?
Natsumi-san's great-grandmother

was Tsar Nicholas' third daughter Maria. Is that what you mean?
Maria's body was never found.
Because Kiichi-san saved her from being shot...
and she escaped to Japan with him.
The love of the two sprouted buds
and they had a child.
But shortly after the birth, Maria died.
Kiichi-san wanted to protect Maria's body from the revolutionary army
and sold her jewelry to build the castle.
But he did not choose a Russian castle,
but a German one,
since Maria's mother,
Tsarina Alexandra, was German.
Thus
Maria's body was buried together with the egg in the secret cellar.
And in the second egg he left
a clue to the castle.
He hoped that his descendants would discover it.
Well, from that point of view, all the mysteries were solved.
Let me tell you this.
There are things in this world that are better left secrets.
In fact
it is probably better if this mystery remains a mystery.
Can you solve the riddle, master detective?
Why did I appear as Shin'ichi Kudô...
and saved you, my troublesome enemy?
Shin'ichi!
Idiot!
It's not a riddle or anything.
You saved me...
In return for taking care of your pigeon.
Isn't it?

Why didn't you hold him back? Conan-kun?!
Well, Shin'ichi said he would come back.
