DETECTIVE MÔRI
Hey, Pops, it's ringing!
Yes, I know.
Yes, this is Detective Agency Môri.
Kogorô Môri?
Yes, who is this?
I've planted a bomb.
What? A bomb?
It will go off at exactly 3:30.
If you want to stop it, break the following code.
You're kidding! Any more of this nonsense
and I'll report you!
What's so funny?
- Look out the window! - Huh?
Out the window?
What should be out there?
No!
Unbelievable!
THE 11TH STRIKER
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran..,
I observed men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on it,
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He was administering a poison to me. And when I
regained consciousness,
my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive,
I will be in danger, as will the people around me.
Professor Agasa advised not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked what my name was,
I said Conan Edogawa.
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father is a detective.
Where is the professor?
He must be looking for the driver's license.
It's always the same.
Hurry up! Otherwise I won't get Hide's autograph anymore!
We'll win the lottery...
You don't get a chance like this to meet the real J-League every day.
Ayumi, Genta, Mitsuhiko.
They're my classmates now.
I guess the J-League is the thing right now.
Here he comes!
I'm sorry. I couldn't find my driver's license.
I knew it!
- Really. - Professor...
This is Hiroshi Agasa.
And this,
Ai Haibara.
You know my true identity.
What are you mumbling to yourself?
The sports land is waiting!
If you dawdle like that, we'll leave you here!
Ah! Yes!
You forgot something.
You know, your spell.
That's right.
I'm small, but my mind isn't.
No case remains unsolved!
There's always
only one truth!
These are the 16th kick-offs. Soccer Lessons
sponsored by the J-League and
Nichiuri TV!
The J-League!
Endô and Konno!
- Narazaki and... -...Nakamura are here too!
Let's get started then.
- Yes! - Hey, you with #10.
Kengo Nakamura
from Kawasaki Frontale.
What's wrong, Conan-kun?
He wants me to take a break. He wants to start with four kids.
Excuse me, you're Kogorô Môri, aren't you?
Huh?
My name is Yamamori. I'm a sports editor
at Nichiuri TV.
Aah...
I'm very excited to meet the famous detective
Môri.
Kôda-chan, a photo please!
Yes, please!
Thank you! This is Kaoru Kôda.
This is Kaoru Kôda. A photographer at Nichiuri Newspaper.
She used to work in news,
but was transferred to sports.
Yamamori-san, this doesn't belong here.
If you get some scoops in front of your lens here,
you can go back to the news, right?
Yes.
Well, good luck for the fight!
For you, too.
If the ratings don't go up on soccer,
the boss is going to want to fire you, isn't he?
Yes, that's right.
- Do you have a good idea, Môri-san? - Huh?
Hm...
- Let's see. - Asking the old man...
Yes, I have one!
You do?
Yes! Me and Yôko-chan will be your guests!
I'm sure it'll boost the ratings!
So, Yôko-chan.
- Her schedule is packed. - Look at them!
The kids turned out really well!
They sure did.
It makes you look away for a moment...
Unbelievable!
How effective lessons with a professional are.
Ran, you don't seem to have much interest in soccer, do you?
Not at all. I often watch it on TV with Conan.
But you've never played?
That's right,
but once in junior high.
a ball flew past Shin'ichi...
I see.
- He was... - Huh?
What's wrong, Ran?
Nothing's wrong.
Well? That guy...
No doubt about it. The genius striker.
That's Kazumasa Nakaoka!
The genius striker?
Yes.
Three years ago.
he helped Haido School win the national championship.
He was rumored to be going to the Spirits,
who saw him as a future ace.
But a month later, he had a motorcycle accident.
Since then, he had disappeared from the soccer world.
For him to show up here....
Yes,
Maybe he still cares about soccer.
Good! You've gotten better.

- Let's switch. - Yes!
Hey, you with the number 10!
- Conan-kun, he's calling you! - Yeah.
Oh, man, it's finally my turn.
Not bad, kid!
Hello, Môri-senpai!
My name is Ryôsuke Sakaki.
- At Beika University... - Ah!
Sakaki, the own-goal scorer!
- Own goal? - Yes, the own goal.
This one
scored an own goal in the final match and thus traded
Beika University
its first defeat in five years.
Oh, you knew about that.
Of course I knew!
I was watching from the stands!
How long ago was that?
Ten years.
It's a trauma
and I still dream about it.
Dad!
Don't bring up such old stories.
Well...
And now?
I work in a gym
coaching youth soccer.
Hey, that sounds great!
There's someone I really want you to meet.
He's a big fan of yours.
Do you have a little time to spare?
J... yes...
Thank you very much! In a minute, I'll bring him right over!
What are you doing?
Phew. I give up.
- Oh, my God! - That was great!
Inside, he's just a soccer boy.
- Way to go, Conan-kun! - Thanks.
Hey!
Huh?
Wow! What a man!
Wow! The real Higo!
Shin'ichi Kudo...
Do you know him?
- Ä... um... - Shin'ichi...
You know Shin'ichi?
Ah? Yes.
I saw one of his games once
I talked to him.
The kid resembles him.
The way he kicks the ball.
I'm sure it's because Shin'ichi taught me how to play soccer.
I see.
You had lessons with him.
Keep on playing soccer!
Yes!
- You're doing great! - Higo patted you!
- You're to be envied! - Better not wash your hair!
Yeah, good idea. Ah!
Hey, don't do that!
Wash it.
Huh?
- I'll pet you too. - Me too!
Hey, stop it! Stop it!
Thanks for waiting, Môri-senpai.
Does it suit you?
Yes.
Let me introduce you.
He's the boss of a small factory in Haido...
and chairman of the team sponsors,
Mr. Keiichirô Motoura.
Motoura my name.
You are very famous.
Oh, thank you.
Mr. Motoura is a big fan.
When he heard you were here,
he wanted to meet you.
That's how it is.
I really want you to look at photos.
Me?
Yes.
Please, here it is.
Ah... yes.
We want to see it too!
Yeah, let's see it!
Really.
What's that? That guy...
Conan-kun, you come look too!
Yeah, come on!
This picture?
My son, Tomofumi.
Please keep scrolling.
Yes, good.
He looks happy.
Is your son here today, too?
Well, yes,
Tomofumi died this year
in August this year.
He was a fourth grader.
That's how it is.
Actually Tomofumi was
was weak by nature
and the doctor forbade him to exert himself.
And these pictures?
He really wanted to play soccer
and I asked Mr. Sakaki
to let him join the team.
He allowed it
and let him play a game once.
The photos show him doing so.
Here he scores a goal.
Great!
He was really good at soccer.
- Yeah, looks great. - That's right.
Hm.
That must be the last one.
And why should I look at it?
Well,
I wanted to show you that Tomofumi was really alive.
I spoiled the mood.
Sorry.
The athletes of the J-League are asked,
in 20 minutes...
I feel so thoughtful.
- Yes, you do. - Thoughtful?
That's right! In a case like this...
- Huh? - But not...
About...
Our usual quiz will make us cheerful again!
Well then,
join us all!
On a footballer's car,
using soccer jargon,
the doors close particularly well.
So, which technical word from the following is it?
First: offside.
Second: hand.
Third: corner kick.
Fourth: yellow card.
Is the difficulty level too high this time?
Conan-kun, do you know?
- Yes, the answer is... - Second.
Hand as in hand game.
The doors close well.
So, not a hand's width open.
No hand fits.
No hand!
Right!
That was great, Mr. Endô!
Not only soccer, they're smart too!
Hi!
Sorry I'm late.
- Takahiro! You're late! - I overslept...
Who's that?
That's Sanada.
He was promoted from the youth squad.
and is the replacement for striker Higo.
Missing the first half

is quite brazen.
I just can't with kids.
Hey, you there!
I am not just a substitute.
I am the substitute. Remember that!
Cut it out, Sanada!
Hide-san!
I've declared you my rival.
Huh?
Next game, we'll see who's better.
You have to come into the game first.
Of course I will.
A challenge. How exciting!
That's good.
The final match between Spirits and Big will be broadcast by us.
We'll make sure there's a good atmosphere.
Good luck to you both in the fight!
- Hey! Don't look! - Why?
I'm not done yet.
Don't be like that.
- When the article's done... - K.K.?
- What do you mean? - Hide, weren't you leaving?
Oh, right!
Well, Sanada.
We'll continue with the final match at Toto Stadium!
Hide looks great in the race, too.
I don't like racing at all.
- Me neither. - Goodbye J-League, I guess.
- That's not true. - Huh?
Slow players
there are a lot of slow players in the J-League.
Is that true?
If you're not that fast, you just start running earlier.
But to do that, you have to exercise your judgment,
to predict the course of the game.
Exactly.
It's a matter of thinking faster
and not to run faster.
There are many players
who are slow and who
rely on mental strength.
What seems to be a disadvantage for others,
can actually become an advantage
if you learn to use your potential properly.
Understand. The words of a professional are very profound.
I say.
Do you have any other questions?
- Yes! - Yes?
Can you teach me the tricks of the free kick?
Quite cheeky for your age.
- But it doesn't matter. - Huh?
We still have some time.
Shall I show you one?
- Really? - Oh yes!
The kick is frontal.
It's more of a fetch up than a kick.
Goal!
Endô has taken a wonderful free kick!
Fourth minute! Gamba Ôsaka are off to a good start!
Wow! That was like the free kick from the other day!
Hey, Conan-kun!
Who are you cheering for?
As a Tokyoite, you shouldn't be cheering for the Osaka team!
It's okay.
Here. Wear these and cheer for the Spirits.
What, but that's...
Don't worry. I bought a new one.
Big Osaka?
- You are... - You're wrong.
I like the color.
You just won't admit it.
No!
Unbelievable!
Then let's get on with it.
Crack the following code.
What?
A blue boy and a blue zebra.
Rain from above.
From below, human points with left hand staying on left tree.
Wha... wait a minute.
With left what?
With left hand staying on left tree.
- With left band staying on left... - Not ribbon!
Hand! Like hand in hand game!
Show man with left hand staying on left tree.
Now,
the game begins.
You...
If you lose this game,
there will be dead and injured!
BLUE BOY...
What do you want?
What's your goal?
You'll soon find out.
Good luck in the fight!
Wait! That's not enough! Give me a hint!
Give me a hint!
Next Beika.
Next Beika.
Wait! Hello! Hello!
Pops?
Damn. Hanging up.
NO ADMITTANCE
POLICE
A blue boy and a blue zebra.
Rain from above.
From below man points
with left hand staying on left tree.
And as a tip:
Next Beika.
Next Beika.
No matter how many times I read it, I don't see the point.
Hm.
Commissioner Megure!
The bomb was determined!
The explosive used was
Plastic explosives..,
...and detonated over the phone.
That's how it is.
We were lucky that there were only light injuries.
Who knows what the next explosion will be like.
We have one hour and five minutes left.
In the meantime.
we've got to solve this puzzle.
I've got it!
I know it!
The bomb is hidden in Haido Park!
Haido Park?
My clue is the ,, Next Beika.
Next Beika."
What do you mean, Môri-kun?
It means a station before Beika Station.
So the Haido or Midoridai station.
And in Haido Park, which is near Haido Station,
there's a fountain.
Fountain?
That's the rain from above!
Yes.
There is a statue of a boy with a zebra there!
But what do the other terms mean?
We'll find out on the spot!
- Hooray! - Counterattack!
Go!
Madness!
This way!
Get out of the way! Excuse me! Make way, please!
- Hurry up! - Yes!

There he is!
Fact. A stone statue.
But that...
That's not a zebra,
It's a donkey.
The guy must have got it mixed up.
They're not blue.
He thought they were blue.
- All right? Wait! - Môri-san, what...
- I'm going to find the bomb! - Dad!
Good. The rest of us will close the park immediately.
Evacuate all visitors immediately!
Yes, sir!
A blue boy and a blue zebra.
Rain from above.
From below, human points with left hand, staying on
left tree!
That's him!
The bomb is under the left tree!
Under that tree?
Good.
We'll take it from here.
You two get out of the park.
Yes!
The Spirits are looking for the equalizer!
Uemura rushes forward on the left!
Shot to the midsection.
A classy cross! Akagi jumps forward!
Goal!
Goal! Goal!
Goal!
Akagi and Uemura score the equalizer with their combo!
SPIRITS 1:1 GAMBA
- Hooray! - True Tokyoites, those two!
Hide and Naoki as strikers are worth their weight in gold!
There was no bomb?
We didn't find one under the tree on the left.
And the other one? The right tree?
We dug there too.
But there was nothing there.
We're searching the other trees, too, but
but it's possible
but it's possible that the caller's riddle
was referring to a different location.
It can't be!
So many people!
It's always crowded at the booths at halftime.
The second half still starts without us!
From Ran.
Wait, I have to pee.
Please pick up, Shin'ichi.
Yes, this is Kudô.
I can't take your call right now.
- Please leave a message... - I'm always out of luck!
Shin'ichi! Pops received a bomb threat over the phone.
- And a riddle! Time is short! - Ran!
- It's me! - Shin'ichi!
What's the riddle?
Okay. Are you ready?
Yes.
And the hint was: "Next Beika, next Beika," right?
The bomb is set to go off at 3:30.
We only have 40 minutes, Shin'ichi!
Got it. Give me some time!
A blue boy and a blue zebra.
Rain from above.
From below, human points with left hand staying on left tree.
What was there? It reminds me of something.
Damn!
It is on the tip of my tongue.
You guys! Do you know the Spirits and Gamba mascots?
Spirits' mascot is called Zebra-kun!
Zebras are good at kicking!
Do you know Gamba's mascot?
Of course I do! It's blue!
His name is Gamba Boy!
That's great! You guys know your stuff!
Gamba Boy is trying hard and...
Zebra... Gamba Boy...
That's it!
That's it!
With blue boy and blue zebra
were meant for the mascots!
Damn it!
Why didn't I think of that right away?
Are the...
Are the bombs
in this stadium?
Wait a minute!
There was a clue.
It's a fact!
I know it!
RAIN FROM ABOVE...
From above rain. Rain kanji is up!
RAIN
From below human. Leg radical.
Left hand. Hand radical.
Lead pointing. The kanji, show...
Left tree. Tree radical.
Each radical results in one character.
,, Show" to it gives:
Neon sign display board!
As proof serves the hint ,, Next Beika,
next Beika."
To be read inside the train on the neon sign display board!
No doubt!
The bombs are here
on the luminous display board!
Not good at all. I have to check it out!
- Conan-kun's really late. - Yeah.
I wonder if he got lost.
Professor!
Professor, the car keys, please!
- Conan-kun! - Where have you been?
I'll be right back!
Never mind that! Professor, hurry!
Ah, yes.
The kickoff of the second half.
In the first, the Spirits scored the equalizer.
No player changes so far.
Can they continue to maintain this energy?
Gamba hasn't made a change either.
Crap!
Isn't there anything I can get up to?
There!
And go!
There's a kid up there!
Get me up there!
That was close.
Rafinha versus Kihara!
Rafinha loses the ball,
Endo kicks it out to the side.
Takei comes in
and shoots a cross! A commotion in front of the goal!
Damn, I don't see one.
Consequently...
Akagi dribbles wildly and is blocked by Endô.
Akagi passes to Kihara,
Pass to Shimura. Nakata and Kurata!
Akagi dribbles past the defense.
A look inside. Shot!
Keepers punching!
Phew.
Keep it going! Go!
What?
Is that...
Kudô-kun?
Oh, no!
What's that?
The Spirits' No. 11 is having a heated discussion with the referee.

What a bummer! A penalty kick!
The other guy bumped the same way!
I'm sure he did!
Haibara-san?
The ball is ready.
He'll take the shot, of course:
Yasuhito Endo!
The ball is in! 2:1!
Gamba leads again!
Great timing, Haibara!
Kudô-kun, what are you doing up there?
The kids aren't with you?
No. Don't worry.
What?!
Bombs?
Yes. I haven't checked yet,
but they're probably
on the scoreboard.
Sorry!
I'll be in touch.
Wait! Kudô-kun!
Kudô-kun!?
There they are.
And attached right to the pillar that supports the tablet.
Wait a minute!
Then...
He wants the tablet to fall down!
Hello?
Kudô-kun?
Shin'ichi!
Mm. Yes.
What?
On the neon sign at Tôto Stadium?
Tôto Stadium?
Neon sign display board?
Yes.
Please evacuate the fans on the Spirits side.
Understood!
The bombs may be simple in design,
but defusing all of them...
What am I doing?
Think!
There must be..,
there must be another way!
Damn it!
If I can't stop them all...
Why did you hang up on me?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen carefully.
There are bombs.
The perpetrator plans to drop
on the Spirits fans at 3:30.
What?
That's in 30 minutes!
Yes.
The evacuation should start soon.
Make sure the kids don't
Don't let the kids do anything stupid.
Okay.
What about you?
I'll stop the tablet from crashing!
The Spirits attack again.
Shimura shoots.
They're fighting!
Header by Itazawa! Uemura goes for it!
He hits the crossbar!
But Akagi is ready to head the ball!
Akagi's second goal! The Spirits equalize!
- Hurray! - We did it, Mitsuhiko!
Hey, Genta-kun, that hurts.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Look!
What's going on?
A stadium employee is with the referee.
What's going on?
We're in the middle of the game.
Haibara-san!
Did you see Hide head the ball?
Ah, Ai-chan?
What's going on?
Honored visitors. A state of emergency has arisen.
What does that mean?
Is Shin'ichi involved?
...please follow the staff...
Bombs.
They are at the scoreboard,
Kudô said.
What... I beg your pardon?
I repeat. The visitors in the supporter seats on the Spirits side
please follow the staff onto the field.
Something must have happened!
But what? It makes me think.
Shall we go and check out the situation?
No!
You guys stay here until Edogawa-kun returns.
He'll take care of it.
I hope he comes back safely.
Okay.
That's not the way to do it. It'll take too much time.
I don't care how, I've got to protect that girder at least.
Only ten minutes left!
Damn it! Can I make it?
We're starting the evacuation. Please remain calm.
Avoid spacing yourself from the person in front of you.
Follow the instructions. Walk to the center of the field.
Walk calmly. Avoid spacing yourself from your...
What's going on?
I don't know, sir. It must be something serious.
You from the press.
Move to the center immediately.
We can't do it right away. The equipment is heavy.
It's dangerous. Leave everything here.
You're kidding!
Leaving the camera behind...
And anyway. What's going on?
As I was saying... Hey! You can't do that!
Come back here!
Put it on the Internet! Put it on the net!
Got it? I'll take responsibility!
You only have to do what I say! Is that clear?
That's good!
This is the area D3 to D4.
All empty!
- E seats clear! - F-seats clear!
- Hurry up! - Go to the center!
- Keep moving! - We're asking for support!
Hold on to your kids tight!
35 seconds left.
There's only one left.
Please, hold on!
Wow!
Kudô-kun.
Hooray!
With this, the numbers will skyrocket!
That's insane!
The scoreboard has exploded!
I did it! Now I've got my Scoop!
Don't push! Calm down!
Calm down!
- Please calm down. - Back away slowly.
Slowly!
Don't push! It's over!
No more explosions!
Has it stopped?
Please,
hang on!
Oh no!
It's breaking!
Run!
- What is it now? - An earthquake?
Don't worry! Calm down.

- What's happening? - Something's coming down!
- What's that? - The scoreboard!
Huh?
That's not good at all. They have to move it.
Impossible.
People are frozen with fear.
Damn it! We're too late.
Shin'ichi!
Hey, she stopped.
Wow! A miracle!
Just a little more!
Hold on!
Pull!
LIVE NEWS
LIVE NEWS WITH MIYANE
Good day.
Here are the live news with Miyane
from November 21.
Yesterday something bad happened at the J-League!
There was a huge explosion, which almost led to the
catastrophe.
Please see.
WHAT HAPPENED?
At the Tokyo Spirits game against Gamba Ôsaka
yesterday, the neon sign board exploded.
Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries. But since
in this matter
the famous detective Kogorô Môri is involved in this affair,
a reporter is on the scene!
Tabeta-san!
Yes. I'm Miyuki Tabeta, and I'm standing in front of the Môri Detective Agency.
Mr. Môri broke the code.
and saved the J-League.
But even before this big explosion, the culprit left
- here... - Thank you, Inspector,
for coming all this way.
As soon as I step outside, the press is all over me.
They're saying now..,
...that you've broken the code.
Well, as usual, Kudô-kun didn't want his name to be mentioned.
You don't have to talk standing up.
Please sit down.
- Yes. Thank you. - Yes!
- Ah, you little squirt! - By the way, Môri-kun...
I heard that you came up with something about the perpetrator.
Yeah, actually, I didn't think of anything myself,
It's this little guy.
Conan-kun?
He was asking Ran and me about the phone call...
...about the phone call with the criminal.
I was going to pass it on to Shin'ichi.
He seemed very concerned.
And what did you notice now?
Something the guy said to the uncle.
Not band!
Hand! Like hand in hand!
I've heard those exact words before.
Conan-kun, do you know?
- Yes, the answer is... - Second.
Hand as in hand play.
Indeed. That makes you wonder.
Saying hand as in hand play is rather unusual, isn't it?
Isn't it?
He was annoyed by the query and unconsciously said the first thing that came to his mind,
what came to his mind first.
Thus, the perpetrator committed a mistake.
And who all overheard Endô's words?
Excluding the league players and us, there are four suspects.
four suspects remain.
Shinzô Yamamori.
Kaoru Kôda.
Ryôsuke Sakaki.
Keiichirô Motoura.
These four are
as the main suspects in my investigation.
There is one more.
Huh?
Sitting on a bench nearby was
Kazumasa Nakaoka-san.
Kazumasa Nakaoka? The one from the national championships?
You know him?
Yes. Three years ago, I was at a game with my nephew.
Heavy snow delayed the start of the match, which was scheduled for 2:05.
and it didn't kick off until about 3:40.
The game went into overtime with a 0-0 score.
In the last four minutes, Nakaoka got the ball and scored the decisive goal.
and scored the decisive goal.
The game didn't end until ten to six.
With Nakaoka, we would then have five suspects.
We can't rule out the possibility that his choice of words was a coincidence.
But if the culprit wants to challenge me...
The only thing out of the ordinary lately
has been this soccer lesson.
Copy that. We'll be checking out those five in a bit.
DETONATE
NO ADMITTANCE
We have investigated the five that Conan-kun
Conan-kun pointed out.
- Shiratori-kun. Yes.
First, Yamamori-san.
Because of the explosion...
his ratings went up...
...and he escaped being demoted.
The explosion was good for him.
Next, Kôda-san.
The scoop photo increases the chance
of being transferred to the news.
She owes that to the explosion.
And now Sakaki-san.
So far we haven't found
no motive to blow up the stadium.
But
if the perpetrator's only intention was to provoke
to provoke Môri-san...
Because of his own goal in college.
you embarrassed Sakaki-san.
Aaah!
Sakaki, the own-goal scorer!
I didn't mean to tease him about it....
Besides, he was laughing.
That doesn't mean anything. It could look
...it could be very different in him.
Next, Motoura-san.
His only son Tomofumi
suffered an injury in August while watching a J-League match on television,
that was being played at Tôto Stadium..,
he had a seizure.

An ambulance took him to the hospital.
But the doctors were unsuccessful and he died.
Tôto Stadium...
Ambulance...
Huh?
What is it, Môri-kun?
It's nothing, it's just so familiar.
It does?
Or maybe not.
I thought I knew something. But
I guess I was wrong.
- But Pop! - Always these games of confusion.
Finally, Nakaoka.
Three years ago.
he had a motorcycle accident. He was operated on immediately
and went to rehab for half a year,
but his leg didn't get back to the way it was
and the deal with the Spirits fell through.
With the Spirits?
Yes.
He quit soccer
and went to South America.
Last year, in August, he came back.
In his native Gunma, he attracted attention by speeding with his motorcycle.
His lifestyle was wild.
Let's hold on:
Yamamori-san and Kôda-san
had a motive to blow up Tôto Stadium.
They could have easily planted bombs,
but such self-dramatization...
That Sasaki-san only resents Môri-san because of the mockery
Môri-san and now wants to challenge him,
is questionable.
I did not mock him!
What concerns me more,
is that Motoura's son had the seizure..,
after watching the J-League game
at the Tôto Stadium.
Yes.
I feel the same way.
But for him to resent the J-League just because of that is far-fetched.
Death is not directly related.
Um... yeah...
The problem is the last one. Nakaoka-san.
According to the police commissioner of Gunma...
He's driving around here like a maniac!
How can I put it? Yes,
like a wounded wolf looking for a place to die.
No kidding.
The fact that he didn't make it to the J-League
he brought on himself.
Still, he can blame the Tokyo Spirits..,
for canceling the agreement.
For these reasons.
we have set our sights on Kazumasa Nakaoka.
The motorcycle! Stop!
TOLLBOOTH
EXIT
What the fuck!
Why am I being tailed?
We are not tailing you.
Nonsense!
Someone has been standing in front of the store for hours!
What did I do?
Now, now, now.
We want to establish that you haven't done anything.
Splitting hairs of a cop. This is
disgusting!
Kazumasa Nakaoka. I'm arresting you for
for attempted assault and obstruction
and obstructing the police.
What? You arrested Nakaoka-san?
Yes.
Last night, when we were following him,
he flipped out and tried to hit me.
We questioned him when he calmed down this morning.
It seems he has nothing against the Spirits.
What?
What do you mean?
When the topic
about the agreement with the Spirits...
You're barking up the wrong tree!
I'm actually grateful to the Spirits
and I don't hate them.
Don't lie!
Explain!
Even the press doesn't know about this.
It wasn't the Spirits who revoked the deal.
That came from me.
I asked them to.
Huh?
After my accident.
they paid
they paid for the surgery and rehab.
And even though
my left leg was not one hundred percent fit,
they offered me a contract.
Even for just 15 minutes
they would have liked to have me as a striker.
But why then...
My pride wouldn't allow it!
If you can't play 90 minutes straight,
has no
has no right to play soccer.
Especially if you want to be a professional.
The Spirits have confirmed everything.
And
from the store owner we got this.
He sent the photo from South America.
Hm.
He looks very different from the way Commissioner Yamamura described him.
There's a note on the back.
I can't stop playing soccer.
I can't stop playing soccer.
I see.
Even if it looks different,
he might
contrary to expectations, he might like children and soccer.
But
if Nakaoka is not the culprit,
who is it?
That reminds me...
Suginami Sports Park.
Six o'clock in the morning. K.K.
Who's K.K.?
Well, then,
I'm here for now.
But where is K.K.?
Well, that's...
Morning! You're early, kid.
Ah, good morning!
I see.
K.K. means King Kazu.
That means Kazuyoshi Miura!
Excuse me.
What is it, boy?
Do you know Ms. Kaoru Kôda?
From the Nichiuri newspaper?
Kaoru Kôda?
Nichiuri?
Aah!
I don't know how,
but she knew that I train here.
She wanted to take pictures of me.
So that's how it is.
I declined.
Huh?
I'm a professional.
I want to be photographed in the game,
in the fight!
Especially when scoring a goal!
Yes.

This has nothing to do with the case.
Yes, exactly!
Kid, do you like soccer?
Well then...
Let's train!
Yes!

DETECTIVE MÔRI
Brr. That's cold.
Where did Conan-kun go?
What's this? So early in the morning?
Another announcement letter?
Oh, it's just a delivery for Dad.
Oh, that's...
- Oh, boy. - J... yes!
Thanks for
for working out with me.
No, I have to thank you!
As a thank you
I give you this!
A bracelet.
Thank you very much!
You are the second.
I gave a red bracelet to the boy before you.
That was 14, 15 years ago.
He was your age and trained with me.
He could shoot splendidly!
Is that kid in the J-League now?
Who knows?
I don't know his name.
If he's still playing soccer now,
he could be a pro.
Well, get home safe.
Yes.
- Well, see you later. - Yeah.
Hey! What are you looking at? It's so...
Yamamori-san!
Ah, Kaoru-chan.
Sorry, I was in a hurry. I was in a hurry.
We've both been busy since the incident.
Not like you by a long shot.
That serene smile.
You have something on your hand?
Well, who knows?
Then good luck for the fight!
But don't you dare try to outdo me.
Don't you dare! So long, I'm in a hurry!
Hey, hey!
Tsk. What is this woman up to?
This notebook...
O.Y. 3.12. SHIODOME ARENA
To Detective Môri. Don't think that it's over.
The next explosion will be seen by even more people right on the spot
on the spot
and go through a period of horror.
Exact clues will follow.
Good luck for the fight!
This morning
there was a letter from the courier service in the mailbox.
Pulling it out, I saw the card....
I see.
Excuse me.
Is the card really from the culprit?
Couldn't it be a prank?
No, it's most likely from him.
We published
...we published the puzzle last time..,
but we kept the last words under wraps.
The last words?
Ah!
Good luck for the fight.
Ah.
Good luck for the fight.
Yes,
And also at the end of this letter....
GOOD LUCK FOR THE FIGHT
Crap. He's playing with me.
But this time
there was no code, was there?
No. But there is a clue.
This place here.
The next explosion will be seen by even more people
will get to see it right there on the ground. I'm thinking,
that means the bomb is going to be in a place
where even more people are gathered.
The other day at Tôto Stadium, there were 80,000 people.
That is,
a place where more than 80,000 people are gathered.
Is there such a place?
Ah! Yes, there is!
Where, Chiba-kun?
There! The poster!
On December 3rd, the Shiodome Arena will host a concert by the
of the popular up-and-coming singers.
The 100,000 People Concert!
On December 3rd?
Wait! At the concert
- Yôko-chan is performing! - Yes.
Yôko-chan, no Yôko Okino-san will also perform.
How can you say that so calmly?
Well, how else...
The arena in which Môri-san's good friend Okino-san is performing,
will become an explosive object.
That can't be a coincidence.
If that's the case,
then the perpetrator really does have a grudge against Môri-kun.
But among these five, there is no one
...who holds such a grudge against Môri-san.
Um...
This has nothing to do with Môri-san,
but the sponsor of the concert
is
SHINZÔ YAMAMORI
Nichiuri TV, where Yamamori works.
On the evening of Dec. 3.
Probably in his program will be shown
part of the concert will be shown live.
I see.
Then, when the explosion happens...
...his ratings will go up.
Yamamori it is.

That reminds me, this guy....
Well,
good luck in the fight.
Good luck to you both in the fight!
Damn it!
I see.
Perhaps his usual way of speaking came through unconsciously.
As for Kôda-san, it could be that..,
it could be that she
personally angry with Okino-san.
What?
At Yôko-chan?
According to her colleague
she complained that she didn't get a scoop from Okino-san.
from Okino-san
because the guard is so strict.
The notebook said...
You know,
I saw Kaoru-san's notes
Kaoru-san's notes.
It said
O.Y., 3.12. Shiodome Arena.
What?
O.Y. are Yôko-chan's initials, right?
What are you doing?
Why didn't you tell me before?
Now, now, Môri-san..,
we don't know if Kôda-san is the culprit.
But that means...
both of them are suspects again.
The other suspects are...
Yes, Ran-chan,
do you know how long ago the perpetrator's
was in the mailbox?
When I checked the mail last night.
last night, it wasn't there.
Then he threw it in after that.
That means Nakaoka can't be the culprit.
Yes.
Huh? Why?
He's still in custody.
He'll be released this afternoon.
By the way, Ran-kun,
What about the other letter?
Ah, yes...
It seems to have been delivered early this morning.
The sender is
Yûshi Ichidô, a follower of the Tokyo Spirits.
The contents were a thank-you card to my father...
and a tie.
Ah!
Ah, sorry.
Glue seems to be coming out of the envelope.
Ah, not so bad.
Thank you.
Sure.
All right.
In any case.
resentment against J-League and Tokyo Spirits is no longer a strong motive.
Take another look at Shinzo Yamamori...
and Kaoru Kôda!
Is something bothering you?
Yes.
The problematic concert will take place on December 3.
Like the final game of the J-League?
Not true,
it makes you think.
Besides,
why does he write
something like this that makes it easy to determine the location?
This way the guard is strengthened
and makes the crime more difficult.
From that point of view, you're right.
Does the perpetrator have so much self-confidence..,
that he thinks he can plant the bombs
to plant the bombs anyway?
That's right.
Maybe there's another place besides Shiodome Arena
there's another place with over 80,000 people.
Or the criminal is not telling the truth.
No,
characteristic of him
is that he is not lying.
One can assume that.
If, then...
If what?
A deception by...
Wordplay.
Here's the news from sports and entertainment.
On December 3, the J-League final will take place!
Due to the explosion at the Tôto Stadium
the game was invalid.
Chairman Oohigashi
officially announced the date in an interview.
The kickoff will be on December 3 at 3:30 pm!
On the same Saturday at half past three begins
,, The Power of the Music" at the Shiodome Arena!
Known as the ,, 100,000 people concert"....
Dear visitors, here is some information.
There will be a bag check at the entrance.
Please have your
your tickets and...
Thank you very much.
...line up in two rows.
So that you can all quickly...
YÔKO OKINO
So, Yôko-chan,
see you later. Good luck on stage!
Excuse me.
Is the live feed up and running?
Yes,
Everything should be on standby.
A live broadcast is unpredictable.
Everybody be alert.
Yes.
Commissioner,
is it really the Shiodome Arena that's going to explode?
- After all... - What's this now?
There's no other event with more than 80,000 visitors.
It has to be the Shiodome Arena!
Seriously, that's why you should go to the movies with Ran.
So, Conan-kun?
Is something bothering you?
Yes. Today's the final round of the J-League.
It's today, like the concert. Memorable, isn't it?
It's true, though.
That's coincidence! Pure coincidence. Really.
- You're holding up the investigation. - No, I'm not.
We've requested
to reinforce our security, just in case.
The final round is scheduled to kick off at 3:30.
It should start now.
If Tokyo Spirits wins, that's victory!
If Big Ôsaka loses, they fall back to J2!
A fight no one wants to lose!
It's exactly half past three. Kickoff!
Oh, there they go! It's just started!

Tell me, why did you say we were going to the movies?
Huh? Oh, I see. I'm sorry.
If I had told the truth,
your father might have stopped us.
This year...
the last chance to see Higo-san.
Go! Put your back into it, Higo-san!
Ah.
Pah. Higo shot one in.
I'd like to eat too.
- A little is okay. - Huh?
I'll go to the kiosk. Huh?
What happened to Higo?
He's holding his leg. He fell over!
Is he all right?
Is Higo going to be substituted?
Well, the best players always get tackled.
- You can't do that! - What?
Sanada! Get ready!
I'm ready to go!
Go ahead and show them!
All right!
Sorry, Takahiro.
I'm counting on you.
Don't worry.
You can take a whole year off.
You idiot!
Off you go!
Sanada was substituted for
Sanada was substituted for Higo.
What?
What's up with you guys?
- Anything unusual? - No.
I bet there aren't 80,000 people here.
And those three?
Great, isn't it,
that we can watch all ten games at the same time?
Yes!
The fact that everyone can be cheering at the same time,
is great!
And?
Catching it,
Edogawa-kun?
To be able to follow along at the same time?
Huh? Did the perpetrator...
Azusa-chan!
It's okay. She's from the cafe downstairs.
Right.
Excuse me,
someone with a strange voice called.
What?
In the phone booth, second block,
there was a message for Mr. Môri.
What?
WARNING
IN THE 10
STADIES
BOMBS
Warning.
I have installed bombs in the 10 stadiums of the J1 League!
What?
Damn! So you did.
At the scheduled end of the game, the bombs will explode.
Without extra time.
WARNING!!!
But so that it is not boring,
you will get a chance.
If in the second half of the game the team
performs a certain move,
the explosion will be stopped.
If successful, the
will blink twice.
Again, the neon scoreboard?
However, the move may only be communicated to the coach
and the ace striker.
The other players must not know anything.
If actions are taken during the game
such as evacuations
or search for bombs,
I explode the bombs immediately.
The ace strikers shall
wear a red wristband on their left wrist.
Now,
the only move to stop the explosion is...
What is it?
...in this warning
already included.
What?
One more thing.
Even if there is no explosion,
...I will prohibit the search for bombs for 35 minutes after the end of the game.
If this is not complied with,
the spectators will be in danger.
Kogorô Môri, if you want to stop me,
become the eleventh striker and come to me!
Well,
good luck for the fight!
Damn! That sentence again!
He's playing with me!
WARNING!!
It was indeed
Misdirection based on puns.
Now he has us.
All the final games started at the same time today.
If you add up all the spectators,
you can easily exceed 80,000.
Indeed.
His warning didn't say anything about only one place.
Takagi, what time did the games end?
I think it was a quarter past five.
Ah!
We only have a little over an hour!
What is it, Satô-kun?
The beginning of the message...
That "Warning!!!"
It was written after
after stapling it together.
You can see..,
that there is red ink
on the staple.
Understand.
Why did he
stapled the sheets together first?
Staple.
The red ink intentionally leads to their center.
Hey!
- What are you doing? - I see.
So that's how it is!
I now know
...what kind of move is called for.
What is it, Conan-kun?
Anything?
Look!
This square frame on this warning letter...
...looks like a soccer field.
Huh?
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?
If this square is the field,
then the staple is the goal.
Doesn't such a staple have exactly
the same shape as a soccer goal?
May I?
The vertical line of the one character
goes straight to the goal of the staple.
That's...
The firing line.
Does he want
to be shot right in the middle of the goal?
- Wait a minute, commissar! - Huh?
Shooting a goal means
is to shoot through the goal frame.
In that case
the line should have been drawn beforehand
and should have come out at the top.
But the line

was drawn after the clamp,
hits them and stops there.
I see.
Where the red paint is on the staple,
would be the center of the crossbar on a soccer goal.
Therefore, the perpetrator probably calls for
A shot that hits the center of the crossbar.
Okay.
Inform the teams immediately!
Yes, sir!
Yes, Megure.
Shiratori here.
We have a possible suspect.
What? You know the perpetrator?
A bomb?
You're serious?
Yes.
The police just informed us.
So?
Can you make it?
Tell me if you can't.
No one will complain if you refuse.
- I'll ask someone... - Ask who?
Who?
Someone else?
Who are you going to let shoot?
The criminal asked for an ace striker, didn't he?
Now that Higo-san is out,
ace or no ace.
there's only me who can be called a striker.
Sanada...
It'll work out somehow.
I'll stop the explosion
and become a star!
The girls will fall for me!
Sanada...
Wear this on your left wrist.
That's just
stage fright, stage fright.
You can do it, Sanada.
Yes, sir!
Will the Tokyo Spirits win?
No, the Kashiwa Reysol.
The players are coming out!
The second half is about to begin.
I'm already tired from waiting.
It's going to be exciting.
I'm sure it will be...
Hello?
Haibara, listen carefully.
As expected, the target is the J-League.
What?
A red bracelet for the ace strikers...
Okay. I'll call you if something's wrong.
Please.
I'm gonna go find someone who...
I'm sorry. I'll get back to you. I'll be in touch.
Huh? Wait, Kudô-kun!
Here you go.
- You know where to go? - Yes, I do.
Can we go, Môri-kun?
Wha... what now?
What are you doing here?
- Never mind. Drive! - Yes.
Wha... what?
Not so loud, Professor!
Sorry.
And who are the strikers on each team?
Look for the red armbands.
According to Kudô-kun.
the explosion
is scheduled for 5:15 p.m.
Can't the spectators be evacuated?
Impossible.
Then the bombs will be detonated remotely.
Then we can only count on the J-League.
Yes.
The fate of the fans depends on them.
On those
ten strikers!
Now!
Hit!
What?
Sanada hit the crossbar!
Really, Conan-kun?
That's what they're saying.
Good.
The national stadium is safe.
No, not yet.
As soon as I hear the signal from the light-signaling board..,
I'll be notified immediately.
Then you won't...
What do you mean?
It didn't work?
Hey, Sanada!
Get back!
Shit!
Hey, Sanada! What are you doing?
- You bungler! - Sonoko, sit down!
Man, why did Higo-san get hurt?
I came all the way here to see him. It's useless.
Sanada! If you miss again, I'll never forgive you!
What? In every stadium they just hit the crossbar.
He didn't even score...
But why is he so happy?
The chosen strikers are really elite.
Despite this extreme situation, they keep hitting the crossbar.
Yes.
Impressive.
Commissioner.
Cerezo and Jubilo were able to take out the bombs!
Understood.
Yes, sir!
Four more to go.
Yes.
Ah!
There it is.
Even you, Môri-san?
What happened to make you arrive in such numbers?
We don't have much time. Just the most important thing.
The hospital where your son Tomofumi...
was transported to and where he died,
is near Tôto Stadium. That's a reason for me
to investigate.
On that day, the J-League All Star game was played
the J-League All Star game took place.
And when
the ambulance with Tomofumi
was about to drive past the stadium,
the way was blocked by excited fans,
so it couldn't go any further.
The fans are said to have
were beating the ambulance with their hands and mouthpieces.
And the leader of the group was....
I know!
That's right. It was Môri-san.
What?
Yes.
That day, I won at the horse race and got drunk.
Damn it. I forgot all about it.
I see.
The ambulance...
...your son was being transported in.
How long was the ambulance stationary?
It was about two minutes, I think.
So
it's hard to say if that's what led to Tomofumi's death.
But...
But if it hadn't been for their agitation..,
he might still be alive.
I love the soccer that my son loved.
Of course, the J-League, too.
But...
Môri-san and those people

I can not forgive!
From which club
were the fans from?
I do not know. I could not see anything.
They said
...they're not getting anywhere because of Môri and the fans.
I see.
Because you don't know the club,
you put bombs in all the stadiums.
Huh?
Motoura-san...
We deciphered the code earlier...
and had Coach Sakaki
to confirm it.
You are our culprit.
What?
Perpetrator, you say?
What kind of shot did
Tomofumi scored the goal?
Huh?
The ball hit the crossbar in the middle and rolled
further into the goal.
The perpetrator's instruction is exactly the same.
It's: Shoot the ball at the center of the crossbar!
How does it look, Motoura-san?
How many times do I have to say it? Perpetrator? Code?
What's this?
Motoura-san,
the story of the ambulance
has a sequel.
Môri-san and the people stopped the ambulance...
stopped the ambulance to help someone.
That's how it was.
At that time
dialed 119 because an old man had fallen down due to overheating.
I gave first aid
and waited for the ambulance.
There he is!
People, clear the way!
The ambulance is coming!
Shit! This ambulance is going all wrong!
Hey!
Over here!
After that the ambulance I had called came,
and the man was saved.
So that's how it was.
A mix-up.
I'm sorry I stopped the ambulance.
Your anger is understandable.
But
But involving innocent people is wrong!
Motoura-san!
Stop the bombs immediately!
As Môri-san says,
what you're planning is wrong!
Mo... Wait a minute!
What do you want from me?
Isn't it you?
The one who planted the bombs?
- What?
Something's wrong.
Commissioner, Shiratori. May I ask you...
We're not making much progress.
Isn't there any other conclusive evidence?
The time limit is less than ten minutes away!
I see. That strange feeling...
That must be it.
This guy...
Let's leave it at that, Inspector.
Now I know why you came to see me.
But I have nothing to do with it.
Huh?
I don't think he's the culprit either.
Sure
the culprit is restless for the time when the games end.
But Motoura-san
didn't look at the clock.
Not even when they turned their backs on him.
Is that true, Conan-kun?
I had my eyes on him.
So really.
But
if the decisive shot is the same as Tomofumi's..,
it's not a coincidence.
But why?
Crap. Do I have to start all over again?
Commissioner!
- Just one more! - What?
If the bomb is stopped at the National Stadium,
it'll be all of them!
Oh!
They did it!
Would you turn on the TV for us?
- Yes. - There's still five minutes to play.
Big's striker was Sanada, wasn't it?
It's not Higo? Damn.
With so little time left.
I'll have to let Sanada have the bomb.
What I can do
is to find the real criminal quickly.
These are
These are the photos from Motoura-san's phone.
What's up?
Tomofumi here...
He's looking somewhere else.
Who's he waving at?
Hey, tell me, the guy with the video camera in the photo..,
that's you, right?
Huh? Yes. I was taking a video
and my wife was over there taking pictures.
Is that that video camera?
Can I look?
Yeah, go ahead and look.
Thank you.
If my assumption is correct,
he must be on it.
Absolutely.
There!
There he is.
- That was a foul! - Yes, it was.
He's in the perfect position.
Motoura-san,
- can you please turn up the volume? - Yes.
Foul! Sanada was pushed!
Big Ôsaka has scored a free kick!
Two minutes left to play and now a free kick!
- Shooting will be Sanada. - Take a deep breath!
Sanada has not yet been able to convert a chance today.
A critical moment. Can he save his team?
That one was sitting!
Big Osaka
has caught up at the last moment!
And?
Did the ball hit?
I couldn't tell.
Stop it! Hey!
It looks bad for the Spirits.
Soon the 90 minutes will be up!
Oh no!
No score?
We're out of time.
And the explosion?
A mistake by the perpetrator?
No...
There was no explosion,
because the first hit was already in place.
Probably the device on the board is broken.
Anyway, we were lucky.
Yes.
The question remains,
who the perpetrator is.

I told you, it's not me!
Hm.
If this guy is the culprit,
then he and this boy...
Uncle...
Has anyone inquired
how Tomofumi died?
Hm,
I feel like my wife told someone.
But who I can't tell.
He must
be the culprit.
But he had...
Tomofumi's paperwork.
The glue is off.
Glue seems to be coming out of the envelope.
Oh no!
Whoops!
Watch it!
No doubt about it. He's the culprit!
That means..,
the timer for the bombs is still running!
Really.
Hello?
Kogorô Môri, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Son of a bitch!
Where are you?
From the looks of it, you're not able to get to me.
What?
You're not
not qualified to be the 11th forward.
That's the whistle for the end of the game!
The winner this year is
the Kashiwa Reysol club!
Oh no.
I can't make it like this!
Are you all right?
Yes.
But what are you doing here?
We know!
You're out of line.
Don't play it cool!
You guys...
We'll find out where you are
we'll find out right away!
Right, Ai-chan?
Really.
Professor. To Toto Stadium. Hurry up!
All right.
Please step on it, Professor. Time is short.
I know.
But why Tôto Stadium again?
It's still under reconstruction.
That's where this case started
and that's where everything ends.
Ah! There's Ran-san and Sonoko-san!
What?
I was watching the end-of-season ceremony,
and there...
THE MISS FANS OF TODAY
among the spectators at the National Stadium...
They went into the stadium!
No, they should be safe there.
Now I have to find the culprit...
You guys stay here and watch if anyone comes out!
I'm going to look for the bombs!
Get going!
Uncle Kogoro's not coming. It's no use waiting.
I'm the only one here.
By the way, I freed the downed guards.
The police should be arriving shortly.
I saw through the trick with the card in the mailbox!
You pocketed it before you blew up the stadium.
Before you called Uncle Kogoro..,
you put the card
upright at the end of the mailbox.
With the shape of the mailbox
you have to peek inside to see the back end.
If there is other mail inside,
it's easy to miss the card.
And that day you
as a Spirits fan, sent the large envelope by courier.
This one fit in the mail slot,
but it didn't quite fit in the mailbox. Also
the envelope had been prepared in such a way that glue was
glue was leaking from the corners.
Of course, the courier will the letter,
to make sure it doesn't fall out,
to the very back of the mailbox.
This way the glue comes into contact with the card on the wall.
in contact with the wall. If you pull on the envelope,
you pull the card with you,
it moves to the front and it's as if it had just been
as if it had just been inserted.
This is how you believe
that the card was inserted the day before.
and the alibi is perfect.
In other words,
whoever has a perfect alibi for that time is the perpetrator.
Isn't it?
At that time, the police had arrested you.
You had a perfect alibi,
former ace striker of Haido High School,
Kazumasa Nakaoka-san.
For a kid, that was pretty good.
What did you say your name was?
Conan Edogawa.
I'm a detective!
No one gets by.
Yes...
In that case,
shouldn't we help look for the bombs?
It's true, the cathedral is huge.
We'll be faster with more of you.
No! It's dangerous in there.
Wait until Edogawa-kun gets back...
- Hey, you guys! - Wait up!
The Detective Boys are coming!
Yes!
This is bad! We've got to get them back!
- Professor, wait here! - Eh?
Leave the children to me.
And keep the engine running in case the perpetrator...
tries to escape.
Yes...
So?
When did you meet Tomofumi?
How
do you know...
You were on the video of Motoura-san.
How you with Tomofumi
exchanged characters.
You probably met him when you were a high school student.
At the sports field in Haido Park,
when you were training.
How do you know that?
The dormitory of Haido High School, where you went,
is near the park.
Since you are from Gunma, you must have lived in the dormitory.
Nakaoka-san,
Tomofumi was watching you and you talked to him, right?

Like that time,
when you were approached by the soccer player Kazu.
Boy, do you like soccer?
Yes!
Yes.
Our first meeting was
in the spring.
It was in fact
in Haido Park at the training.
Yes!
He was weak from birth
and was not allowed to move violently.
But gradually he grabbed the training.
Our training together
lasted until winter.
I won the high school championship
by scoring a goal and toasted with Tomofumi.
That's right. I'm giving this to you.
That you can score a goal at a game someday.
Thank you.
But in February you had the motorcycle accident
and the connection with Tomofumi broke off.
Yes.
The six-month rehabilitation didn't go well
and I fled to South America.
Finally
I visited Haido Park in June of this year
Haido Park.
Tomofumi.
Tomofumi was now a fourth-grader
and a member of Haido's soccer team.
Because of his weakness
he always sat on the bench during games.
But the coach offered him to play a little in the next game.
If he scored a goal, we would drink to it,
we promised each other.
As promised
he scored
a goal in the game.
When I saw that,
I wanted to make a fresh start.
But...
And then
you wanted to take revenge on
Uncle Kogoro and the fans.
Yes.
How did you get the bombs?
I met a specialist in South America.
You planted those bombs in the nine stadiums.
And the tenth stadium is not the national stadium,
but
It's this ToTo Stadium.
The sensor in the National Stadium is a dummy.
That's why it didn't react to Sanada's shot.
You spared the stadium
because it's sacred ground to you.
In exchange
you planted bombs here, where you hoped to be
to stand here as a J-League player
and set them for 5:50 p.m.
When Uncle Kogorô breaks the code and comes here,
you were going to die with him.
At exactly 5:50 p.m.
Haido High School won the day, didn't it?
That's why you didn't write at 17:50,
but at the end of the game...
Yes, that's right.
For me, that final game was the last soccer game.
That's why my ending starts here.
Nakaoka-san,
you said that if you can't play for 90 minutes straight,
has no right to play soccer.
But that's wrong.
What?
Did Tomofumi,
who could only play for a short time,
had no right to play soccer?
If you can only play for 15 minutes,
you can still make the best of it.
What does a kid like you understand.
Indeed.
But a J-League player would surely say,
that you don't know true soccer.
...can definitely become an advantage,
if you learn to use your potential properly.
There's something else
you don't know, Nakaoka-san.
And that is...
Hooray! You have done well!
TOP NEWS
I wonder what happened to the Shiodome Arena?
No news so far.
The battery is dead.
That's not true!
That Môri and the others
wanted to help someone...
- That's a lie! - It's not a lie!
It's the truth!
Nakaoka-san.
As if I would believe such a fairy tale!
Don't do that! That would Tomofumi
only sadden!
Unfortunately, but
for me there is no turning back.
No!
- This is not good at all. - We'll look separately!
- Huh? - Yeah!
Hey! Genta-kun! Ayumi-chan!
Wait up!
Not good at all. I have to get her out of here!
Now there's only one way to stop the bombs.
Look at the scoreboard.
It doesn't make sense anymore, but as a test for the striker...
bombs will go off every minute from now on.
And finally, when this goes off..,
all the other bombs will go off everywhere
and everything will end.
This killer of detective and the fans will die!
Uncle and the fans will die?
Boy,
there's a big mistake in your conclusions.
Is it... not here?
Exactly.
This stadium was not meant in the threatening letter.
I hadn't planted any bombs here at that time.
That's why this stadium isn't the tenth.
It's the eleventh stadium!
Then the tenth stadium is...
The National Stadium!
That's why,
that's why you banned the bomb search for another 35 minutes.
So that no one would find the bombs in the National Stadium!
That's right.
The bombs there are linked to the detonator in that bag.

They explode at the time I scored my goal back then.
Precisely because it is sacred ground for me,
I want to obliterate the stadium along with me.
Are you sure, Môri-kun?
Yes!
The perpetrator wants to mess with me here.
Okay.
I'll check the security cameras. You stay here.
Got it!
Higo-san! You're great! Higo-san!
I love you!
He looked over here!
Who do you think it was?
Damn it! Why now?
Please! Answer it! Answer it!
You're going to talk to the answering machine....
Why? Answer it...
Run away quickly, kid.
I don't want you.
The bomb can only be stopped by the eleventh striker.
But he failed
and didn't come.
I'll have my revenge soon.
Thus Tomofumi's grief is lightened a little.
What nonsense!
Your dream is shattered. You run away.
Take advantage of Tomofumi's death..,
to take out your anger on others!
What?
You set your limits.
Just give up. A coward you are!
You little squirt! They let you talk...
You're the squirt here!
Blaming others,
denying what you don't like and trying to destroy it.
You are a selfish child!
Don't you get it?
What you deny,
is the soccer that Tomofumi loved so much!
You are about to drag the memory of Tomofumi in the mud!
Don't you get it yet?
That's right, big brother.
Tomofumi...
W... why are you wearing this bracelet?
The
I gave it to Tomofumi,
no, that
can't be!
It's nobody's fault.
Please stop,
big brother!
W... are you saying that I'm wrong,
Tomofumi?
I... I wanted to take revenge
and then just come to you.
But why, Tomofumi,
why aren't you on my side?
Nakaoka-san...
There's no time.
Tomofumi,
run!
Damn it!
Don't!
Are you kidding?
I'm not going to
give up!
You can't give up! No kid can do that!
I'll stop it! I'll stop the bomb!
Fly!
Yes, it's on!
No.
I only had this one ball.
No, even if I had a spare, like...
What now?
The explosion earlier was the third.
Not even two minutes.
What now?
The debris is in the way.
I can't shoot directly.
What now?
I have no more ball.
What now.
Conan-kun!
You mean...
Ayumi?
We're here to help you!
Hurry and run!
- The whole place is going to explode! - Conan!
Mitsuhiko!
Genta!
Conan!
Get out of here, I said!
I don't have a ball to stop the bombs!
I have a ball!
The signed ball.
I don't know exactly why,
but if we can help with this...
Let's go, Mitsuhiko!
Are you sure?
You'll catch it just fine!
Hey!
Okay!
Got it.
Ayumi-chan, please
pass the ball to Conan!
Yes!
He's coming!
One, two.
He's coming! Ah! Wait!
Got him!
That was great, Ayumi!
- Hurry to Conan-kun! - Yes!
But how?
I can't shoot that far!
You just have to get over the rubble!
Don't forget soccer class!
The three of you...
Here we go, Conan-kun.
Hey!
Oh, no!
Oh, really.
I guess we can't do it without me.
- Haibara-san! - Hooray!
Ai-chan, please! Pass the ball to Conan-kun!
Okay!
Kudô-kun,
Our feelings...
I'm entrusting them to you!
Receive them!
That was top-notch!
All of you!
Wha... what's... What about them?
Do they think
they can stop the bombs in this situation?
Hurry, time's running out!
No... no chance.
Not a minute more.
The debris prevents a direct shot,
but with the shot...
What was that?
The free kick Endo-san..,
he showed me.
It works!
Hit the ball head-on,
Not really kicking,
but rather bring it up.
Shoot!
Go!
Un... impossible!
At this angle, the curve will be...
What?
Turn!
How'd it go?
- That was great, Conan! - Yay!
Conan-kun! Yay!
You're amazing.
So the eleventh striker...
was you.
Conan Edogawa.

So, what was it?

Well,

Free kick from Hide!
- Ran-neechan! - Ah!
She's white.
Huh?
Ugh, Conan-kun!
I don't believe it.
What a rascal.
What's white?
How rude.
Oh, well...
Conan-kun!
Excuse me, sir.
No, really. We're playing soccer. A header would be more appropriate.
