And?
What is the view like from the Bell Tree Tower, which our company
our company spent all its resources to build?
It's absolutely amazing, Sonoko!
Thank you for inviting us!
You should be grateful, too.
Normally, at an opening ceremony
only those directly involved are allowed to attend!
Yes!
This is really awesome!
Thank you so much!
You're one to talk.
She invited us herself.
Hey!
Shouldn't we go slowly?
What are you talking about, Pop?
We just got here!
Why the hell did I end up so high up again?
Why don't you come over here, Pop?
The view is great!
Don't give me that shit!
I'm leaving, okay?
I mean...
And anyway!
You know what they say: Only fools and whatnot climb heights voluntarily.
You say that, but you're really scared!
Pah... Nonsense!
I don't mind a little bit of height!
Then you can look at the ground without any problems?
Huh? On the floor?
Wha...?!!
D...
The floor!!!
I... is gone!
- I'm scared! Scared! Scared! Ah! - Stop, Pops!
I'm scared of big heights!!!!
- M... Wait, sir! - The elevator is going...
This elevator
goes to the special observation deck.
Enjoy the view of the world 480 meters above the ground!
Let me down!!!
Really, this pops...
Sorry, Sonoko.
Ah, that's all right.
The things he does...
Come on, let's enjoy the beautiful view from Bell Tree Tower!
Say, Sonoko, what's that building?
Ah, that little one? That's the Asakusa Sky Court.
It has nothing to do with the Suzuki company.
When finished, it will probably only be as high as the first observation deck here.
Then the Bell Tree Tower has won!
Of course!
Oh! Look, look, the river there!
There are a lot of bridges!
Yes, that's the Sumida.
The blue bridge is the Komagata Bridge.
The red one is the Azuma Bridge.
The bridge in front of that is the Tôto Bell Tree Line.
Oh! There's a train coming right now!
Wow, cool!
Well, it's stopping on the bridge!
No, it's just slowing down.
Because right after the bridge is Asakusa Station.
Oh! I have an idea!
How about we use
for our summer vacation project
we make a miniature model of the ToTo Bell Tree Tower and the surrounding area?
Wah, that's a great idea!
That sounds fun!
Conan-kun and Ai-chan, why don't you join us?
- Isn't that a bit... - That's a good idea!
Yay!
Okay, it's decided!
Let's build something really great!
It was worth coming here.
Let's take lots and lots of pictures!
I'll make a video!
I'll do the research on the Bell Tree Tower.
Shouldn't a certain someone be doing their summer project too?
Why don't you leave me alone?
There,
the yellow building!
That looks great!
Oh yeah, I can see it. What a pretty house!
It was built thirty years ago.
And now that the Bell Tree Tower is completed,
the view from it alone is worth four stars.
It's certainly a five-star property.
Built thirty years ago? Isn't that a little too old?
I've really fallen in love with this house.
I feel the same way.
- What's the matter? - Oh...
No, it's nothing.
A sniper! On the ground!
You're too heavy...
Please stay calm!
Damn! He's causing a panic!
I knew it, there he is!
Where's Ran?
Okay.
- Professor! - Huh?
The car keys!
D... The car...?
I'll get my skateboard!
- J... yes... - They're too heavy!
Wait!
Please stay calm!
Conan-kun...
I'm Shin'ichi Kudô, a high school detective.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran
at the amusement park,
I saw men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on it,
I didn't notice the man behind me.
He was administering a poison to me.
When I awoke...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised me not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked what my name was, I spontaneously said, Conan Edogawa.
In order to track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father is a detective.

DETECTIVE MÔRI
The Black Organization surrounded by enigmas....
Besides me
others are also secretly searching for the truth about them.
The "Federal Bureau of Investigation",
the FBI.
James Black,
Andre Camel,
Jodie Starling,
and Shûichi Akai.
He was one of the FBI's brightest minds...
and a talented sniper.
But then he was taken by an infiltrated CIA agent....
Then others showed up!
Masumi Sera.
A new student,
who says she's a detective.
And Subaru Okiya.
Engineering doctoral student,
lives in my now empty house.
In reality, he's...
I'm small, but my mind isn't!
No case remains unsolved!
There is always...
...one truth!
A precise shot from this huge distance!
It's not...
...the work of them?
I've got to find out.
That building was...
Damn it!
What was that?
A kid fell off!
It's next to that building over there!
That's the one!
Okay!
He can't have gotten far!
If he wants to escape without getting stuck in traffic,
it's on foot...
Or on a motorcycle!
Is that him?
The size and thickness...
No doubt about it! A rifle bag!
Haibara! Can you hear me?
Shit! This old piece of junk!
Haibara!
Haibara! Please answer!
What's wrong? The connection is bad.
Where are you?
I'm chasing a suspect!
Professor!
Call the police!
Huh? Yes...
His license plate number: "Shinjuku Se 33-17". Heading north on Mittsume-dôri.
He's turning left!
Shit! You can't get away from me!
What happened?
Edogawa-kun, are you all right?
Yes. He's crossing the Sumid River on the Kototoi Bridge...
I'm at the limit of radio range!
Shit! I'm in a blind spot!
Where is he?
He's going the wrong way?
Did he just...
Watch out!
It's just like Yaiba!
Damn it! He actually noticed me!
Why did you...
You here, Sera-neechan?
I'll explain later!
I'm off now!
The license plate of the suspect's motorcycle
of the suspect's motorcycle is: "Shinjuku Se 33-17".
According to eyewitnesses.
he has crossed the Kototoi Bridge and is heading south.
To all cars: Go to the scene immediately and arrest the suspect!
arrest the suspect!
You were at the tower?
I was shadowing the man who was shot.
On a mission!
So you were up there too?
Yes. But that he would be murdered...
I see him!
Hold on tight!
Yes!
He's going off National Road 6
onto the Kuramae Bridge!
We'll get him!
Roger that! The road is closed!
Damn it!
After him! Hold on!
No. It's too dangerous to provoke him any further.
Don't worry.
We'll know where he's going in a minute.
He's stopping!
It's possible he's got another getaway vehicle
another getaway vehicle there!
Not good.
Let's hurry!
Yes.
But be careful.
I'm aware of that.
We're just checking things out.
The suspect is fleeing on a motorcycle.
His license plate...
Looks like it's right up ahead.
Yes.
...heading south towards...
This motorcycle...
Yes.
No doubt about it.
If he walked from here...
Damn it!
Sera!
Hey, Sera!
Agent Camel!
You're mine!
Let's see what you got!
Ouch ouch ouch...
You okay, Sera-neechan?
J... Yes...
If it wasn't for this, I would have died instantly.
It looks like you're both
both of you are unharmed.
But is everything
all right with you, Agent Camel?
No problem.
Cause I'm wearing this.
I see.
But this thing with Jodie-san's gun...
...will be our secret, yes.
Not a chance.
He got away.
Nothing we can do.
Let's leave the rest to the Japanese police.
I'll have them check the banks in the area immediately.
Good.
Well, arresting him will be difficult.
Because to a Seal...
the ocean is like his backyard pond.
For a Seal?
Please take a look at this.
The photos we received,
as well as the shooting technique
suggest that this is the perpetrator.
TIMOTHY HUNTER
Timothy Hunter,
37 years old.
Ex-sniper with the Navy Seals, a special operations unit of the U.S. Navy.
Served in the war in the Middle East for three years from 2003.

A war hero whose meritorious deeds are numerous.
But why should this hero...
The reason is probably to be found here in the Silver Star.
Silver Star?
An award given to soldiers
who, in battle against hostile organizations.
in combat against hostile organizations.
Hunter was awarded
2005, but was stripped of it in 2006
it was revoked from him
on suspicion of violating the rules of engagement.
Revoked, you say?
Yes.
A U.S. Army officer had
that Hunter had shot unarmed civilians.
Hunter, of course, denied it.
The investigation turned up
too little evidence and there was no trial.
But as a result of this affair
Hunter was suddenly transformed for the world
from "war hero" to "dubious hero."
And...
Perhaps influenced by the Silver Star case,
Hunter had lost all his prudence back in the war,
went off on his own, and got hit in the head with a bullet.
- Oh dear... - What happened to him then?
A successful operation managed to save his life.
But he was discharged from the army and went back to the States.
But his streak of bad luck continued.
He tried to live a normal life,
and moved to a suburb of Seattle, Washington.
But memories of the war did not fade
and probably continued to torment him.
And the unhappiness was not confined to him,
but also his wife and younger sister.
Ruin due to a bad investment,
suicide of his sister after a broken engagement.
And his wife died of a drug overdose....
Honor, fortune and even
his beloved family...
Hunter lost everything in turn.
For the next six years
every trace of him disappears.
But why does this man
a suspect in this murder case?
Three weeks ago.
in Seattle, Brian Woods, a journalist for a local newspaper,
was shot and killed by a sniper's rifle.
The police investigation revealed that Woods had written
had written a series of highly inflammatory articles
about Hunter and his wife,
which drove them both to nervous breakdown.
Hunter had thereby
a suspect in the crime
and the police and FBI launched a manhunt.
It was discovered that he had
had entered Japan two weeks earlier.
We were just
here in Japan on vacation, and so we were ordered by the
so FBI headquarters gave us the order to arrest Hunter.
I see.
And so that's how the current situation came about.
Yes.
But do you know where Hunter has been since then?
We've been searching the bay, but we haven't found any clues yet.
That's not surprising.
As you know, the "SEAL" in "Navy Seals" is an acronym for "sea."
is an acronym for "sea," "air," and "land."
Navy Seals are as good swimmers
as they are skilled snipers.
As for shooting...
On the roof of the building from which the shot was fired..,
there was something strange.
Something strange?
Chiba-kun.
Yes.
By the window cleaning scaffolding on the side facing the Bell Tree Tower
there was a cube
and an empty 51mm shell casing.
The cartridge is
the same caliber as
the 7.62 mm cartridge used in the crime.
This is also consistent with NATO ammunition for Hunter's
's preferred sniper rifle, the MK 11.
Then it really is...
As for the dice...
Where the shot was fired from in Seattle
was there also a die next to the round?
No,
we never heard anything about that.
But Hunter has something to do with dice.
Hunter loves dice games and is said to have
a tattoo on his left arm with a dice motif.
Ve... get it...
As a connection, this is weak,
but it's conceivable that Hunter is using this as some kind of message.
Yes.
And the best evidence that the crime was committed by Hunter...
is in his victim.
Do you mean by that
that Hunter had a motive
to shoot Fujinami-san?
Yes.
Because it was Hiroaki Fujinami..,
who seven years ago
a worthless property in Japan seven years ago
and bankrupted him.
What are you saying?
And that's why he...
The culprit
was undoubtedly Hunter.
But tell me,
why were you shadowing Fujinami-san?
Actually...
Why were you shadowing Fujinami-san...?
A friend of mine has a relative,
who was planning to marry this Fujinami.

She found him shady and asked me to investigate.
My investigation also revealed that he was
that he was swindling naive foreigners..,
by selling them worthless real estate.
That's right, he was on the Tower
on the Tower...
It's unfortunate that he was shot..,
but maybe it's a good thing the wedding fell through.
But speaking of...
This info doesn't
that Hunter's crimes are over.
Yes, you're right.
Are there other people Hunter could be targeting?
- Jodie-kun, the photos please. - Yes, sir.
We at the FBI have reason to believe..,
that there are at least three more people.
Dr...
Three more people?
Yes.
The following people are at high risk
of being murdered.
Jack Waltz, age 45.
A former captain in the U.S. Army who reported Hunter for
of the rule violation.
He now runs a military equipment manufacturing company
for military equipment in San Diego.
Next up
Is Bill Murphy, 35.
Ex-U.S. Army sergeant
and Waltz's subordinate, who testified as a witness in the case of
of the deployment rule violation.
He has been Waltz's secretary since his discharge from the Army.
- In San Diego, Hunter can't kill her. - Wrong.
The two are currently in Japan.
Waltz has been in Kyoto with his family for two days,
and Murphy is in Nikko.
Kyoto and...
...Nikko, you say?
Yes.
They plan to stay eight more days.
And the last of the three people:
Hitoshi Moriyama, 34 years old.
Hunter's sister killed herself because
he broke off his engagement to her.
Moriyama was employed by a Seattle trading firm.
He quit four years ago. Where he is staying is unknown.
That two of the three are in Japan...
He's definitely going after them.
Yes. Alert the police
Kyoto and Tochigi Prefectures.
Good!
Launch an urgent manhunt for Timothy Hunter as the prime suspect!
- Yes! - Yes!
A former Navy Seal sniper....
That's one bad dude that showed up.
At least we know the case has nothing to do with them.
But nonetheless...
Why is this Hunter guy starting his vendetta now..,
after six years?
You're right.
Now that you mention it...
Oh, it's just a coincidence!
More importantly:
Stop playing detective now.
You almost got yourselves killed!
Young man!
And you stop fidgeting all over the place!
Yahaaa!
For real.
Sera-san,
You were lucky not to get hurt.
But please don't put Conan-kun...
Don't ever put Conan-kun in that kind of danger again, okay?
Ran...
Don't worry.
I'll protect Conan-kun, I promise.
And anyway..:
His heart can't be damaged by any bullet right now.
Of course, neither is your heart.
Take care!
My motorcycle's over there.
See you soon, Conan-kun!
No kidding! Do you think she really gets it?
Why wouldn't my heart be vulnerable to a bullet?
Ah!
Because you hit it back with your karate?
You can't do that!
Yes, you could, maybe...
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so depressed despite the fireworks?
It's obvious.
Someone was shot in front of us.
There's nothing we can do about it.
- And it's not just that! - Huh?
They took all our photos!
All of them, including the digicam!
But only temporarily.
We'll get them back soon.
Maybe there are clues for the investigation.
Mine's off.
Ah, mine too.
Mine too.
That's the last of them.
Well, did your mood lighten a bit?
- Not from something like that! - Somehow it wasn't that great.
We should have bought more.
That's what I thought.
That's why I prepared something.
The soccer belt?
A new version of it!
You have to kick it as high as possible.
All right. Come on!
Good... Set the timer... Here we go!
- How high! - Ha, very good!
Wah, great! Really super, Professor!
- A masterstroke! - I call it "Fireworks Ball"!
But the neighbors will surely complain.
Oh my, this isn't good at all! What are we going to do, Ai-kun?
I mean, really...
Conan was the only one who was allowed to...
That's so mean, Professor!
Don't you have something for us?
Oh, my...
It's morning already?

This Hitoshi Moriyama...
I was sure that I had seen him in the newspaper once.
I wonder if I was wrong.
FBI HQ sent us some information about the people
that Hunter has a high probability of contacting.
Yes...
Our team split into three groups to interrogate them.
But would you
repeat the information the FBI has on them?
Of course.
The first: Scott Green.
Ex-chief petty officer in the U.S. Navy.
Today, he's turned his hobby into a profession and
runs a motorcycle store in Machida.
In the Navy Seals
he was an instructor in sharpshooting
and apparently taught Hunter as well.
Next up is Kevin Yoshino.
Formerly a staff sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps.
Today, he runs an Army store in Fussa.
Through his Army contacts
he procures scrap material that is disposed of and sells it.
And the last one is Mark Spencer.
He wasn't on the list you gave us yesterday, was he?
No.
He has no direct connection to Hunter.
But he is a former commander
who serves as an advisor to the U.S. Army in Japan
often serves as an advisor.
Hunter's circle of acquaintances here is small, it's
quite possible that he would turn to Spencer.
Understand.
If you ask how he got his rifle..,
...it's fair to assume that one of the three was helping him.
Yes.
What? Tim is...?
No, I mean, Hunter is the shooter?
Well, it's not clear that he is, but...
Hunter saved your life
in the Middle East, right?
Yes.
If it wasn't for him, I would have died.
If your lifesaver asked you for help....
The gun, for example, that was used in the...
in the bombing...
To get such an MK 11...
I don't carry such a thing! Do you think those things are real?
Do you want to check? I'd be happy to sell you one.
Did you see Hunter?
Yeah. He said he'd just arrived in Japan.
Where is he now?
I'm sorry, but I don't know where he is now.
His getaway vehicle was a motorcycle.
A repaired used bike with a fake number.
Are you saying I got it for him?
I'm sorry, but
I only sell new motorcycles here.
What's your opinion on Hunter's alleged
Hunter's alleged breach of the rules of engagement?
It's probably true.
Overzealous to protect his comrades....
He must have thought the others were armed...
...were armed, and he fired.
That's not true!
It can't be, not with him!
It's all a fake!
Fake, you say?
That Waltz used to be a sniper, too, and he was jealous of Hunter.
Jack Waltz was a sniper too?
He took the Silver Star
the Silver Star from Hunter
and then...
You're saying there was no violation
against the rules of engagement?
No.
Of course there wasn't.
Hunter is a hero,
who saved my life and the lives of many of my comrades.
If he came here and asked me for help,
I would grant his request.
No, I don't know of anything.
I have not met this Hunter
nor have I received any information about him.
I see.
And what is
What is your opinion of his alleged violation
against the rules of engagement?
Whether it is true or not is no longer the issue.
But if he really is the perpetrator in this murder case,
as an ex-U.S. Marine, I can't let him get away with it.
Shoot him on sight.
Shoot him, you say?!!
The police snipers won't stand a chance against him.
won't stand a chance against him.
Shall I lend you my driver?
Carlos!
Yes?
Carlos Lee, former U.S. Marine Corps sniper.
Responsible for the deaths of 36 enemy soldiers in the Middle East.
These are the confirmed hits. With the unconfirmed.
that makes 78.
Oh, that's right.
Well, that's still...
less than Hunter's 79...
But only a Sniper can defeat a Sniper.
What do you say? Are you going to take him?
LIBRARY BEIKA
If it wasn't in a newspaper,
it was probably in a woman's magazine.
But that will be
quite a Herculean task...
Alright, spread out the plan on the table.
Yaaaa!!!
Let's determine the exact area first.
Oh, you're about to start your homework project?
Of course we are!
Very good!
And such good children should be given a reward!
What, what?

Do we also get a fireworks belt?
Ah no, that would disturb the neighbors too much.
For you I have something more practical: Here you go!
The detective badge?
A new version of it!
Improved and with increased range.
Someone called them "junk." That really hit him.
Well, well, you heard that?
They look just like the old ones!
Only the transmission has gotten better?
How boring!
That's not all!
If you change the setting and press the transmission button....
Oh! They light up!
Those are LED lights, aren't they?
- They're way cooler than the old ones! - Yes!
You can choose the color and also the device!
Wah, great!
But somehow it makes a weird sound, doesn't it?
A sound?
I can't hear anything.
What? You can't hear that, Professor?
A mosquito sound...
High frequency sounds get harder to hear as you get older.
Adults can't hear it.
It must have occurred by accident in the improvement process.
I'll have to correct that.
Ah, that's all right!
Maybe a tone like that will come in handy again someday.
At the end of the day, this is a "defective product," right?
What a disappointment!
Somehow I lost my good mood.
Then I'll ask you a good mood quiz question now!
- Again? - It's just another bad joke!
Shouldn't you just listen to it?
If you say so, Ai-chan...
If you want to...
I guess we have no choice.
Good! Well, here we go!
If you play rock, paper, scissors with a sniper..,
what symbol do you have to show to win against him?
Here's a hint: Translate "sniper" into English.
What does sniper mean?
In English?
Do you know, Conan-kun?
Ah... Yes.
But the punch line
doesn't really work.
In English? I don't know that!
- I capitulate! - What's the answer?
The correct solution is, stone...
A sniper is a "sniper",
and because it sounds like "cut",
the effective rock-paper-scissors weapon
against him is stone.
Because it sounds like "cut"...?
And the "cut" is the scissors?
And because he shows the scissors, you win with the stone?
Because it sounds like "cut"...?
Well, because "cut" sounds like...?
In which of the following sports is a sniper particularly good?
First: baseball. Second: soccer.
Third: golf.
D... the...
The answer is: three.
If you swap the syllables of "Sniper",
you get "Nice par".
Wow, Ai-chan, that was great!
- You're really good! - "Nice par"?
From now on, Haibara will ask the quiz questions....
Oh my! All my nice word aesthetics so far....
Forget the professor. On with the homework!
- You're right. - Yes, let's continue!
Boo-hoo... I'm out. Assignment...
Ah yes... You lost your smartphone, didn't you?
I heard the police called about it.
Really, this professor!
This is really more important than a quiz!
And... Masumi Sera.
Be careful.
She's dangerous.
You're the one who said that.
What's this? Conan-kun?
Ah, he's gone to pick up his lost smartphone.
Let's start without him.
Thank you for visiting today.
The Beika Library will be closing shortly.
It's strange...
I wonder if I imagined it.
Oh... Bingo!
Hitoshi Yasuhara...
What's up?
Not "Moriyama"?
Started a single import company four years ago.
His wife: a charismatic cooking expert.
Started a cooking school in Honjo, Sumida County...
Excuse me... We will soon...
Ah, right away.
I'll clean up in a minute.
Excuse me.
Hitoshi Yasuhara
his wife's surname after their wedding...
I see!
His family name changed after the marriage!
We should hunt down the organization
and get involved in this unpleasant case...
Yes...
And we have a tough opponent.
A former Navy Seal sniper...
If only Akai-san were here...
I'm sorry, sir.
That's all right. I was just thinking the same thing.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Shû!
I have a question.
A police sniper or
a military sniper?
Who's the better sniper?
Depends on the circumstances.
Within 100 meters: the police sniper.

Because when it comes to the precision of their shots,
police snipers are better.
Are they?
Yes.
Police snipers are mainly used in hostage situations.
In such cases
a sniper needs unprecedented precision, which instantly robs his target
instantly deprives his target of all his physical abilities.
There is only one target when you want to kill a person
instantly with a single shot,
without even flinching.
The brain stem...
Exactly.
With any other body part,
even with a bullet through the heart,
the other guy can keep fighting for another ten seconds or so.
And there's a risk that he'll take the hostage with him.
and other police officers to their deaths.
But where exactly do you have to aim?
Face him head-on
and aim for the tip of his nose.
Well?
Could you do that?
Don't worry.
As long as I'm around, I won't let you do anything like that.
I won't.
Shû...
Thank you very much.
Make sure you don't lose it again!
Yes!
Conan-kun? Where have you been?
I lost my smartphone.
Oh, that's why I couldn't reach you!
I'm sorry, Conan-kun.
But what happened?
Ah...
I have someone who might be Moriyama.
I'm going to check if it's really him.
Wait! I'm coming too!
But where are you now?
In front of the police station at Azuma Bridge, Honjo.
What a surprise! I'm in Honjo, too!
What,
- Really? - Yes.
Seems like we were
destined to solve this case together.
Exactly. That's where you turn left.
- Oh! - That was fast, huh?
Yeah. Any movement yet?
No, don't worry. None yet.
Okay!
Let's go in.
Yes.
- Watch out, there's a car coming out... - Shit!
Damn it!
Let's go, Conan-kun!
Oh... oh, no...
He could have been shooting from two places.
Which one do you think it was?
I'll bet on the higher one.
Are you going for it?
Yes.
I think it was the higher one too.
If you connect the windshield and the entrance wound with a line..,
the starting point is the lower, closer one.
But during the shot, the car was still on its way out of the garage.
That means: Only when
the slope is added to the angle of impact,
you get the trajectory of the bullet.
And there is
only one high-rise building that lies on this trajectory!
Isn't that the building?
Wait, Conan-kun! It's too dangerous to go alone!
Damn it!
Stop! You have to
sign in first!
He's just too reckless!
Hunter could still be around!
A three?
Oh no...
Conan-kun!
Look at this!
He was actually shooting from here.
That Moriyama had really returned to Japan...
Yes. We were negligent.
Since these two were killed,
we can assume that Hunter is the killer.
Yes.
Also, the cartridge matches the caliber of Hunter's preferred MK 11.
The locations where both victims were shot,
also confirm that Hunter was the perpetrator.
What do you mean by that?
For that matter...
Akaboshi-kun!
Yes!
Fujinami-san always invited
...always invited potential victims to high places..,
...to talk them into buying his real estate.
He probably tricked Hunter in exactly the same way.
So he deliberately targeted a moment,
when Fujinami-san would present a property?
Yes.
According to industry insiders.
Fujinami obtained
numerous tickets through unofficial channels
for the pre-opening period of the tower
and presented
his properties from there virtually every day.
And also,
as for Moriyama-san...
He broke off his engagement with Hunter's sister
and married another woman.
Hunter will have Moriyama's "love nest"
as the place for the murder.
Moriyama is said to have picked up his wife
at the same time every day
after she finished her cooking class.
Hunter targeted that exact time.
On the day of the murder, the front door
and surveillance camera had been shot out,
allowing him to enter.
A precisely planned murder, for which the crime scene had been
scouted and intel gathered....
Really sounds a lot like a Navy Seal sniper.
Yes.
Speaking of precise...
Did they find a die and a shell casing this time too?

Ah... yes. At the starting point of the shot.
Here are the photos of it.
The cube shows the number three this time....
Last time it was four, wasn't it?
Could this possibly be...
a countdown?
I see.
If that's true,
Hunter would be targeting a total of four victims
four victims.
The already murdered Hiroaki Fujinami
and Hitoshi Moriyama...
And once he's killed the remaining two,
he plans to leave dice at each of the crime scenes...
dice showing a two and a one, respectively, at the respective crime scenes.
This is not good at all.
If one follows this conclusion,
the remaining two are...
Yes, undoubtedly.
It will probably be Jack Waltz and Bill Murphy.
As for these two...
After learning of the murders,
they are said to have changed their travel plans in Japan to a great extent.
Originally
they had planned to meet in Tokyo after two days.
But now they will not leave their accommodation
until the case is solved.
Waltz's family apparently wants to
to return to America as soon as possible...
Hunter plans his actions systematically. There is
danger that he foresaw their reaction.
That is why they are now stuck, so to speak....
It's probably better to leave it
for the time being?
Yes.
As long as the prefectural police keep an eye on them..,
he can't touch them.
Hunter couldn't get into Kyoto or Nikko either.
because those cities are now under strict surveillance.
But that's why we can't sit idly by and watch.
Hunter is probably still here in Tokyo!
We must find out where he is!
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!
What's wrong, Conan-kun?
Yes...
Yes.
What are you saying?
Hunter was shot?
His identity hasn't been confirmed yet,
but they're pretty sure it's him.
Yes... Yeah.
I'll call you as soon as I know more.
A diary was also found at Hunter's hideout, an apartment,
a diary was also found.
When we translated it,
we found something surprising.
These are photos from it.
"August 3: He provokes
me again by snatching away my prey.
This can only be a challenge to me.
I must kill him at all costs and take the remaining two prey animals
with my own hands..."
From this one concludes,
that someone has beaten Hunter to the punch
and killed Fujinami-san and Moriyama-san.
And that the real perpetrator challenged Hunter to a duel
and defeated
and defeated him...?
If that's so, the person we saw was,
was not Hunter.
We suspect that
the perpetrator was shooting from a platform on the opposite shore.
Also this time
the cartridge case and a die showing the two
showing the deuce were left behind.
This murder differs in that,
that the distance was much less than the two previous murders...
in the two previous murders.
Nevertheless, a projectile was lodged in the front door,
presumably from a missed shot.
Also on the platform there was
the platform was also found to have a bullet hole from a missed shot.
Forensics are now investigating the area.
The story about the bullet casings and dice
is being kept secret from the media?
Yes.
I think the fact that they were left at the scene of the shooting means
that, including Hunter's murder,
all three murders must have been committed by the same person.
And in the first sniper incident in Seattle.
there were no shell casings, no dice...
You're saying that only the murder of Brian Woods
was committed by Hunter?
Yes.
When you think about it that way, it makes sense.
And assuming that conclusion is correct,
we need to focus on the numbers on the dice.
Four, three, two, and after that....
The next one is one?
So there's another murder?
Yes.
But we have no way to stop it.
Right...
Now he doesn't necessarily have to go after Jack Waltz
and Bill Murphy, the two men that Hunter had a grudge against,
that Hunter had a grudge against.
Yes.
And we now have
no idea who he's going to
he's going to target next.
The worst possible development...
A third sniper killing occurred early this morning
early this morning in an abandoned building
near the Azuma Bridge in Tokyo's Sumida district.
The murder victim is
U.S. citizen Timothy Hunter, 37 years old.
A former sniper with the U.S. Navy's special operations unit, Navy Seals.

was himself wanted by police as a suspect in the series of murders.
wanted by the police.
Police have not yet released more detailed information,
but the two previous murders
were probably committed by the same person, right?
What?!! That means...
Yes! That this is not the end of the series of murders!
And that there's no way of knowing who's next.
This guy's killing random people?!!
No, I wouldn't go that far.
But if they don't catch this guy soon..,
- you can... - He's killing random people! That's scary!
Helicopters are flying over Sumida in droves!
Shitamachi's the riskiest.
No! I heard he's targeting Shibuya.
You mean underpasses aren't safe?
I heard it's dangerous in Harajuku too!
IT'S HARAJUKU
Oh, it's all lies!
Don't let them fool you!
The Takeshita-dôri deserted! I'm flabbergasted!
This is the first time, isn't it?
It must be happening in Asakusa.
The kids there have a curfew.
Are they stupid? So far, he's only targeted adults.
There are no old people in the temples anymore...
What's going on?
The Bell Tree Tower, where the first murder took place..,
is still closed, right?
By the way:
You can also see the Tower from the two previous crime scenes!
You can see the Tower from here, can't you?
So the Tower is the key to everything?
So all the places from where you can see it are dangerous!
An umbrella! So he can't see you from above and it's safe!
That's really gross!
DETECTIVE MÔRI
We reported live from Kinshi, where, counting serious injuries,
five people were injured.
It looks like there is panic all over Tokyo.
The story of the "indiscriminate killings"
has spread in the blink of an eye.
This is not surprising.
After all, there has never been a
- a series of sniper killings in Japan. - You're welcome.
Thank you, Ran-chan.
Thank you very much.
So?
Do you have anyone in mind?
Well, about that...
To be honest... Hunter getting shot..,
has been very disturbing for us as well.
That's why we wanted to ask your opinion, Môri-san.
I see.
There, there, there!
Asking him won't do you any good.
The only thing we know
we know for sure is that..,
is that the killer had some sort of relationship with Hunter. He didn't?
Yes.
People connected to him who live in Japan:
Scott Green, a former instructor
and a sniper himself in the Navy Seals.
in the Navy Seals.
And former U.S. Marine Corps member Kevin Yoshino.
And it's like this: The two of them have been
disappeared last night.
What?
Just... Neither of them has a motive to kill Hunter.
Then the police suspect, as far as who did it....
It could be a third person,
who hasn't turned up yet.
No.
You forgot someone else.
The former base commander
in Yokosuka, Major General (ret.) Mark Spencer.
- Huh? - But...
Specifically, his driver.
Carlos Lee, former sniper
in the U.S. Marine Corps!
But neither Spencer-san nor Lee-san had anything to do with Hunter!
Yes! And anyway! Where's the motive?
His motive is his pride as a sniper!
His pride?
Indeed.
Hunter shot 79 opponents on the battlefield.
And Lee had how many?
Oh... uh...
In the Middle East, 36.
Those are just the confirmed hits.
With the unconfirmed...
Ah... ah... j... yes!
78, if I'm not mistaken.
Exactly!
And this Lee could not bear any longer.
He felt he was a more talented shooter.
It was at this time
he heard that Hunter had killed Woods in Seattle.
So Hunter's body count had risen to 80.
That's why Lee beat him to it...
...and shot Fujinami and Moriyama?
Now it was 80 to 80.
Since Lee was finally Hunter's equal..,
he challenged him to decide the matter once and for all.
- Bang! - I see!
We'll investigate further with this!
Ah... yes.
Thank you very much!
Thank you very much.
Dad, that was great!
His conclusions are extravagant, but logical.
But, uh... Whether they're true or not...
I need more information.
New information...
That reminds me:
The bullet that was removed from Hunter's body...
was a 5.56 by 45 mm cartridge.

The lightest so far, which is why it did not penetrate his body.
It was a different cartridge than before?
Yes. Although the perpetrator was aiming for the head..,
Hunter's body had so little damage..,
that it was immediately recognizable.
He switched to lighter cartridges because of the short distance?
That's right.
Was he trying to increase accuracy by using less recoil?
He missed once, didn't he?
That's really strange.
Did you find out anything else?
There's something I noticed...
Hunter's body that I saw at the university clinic..,
was very emaciated.
Emaciated?
Yes.
Compared to the Silver Star days.
he looked like a different man.
Have the body
...not only forensically, but also clinically and pathologically.
And get an x-ray of his head.
Right. I'll talk to Inspector Megure.
Yes, sir.
I'll get back to you.
Conan-kun!
Where are you going?
Don't go far, it's dangerous!
Yeah, yeah, don't worry!
I'm just going to get my skateboard from Professor Agasa!
Wait, Conan-kun...
Yeah, I heard.
But who would want to kill Hunter?
Yeah, I have no idea either.
At least I don't have to worry about him coming after me anymore.
Remind me to tell his killer thanks.
Yeah. But we should still be careful.
Yeah. As always.
The attack in Japan aside...
Brian Woods being killed means
means we're still in danger.
You always did worry too much.
Even if I was just following your orders...
I still regret what I did
I did in the battle.
What's the point now?
You're living a life of luxury today because you followed my orders and robbed
Hunter the Silver Star. Don't forget that.
J... yeah, right. I'm sorry.
Ah... Forget it.
So, uh..,
my family and I are flying back as soon as we get tickets.
The Japanese police are incompetent.
You'd better get out of here, too. Go home, and go home fast.
Yes, sir.
I'll see you back in the States.
Mr. Murphy?
I'm working the front desk.
There's a special delivery for you.
Oh, I see.
Thank you.
NIKKO - ASAKUSA
From the base in Yokosuka?
But who...
I know about all your deeds in the Middle East.
What?!!
I don't want to cause a commotion,
but we're going to have to take another look at Hunter's infraction.
Your ticket is enclosed.
Come here... Or court-martialed.
Don't tell Waltz.
And destroy this letter immediately.
Ma... Ma... Mark Spencer?!
Oh god...
NIKKO - ASAKUSA
It's really strange.
That they both missed even though the distance was the shortest.
Yes.
Were they nervous because it was a duel...
between snipers?
And...
That all the crimes
took place here in Asakusa and the surrounding area also concerns me.
In fact...
The distances, trajectories
and the dice may have a more specific meaning.
What is it, Jodie-sensei?
On your advice, I had Hunter undergo a clinical pathological autopsy.
The result: In his stomach
there was a large quantity of painkillers. And pretty strong ones at that.
Painkillers?
The reason for this turned out to be an MRI of his head.
There is a fragment of a cartridge near the brain stem.
It's not from the incident here.
It's from the battle eight years ago, isn't it?
Yes.
The operation was successful, but
but a fragment was left behind.
It must have pressed on his visual and other nerves..,
which is why he suffered from chronic raging headaches
and probably could no longer see well.
See?
Strange that he was then able to shoot Woods in Seattle!
What if that murder was also committed by the current perpetrator?
But if it was, what would be the point of the duel with Hunter?
Well...
There would be a point.
But not...
Yes.
If that's really the case,
the first two attacks, and the one on Hunter.
could have an entirely different meaning.
Hello? Takagi here!
Oh,
Conan-kun! That's a good one!
Please tell Môri-san something:
I'm afraid Lee-san has an alibi.
-And... - More importantly... Where are Waltz and Murphy?
Ah... Waltz is still in Kyoto, but
Murphy said he was safe now,
...and, ignoring police concerns...
and, ignoring police concerns, boarded the 9:00 a.m. Express to Tokyo this morning.

Someone wanted to meet him and sent him a ticket.
A ticket?
9 o'clock express? That is...
As far as I know, he arrives in Asakusa at 11.
Crap!
If this is a trap set by the perpetrator....
A place overlooking the platform is ideal as a location!
The victim sits quietly in the seat reserved by the perpetrator!
So he's near Asakusa station!
Hurry up! We only have three minutes left!
This is serious! He's targeting Murphy-san!
Conan-kun! What do you mean? Conan-kun?
The Express!
It's here already?!
Yeah, it's on the bridge, driving slowly...
What's that van doing in the middle of the bridge?
Oh, no...
A rifle!
Is he going to go from there...?
There's no time to go back!
Conan-kun!
Oh, no...
Is that guy trying to hit Murphy on a moving train?
I have to hold him back until the train passes!
Please make it last!
Go!!!
Helloooo!
Here I am! Murphy-san!!!
...we reach our destination Asakusa.
Please notice that something is wrong!
Hellooo!!!
Damn it.
Hellooo!!!
Murphy-san!
Conan-kun!
Watch out!!!
Se... ra...?
Wha... what's that?
Die.
Sera! Snap out of it, Sera!
Why did you...
Fucking... Fucking...
Damn it!!!
TÔTO-ASAKUSA HOSPITAL
OPERATION IN PROGRESS
Are you hurt, little one? Are you all right?
Yes.
There's blood on your shirt...
That's not mine.
Conan-kun!
Superintendent Megure!
Do you have a minute?
- Patient #18... - I don't like needles...
Shall we go home?
Is mom coming back soon?
If that's the case, this wasn't a random killing?
He was targeting Murphy from the beginning?
Yes.
Thank you. That's what I wanted to confirm.
That's what I wanted confirmed.
So the killer and Hunter were actually accomplices?
Wha... what do you mean?
Just now.
with the help of the FBI.
we've discovered a new element of the crime.
The new facts?
Due to the long-term effects
of his head injury, Hunter has been physically unable
for the past eight years.
But in Hunter's diary.
did it say something about a duel with the real killer?
It was all a lie.
We think that Hunter himself
asked the killer to shoot him.
- That can't be... - Oh no...
By shooting him, the prime suspect himself..,
he confuses the investigation
...and makes the next victim reckless..,
so that he can kill him more easily.
This plan was probably in place from the beginning.
That the perpetrator, when he shot Hunter,
from a relatively short distance of 150 yards...
missed his target once, was not
at Hunter's request, but
but because the perpetrator hesitated.
That only there
a lighter ammunition was used,
is probably because the perpetrator wanted to leave Hunter's body...
as unharmed as possible.
I see...
And Hunter, who couldn't see very well..,
shot the perpetrator, not because he wanted to hit him...
but because he felt his feelings.
It was a message to him.
Yes.
That also explains
the unusual sequence of events, how two gifted snipers
despite the fact that they were facing each other
and although they were facing each other, could miss each other
could miss each other with one shot.
But to conclude this only on the basis of circumstantial evidence....
Isn't that a bit risky?
No.
We have evidence to support those conclusions.
Evidence, you say?
We have the video that Conan-kun and his friends...
...at Bell Tree Tower..,
...by FBI headquarters...
It showed another man...
...and another man..,
presumably his accomplice.
Indeed!
There really are two of them!
Hunter probably acted as an observer,
as a so-called "spotter"...
But Navy Seals don't normally use spotters!
Were they extra careful because it was
because it was the first murder in Japan?
Or...
Raging headache, low vision....
Hunter realized that he would never
would never escape these afflictions again, and
and hired the perpetrator to exact his revenge..,
which included his own death.
Wait. The mystery of the dice is not yet....
Yes.
Also this time on the scene were
an empty cartridge case and a die were left at the scene.
What number did it show?
Well, that...
Not the one.
But the five.
I beg your pardon?

So it wasn't a countdown?
That after four, three, two...
is not followed by one...
What do you think that means?
I thought it was a message to Waltz that the closer the dice were rolled.
of his execution was getting closer as the number of dice diminished?
It looks like we're
we may have jumped to conclusions too quickly.
Perhaps, for some reason, the murder of Waltz was more important to him
more important to him than killing those who drove his family
- to their deaths... - Be that as it may...
Kevin Yoshino and Scott Green.
We need to find out where they are as soon as possible.
- They have... - In any case, I will not forgive the perpetrator.
I'll stop him at all costs next time!
Why the Asakusa area?
And the number of the dice...
Do you have any idea what all this means?
I've said it before!
Asakusa and those dice don't mean a thing!
You'd better find Scott Green as soon as possible.
He's the culprit, for sure!
A... but...
We don't have enough evidence yet.
Come on!
Talking to you Japanese cops..,
is just a waste of time!
Waltz-san!
No matter what happens, do not approach Tokyo under any circumstances.
As you can see from the map itself,
the perpetrator will also be planning his next murder in Asakusa.
Why would I go there?
To such an ominous place?
You'd better get me
get me tickets home from Kansai Airport.
After all, Murphy was kind enough
to show us where the killer is by killing him.
If I don't take this opportunity, his death will be for nothing!
Horrible guy...
His colleague is dead, and he...
The fact that someone showed up to carry on Hunter's last wish..,
I guess that means he also knows what I did eight years ago.
Damn...
Damn it...
I've got to do something about this!
What the hell?
Hello?
D... you!
MASUMI SERA
Conan-kun...
Leave it to us to take care of Sera-san.
Yes.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
The doctors say her life isn't in danger.
I'll let you know as soon as she wakes up.
Okay?
Yes.
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
But it was really lucky, what...
If it wasn't for Sera-san.
the little one would have been in mortal danger.
They said she protected Conan with her own body.
She really risked her life...
Sera-san said it then...
Don't worry.
I'll protect Conan-kun, I promise.
And anyway, his heart isn't vulnerable to any bullet right now.
Of course, neither is your heart.
That's right, I remember...
She said that your heart wasn't vulnerable to bullets either...
I can't forgive him.
Conan-kun...
and do this to Sera-san! I'll never forgive...
I'll never forgive that criminal!
Ran...
Shû...
nii...
Shû-nii...
She said "Shû-nii"...
Does she mean her older brother?
She once said she had one, but he was dead.
What's up?
I hadn't noticed the bouquet of flowers....
Really...
I wonder if anyone's been here.
Who's it from?
I don't know.
But look, Sonoko!
He's incredibly beautiful.
It really is. Let's put it on the windowsill.
Yeah. I'll go borrow a vase.
What's wrong Ran?
Oh... Nothing.
It's nothing.
DANNY'S RESTAURANT
Do you know where Green and Yoshino are?
Well... In the Kansai region
there have been several sightings of someone who might have been Green.
The police will launch a large-scale manhunt with Osaka as the center.
It will target Waltz, who is flying home from Kansai Airport.
Not good at all.
The timing is just too perfect.
What if this is a diversionary tactic..,
to facilitate Yoshino's activities?
Commissioner Megure!
Yes?
James-san! I have something to tell you.
What is it?
I heard about the Green sighting from Camel...
No. It's something worse.
I heard Waltz-san disappeared!
What do you mean?
We are at a loss as well.
According to the Kyoto police.
after questioning him.
he left his hotel through the back exit.
He told his wife that he would be back tomorrow.
But why? What on earth made him...?
Something seems to have happened.
- Yes. - I'll contact you as soon as I know anything.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
What happened, Jodie-sensei?
Yes. That Green has been spotted,

Inspector Takagi secretly told me...
Yes. And what about this?
What? Waltz-san is...?!!
I wonder what he was thinking.
If we find out what these dice mean..,
we'll know
where Waltz-san is going.
You mean he's going to the next attack site voluntarily?
I don't know.
But between the perpetrator and waltz.
something else we don't know about.
Some special connection maybe.
You're right.
We're re-examining the relationship between victims and
between victims and perpetrators.
All right, I'll get back to you.
Thanks for your patience, Camel.
Let's go.
Yes.
We'll meet Unit 1 and go over the intel again.
Yeah. Thanks.
Waltz-san disappeared saying he would be back tomorrow.
That means...
MESSAGE WILL BE SENT
Within the next 24 hours
another attack will take place!
SENT
TEXT: HERE ARE THE DATES. IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, I'M COUNTING ON YOU.
I got everything you wanted.
All untraceable.
And the scope?
Exactly adjusted.
I wouldn't have expected anything less from you, Carlos.
You're the best, after all.
That means you and Hunter.
What do you say I let you take out the shooter?
Then you'd really be number one.
Weren't you one hit behind Hunter during the war?
Rear Admiral Spencer just gave me orders..,
to get the weapon.
Never mind.
Now that I know the target, I don't need your help anyway.
Thank you for the weapon.
I have another message from Admiral Spencer.
He says there's no investigation
into the cause of this rampage.
Just eliminate this sniper, absolutely.
Preserve the credibility of the U.S. military.
The cause of this rampage....
How much does the admiral know?
Probably
everything.
What?!!
What?!!
But... how...?
Only one person alive knows about this operation,
and that's me!
The Sniper used the Admiral's name
to threaten Bill Murphy.
Murphy was scared.
The day before he was killed,
he asked for the charges to be reduced.
He emailed the admiral,
confessed to everything.
The plan to take the Silver Star away from Hunter.
Her orders after that.
Everything.
What?
What?
Your crimes of eight years ago...
are unforgivable.
But, uh...
But, uh...
We have to stop a former American soldier
from committing any more murders
from committing any more murders abroad.
Well, if he knows everything anyway...
Please tell the Admiral
I want to meet with him
as soon as this case is over.
And one more thing.
What?
What?
Do you know what the dice mean now?
It's not worth it.
Now we know the shooter.
Now we know the shooter.
We now come to a report that has just come in.
It's about Bill Murphy, who was shot
at eleven o'clock yesterday morning on the Tohto Railways Express "Oruri"...
was shot dead.
We have learned that he is believed to have had something to do with Timothy Hunter,
the previous murder victim.
The woman who was involved in the attack,
is on the mend.
This concludes the breaking news story.
Well, what do you know?
So this guy isn't killing randomly at all?
I told you so!
Thanks to your irresponsible talk.
- panic has broken out all over Tokyo! - What, really?
Ah, I'm really sorry!
I'm really sorry.
What a blind alarmist!
- Hello, Uncle! - Huh?
It looks like Sera-neechan has woken up!
Let's go visit her together!
I'm sorry, but you guys go ahead.
I want to think about this a little longer.
Dude... You've been up all night and you still want to...
...I solved the riddle of the dice!
What, really?
Huh? Yes!
For a master detective like me
one night is easily enough for that!
So, what do the cubes mean?
Well, the dice are...
a countdown!
The bridge must have been shaking!
That's why the last die he put down..,
flipped from the one to the five!
See?
If you think about it like that, it's all very simple...
Well?
What's up?
Where did he go?
It's not a countdown.
It's something else.
I have to talk to Sera about what happened.
Here!
A clear shot...
Yes! I found it!

The perfect position to shoot at the Chigusa
to shoot.
The victory is mine!
D... you!
I got Murphy.
Now it's your turn!
W... why...
Why you?
For the money?
How much did he pay you? I'll pay you double!
You really never change, Waltz...
I, uh...
Come on, let's make a deal.
You, alone here in a foreign country...
You could use the money, right?
Tomorrow night.
Come to Chigusa in Asakusa at eight o'clock sharp.
We'll discuss it then.
Uh... okay. E... okay.
To the Chigusa in Asakusa.
If you confess everything,
plead guilty...
I'll let you live.
But if you're
late as it is, say goodbye
say goodbye to your family!
Understand?
Hello?
Hey, I...
Damn it!
Damn it! Damn it!
Helen...
Sarah...
Waltz-san!
Emergency!
Green was caught on camera at Shin-Osaka Station!
Going to the airport would be dangerous!
I'm sorry, but
You'll have to cancel your flight home.
Damn it!
Then it's: "Kill or be killed."
Here! The perfect position to aim at the Chigusa.
That's the one he takes. It's textbook.
Every sniper's dream.
But tonight, I won't be the target.
It's him!
Only a sniper can defeat a sniper.
In the end, it all comes down to foresight.
Anticipating your opponent's actions,
gaining the tactical advantage.
And most importantly:
A superior position guarantees victory.
That I have found this place means....
Victory is mine!
You want to challenge me?
You will lose.
Say hello to Hunter for me, in hell!
Conan-kun!
You came alone?
Yes. The others are coming later, by car.
I see.
We were just going to the store downstairs.
Are you coming?
No, I'll wait here.
I'll wait here.
I'll wait here. Shall we go, Sonoko?
Yes! Sera-san, we'll be off for a while!
- Yes! Thank you very much. - We'll be right back.
Call us if you need anything, okay?
Yes!
Hi, Conan-kun!
It looks like you didn't get hit by a bullet, huh?
I haven't thanked you for saving me yet.
That's okay. I just kept my promise to Ran-kun.
But what about the perpetrator?
The two suspects are still missing without a trace.
I see.
Yesterday, when I was shot..,
...I noticed something.
The perpetrator used
used a laser sight.
Don't you think that's strange?
Snipers don't need that!
The target might notice it
and it gives away their own location.
I see.
That's why Hunter didn't have a suicide, but a duel....
Huh? What do you mean?
A suicide would have stopped the investigation sooner..,
and Murphy would have felt a lot safer.
But he didn't.
I see.
So it was kind of like a final test for the perp,
to become a cold, calm sniper!
Yes.
The first attack was at the maximum distance of an MK 11.
The second at night and on a moving target.
The third was about mental toughness,
to remain motionless no matter who the target.
Hunter's goal, until his death, was to
train the perp to be an excellent sniper!
That means the perpetrator.... Ouch!
You okay?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Hello! We're here for a visit!
Hey, Genta-kun, you're making too much noise!
- Sorry, sorry. - Oh! Conan-kun!
What did you guys bring?
- It's really great, isn't it? - Yes, it is!
We brought it to cheer Masumi up. You didn't?
- Yes! - Yes!
Wah, that's great!
Did you do this all by yourselves?
Yes!
This is our project for the summer vacations!
It's not quite finished yet, though.
But we wanted to show it to you.
Thank you so much.
It's really great!
Yes. It's very well done.
The exact shape of the buildings is not right,
but their size and position are correct!
Ai-chan checked it for us.
Okay!
Someone hasn't helped yet, though.
...but it's finished!
So it's not finished yet?
I think it looks really good already!
What do you have to do?
We still have to paint it!
But the other day at the Bell Tree Tower, we could only take pictures
we could only take pictures from the western side.
So we don't know the colors of the houses.

Before painting, we would like to go up the tower again....
Shall we go up again?
The tower is repaired, but not yet open.
We could have it to ourselves!
- Are you serious? - You really think so?
- Whoo-hoo! - Great!
What's wrong with you?
Our summer vacation homework project is all set!
Haibara...
The scale of the model is right, isn't it?
Yes.
Okay! Then let's hurry back and get our cameras!
Yes!
What's wrong, Conan-kun?
What's that?
I feel like I'm looking at something that wasn't on the map!
You're going to help us paint it, right?
What's wrong, Conan-kun?
What's wrong?
Do you see anything, Conan?
That's interesting.
What's interesting?
If you look at it from a crouching position,
there's a place from which
the houses all look the same height!
Conan-kun!
Genta, show me that, will you?
Huh? Here, look.
Oh, yeah, that's right!
That's really interesting!
I see! The message is not
expressed in two dimensions...
But you have to look at it in three dimensions!
Here!
From here
the launch sites of the first two attacks look the same height!
What about the other attacks?
The third was the platform. And the fourth was the Komagata Bridge.
From the previous position, the result is....
an isosceles trapezoid!
Wait a minute...
If you include the Tower observation deck as well....
A regular pentagon!
Such a shape doesn't happen by chance.
No doubt about it.
It was deliberately arranged that way!
I forgot something. I'm going home!
Huh? Wha... Conan-kun?
Aren't you coming to Bell Tree Tower?
Please be careful, Conan-kun!
No. I'm going to have to pass today!
Waltz said he would return to Kyoto today.
That means...
In order for him to make it back, the decision has to be made by eight!
Shit, I've got to hurry!
Hi Cool Kid!
I've got new info.
The Osaka Prefectural Police have arrested Scott Green.
It seems that Hunter asked him
Hunter asked him to go into hiding in Osaka...
and not to get caught until this time today.
I knew it...
Yes. He seems to have had some inkling
that Hunter had come to Japan for revenge.
When he saw Hunter determined to die,
he must have wanted to help him fulfill his last wish.
If he was just a decoy,
the real culprit is...
Yeah. Ah, and we just got
some new intel from FBI HQ.
Witness reports say that Hunter,
after losing his family,
he was living with an Asian man.
If that was
Kevin Yoshino...
He could have committed the murders!
Yes. Thank you, Jodie-sensei!
But tell me, Conan-kun...
Where are you right now?
I'm on my way to the site of the next attack.
What?
You solved the Cube puzzle?
I'm not sure yet. I want to check it out now.
But don't have time!
Can we support you?
If my deductions are correct, the
the tower observation deck is involved again.
The tower...
Okay.
We'll go there.
Good!
Make sure you're careful.
Let's go.
Yes, sir!
According to the model, it should be somewhere around here...
From that building...
you might be able to see it.
Where's the tower?
Fujinami was shot from there...
And from there, Yasuhara.
That's right. They form a practically horizontal line.
That means...
If we connect them with the 3rd and 4th firing points..:
an isosceles trapezoid.
If you take the tower observation deck into it....
No doubt about it. A regular pentagon!
Put on top of it the cubes that were left behind in each case,
and place the last one on the tower...
I see!
So that was it!
What the killer wanted to show Waltz,
his last victim,
is a star!
The symbol for the Silver Star that was taken away from Hunter.
Hunter and the perpetrator put on the star from the very beginning
put on to show Waltz the Silver Star!
Meaning.
On the 1st observation deck of the tower the cube with
the cube with the one.
And this is also the place from where
the perpetrator will now shoot!
There he is!
So the perpetrator is indeed...
Kevin Yoshino!
Damn it!
Where is this guy aiming?
In order to get a more regular star shape..,
he has to go to a slightly higher place...

That's where Waltz was supposed to show up!
There?!!
Say hello to Hunter for me, in hell.
Come on, Waltz, come to the window!
The moment you see our message,
will be your last.
This time I'll stop him, at any cost!
Ha, today I finally get rid of Hunter's ghost.
Settle the score once and for all.
W... What the...?
That wasn't here before!
Huh?
Did you leave it here for me?
Go!!!
Die.
What... that flash of light...
It came from that building.
What?!! That brat's interfering again?
Damn it!
You're...
You'll pay for this,
you son of a bitch!
Damn you! I can't escape from here!
M... my leg...
Shit...
You brat!
You've ruined everything. Everything!
Did someone shoot him?
But...
You could only aim up here...
From there?
Another sniper?
But, uh......how...?
The only position from which you could aim
is the Asakusa Sky Court!
But
But
this building is...
If you aim at it from here, nothing can happen to you.
What if Waltz recognizes the message before I do...
and aims at me from the sky court?
Don't worry.
There's no one left who can hit accurately at this distance.
at this distance.
Oh yeah, that's right.
Your eyes are no longer...
No.
Even I couldn't hit from such a distance.
There was a better sniper than you?
Yeah, in the FBI.
A gifted marksman they called the Silver Bullet.
But you don't have to worry.
The guy's considered lost, and they say he's long dead.
U... Impossible!
Is he...
Are you saying that "Silver Bullet" has appeared?
Subaru-san?
Wha... what is he doing?
I see.
So Subaru-san solved the riddle of the dice, too?
Conan-kun, we're at Bell Tree Tower.
We're negotiating to go up.
Very well.
Climb to the top of the observation deck!
That's where Yoshino is...
So the culprit really is Yoshino.
Yes.
So? Can you go up?
No.
The tower is reserved exclusively.
They won't let us in.
That reminds me...
These exclusive guests are Ran and the others!
Explain the situation and get up there!
Arrest Yoshino!
I'll take care of it. I'll let Commissioner Megure handle it.
Wah, that's beautiful!
Isn't it? The view at night is fantastic from here, too!
Wow, that's cool!
It's even more beautiful at night!
It sure is!
Let's go over there, we don't have any photos yet!
- Yeah! - Let's go!
Shin'ichi?
He's not completely immobile...
I can't give up now!
I promised Hunter-san...
You've become good.
Now all you need is practical experience.
Good.
First up is Brian Woods.
And Waltz.
I'm definitely gonna...
Are you sure about this?
It's a little late...
But I regret dragging you into this.
What are you talking about?
You saved my life
countless times during the war!
And now I can finally show my gratitude!
But...
And... Waltz and his cronies can't be forgiven.
Because your deeds made theirs
paled their own, they innocently accused you
innocently accused of a crime
and took away your Silver Star!
And no sooner did we ask for a reopening
to reopen the investigation, Murphy
on Waltz's orders, tried to kill you!
Yes.
You're right.
If you hadn't been suspicious
the bullet from my head with the one from Murphy's rifle,
the truth would have remained hidden.
But
that evidence was also taken away from us,
and in the end...
Kevin,
I ask you once again.
Let Waltz and his cronies,
who are responsible for the death of my family and my misfortune,
go to hell!
Yes.
I promise you.
At any price.
I'll let them go to hell, I promise.
I'll leave it up to you.
Yes...
I can't give up yet!
If I escape according to plan, I'll muddle through somehow.
And then...
I'll be Waltz...
That's right! And that's why you all have to get off the tower now!
Huh? But then what about the culprit?
Don't worry.
The FBI is on their way.
Okay. All right.
There's the emergency stairs.
Yes.
Sonoko!
Hey, how dare you!

Give Ayumi-chan back immediately!
What are you doing! Hide at once!
- But... - He has Ayumi...
You kids stay out of this!
Oh no!
- Sonoko! - Stop screaming, you bastards!
Stay there!
I'm going to borrow that one.
Stay away!
We're FBI!
Throw down your weapon!
Shut up!
If you come any closer..,
...the girl dies!
Muzzle flash?
The bastard hasn't given up yet?
Don't make me use the last one.
Come on, bring her here.
Stand still!
Do you want the girl to die?
Okay! We have to save Ayumi-chan!
Yes!
Don't talk nonsense!
That guy has a gun!
We have to save her somehow!
Sonoko! Come to your senses, Sonoko!
Shin'ichi...
What am I going to do? Please help me!
Damn it! I can't do anything from here. I can't do anything from here!
Be reasonable!
Hurry up or I'll kill her!
If you want to rescue a hostage unharmed..,
the hostage-taker must die.
But to do that...
There's only one way to kill a man...
with a single shot,
without the hostage even flinching.
The brain stem...
Exactly.
I have no choice!
Damn it... It won't work over there.
Jodie-san!
Yoshino!
We got him!
Oh no! What's wrong?
Ah... I can't see anything!
A power failure?
Shut up, both of you! Get back!
Darn it! The lights went out!
So Subaru-san can't...
I see.
He was going to try to escape under the cover of darkness...
Now what?
That's not good! If we don't do anything, he'll take Ayumi with him!
NIGHT VISION MODE
Oh no!
A night vision device!
Run away, Jodie-sensei!
Yoshino!
Stop this nonsense!
Camel!
Answer me, Camel!
Damn!
That's how he'll finish them all!
If I could light up the platform,
Subaru-san would shoot him for sure!
But my leg is...
How can I make Yoshino visible...?
Wait!
His night vision is an old model...
Then I'll just have to
I'll just have to find a way to light up the Bell Tree Tower...
This?!!
If I use this height...
Could it work then?
No...
I don't have a choice!
Edogawa-kun!
Hello?
Light!
You have to shine a light on him!
He's wearing night vision! Then he'll be blinded!
But where is he?
Right.
Use it.
All right.
He'll be coming at you in a minute.
Don't move for 30 seconds so he won't know you're there.
I'm hanging up.
Listen up!
Don't move for the next 30 seconds.
Yes.
I'll get another chance.
The boy will definitely...
Please!
Make it work!
Are you ready?
Yes.
Yes!
Let's go.
Where from? Where do you hear it from?
Wait!
From over there!
- Okay! - Go!
Now!
What...?!!
Yoshida-san! Over here!
Ai-chan!
You miserable bastards!
Go! Go! Go!
Run!
Ran-san!
No, don't, Ran!
Ran!!!
Damn it! No time to think for long!
What am I going to do, Shin'ichi?
She'll just interfere...
Hostage exchange, then.
All or nothing!
I'll do it!
Wait for me,
Ran!!!
Go!!!
Now.
What's that?
- It's bright! - What is it?
Ran!
For Sonoko!
For Ayumi-chan!
And for Sera-san! This is her revenge!
Yes.
We've captured Yoshino.
We did it!
- That was great, Ran-san! - Raaaaan!
Sonoko!
You're so cool, Ran!
Mo... Wait, are you okay, Sonoko?
I don't know what's going on, but I'm fine.
But, why are the lights out? Is the tower closed?
Come on, Sonoko!
Come on, Sonoko.
She has no mercy.
The target is out of action.
Report: All clear.
Jodie-kun just called in.
Thank you for your efforts. I'll get back to you.
Roger.

Tomorrow you'll finally be released...
Yes. Thank you for taking care of me.
You're welcome, don't mention it.
Ah, that reminds me... Waltz-san was on TV, right?
The sniper attack series was the reason why
that his crimes came to light one by one.
He'll probably spend the rest of his life behind bars.
Even "our" perpetrators fell victim to him.
and simply wanted to take revenge on him.
But nevertheless, Ran...
That you took on a guy who had a machine gun!
I just saw red.
You're lucky you got off with a graze.
What if he'd hit your heart?
That gives me the shivers!
No, I'm a lucky guy.
Don't worry.
The only one who can snipe Ran-kun's heart..,
is him.
Ah, that's right, you're right!
Your beloved Shin'ichi-kuuun!
- Really, Sonoko! - At least for now.
Are you okay, Conan-kun?
There's no point in trying to get attention.
You're going to get your share of the project..,
...that you've been avoiding, you're going to do it now.
Okay, let's go to the swimming pool!
- Yeah! - It's a lonely job, Haibara-san.
But please take over Conan-kun's supervision!
Yes, yes. Your hands just stopped.
Come on! Are they going to let me do the rest all by myself?
