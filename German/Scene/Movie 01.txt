KUROKAWA ESTATE
Mr. Kurokawa sat in front of his computer,
TAIZO KUROKAWA (62) HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
when he was struck from behind while drinking.
The bronze statue next to him is no doubt the murder weapon.
But what I don't understand is this.
It seems to be a death message,
but what does J U N mean?
That points directly to the killer.
Excuse me?
What's more, the killer is one of the three there.
How unexpectedly perceptive.
MINA KUROKAWA (32) TAIZO'S SECOND WIFE
His wife, Mina Kurokawa.
DAISUKE KUROKAWA (36) TAIZO'S ELDEST SON, PHYSICIST
His eldest son, Daisuke Kurokawa. And
MANAMI NAKAZAWA (27) HOUSEKEEPER
The housekeeper, Manami Nakazawa. One of them was.
Fantastic, Môri-kun. So, who's the killer?
The perpetrator who killed Daizô Kurokawa,
- is you! - Huh?
- Eh? - His wife?
The three letters J, U, N of Mr. Kurokawa,
that's June in English. The first letters of it.
It rains little in this month.
JUNE
That is why it is called Minazuki.
JUNE - MINAZUKI (SIXTH MONTH)
In short, it is Mina-san. What's more, you have...
JUNE - MINAZUKI - MINA (MINA)
Because my birthday is in June?
Just because there is Mina in Minazuki?
This nonsense makes me a culprit?
Well, that's called logical reasoning.
Would someone who is on the brink of death think in such a roundabout way?
In his place, I would have typed the name of the culprit.
Not you too, Inspector.
Now he's at his wit's end. Can't be helped.
Accusing innocent people, is that your job?
I guess I'll have to use my usual tranquilizer dart...
with a tranquilizer dart.
Oh, there it is, the flash!
Yes? I've been waiting for it.
Well, that you're the murderess,
was a joke, of course.
A joke?
Inspector Megure, take a good look at the body.
Only the little finger on Kurokawa's right hand...
is covered in blood.
Yes. That's right.
Now, on which parts of the keyboard is there blood?
On the ke, mu and ro keys,
and on the left alphabet shift key.
The blood at ke, mu, ro came on the keys,
when Kurokawa with the index finger
the keys j, u, n and so the blood from the small finger on
from the little finger onto said keys.
But nobody will press with the right small finger
a key on the left edge.
So, how did the blood get on the left key?
Probably the victim was
was hit in the back of the head by the sneaking perpetrator.
After that, he grabbed his head.
That's how the blood got on the little finger.
When he turned around, he was hit again
and tore with the little finger the keyboard to the ground.
In short, the left key,
the alphabet shift key,
was not pressed by Mr. Kurokawa on purpose,
but was accidentally pressed as he fell.
As the perpetrator scrambled, Mr. Kurokawa,
while he was already losing his senses,
pressed the keys in front of him with his last ounce of strength.
With the intention of writing in Japanese.
Then the Japanese characters
that Mr. Kurokawa pressed...
MA NA MI
Ma - na - mi?!
Exactly. The maid Manami Nakazawa.
It was you!
You're kidding, right? Mr. Detective?
After all, there's no proof.
There is proof.
When you committed the crime,
didn't you take off your shoes?
The slippers would have made too much noise on the wooden floor...
and you wouldn't have been able to sneak up on them unnoticed.
Without realizing it,
you stepped into the blood splattered on the floor.
This is testified by the spot A, where a bloodstain is
is not complete.
On your white socks
there should be a blood stain.
When questioned by the police, you testified,
that you did not approach the body.
Do you agree with an examination of the blood stain on the sock?
Kurokawa killed my husband
a year ago.
Are you the wife of the patient my father operated on?
Yes. Because Kurokawa was drunk during the operation, my husband had to die.
I changed my hair and name, and no one recognized me.
That is, for you, this incident was nothing..,
to remember.
I wanted to file a complaint and asked
the hospital staff to testify against him.
But no one supported me.
Everyone was afraid of Kurokawa.
And so you wanted revenge for your husband.

Today it was exactly one year ago.
I do not regret it.
After all, I was able to avenge him.
Let's go.
That's when I brought glory back to the old man.
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE TICKING SKYSCRAPER
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran,
I watched men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on what was happening
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He administered a poison to me and when I came to,
my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised to keep my true identity a secret.
When Ran asked my name, I said Conan Edogawa.
To learn more about these men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
However, the old man is a fool of a detective.
I couldn't stand by any longer
and with my logic I solved one case after another.
Thanks to this, the old man is now a famous detective.
MASTER DETECTIVE KOGORO MÔRI
And I am back at the elementary school.
My classmates Ayumi, Genta, and Mitsuhiko
have formed the Detective Boys with me.
DETECTIVE BOYS
Now I'd like to introduce you to Professor Agasa's inventions.
The anesthesia chronometer.
When you press the button with the visor up..,
a needle shoots out and puts you to sleep instantly.
The voice transposer in the shape of a fly.
By adjusting the dials
you can create a wide variety of voices.
My secret weapon is the power kick boots.
The pressure points on the foot are stimulated and thus increase my muscle strength.
For the manhunt: skateboard with turbo drive.
However, it is powered by solar energy,
so you can only use it in daylight.
Oops, can't forget this. Our club pin
is a tiny device with which you can
transmit and receive. It's a great piece!
There's a lot more,
but my best weapon is up here!
My mind is still the same. Iöse every case!
There is always only one truth!
PROFESSOR AGASA'S HOUSE APRIL 26 (SATURDAY)
To Mr. Yûsaku Kudô, Mr. Yûsaku Kudô.
CONAN EDOGAWA (SHIN'ICHI KUDÔ)
Ts, everything is just for father.
Probably most of it is fan letters anyway.
Even the new series "Night Baron", which your father wrote,
is supposed to be a bestseller in the States.
Yes, but he's in Switzerland right now.
He travels all over the world all the time.
It's very annoying to send his fan mail after him.
Since he's giving you free rein, it's the least you can do.
Yes, I know. By the way, Professor. What are you tinkering with?
Something new for me?
Unfortunately, no, it's nothing like that.
Mankind has explored flying birds
and invented the airplane. But so far
no one has succeeded in reproducing the flight mechanics of insects.
I will complete the first model
and market it as a toy.
All the children of the world will be interested in it!
The money will come pouring in and I will become a millionaire!
and I will become a millionaire!
When will this become a reality?
I've been hearing this since I was a kid.
And anyway.
Not a single fan letter for me. I must have been forgotten.
TO MR. SHIN'ICHI KUDÔ, BEIKA DISTRICT
Huh? This is for me!
TEIJI MORIYA
Teiji Moriya?
That Teiji Moriya?
Please forgive me for writing so suddenly.
I've been wanting to write to you, the high school detective..,
whose activities I have followed in the newspapers
in the newspapers and on television.
and have a conversation with you.
PROFESSOR AGASA (52) INVENTOR
As for my request, there will be a meeting on Tuesday, April 29,
from half past three in the afternoon at my humble home.
Afternoon Tea Garden Party, to which I would like to invite you.
cordially invite you.
MR. SHIN'ICHI KUDÔ COMPANY WELCOME
INVITATION FOR SHIN'ICHI KUDÔ ESCORT WELCOME
What, an invitation to a party?
Professor, you know Teiji Moriya, don't you?
Of course. He is a professor of architecture at Tôto University
and one of Japan's leading architects.
Why is someone like that interested in me?
Architects are artists, too.
Maybe he's looking for new inspiration.
After all, Professor Moriya is a genius like me.
A genius, then.

A garden party?
RAN MÔRI TEITAN HIGH SCHOOL, SECOND YEAR
Yes, I'm in the middle of investigating a case and I can't go.
You want me to go in your place?
You're welcome to come with us.
Why don't you take your father and the boy with you? What's his name?
- Conan-kun? That's right, the three of you can go.
The invitation's already in your mailbox.
Oh, really! You call me once and ask me for something right away.
- But only on one condition. - A condition?
Next Saturday you go with me to the long cinema night.
Why not? We haven't been out for a long time.
We'll meet at 10:00 in front of the Beika cinema.
Wait. Next Saturday is very inconvenient. Later would be...
Out of the question. It has to be May 3rd!
Tell me, do you prefer red or blue?
Red or blue? Why do you ask?
- It doesn't matter. Just answer! - Well, red it is.
Red? So it is indeed red. I had a feeling you'd say that.
After all, red is your favorite color.
KOGORO MÔRI PRIVATE DETECTIVE
- Hey, where's my food? - I'll make it in a minute.
All right, Shin'ichi. Third of May, at ten in the evening. Don't forget!
Hey! Really.
If I could go to the movies, you wouldn't have to go to the party for me.
But why does it have to be May 3rd?
Was there something on May 3rd?
On May 4, Holmes fell down the Reichenbach Falls with Moriarty.
May 5 is the day of the child.
Hello, Conan-kun! Are you on your way home?
Inspector! Has something happened?
INSPECTOR MEGURE POLICE INVESTIGATION DIVISION
Well, so many things. Let me introduce you.
Shiratori-kun here has been assigned to our department.
INVESTIGATOR SHIRATORI POLICE INVESTIGATION DIVISION
I'm Shiratori. The inspector has told me a lot about you.
You seem to notice interesting things.
No kidding. It's all just coincidence. Just coincidence.
Probably. It often happens that coincidences accumulate.
Hehe, well countered.
With so many incidents, Golden Week
won't bring me any relief. See you.
Golden Week?
That's right!
May 3 is Constitution Day.
Yeah, so?
What? Birthday?
Yes. May 4 is Shin'ichi's birthday.
I invited him to the movie night on May 3,
so that at midnight I could surprise him with my gift,
a red polo shirt, at midnight.
Oh, I see, May 4 is my birthday.
I had completely forgotten about that.
What movie are you going to see?
- The Legend of the Red Thread. - Red Thread?
Don't you know it? When a man and a woman are meant to be together..,
from the moment they are born, they are joined together
with a red thread.
That is the theme of this romance.
What for girls!
Check it out here! The happy color in May
of Shin'ichi and me is red!
TAURUS 4/20 - 5/20 KEY NO.5 - RED - DEPARTMENT STORE
So I decided that's the only way to do it.
Even if you set it that way,
I can't go to the movies with you.
Wait a minute. Did you say something
about a movie night?
- Yes. - No way!
I won't allow it! At this hour, two young people
- are just fooling around in a dark movie theater! - We're not like that!
Don't talk like that!
Shin'ichi forgets his birthday every year.
I remind him once a year.
So he notices that he's getting older.
On the contrary, I'm getting younger.
But you know...
- you're still a student. - That's right!
Let's go to the garden party of a Mr. Teiji Moriya.
What's this all of a sudden?
It's Shin'ichi's invitation, but he can't go.
- Conan-kun, you're coming too, right? - Oh yeah!
I'm not going to a party with Shin'ichi's invitation!
Teiji Moriya is a famous architect, isn't he?
This will be a meeting between master detective and master architect.
So master detective and master architect.
He's so easily influenced.
MORIYA ESTATE APRIL 29 (TUESDAY).
Don't, Conan-kun. We're coming in by invitation only.
- Here you go. - Thank you, sir.
Wow!
Indeed, 17th century English style.
A building from the time of Stewart.
You know about architecture?
Well, I used to be called the walking library.
Take a good look to your left and right.
If you stand right in the middle, both sides are completely the same!
The garden and also the building!
Yes, that's called the symmetry of left and right.

Professor Moriya lived in England until high school.
That's probably why he admires English architecture so much.
Especially... uh... especially...
When it comes to classical architecture, he is without a doubt....
A cheat sheet!
He even has the spelling
TEIJI MORIYA
of his name to maintain symmetry.
He's sick, isn't he?
I have never seen such a beautiful garden!
Thank you for the compliment.
TEIJI MORIYA (47) ARCHITECT
I am Teiji Moriya. Nice to meet you.
I... am Ran Môri.
This is my father and Conan Edogawa. Shin'... uh,
Kudô-kun couldn't come today, so we're...
Oh, Kudô-kun couldn't come.
But this uncle is also a famous detective.
What do you mean by "also"?
I'm Kogoro Môri.
Oh, you're that famous detective. Nice to meet you.
This way, please. The party is in the back garden.
This garden is wonderful too!
As you would expect from a celebrity's party.
A model and a musician, big company executives as well as critics.
Lots of artists. All just people you know from TV.
Please enjoy the afternoon and relax.
Oh, it looks good! Is it all homemade?
Of course it is.
Offering homemade at a tea party is true to form.
- Please help yourself. - Thank you very much.
And does it appeal to you in terms of taste?
They are delicious, these cookies!
Oh, I'm glad.
Then it was worth baking them yesterday.
Oh, Professor, you cook yourself?
You wouldn't think it, but I'm a bachelor.
Everything on the table, the scones,
sandwiches and cookies, everything is homemade.
I'm the guy who always has to do everything myself.
That's the way it is. So it's that will that creates
all the beautiful architecture.
Without beauty, you can't talk about architecture.
Today's young architects lack a sense of aesthetics.
They should take more responsibility for their work.
By the way, Môri-san, do you mind if I have a quiz?
A quiz?
Yes. Three men run a company whose computer password has to be
must be determined.
For the master detective Kogoro Môri.
it must be child's play.
This is the famous Kogoro Môri-san?!
- Very well. - How exciting.
- Please. - Yeah, right.
Hey, can you get this?
Now then, these are the dates of the three.
The password is a common one and consists of five syllable characters.
Would you like to try it too, Ran-san?
The time limit is three minutes.
OYAMADA, GEB. OCTOBER 1956 SORATOBI, B. JUNE 1957
Now, everyone, please think with me.
- What is this? - Can you see through it?
All right, here we go!
There is no sign that the names have in common.
The birthdays and blood types are different.
The hobbies are completely different. This is harder than I thought.
What might it be? Any similarities?
I have to give up.
- I'm waiting for the pros to answer. - So am I.
I wonder if dad can handle it.
Hang on. All three are a year apart.
I know it!
It's Mo-mo-ta-ro-u!
Momotarô?
The zodiac signs of the three!
1956 - YEAR OF THE MONKEY, 1957 - ROOSTER, 1958 - DOG
The year of the monkey, the rooster and the dog.
Do you understand? Monkey, rooster, dog! These are the servants of Momotarô.
MONKEY, ROOSTER, DOG
That's right, boy. Really amazing.
Making a fool of yourself will do you good.
As a reward for the correct answer.
I will give you a tour of my gallery.
- Please join me, Ran-san. - Yes.
Please look around at your leisure.
Oops? Ran-neechan! Isn't that the...
Yes, that's right. That's the Kurokawa house.
Wasn't Kurokawa-san killed?
Yes.
I designed this house shortly after I became independent.
The following pictures show works from my thirties.
I was inexperienced at that time. Please don't look so closely.
He even designed a bridge.
By the way, Ran-san, are you close friends with Kudô-kun?
Eh? Well, we've known each other
We've known each other since we were kids, and we go to the same school.
But we haven't seen each other lately.
But next Sunday is Shin'ichi's..,
I mean, it's his birthday, and we have a date to go to the movies.
Oh, you must be looking forward to that.
I'm sure you already have a present for him.

No, I'll do that on Saturday.
He likes the color red just like me.
Besides, red is the happy color for both of us in May.
That's why I want to give him a red polo shirt.
That's a nice gift.
I'm sure Kudô-kun will be pleased.
Yes.
Oh my, it's my birthday! What am I going to do?
Oops!
Isn't that the Beika City Building?
Yes, it is.
We're going to see the movie here at Beika Cinema 1.
On 5/3 at 10pm, we'll meet in the lobby.
That's how it is.
This building is one of my best works.
There is no better place than this,
to celebrate a birthday as a young couple.
What am I doing?
MAY 3 (SATURDAY)
For dinner you can have some food.
There are still ten hours until 10:00 pm.
A real problem.
I'm leaving!
Why am I hiding?
You should have canceled earlier.
What was I supposed to do?
Ran is full of joy in front of the calendar every day.
I couldn't cancel then.
Can't you create a Shin'ichi robot?
That's impossible. Even if I am a genius.
I thought so.
The day before yesterday, from the Tôyô powder chamber...
SATOSHI YOKOYAMA SPECIAL REPORT
Explosive powder including octogen was stolen.
100 police officers were mobilized
to investigate the case. So far, however, there are no clues
- on the perpetrator. - A bad incident!
Yes. After all, octogen is a plastic explosive.
is a plastic explosive.
...a fire broke out in the Kurokawa house and spread to several...
The house is the mansion of the Kurokawas!
Ah, where the murder took place?
There have been a lot of arsons lately.
Since the recent fires are similar, only one culprit is suspected.
Yes, hello?
- Is Shin'ichi Kudô there? - Yes, one moment please.
- Shin'ichi, it's for you. - How do you know I'm here?
What are you talking about?
Don't you remember that all calls
to your home are forwarded here?
That's right. I forgot. I haven't been getting any calls lately.
no calls lately, so I completely forgot.
The caller seems to be using a voice distorter.
- He sounds all funny. - Huh?
Hello?
- Are you Shin'ichi Kudô? - Yes, I am.
Have you seen the news? I stole the explosives.
You'll give me your cell phone number.
I don't need to give it to someone like you.
Oh, so you don't mind cutting me off?
Got it. The number is...
Good, you're going to take your cell phone...
to the Teimuzu River Park. I'll show you something interesting.
- The Green Park? - Hurry up or the kids will die!
What?
- Shin'ichi? - I'm definitely going.
- Could it be a prank call? - With voice distorter? Too complicated.
You inform Inspector Megure.
- Okay. Take care! - Sure!
TEIMUZU RIVER GREEN PARK
- Hey, Mitsuhiko, pass it! - I want a turn too!
Please wait a little longer. It's quite difficult..,
to handle a remote control.
Hey, Mitsuhiko! Where did you get the remote control?
- Conan-kun! - A bearded man gave it to us.
"This is a plane bomber," he said.
A plane bomber?!
What's that attached to the fuselage?
Is it the bomb?!
- Mitsuhiko, give it to me! - Hey! I'm next.
There's a bomb attached to it!
You idiots!
Ah, the antenna's broken off.
Conan-kun! The plane!
It's not working. Run, all of you!
Idiots! Don't go there!
Conan, do something!
Let's see.
Oh, no!
And go!
Oh, what was that?
- What exploded? - Fireworks?
A plane exploded.
A flash of orange. It was plastic explosives.
What are you doing?
- What about Kudô? - Damn it!
Oh, I see, he must think that a peck like you is enough for me.
A peck like me? I'm being watched!
Listen carefully. At exactly one o'clock, another bomb will go off.
At exactly one o'clock?
It's at the forecourt of Beika Station.
If Kudô doesn't come, you have to find it.
Wait! That's too little information. I'm just a kid.
Can you give me a hint? Hello?
She's under the tree. But not buried under a tree.
You have to hurry, or someone will take her.
Damn it!
- Conan-kun! - Hey, Conan! Where are you going?
Ten to one.
Shit, there's nothing here.
Welcome!
What does he mean, "under the tree"?
And who would take it?

Please take me in.
Oh, have you been abandoned? You poor thing.
Don't worry. I'll take you in.
Under the tree? Tree? Wood?
The cat!
Thank you.
Grandma, wait!
Idiot! Didn't you see the traffic light?
I'm sorry.
Oh no!
Five to one! Damn it!
Four minutes to one.
All right, she's caught in traffic.
Ah! What's going on? It's still broad daylight.
I guess it broke down when it hit the curb.
Kid, I'm borrowing your bike!
Hey?
Hey, kid? What am I, younger?
Damn it! They're off again.
Three minutes to one. What was that?
Doesn't this road make a left turn?
Bi... You all right, kid?
Can I borrow this box for a minute?
25 seconds to go!
- You sure you're not hurt? - No, I'm not hurt.
Damn it. I can't let this thing explode.
Well?
Stand still? All right.
The open space behind the expressway!
Don't you need it?
Time is running again.
Aaah!
SONOKO SUZUKI TEITAN HIGH SCHOOL, SECOND YEAR
- Yes, I'll take that! - Oh, pretty daring.
The boy who was injured while trying to remove a bomb..,
...is currently being treated at the police hospital.
Conan-kun, you're awake again!?
Conan, are you okay?
- Where am I? - You're in the hospital.
Conan! What's going on here?
- Oh, no. - Explain it to me!
You can ask questions later. Get the doctor, please!
- Conan! - Yes!
Calm down.
- Hm. - Yes.
You can rest assured. Even when I examined you earlier.
...the EEG showed nothing abnormal.
We can safely discharge him tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
- All the best. - Well, good luck.
Let's get straight to the point, Conan-kun. Tell us about the incident.
I see. You were trying to save the others...
...from the bomb, and you jumped on the bike?
Yes. Ah! Inspector!
The connection to the criminal is through Shin'ichi's cell phone.
I thought cell phones were banned at the hospital?
Don't worry about it.
This part of the hospital is independent.
No electric machines are used here,
so the use of cell phones is possible.
Professor Agasa explained the situation to me, so that's why you're here.
That's fine, then. Besides, I
broke the bicycle. Uncle, can you compensate the boy?
You'd better tell me why you did such a crazy thing?
- You almost died! - I'm sorry.
And anyway, what's wrong with Shin'ichi?
That man called Shin'ichi, didn't he?
Well, Shin'ichi was busy with something else...
...so he asked Conan-kun to do it.
What? If I catch that guy, I'll kick his ass!
I can't very well say that I'm Shin'ichi Kudô.
Inspector, were you able to determine the type of bomb?
Yes, plastic explosives were used in the remote-controlled plane...
were made of plastic explosives.
Indeed.
A bluish-tinted orange beam...
is the peculiarity of plastic explosives.
Probably it is the stolen explosive of Tôyô company.
The first bomb had a detonator. It exploded on impact.
In the carrying box
there was a time clock. Thus, it was a time bomb.
But why did the time clock stop
at 16 minutes to one?
Speaking of which.
For one thing, the timer could have broken.
Or, for some reason, the perpetrator stopped the clock
the perpetrator stopped the clock with the remote control. Both are possible.
Since the perpetrator called Kudô-kun on purpose..,
maybe he wanted him to,
knowing of his celebrity, to challenge him.
Or it may be someone who has private feelings of revenge.
According to my research
all of the criminals that Shin'ichi Kudô
are currently in prison.
They could be the lovers or relatives.
In any case, the police are searching
from a picture of the children.
Conan, here. It looks just like him.
- It's good! - The three of us drew it.
Oh, the characteristics are well recognizable.
But I can't think of anyone to do it.
The criminal had his voice distorted.
It could be someone I know!
Inspector, among the cases involving Shin'ichi-kun,
which one attracted the most attention?
It was certainly the case involving
...involving Mayor Okamoto of Nishitama.
There was a 25-year-old office worker living in Nishitama,
who was hit by the mayor's car

and died.
It seemed to be a normal traffic accident,
in which the mayor was sitting in the passenger seat.
However, Kudô-kun had doubts about the accident.
SHIN'ICHI KUDÔ TEITAN HIGH SCHOOL, SECOND YEAR
MAYOR OKAMOTO (52) MAYOR OF NISHITAMA
KÔHEI OKAMOTO (21) SON OF THE MAYOR
This cigarette butt was found right next to the victim at the scene.
It has your son's saliva on it. You threw it away, didn't you?
Yes. After I hit the girl..,
I jumped out of the car.
I must have dropped it unconsciously.
I see. From the length of it, it would seem that you...
-...you've only just infected her. - That's right.
- It was just after you lit it. - With the lighter?
Yes.
What lighter did you use?
The car's cigarette lighter.
Please sit down in the driver's seat
and light a cigarette.
It's enough if you just pretend.
But you must buckle up properly.
Yes.
Here.
Please use these cigarettes.
It's the same brand as the ones from the crime scene.
Stop!
Right. To reach the lighter from the driver's seat..,
you have to reach out with your left hand.
But on this lighter, there are only the prints of your right hand.
Can you explain that, Kôhei-san?
Yes, I had my own lighter....
No.
You had left your lighter at the place where you visited.
Besides, your father is a non-smoker.
You undoubtedly used
the cigarette lighter from the passenger seat.
Sitting next to your father, who was driving.
The other fingerprints were expertly substituted.
Seat adjustment and the angle of the mirror were perfect.
Well, but
You missed the cigarette lighter.
Mayor Okamoto.
My son, Kôhei,
was thinking about my position as mayor
when he posed as a driver for me.
In truth, I was driving.
I am very sorry.
Father.
Because of this, Mayor Okamoto lost his post.
The construction project for the renewal of downtown Nishitama, which he had supported.
of downtown Nishitama has been reconsidered.
Will Mayor Okamoto's son hate him for that?
Hmm, that reminds me, he studied, I think,
I think he studied electronics.
I'll look into that.
Can you think of anything else about the criminal?
It doesn't matter what.
Well...
- The smell. - What?
It smelled sweet.
When Mitsuhiko-kun was handed the plane.
Yes? I didn't notice anything.
Neither did I.
A sweet smell? Do you mean like a perfume or something?
I don't know. But
it didn't smell like a perfume.
A sweet scent?
Good. If you think of anything else, please let me know.
Yes!
Well, we should be getting home, too.
Yeah, right. Now that Conan is well again.
If there's any trouble, I'll come rushing right over.
Yes, thank you.
- Ts, he's got it good. - I want to be in the hospital too.
You're quite popular.
Not bad, pretty boy.
What do you know.
Well, we're off.
- See you, Conan. - Thank you.
I wonder..,
Where's Kudô-kun at this important time?
Wait, Conan! If it's the criminal, I'll take over.
- Hello? - You've discovered the bomb well.
My compliments. But
the time for children is over. Give me Kudô!
That's true. Now is the time for adults.
Who are you? What about Kudô?
Kudô is not here. I'll take you on!
I'm the master detective Kogoro Môri.
Also good. I'm only going to say this once, so listen carefully.
I've planted five bombs at the Tôto ring line.
Five... Bombs?
These bombs will detonate at 16:00 hours..,
...as soon as the speed drops below 60 kilometers per hour.
They are set to explode
at sunset.
Here's a hint.
The bomb is attached
to xx of x of the Tôto ring line.
A character goes in the place of the x in each case.
Well, make an effort, master detective Môri.
I'm sure it's just an empty threat. Bombs on the ring line?
No, he's serious.
Presumably at 4:00 p.m. the bomb will be armed
and as soon as the train goes slower than 60km/h,
the explosion will be triggered.
I must inform headquarters.
Yes, this is Megure...

I also agree with Inspector Megure.
But what is the perpetrator's intention?
Why does he do such a thing?
- Just made it. - Today is our lucky day.
TÔTO-END STATION
What? Bombs on the ring line?
TOTO RAILROAD COMMAND CENTER
We just got the alert from the police.
We're stopping all trains for search immediately.
SAKAGUCHI (52) OPERATIONS MANAGER
- No, we're not allowed to stop them. - What?
KUSUNOKI (45) DEPARTMENT HEAD
These bombs are supposed to explode from 4:00 p.m. on,
as soon as the train speed drops below 60 km/h.
Excuse me?!
There are only three minutes left until four o'clock!
Instruct all ring trains to maintain a speed of 60,
no, 70 km/h!
- What about the trains at the station? - Immediate departure!
- And the ones that are coming in? - Passage!
Until the bombs are found, we must let
we have to let all trains pass through without stopping! Kusunoki-kun!
Understood!
This is an emergency! This is an emergency!
Calling all trains! Someone's put bombs on the trains!
They'll detonate under 60 kph! All trains accelerate to 70 km/h!
I repeat, someone has planted bombs!
They're detonating under 60 kph! All trains accelerate to 70 km/h!
Tell me, isn't this train funny?
What's so funny, Genta-kun?
We're about to enter the station, but the train is accelerating.
Your attention, please. Due to an emergency...
...this train will not be stopping at the next station, Beika.
Hey, what does emergency mean?
The expected train on Track 1, the Tôto Ring Line,
will pass through this station due to an emergency.
That's how it is. I get it.
At least there is no train that has exploded yet.
I got it, Inspector Megure!
What did you find out?
The x's the perpetrator talked about,
mean under the seat or on the shelf.
That's where the bombs are.
It can also mean under the car.
Eh? Well.
Come to think of it, don't your friends have to take the Ring Line from Midoridai Station..,
don't they have to take the ring line from Midoridai Station?
I repeat. This train will not stop at any station for a while.
If you notice a suspicious object,
do not touch it and tell the conductor.
- What is a suspicious object? - Something that doesn't belong to anyone.
I know that! But what exactly are they looking for?
Well, for example...
- Ayumi-chan, can you hear me? - Conan-kun! I can hear you.
Where are you now?
In the ring line.
So you are?
Conan, what's going on?
They wouldn't have hidden the word with Bo here, would they?
Don't worry. It's nothing.
So it's not just the inside of the train
it's not just the inside of the train that could be the bomb site!
- A bomb?! - So it is!
Does that mean we're going to die?
Of course not! I'll find the bombs for sure.
Conan-kun.
Shit! We can't leave this to Conan alone!
We have to get involved, too. We're the Detective Boys!
- The Detective... - Boys?
That's right. The bomb seems to be hidden inside the car.
Okay! Detective Boys, let's go!
- Yeah! - Hey, you guys!
Shit, they pushed me away. I hope nothing happens.
Yeah, I got it.
They've set up a control center at headquarters.
I'm going to the ToT control room. Are you coming?
Yes! I'll go with you.
It has just turned 4:30.
Please see for yourself, all trains of the ToTo Ring Line
have been running non-stop for over half an hour.
The only comment released by the police and the railroad...
only published the comment that there was an emergency.
For more than 30 minutes, the police will not be able to keep quiet about it.
I got it from a nurse. So you can stay in the room.
If the speed drops below 60 km/h, they explode.
This mechanism is understandable.
But that they also explode after sunset,
what does that mean?
Why do they explode in the absence of light?
I wonder if it has something to do with the train light?
Thank you for your patience.
Enjoy your stay.
The dress looks really good on you.
- The red color too. - Thank you.
In May, red is the happiness color for Shin'ichi and me.
Like this. I haven't seen Shin'ichi-kun for a long time.
Do you think I'll go with you guys?
Eh? Come on, the movie's not that worth watching.
And besides, he's a boring guy.

I'm kidding. I'm not going to interrupt your date.
Because you always take everything seriously right away, I like to tease you.
Really, Sonoko.
I'm surprised your father lets you go to movie night.
He was against it. But I ignored him.
Right now, he's probably talking to Conan-kun...
...about what they're making for dinner.
What's wrong? What about the front car?
So they didn't find anything suspicious in the cars?
No. All 21 trains currently on the road..,
have been thoroughly checked by the conductors.
The luggage has all been accounted for. What about you?
On the video cameras installed along the railroad line, nothing
have not detected anything bomb-like under the carriages.
- That's how it is. - Then where are the bombs?
It is terrible! Passengers are breaking out in panic!
How long are you going to drive around? Stop the car!
My son has a bad stomach ache. Let us off!
Suspicious object? It's not a bomb, is it?
- Bomb? Joke! I'm getting out! - Don't do that, please!
It's dangerous. Calm down.
- It's starting to escalate! - Just hang in there a little longer.
Môri-kun, can't you think of any way to find the bombs?
There's still about an hour and a half until sunset.
But to have them explode just as the sun goes down...
It's almost like my skateboard, but upside down.
It's powered by solar energy
and yet it doesn't run when it gets dark.
Only during the day? Sun?
I got it! I got it, Professor!
- Megure here. - Inspector, it's Kudô.
Oh, Kudô-kun! I've been waiting for you!
Professor Agasa told me everything.
The place where the bombs are..,
...is not under the seats..,
nor on the shelf, nor under the train cars.
- They're between the rails. - Between the rails?
The bombs are designed so that if they are not exposed to light for a while.
for a period of time, they will explode.
When the ring line passes over the bomb,
no light falls on the bomb for some time.
Let's assume a car length of 20 m. With ten trolleys, that is 200 m.
At a speed of 60 km/h, or 16.7 meters per second,
the train needs about 12 seconds to cover 200 meters.
This time, at which it just doesn't explode,
is when the train is traveling over it at 60 km/h.
Therefore, please divert all trains to other tracks immediately.
Once they leave the ring, they can stop safely.
Roger.
Mr. Sakaguchi, it's like the boy said.
In three minutes, train number 11
will be directed to the Shibahama freight yard. Get to work!
Train No. 11, Train No. 11. Change of course in three minutes!
Shibahama has confirmed course change.
Clear the tracks immediately!
Train #11 has passed Kawashina.
SHIBAHAMA STATION
Train #10 has passed Shibahama. Switching points!
Reducing speed now.
68, 66,
64, 63,
62, 61,
60 km/h!
59, 58!
- Everything all right? - Yes, no problems.
Good. Continue to slow down and stop at the next freight station.
Roger!
- We made it. - No,
we can't breathe a sigh of relief yet. There are still 20 trains on the loop.
You look at the ground. In your back
The aching rain stings.
In my memory I saw you praying.
If in this world an umbrella
Train number 9, no problems. Train number 20, no problems.
exists only once,
Another train!
I'll look for it and give it to you.
Even if I can't do anything else,
I can get wet in your place.
This is train number 10. We're at 55 km/h. No problems.
I don't mind.
Hooray! We made it! It's a success!
Please, your sorrow,
It was a great achievement!
entrust it to me.
Good job!
Now it's our turn to do our job.
Phew, finally we can get off.
I'll never run into a train again.
Yes? That's good, then.
Conan-kun, did you find out where the bombs are hidden?
No, that was Shin'ichi-nîchan.
However, the bombs haven't been found yet.
The bombs have been armed since 4:00 p.m...
and are located in places free of shadows.
When searching, pay attention to the position of the sun...
and your own shadows. Extreme caution is advised!
I have found a bomb!
Bomb detected!
Roger that.

All five bombs were secured.
- Hooray! - Yeah!
It was all as Kudô-kun had suspected.
There are 15 minutes left until sunset. That was pretty close.
But it's still too early to rejoice.
In the bombs used so far, only about a quarter of the
of the amount of explosives stolen.
That means the remaining three-quarters is still in the criminal's possession.
- Sorry for the delay. - And what was it?
Yes, it's about the said son of Mr. Okamoto, Kôhei.
We found out that he left for Izu this morning.
- That means he's innocent. - Yes.
- Um, what about the bomb case? - Solved.
With Kudô-kun's help.
We're missing the remaining bombs and the identity of the perpetrator.
The only thing we know so far is that the perpetrator wasn't
...on the Ring Line near where the five bombs were discovered.
Doesn't he? If the bombs had exploded, the train would
and everything around it would blow up. It wouldn't be his own house, after all....
When he stopped the timer in the carrying box,
he might have had the same reason.
There was a playground and an apartment nearby.
That's it! The criminal lives in that apartment!
Okay! We'll go straight there!
- Failure? - Yes. Not only the apartment,
- but also the other apartments there. - All of them are clean.
I see.
Inspector, where exactly were the bombs
on the ring line exactly?
Huh? Where exactly? Well, in ordinary residential areas.
Ah, one was on a bridge. The one over the Sumida Canal.
On a bridge?
Wasn't that bridge?
BOMB ALERT ON THE TOTO RING LINE!
Wait a minute, I know this picture from Professor Moriya's gallery.
Didn't Professor Moriya design this bridge?
Ah? Was it like this?
That's exactly how it is.
It is the design of Teiji Moriya.
This bridge was completed in 1983.
Since it is not an iron bridge, but an English stone bridge,
it attracted a lot of attention. With the design, Teiji Moriya has won
won the newcomer award from the architecture association.
You know pretty well about it.
I'm just interested in architecture.
THE ARSON SERIES!
Here are the reports on the arsons.
- Enough is enough. It's annoying. - Yes!
That reminds me, the burned house of the Kurokawas
was also designed by Professor Moriya.
Who do you think designed the houses
that were affected by the arsons?
Maybe you'll find out something interesting.
Something interesting, then.
- That's enough up to here. - Thank you for accompanying me.
Tell me everything in detail later! And at least let me kiss you!
Nine o'clock.
One hour to go.
THE LEGEND OF THE RED THREAD
I beg your pardon? They are all designs of Mr. Moriya?
Starting with the house of the Kurokawas, the Mizushimas, Yasudas and Akutsus.
all of Professor Moriya's incendiary properties
in the first half of his thirties.
This can hardly be called a coincidence.
Perhaps in the case of the bombs on the Ring Line
only the bridge was targeted.
This bridge?
Possibly. The arsonist could be identical to the bomber...
and target Moriya's property.
I see. I've got it, Inspector!
The culprit is someone who hates Professor Moriya...
or who envies his success.
The challenge to Shin'ichi was just a cover.
I see. Yes, that's very likely.
I am of the same opinion. In the series of arsons.
handmade detonators were used.
They're the same ones we found in the bombs.
All the targeted objects were designed in his thirties.
Good. Let's go to Professor Moriya and question him.
- Môri-kun, please guide us. - Where was that again?
Uncle, I remember! I'll take you there!
- What are you talking about? You're still... - I'm all right now. Come quickly!
Hey, what are you doing?!
I'm counting on you, Shin'ichi!
Môri-san, we're coming to the place..,
- where the timer stopped for a moment. - Oh!
A playground.
Really. We wasted precious time because of that broken bomb.
I see. It really doesn't look like a coincidence.
Do you have any idea who it might be?
Hmm, let's see.
This is a photo of me when I was ten, Conan-kun.
Standing next to me are my parents.

Your father is a very impressive man.
He was a very respected architect worldwide
and worked mainly in England.
Oh, how I loved his buildings.
When did he pass away?
That was 15 years ago, when the country house caught fire.
My mother was with him.
I took over this property as an estate at that time.
It has been since that day, hasn't it, Moriya-san?
That your designs suddenly came into the spotlight.
What? Well...
Oops. That smell!
You don't mean...?
Moriya-san, please think. Is there someone there?
That's right, we were there.
The works from his thirties start here.
Kurokawa Villa, Mizushima Villa, Yasuda Villa and Akutsu Villa.
And the bridge.
Wait a minute. This bridge...
Without a doubt!
I was inexperienced at that time. Please don't look so closely.
No way! Is it possible?
But... the smell?
Hmm, was that there last time?
MY VISION OF A NEW CITY: NISHITAMA
My vision of a new city: Nishitama.
That's right!
Because of that, the mayor lost his post.
Also the construction project he supported,
to renew the downtown of Nishitama,
has been reconsidered.
That's it! The design for the city
came from Professor Moriya!
This city offers the perfect symmetry.
These are the same as the ones at the playground!
Oh, so that's why the other day...
He really is the culprit! But I have no proof.
Well, in that case, I guess I'll just have to resort to subterfuge.
Oh. That's good!
Now scissors, tape and a pen.
Hm. A lighter?
That's it. You can't think of anyone.
I'm sorry I couldn't help.
Well then, if you think of anything, please let us know.
Huh? Where's Conan-kun?
Excuse me, please.
Megure speaking. Oh, Kudô-kun!
Yeah, I got it. We should just go to the gallery, right?
Moriya-san, would you please show us your gallery?
I'll do that.
Could I go to the study quickly beforehand?
Of course.
Good, we can. This way, please.
The gallery is on the second floor.
Here you are.
Oh.
Megure here.
Yes, we're in the gallery now.
Inspector Megure, please switch to speakerphone.
Okay.
And that is that I now know
I know who the arsonist and bomber are.
Really? Tell me, who is this criminal?
Wait a minute! I know it too.
The culprit is you, Mr. Shiratori!
What do you mean?
You admired Professor Moriya's father...
and began to have doubts about his death. You began to suspect his son,
who was in the limelight afterwards,
that he might have set the fire and killed his parents.
Convinced of this,
they set fire to Professor Moriya's properties.
The veneration for the father
turned into hatred for his son.
Besides, you were
you were never around when the bomber called.
So, wait.
Hey, Shin'ichi, that's what you were going to say, right?
- No.
The series of these incidents
is not based on revenge against Professor Moriya.
The criminal designed the four mansions set on fire
and the bridge itself. Professor Moriya,
it's you!
What?
Idiot?
What architect would destroy his own works?
At an early age, Professor Moriya
inherited his father's talent
and entered the world of architecture in his early 30s, very early.
Hello?
And then, with the design for the bridge, he won
he won the Newcomer Award of the Architectural Association of Japan.
After that, other buildings followed,
but soon the desire arose
or perhaps he always felt that way,
to erase the works from his younger years.
This can also be inferred from his words,
he had uttered at the tea party.
Most young architects today lack this sense of aesthetics.
They should take more responsibility for their work.
So he put his words into action.
Yes, he mentioned something like this....
Stop! You weren't there! How did you...?
- Well... - Hey!
Please take a look at the photos.
Kurokawa Villa, Mizushima Villa,
Yasuda Villa, Akutsu Villa and the bridge.
Each structure is built in the classic English style,
but don't you notice anything about them?

Well, for me they are all great buildings.
- Ah! They are not 100% symmetrical. - That's right.
There are minute differences.
Probably the client wanted it differently
or he had to give in because of the building regulations.
For the perfectionist Professor Moriya
this state of affairs was unbearable.
At about this time, a shadow fell for the first time
on his hitherto successful life as an architect.
The realization of his Nishitama design
on which he had worked for a long time
was stopped due to the arrest of the mayor.
Oh, so that was also a design of yours.
He challenged me in order to sully my reputation
and thus to take revenge on me in his turn,
but also to take revenge for the arson of the four villas
and the bombing of the bridge.
Furthermore, he stopped the time clock in the carrying box,
because there were gas lanterns in the playground.
The gas lanterns were to become the symbol of the city of Nishitama.
The professor could not destroy them. His beloved
English lantern served him as a model for the design.
Am I not right?
Interesting conclusion, Kudô-kun.
But unfortunately, you can't prove it.
I have proof. Behind the display case.
That's the bomber's disguise.
That's impossible. It's in my safe!
I see. The bomber disguise
is actually hidden in the safe.
What?
These are my glasses.
I had only painted them black.
The beard and the wig I made from the helmet
from the helmet in the study. All ideas of Shin'ichi-nîchan!
Professor Moriya, please accompany us...
Don't move!
Or I'll explode the bombs in the house.
They won't explode.
After all, this detonator
- has no batteries. - That's impossible!
When did you...?
How did you know this was a detonator?
After all, you didn't use it
and lit the pipe with a match.
The sweet smell Ayumi-chan was talking about,
was the smell of a pipe.
Arrest!
Yes! This case is now
finally solved. How wonderful!
What's wonderful, Môri-san?
That was mean, making me out to be a criminal.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Even a monkey can fall out of a tree.
What do you mean? The old man
is only on the ground.
If you think you've got it all figured out, you're wrong.
There's another building that needs to be wiped out.
But it's not the Beika City Building!
Is it not 100% symmetrical?
Because the bubble economy collapsed,
there wasn't enough money for my building.
It is my greatest and yet worst work.
You can't understand my sense of beauty.
Well, one minute to ten.
Ran!
BEIKA CITY BUILDING BEIKA CINEMA 1
- Yes, Môri here. - Ran-nêchan, you have to get out of there right now!
- Ran-nêchan, are you okay? Ran-nêchan! - Give me that!
Hey Ran! Answer me! What's going on? Ran!
Damn it!
You bastard! What are you going to do with Ran?
So far, the entrances to the lobby and the emergency exits are blocked.
- The fun is just beginning. - What?
Hey Kudô! You must be listening in somewhere.
If you don't hurry, your beloved friend will be smashed.
- Son of a bitch! I'll finish you off! - No violence!
Hey, what are you doing? You...
That's...
What? The bomb's wiring diagram?
- What? I'm taking this to Shin'ichi-nichan.
No, wait!
I'll have the bomb squad move out.
I can't wait for the bomb squad!
Stop!
When you meet Kudô, tell him this:
I've set up three minutes for you.
Enjoy them carefully.
Wait, Conan-kun! Shiratori-kun,
- take care of Professor Moriya. - Yes!
Ran! Where are you? Ran!
- Ran. Ran. Damn it! - Môri-kun!
Inspector! Where's the rescue team?
Calm down, Môri-kun, stay calm!
Ran! Be patient! I'll be right there!
Don't be afraid. Help will be here soon.
Hello?
- Ran, is that you? - Shin'ichi?
- Lucky! The phone's still working! - What are you up to?
You're always not around when I need you.
Really, always... always.
Do you know what kind of situation I'm in?
Yes, I do.
I'm right in front of the emergency exit, which is blocked by debris.

Somehow I was able to fight my way through the rubble to get here,
but due to the concussion
the door seems to have warped. I can't get it open.
By the way, do you see a briefcase or a suitcase in the lobby?
- or anything strange? - Something strange?
What is it? It's very heavy and big.
Some kind of digital clock is attached to it.
Be careful! It's a bomb!
A bomb?
Damn professor! So his biggest bomb is here.
- Ran, what does the clock say? - Wait a minute.
42 minutes, seven seconds.
Forty-two minutes to go.
That means the explosion will occur at 12:03. Three minutes?
I've set up three minutes for you. Enjoy them!
What do these three minutes mean?
- What is it? - Nothing! Every staircase is buried.
It'll take a while to get to the fourth floor lobby.
Ran.
Eighteen minutes to go. We're running out of time.
Let's try it.
Hey Ran. Did you bring scissors?
I have some in my sewing bag. What would I do with them?
You have to disarm it, the bomb.
Listen carefully Do exactly what I...
Wait, wait, wait. I can't do it on the phone.
- I'm coming to you. - I'm coming to you.
Good. It doesn't seem to go off by shock.
- Be careful, though. - Got it.
- Can you hear me, Shin'ichi? - Yes, I can hear you fine.
- I'm going to tear the bag now. - Be careful.
What's wrong, Ran? Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Okay. I'm ready to go.
Good. First, you take off the outer shell.
When you lift her up, she'll dissolve. Gently, huh?
- It's off, Shin'ichi. - Well done.
We're cutting the inner cables now.
If the order is wrong, we'll die.
First, the yellow cable in the lower part.
- I'm cutting now. - Yes.
Inspector! Ran isn't...?
Calm down, Môri-kun. Ran-kun is somewhere else.
Don't worry. Your daughter won't be blown up for another 15 minutes.
You!
Tell me! How can we stop this bomb?
This is a very special bomb.
Even if it's defused, the last wire is its fate.
The last wire...
From the Beika City Building, the bombing...
It's through.
Good. We seem to be making it.
Now the black wire and the clock is set.
The black wire, huh?
Shin'ichi?! The black wire is cut,
but the clock keeps running. There are also
two wires left. One red and one blue.
What?
We finally cleared access to the third floor.
You must hurry.
We only have four minutes until the explosion!
- Ran, I'm coming for you! - Môri-san!
Where are you going? Môri-san!
Let go! Me, I have to save Ran!
Wait! The rescue party
- will be there soon! - Ran!
The pathetic love of a father for his daughter.
Architecture doesn't need love. Nor does life.
Did the professor, in order to trick me..,
he didn't draw the two cables?
What do we do? Shall I cut them both?
Fool! One cable is a trap!
- One cut and it explodes. - What?
Damn it! Which one is it?
Red? Blue? Which one do we have to cut.
12:00. Three minutes to go.
Damn! Which one is it? Which one?
Shin'ichi?
Happy birthday, Shin'ichi!
After all, I may
I may never be able to say that again.
Ran.
Arm in Arm
Runs a happy couple
Just cut.
in front of me.
- Take the color you like. - But
Their voices were loud and cheerful.
if I'm wrong?
It doesn't matter. When the time is up, we'll be dead anyway.
Just a little
Then you'd better use your favorite color.
I became jealous.
But...
And thought of you,
you who are not here.
Don't worry! I'll be here with you
I'll be here with you.
Well, my heart tends to do that,
If we die, we die together.
if I'm careless,
go to
Shin'ichi.
to become weak.
Then I clench
my molars tightly together
and try
to smile forcedly.
I want to see you.
Shin'ichi, do you like red or blue better?
Right now
- I think red. - Look at this!
I want to see you.
My and Shin'ichi's lucky color in May is red!
BULL 20.4. - 20.5. KEY NO.5 - RED - DEPARTMENT STORE
Therefore, I decided that it can only go like this.
Ran! Run! Are you okay?
Shit, she can't hear me. Oh yeah, my cell phone!

It's gone! Oh no, I must have lost it earlier.
Oh! Here's a boy!
You're safe now, kid. Let's go.
Wait a minute!
There's still people trapped in there!
Good. Wait here.
- No chance. The stone drill! - Yes!
And it's my wedding anniversary.
I don't think I'll be able to enjoy it quietly.
I've set up three minutes for you. Enjoy them!
I see.
I'm supposed to enjoy my birthday for three minutes.
Wait a minute, didn't he then....
Oh, you must be looking forward to it.
I'm sure you've already got a present for him.
No, I'll do it on Saturday.
He likes the color red, just like me.
Besides, red is the happy color for both of us in May.
Lucky?
Oh, no!
Boy, we've got to get out of here!
Run! Red is the trap! Cut the blue!
Don't take the red one! Run! What is it? Answer me!
Ran! Run! Ran!
Farewell, Shin'ichi.
Ran!
It can't be.
We're really glad that Ran-kun's okay,
- aren't you, Môri-kun? Yes. Thank you.
As a detective, how were you involved in this case?
Well, this bombing case began
...that my reputation as a master detective...
and set a trap for my daughter Ran.
Oh!
Conan-kun.
- You were worried about me? - Well, yes.
What happened to this bandage?
- I fell down. - You have to be more careful.
Say, Conan-kun, have you seen Shin'ichi?
Eh? Oops. He was here until just now.
I bought a present especially for him.
That reminds me, Shin'ichi-nîchan was very surprised.
He thought you'd choose the red wire for sure.
Why did you cut the blue one?
Well, I didn't want to cut it.
The red thread that
that might connect me to Shin'ichi.
That I can't talk so well,
I really regret it.
I tried to brood over it.
But soon fell asleep exhausted.
The air on weekends in this city
is suffocating with sultriness.
When I let out a deep sigh,
it was swallowed by a street loudspeaker.
Even if I string together
I string words together,
I can't communicate with you,
is not possible from the beginning.
To the sky above this
bustling city
I raise my voice with all my might.
Somewhere in a distant city you are.
It's the Happy Birthday for you.
To the sky above this
bustling city
I raise my voice with all my might
I raise my voice.
To the sky above this
bustling city
I raise my voice with all my might
I raise my voice.
Somewhere in a distant city you are.
It is the Happy Birthday for you.
It is not there! The red thread!
As Conan, I don't think I have a chance.
