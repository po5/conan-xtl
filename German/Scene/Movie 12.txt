DETECTIVE CONAN - THE SCORE OF HORROR
ADULT AMAZED!
I am high school student detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on what was happening
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He administered a poison to me
and when I came to...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked my name,
I said Conan Edogawa.
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
Let's go, Mitsuhiko!
You can count on me!
And hop!
Got him!
Mitsuhiko!
Conan-kun! What?
He's coming, Ayumi-chan!
What? To... To me?
I'll take over!
Goal!
These are my current classmates
Genta, Ayumi and Mitsuhiko.
They've made me a member
of their child detective troupe.
Another member...
This is Ai Haibara.
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
Her late parents were
as scientists to the men in black.
With the code name Sherry Miyano also worked for them
and developed for them
that drug, Apoptoxin 48-69.
But the guys
killed Miyano's only sister Akemi, whereupon she rebelled.
she rebelled.
She wanted to kill herself,
She swallowed the drug and shrank.
That's how we met.
and now live the lives of elementary school students..,
while we continue to pursue these guys.
However... This little master detective here
keeps forgetting himself
and eats with his mind
and Professor Aga's inventions
one difficult, tricky case after another.
Which is why I'm always on pins and needles.
Well, in music class
I'm on pins and needles for another reason.
Go on, say your line.
Ah, yes.
I'm small, but my mind isn't!
No case remains unsolved!
There is always only one truth!
DETECTIVE MÔRI
Kazuki Dômoto?
- You must know him, Shin'ichi. - Yes.
The founder of the academy, where there was the explosion last week.
To be honest...
I'm there right now.
Dômoto-san was a well known pianist, but he suddenly
but then surprisingly switched to the organ.
And for his new concert hall
an organ from an old church in Germany to Japan.
Ah yes...
The organ that Bach himself is said to have played on!
We have the chance to attend the opening concert of this very same
concert hall! And we may
even watch the rehearsals! Sonoko arranged it!
The hall was built by the Suzuki construction company, right?
A piano key?
It flew that far?
Oh, come along too, Shin'ichi!
We'll hear the famous Stradivarius live!
You play the violin yourself.
You said you wanted to hear a Stradivarius!
Who's that?
Hey, are you listening to me?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm really busy with a case right now.
Can't you take some time off?
The rehearsal is the day after tomorrow...
I'm afraid I'll have to give it up.
The concert is next Tuesday.
Not a chance. I told you, I'm in the middle of a...
Maybe it'll be finished by then!
I'll ask Sonoko to make you a...
I said no need! Please don't be so pushy... I'm sorry...
So I'm pushy?
Ah, no, I...
Okay, okay, I get it.
I'm a pushy karate freak who meddles in everything.
Ah, I didn't...
It's okay. And even if you hear a Stradivarius..,
you'll never be able to be Holmes.
What are you saying?
Well, because you're totally
unmusical!
Ran, you...
Good luck to you!
You tone-deaf master detective!
Really! I'll never invite that miserable snoop anywhere again!
Really...

Hello?
Ah, Conan-kun?
What do you want for dinner tonight?
Uh...
What do you think about curry? Or maybe...
Ah... Curry's fine!
Great.
I'm glad you're so easygoing.
Well, take care of yourself and be back before dark, yeah?
Yes!
See you later!
As Conan, it's no problem to be straightforward....
KAZUKI DÔMOTO ORGANIST / COMPOSER
You really played wonderfully!
EXCELLENT, REALLY! WONDERFULLY PLAYED!
It was really very beautiful.
The organ has a very different appeal than the piano.
Ah... Kazuki Dômoto really plays absolutely fantastic.
- I saw that gentleman on TV! - Huh?
The one with the glasses, I mean.
Ah, that's Takumi Fuwa-san.
TAKUMI FUWA DIRECTOR OF DÔMOTO CONCERT HALL
He was Dômoto-san's personal piano tuner for 15 years.
Now he is the director of the Dômoto Concert Hall.
That's...
The German who is looking at us is Hans Müller-san.
He is an organ tuner.
HANS MUELLER ORGAN TUNER
By now he is laughing happily, but in the
at first he did not get along well with Dômoto-san.
The man standing next to him and translating is Dômoto-san's son
GEN'YA DÔMOTO PIANIST AND KAZUKI DÔMOTO'S SON
Gen'ya-san. He is a pianist.
And responsible for the concert.
And look, the two girls there...
Both students of Dômoto-san.
The one on the right is in her 9th semester at the academy,
LARA CHIGUSA SOPRANO
this is the soprano Lara Chigusa-san.
The nervous girl next to her
is studying in the 8th semester,
SHION YAMANE VIOLINIST
the violinist Shion Yamane-san.
Aha, the substitute for Sôko Kawabe-san,
who was injured in the explosion, right?
That's right.
At the time of the accident, Kawabe-san's Stradivarius was
was being repaired.
So now Shion-san can borrow it for the concert.
And... Sitting in the front row is...
Reiko Akiba-san, right?
The soprano.
Yes, you must know her.
She's a celebrity, after all.
REIKO AKIBA SOPRANO
All right, Shion! Get ready.
J... yes!
From the first piece. The "Ave Maria".
Yes.
From the sound of it
you're not ready to play with me.
I'm sorry. Just be patient, okay?
Excuse me.
Finally, we can hear a Stradivarius live,
Satô-san!
If you ask me, I'd prefer an Amati...
Shut up!
No, no, no!
That sounds terrible!
What did you do this week?
I'm sorry...
Huh? Was there something wrong?
No, it sounded perfect to me.
No. For a Stradivarius, it sounded like absolutely nothing.
- Let's start over. - Yes!
What? What happened?
She broke a string...
I'm so sorry! I'll change it right away!
What about the organ tuning?
Well... No problems so far.
Oh dear, oh dear...
I wonder if I'll get a chance to sing today...
Akiba-san, do you have a moment?
Can I go to the bathroom?
Môri-kun...
Have you found any clues about the bomber yet?
No, not yet.
So he must have used plastic explosives?
Yes. We found the timer, too.
It was set to the time of the musicians' rehearsal.
So you think it's...?
I'm sorry, Môri-kun,
but I shouldn't be talking to you about the investigation.
Especially not in front of the boy.
In front of the boy?
Go play with the other kids!
Yeah.
Wah, it's huge!
Not only huge, but also beautiful!
Impressive, huh?
Tell me, why does such an organ sound at all?
The tones are created
the same principle as your recorders in school.
Look! There are quite a few pipes.
Air can be blown into each of these pipes just like into a recorder,
and it will sound.
Air, you say?
But there are no holes on the pipes like on the recorders.
Right. On a recorder, you get different tones,
by covering the holes. On the organ, on the other hand...
you press a key and the corresponding pipe sounds.
The individual pipes can produce only one tone at a time.
And what are these switches?
These?
They're called stop slides.
Depending on which one you pull, you get a different timbre.
For example, if I pull this one....
That's a trumpet!

A flute!
The organist can change his playing by combining the different sounds.
combining the different sounds.
I see! That was very instructive!
On this occasion
comes the eagerly awaited quiz!
I wasn't expecting it.
A singer has injured his neck
and is supposed to undergo surgery.
But then he gets
a few pills from his grandfather-in-law and is cured.
And now say, which of the following do you think was the patient?
No. 1: the soprano.
No. 2: the alto.
No. 3: the tenor.
No. 4: the bass.
This time the question is really difficult.
Professor, a hint!
How do you say surgery in English?
"Operation." Usually "OP".
And it was:
"some pills from the in-law".
Conan-kun, did you figure it out?
Yes. It's very simple.
- First... - No. 1.
The answer is: No. 1, the soprano.
The singer of the "opera" doesn't get an ope:
You take away "ope" and you get "ra".
From the "grandpa-in-law" you take out a few letters,
because there are only a few pills, put him in front of the "ra" and hang
and add the last part of the pills.
- Sh... - Grandpa...
The last part of the pills...
S-op-ra-n!
How silly.
True. But calling it silly is rude.
Forgive me, Akiba-san...
But we'd like to...
Really...
- It won't take long, will it? - No...
We'd like to talk to you again...
about the text message Kawabe-san sent you just before the explosion.
Kawabe-san sent you just before the explosion.
"I can't work with dilettantes who can't distinguish...
I can't work with dilettantes who can't distinguish sounds."
What exactly does that text message mean?
What, exactly what she wrote.
I already said it.
Me and Kawabe-san...
You met at the press conference of the concert.
Yes. She told me...
she told me that she would text me
about the two musicians by text message.
In other words:
The tones of the two and the tones of Kawabe-san....
Couldn't she play with the two because they didn't recognize the tones that
she wanted to express?
I think so.
Why don't you ask her directly?
She woke up, didn't she?
She's conscious,
but she can't remember what happened before the explosion because of the shock.
She doesn't?
And another thing...
We found this at the site of the explosion.
A transverse flute centerpiece.
Correct.
The middle part of a transverse flute, which is divided
into three parts: head, middle and foot.
Maybe a student left it there?
But the fact that only the middle piece was found makes one wonder.
Can you think of anything in this regard?
Akiba-san?
No. Nothing.
That's enough.
Ah, wait, Akiba-san!
What's that?
What are you drinking?
- Tea. - Can I have some?
- No. - How mean.
Is there anything in there that's good for your voice?
None of your business.
Then maybe we would win the choir competition
if we drank from it!
Choir competition?
Yes!
There's a choir competition between the classes....
Oh yes! Would you mind conducting our choir?
Huh?
We're rehearsing the day after tomorrow
from two o'clock in the afternoon in the music room of our school!
Ran-onêsan will accompany us on the piano.
But our problem is the singing teacher...
Hey there, you midgets!
Who's the problem here, huh?
- Really, who's the problem here? I'm... I'm... - I'm sorry, sir. I beg your pardon.
This isn't about the ninth, is it?
I can't stand them.
We're not singing 9th grade!
It's the Teitan school song!
By "the ninth," she means, of course.
Ludwig van Beethoven's 9th Symphony.
What? Really?
All right. I'll conduct your choir.
Out of goodwill to my old school.
You went to Teitan?
So go home now.
You're interrupting.
Yes...
It's great that she agreed to conduct the choir, but...
That old aunt is really unpleasant.
Yes, a little.
A prime example of the bossy "queen" type.
Yeah. She reminds me a little of you.
Uh... I mean... She's incredibly pretty, isn't she?
You can't really tell if she's mean and spiteful or nice....
Hm... But maybe she sent us away
she sent us away out of consideration for that,
that Shion-san was so nervous?
- Really? Sounds a bit far-fetched. - Maybe it is.
Yes!
Yes!
Love-thirty!
I mean...

Don't be so merciless to an amateur, will you?
The lion also does his best when hunting rabbits.
Yeah, yeah, I get it! So I'm the rabbit here!
I got it! Next time we'll have mixed doubles!
With Makoto-san and Shin'ichi-kun...
Shin'ichi?
That miserable, crazy snoop...
Isn't that right...
Oh, so you had a fight with Shin'ichi-kun.
"Packs fight, packs get along..."
We're not a bunch!
But you guys do that a lot, don't you?
You always fight and then make up.
But once, you had a big fight for a long time.
You didn't speak for a week.
When do you mean?
Back in the second grade of high school.
Ah, I remember! Back then we...
Why were we fighting?
And how did you make up?
You forgot both?
Ah, it was like this...
Stop, stop, wait a minute!
You're fighting. Why are you walking next to each other?
Huh?
Our way home is the same...
It's okay, it's okay. Go on.
There was...
- A song! - Huh?
We heard a song coming from the riverbank.
And while we were listening, we suddenly...
Forgiven and reconciled.
What kind of song was it?
What kind of song was it?
Well, I think it was a rather familiar melody...
But, but...
It was a song that somehow
to the farthest corners of our hearts.
The hill shines in fresh green,
from far away there's an echo from the mountains...
TEITAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
On our singing, laughing faces
shines the bright sunshine.
MUSIC ROOM
Let us keep everything
firmly in our hearts
and reach for the future!
Teitan!
Teitan!
Teitan Elementary School!
Teitan!
Teitan!
Teitan Elementary School!
So, what did you think of the children's singing?
Well...
First to you.
You sing too loud. Tune your voice to the others.
You next to them with the freckles.
Your singing is right in tone, but now and then you're not fully there.
Because you admire the profile of the girl diagonally in front of you?
The girl diagonally in front of him...
That's Haibara!
And that girl...
You sound good, but sing a little more childish, okay?
- But I'm not a child. - There, there, there!
You hit the right note,
You sing with energy, very well.
And you: don't let the others pull you along.
- Sing with more... - Not bad.
Pretended not to listen,
but she heard every single one.
Yes. She has the ear of a musician.
The problem... is you!
J... Yes?
Not a single real note!
Are you doing it on purpose?
- N... no... - He's not doing it on purpose!
He's just completely unmusical!
You're no help to me!
It's horrible. The piano sounds strange, too.
It's a little too low overall.
- Is it out of tune? - Do you think so?
Oh dear... I hadn't noticed.
I was wondering the same thing.
That woman...
Akiba-san, do you have perfect pitch?
Yes, I do.
What's that? Absolute pitch?
It's when you hear a sound and can immediately determine its pitch
and its name.
For example...
e-5. Mi.
B-3 and f-5. Si and Fa.
Correct!
- Wow. - So that's why you can sing so well?
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
I don't know if a musician
if a musician really needs absolute pitch.
I've had it since birth,
but I've heard it can be trained.
With the former piano tuner Fuwa-san, that was the case.
So,
I have nothing more to say to you. Keep practicing on your own.
When you get better, I'll listen to you again.
You're leaving again?
We'd like to hear a sample.
Oh, yes!
How much will you pay me?
A pro only sings if he gets paid.
See you.
There he is, there he is!
Hey there! That's my tea!
Thank you and cheers!
What's wrong, Genta?
My throat... My throat...
Genta-kun! Genta-kun!
Are you okay, Genta-kun?
Someone at...
...put something in the bottle.
That's the logical conclusion.
But that's...
This can't be...
We have to take him to the hospital.
HOSPITAL HATANAKA
I wonder if he'll be okay.
It looked like he was hurting a lot.
And his eyes were all red.
When was the last time you drank from it?
Probably before noon.
Where was that?

At the Dômoto Academy.
I had practiced there in
in a rehearsal room.
Then I went to the restroom.
During this time I poured the bottle
with my other things in the rehearsal room.
If someone smuggled something into the bottle,
it was at that moment.
But who could...
Thank you very much.
Genta-kun!
Are you all right?
N... No, it's not.
What did the doctor say?
His throat is very sore, but...
but he'll be fine in four or five days.
- You will get well! - Good luck!
But in other words...
He won't be able to speak well for four days.
Yes. The concert at Dômoto Hall is three days away.
If you had drunk it, you wouldn't have been able to perform.
Let's inform the commissioner
and have the contents of the bottle checked.
I'll take the bottle to him.
But first we have to...
We'll take Genta-kun home.
- I'll go too. - I'll go too.
I want to ask that boy's parents..,
...how they're raising him,
that he just drinks other people's tea.
I'm sorry, but...
Genta-kun...
Come on, cheer up, Genta-kun!
Four days will pass quickly!
I want... In-laws...
I want to take pills.
It's just like the professor's quiz, isn't it?
Go to the side of the road.
No! Run!
Run! Run!
I can't see his face!
Turn right! Turn right!
What?
Are you okay?
Damn it!
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm all right.
What's the truck doing? Disregarding the one-way street...
Reiko-sensei!
Your leg's bleeding!
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Did he give up the chase because of the cab?
Or...
All right, I'll leave the kids to you then.
Huh?
I'll take the cab home.
Tell the police what happened.
You're... You're going home?
Because with you, one is not sure of one's life.
- But that's... - That's mean.
Commissioner!
The cause of the explosion?
Yes...
There was a gas leak in the room.
A match ignited it.
And......there are traces that the gas detector had been damaged beforehand.
So it wouldn't be an accident, but a murder...
The victim was the owner of the bar,
Osamu Shida-san, 36 years old.
He was a violinist and a freshman
in the first semester at the Dômoto Academy.
In the 1st semester?
Just like the victims of the last bombing?
That's probably not a coincidence.
No... It's not a coincidence.
Inspector Satô!
This was inside the bar.
What is it?
The foot of a flute.
No doubt about it.
A serial murder by the same killer.
And the killer leaves us a message.
A middle piece, then a foot piece.
So that leaves the headjoint.
So the criminal
is planning another murder.
The case of Hisao Sone-san, who parachuted down...
...who parachuted into the ocean and drowned yesterday...
I understand he was a viola player?
Turns out he was a freshman, too.
- So that means... - Yes.
He was a classmate of Mizuguchi-san and Renjô-san..,
who died last week, and Shida-san, who died the day before yesterday.
And the four of them
played together as a piano quartet until two years ago.
So it's a serial murder by the same perpetrator?
There is no doubt about it.
According to the prefectural police, there were traces of small particles in the glider fabric,
the so-called calotte, traces of small cuts from a blade.
What is even more clear:
Under a seat in Sone-san's car...
...the last part of the flute, the headpiece, was found, right?
J... Yes.
But now that all the parts of the flute are back together again,
I guess the series of murders is over, right?
I really hope so.
- And, Ran-kun... - Yes?
About the contents of the tea bottle you gave us...
Our experts have discovered..,
...that it was laced with a powerful stimulant.
That's going too far for a prank.
And the truck that was following us?
It had been stolen nearby.
To sum up: The perpetrator did not succeed,
Akiba-san by the means in the tea,
so he attacked her with a stolen truck and tried to accomplish his goal.
attempted to realize his goal in this way.
The goal,
to prevent Akiba-san from appearing at the opening concert of Dômoto
at the opening concert of the Dômoto Hall.
Say... If Reiko-san can't perform,
who will sing in her place?
It would probably be Lara Chigusa.
Initially, she, who is in her 9th semester and

also studied under Dômoto-san,
the favorite among the sopranos for the concert.
But Sôko Kawabe-san, whose participation had already been decided,
recommended Akiba-san for the soprano part, because although they had
they did not know each other, she had wanted to play with her for a long time.
Whereupon the decision was made for Akiba-san.
The next problem is the connection
to these four musicians who were killed.
We still have
found any connection between Akiba-san and them.
We only know
the connection between Kawabe-san and the first two musicians.
You mean their rehearsal together....
The bomb was under the floor near the point
where the two musicians were playing.
Meaning,
Kawabe-san was just pulled in by accident?
We can't say that for sure.
Because there is someone who has a motive to harm her....
Lara Chigusa-san, who was the favorite for the soprano part.
for the soprano part?
And there is someone else: Shion Yamane, who is now being used as a replacement for
Kawabe-san's replacement.
What? Her too?
Yes. When she plays Kawabe-san's Stradivarius at this concert,
which will be attended by many internationally renowned musicians,
at this concert, which will be attended by many internationally famous musicians,
her name will be known all over the world in one fell swoop.
But there is something else.
She is Dômoto-san's favorite student.
The reason he chose Kawabe-san for the concert,
was not so much because of her,
but rather the Stradivarius in her possession.
At the bottom of his heart, he probably would have preferred to choose Shion-san.
That is why he appointed her as the substitute violinist and,
so that she could borrow the Stradivarius,
he had Kawabe-san seriously injured.
This possibility is not unthinkable either.
Such complicated relationships... I can't really figure it out.
In a nutshell:
A motive to harm both Kawabe-san and Reiko-san..,
only Lara Chigusa-san has.
A motive to harm only Kawabe-san..,
Dômoto-san and Shion-san.
But we found no motive
none of the three had a motive to harm the four musicians.
That's the way it is, isn't it?
J... Yes. That's the way it is.
Oh, yes. The grand piano in the rehearsal hall where the explosion took place,
was that any special instrument?
No. I never heard that there was anything special about it.
What gave you that idea?
I was at the academy the other day
I saw Fuwa-san pick up a key...
as if it was very special to him.
So I thought the wing was special somehow.
How dare you! Don't always roam around on your own!
Sorry.
On this hill.
Dômoto-san played on this grand piano at his home for over 30 years.
When he gave up his career as a pianist..,
he bequeathed it to the academy for students to practice on.
At home with Dômoto-san and also afterwards
at the academy, the piano was
the piano was always tuned by Fuwa-san.
For him, it was something like his own child.
Are you okay, boy?
But it's true...
Fuwa-san is said to have criticized the four musicians quite a bit.
Their general attitude towards life was problematic...
But that's why
he didn't have to kill them, did he?
That's right, you're right.
Even assuming that their way of life
that he disliked their way of life so much that he wanted to kill them,
there's no connection to what happened to Akiba-san.
Superintendent,
Is it better to keep the murder of the musicians
from Akiba-san's case?
Considering that
considering that so many incidents happened at once at the academy...
No connection at all would be too unlikely.
That's true.
Anyway...
We were of the opinion that we should monitor Akiba-san at least
at least until after the concert the day after tomorrow.
So we sent Takagi-kun to her.
Well... she called me
She called me "annoying" and chased me away.
Really...
What are you doing, Takagi!
If something happens to Reiko-san, you won't get away...
you won't get away with an apology!
Yeah, but...
She said she'd stay home today and tomorrow.
Are you out of your mind?
- You're just going to settle for that? - I'm sorry!
DETECTIVE MÔRI
I'm going!
IROHA SUSHI
SUSHI IROHA
Conan-kun!
Hello, Conan-kun!
Good morning, everyone!
What are you guys doing here so early?
We're going to meet Kamen Yaiba!
Kamen Yaiba?
We have it on good authority
that there's a morning shoot today at Ryokuchi Park...
Teimuzu shore today!
And figured that would make Genta-kun cheerful again.

He doesn't look too unhappy to me.
That's why we wanted to take you with us.
Are you going out?
Yeah, I got plans.
What's "what"?
What's it to you?
Is it more important than your friendship with Genta-kun?
There's really no helping you.
I'm going to see Reiko-san.
Reiko-sensei? Don't do that!
You'll just get yourself in trouble again.
Yeah, I guess so. But I have to protect her from the bad man.
The bad man?
The one from the day before yesterday?
Why do you have to protect her?
Yeah, why do I need to protect her?
I don't really understand it myself.
But I feel I have to.
Somehow.
He says, "It must be love, I'm sure of it."
You like older girls...
I'm sure I don't!
Anyway, I'm entrusting Genta to you.
Take care of him.
Conan-kun!
Does that mean he has faith in us?
Maybe.
Yes?
Morning, Reiko-san! I'll come visit you!
Hey, wait a minute!
You have a nice place!
The neighborhood's nice and quiet, too...
Hey, kid!
How dare you! How dare you barge in here like this!
What do you want?
Singing lessons...
I want special training.
Huh? Oh, yeah, that's right. You're the little non-musical one.
But not today.
You're going out, aren't you?
Before important concerts or recordings you always take
you go for walks in the woods to refresh yourself.
Why did you come here then?
I wanted to go with you, that's why.
I mean it. I told you:
I don't want anything to do with you, because it's not safe with you!
This is how you guarantee our safety,
by staying away from us.
Because you're sure that the criminal is targeting you.
And you wanted to escort Genta-kun home..,
...to make sure he got home safely..,
Not to complain to his parents.
What a bunch of miserable bullshit.
Ah! Before we go, can I have some juice, please?
I'm thirsty.
What? You're unbelievable.
I only have 100% orange juice here.
Don't be picky.
Yeah, it's okay.
A flute! And that man...
Hey there!
You're ten years too young to be interested in women's bedrooms!
Say, Reiko-san... Do you play the flute, too?
None of your business!
Drink this and get out!
I'm not giving you a singing lesson, and I'm not taking you with me!
Yes!
I'm just following you, ignore me.
I mean...
I don't care if you get lost.
Don't worry.
Commissioner Megure!
We have a connection between Akiba-san and the musicians!
What?
Three years ago in January.
a flautist who was rehearsing with them at an academy summer home in Izu
...at the academy's summer home in Izu..,
under the influence of alcohol
from a cliff near the hostel and died.
Hikaru Sôma-san, then 28 years old.
Was in his 6th semester at the academy.
Did they take him...
No, no.
But they persuaded him, who usually never drank, to drink.
Since they weren't directly involved in the fall..,
the case was dismissed as an accident.
I see. And what does all this have to do with Akiba-san?
Well... This Sôma-san was engaged to Akiba-san.
- What?
Hm... There's a really good chance
that she still holds a grudge against the four of them.
But then why was she attacked?
Came Yaiba, Yaiba...
When we call his name...
Kamen Yaiba, Yaiba...
He always comes right away...
Hello, sir.
Hello, sir.
Hello.
I wonder if she's his mother.
They don't look alike at all.
Why is he walking so far behind her?
Maybe his mother scolded him?
- Really... - Tell me...
Do you know why before a concert
I always go for a walk in the woods?
Because I want to absorb nature.
Because the music of Europe is
surrounded by a great nature
in the midst of a great nature.
Do you understand that?
Yes, I think so.
Are you okay, Reiko-san?
Yes...
Run!
You go first!
He's actually attacking her.
Damn it!
He's going to shoot her!
Reiko-san! This way!
Why? Why didn't he pull the trigger?
What's he after?
Don't you think we should report the incident to the police?
No way. I told you:
Reporting it to the police...
...would be a waste of time
and would only jeopardize your performance tomorrow.
I understand that, but...
If you understand, then keep quiet.

After the concert I will tell you everything.
Okay?
Yes.
Oh, Inspector Takagi!
Ah, Akiba-san!
And Conan-kun!
Where have you been, Akiba-san?
You wanted to stay home!
I had a date with him there.
A... A date?
We'd like to talk to you...
Postpone it.
It's about Hikaru Sôma-san.
Hikaru Sôma-san was engaged to you, right?
Superintendent...
I'll tell you everything I know.
But please postpone it until tomorrow after the concert.
Tell me, Inspector...
Does this Sôma-san have a birthmark?
Yes, he does. But how do you know?
Because there was a picture of him in Reiko-san's apartment.
What? You went to Akiba-san's apartment?
Yes. I got it!
Why don't you take me home? I'll tell you what I know.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
So we brought Conan-kun here with us.
However, he didn't know anything more to tell us than that
Sôma-san's photo and a flute are in her apartment.
Really...
But commissioner...
Even if she had a motive to kill the four musicians..,
it doesn't necessarily mean she did it.
She was also followed by that truck...
Tell me... Didn't Sôma-san have
...no relatives or anything to avenge his death?
No, I don't know of anyone...
Uh... I made some tea...
Thank you very much, Ran-kun.
Thank you, Ran-kun.
Here you go.
Uh...
His mother, who was a single parent, died five years ago.
He has no siblings.
What about his father?
We don't know.
It is not known if he is still alive.
HIKARU SÔMA BORN 03.08.52 (SHÔWA)
This is...
The four murdered musicians had caused problems before.
For example, they once played drunk at a concert.
And they were sharply reprimanded by Dômoto-san.
What?!
When did that happen?
Ah... Right away, right away...
Uh...
Ah, there it is. It was a year ago.
They were playing a piano quartet by Beethoven.
I understood everything.
Who killed the four,
seriously injured Kawabe-san,
attacked Akiba-san, and also what his motive was.
I... Is that really true, Môri-kun?
Yes. The culprit is...
Gen'ya Dômoto-san, it's you!
It's because you're a fan of Beethoven.
You're a fan of Beethoven.
No,
you're an absolute fanatic admirer of his!
Well, well, well...
How dare you, all of a sudden...
Those four musicians killed you
because they performed Beethoven in a drunken state.
For you, it was a terrible desecration of the genius composer.
And you hurt Kawabe-san..,
because you had once clashed violently..,
over the interpretation of one of his pieces.
BETWEEN STRINGS AND BOW
Kawabe-san described it quite accurately in this essay.
You attacked Akiba-san because during the rehearsal...
This isn't about the Ninth, is it?
I can't stand it.
...had spoken badly about Beethoven's Ninth.
One moment, please.
Yes, I like Beethoven's music.
I hold it in high esteem.
But to call me a fanatic...
There's no doubt about it.
The fact that you have the exact same hairstyle as Beethoven..,
is proof of that.
Mo... Môri-kun?
You can't be serious!
My hair is naturally like that!
I only look like my mother!
If you don't believe that,
Here you go.
T... actually...
Like two peas in a pod.
What do you say now? Your accusation regarding the four musicians
and Akiba-san is untenable because I'm not a Beethoven freak.
Kawabe-san and I are both musicians.
And musicians sometimes get into
clash over interpretations.
But it's always just about playing,
so there's no personal grudge!
The idea is so idiotic, it's unbelievable!
Yes, but...
Commissioner...
Did you impose your late-night visit
just to tell us that?
There is a very important concert tomorrow.
I beg your pardon.
In any case, go now.
After the concert you can interrogate us for as long as you like,
as long as you like.
I really thought it had to be like this and not otherwise.
Where does he get this confidence?
Tell me, Inspector Takagi...
Does Kawabe-san still remember nothing?
No, unfortunately not.
She can talk normally now, but...
Then she says strange things like, "I can't sleep,

because the ventilation forms a dissonant interval..."
Because the ventilation forms a...
Can it be that...
That doesn't have to come out now, does it?
- Ah, sorry. - From there, please.
The pieces are the same as in the concert.
But we can sit down in the empty hall,
where we want. A dress rehearsal is really great, isn't it?
At the actual concert we sit upstairs.
I was listening to dad...
That means we sit on a balcony!
A balcony has ten seats,
so we're about to fill it.
Huh? With ten people?
The professor and the kids are invited, too.
And Shin'ichi gets a seat, too.
Let him know, will you?
His ticket is at the front desk.
You don't have to...
All right, go on, tell him! It would be a shame to lose a good seat.
I guess I'll have to...
But he won't come
Sorry Ran...
I guess you didn't tell the police about yesterday.
I want to thank you for that.
It's not important.
- But how's your leg? - Okay.
It won't get in my way.
Say, Sôko Kawabe-san has perfect pitch too, right?
Yes. When we met, we found out about it, and she
...acted unnecessarily chummy.
Anything wrong with that?
No, nothing.
Like that?
I'm gonna go.
Yeah. Good luck at the concert.
Reiko-san and Kawabe-san both have perfect pitch.
That's...
I don't want to talk to him. I sent him a text message.
Good. I hope he can come.
I don't care if he can come.
But it would be a shame to waste the space.
That's what I said before.
Oh, really?
Nothing doing. Let's start without him.
Did something happen?
Ah, Môri-san.
Müller-san isn't here yet.
What? The organ tuner?
He's supposed to be there
to make the final adjustments.
It's really annoying.
He's not answering his cell phone and
and he hasn't been back to his hotel since yesterday.
What, since yesterday?
It's just a matter of final tweaks,
so it's not a big deal if he's not here.
Doesn't that mean he's disappeared?
Have you notified the police?
No. They'll just waste a lot of time
with useless questions.
I just want to concentrate on the concert now!
Shion-san seems different.
That voice...
Shion-san played fantastically, didn't she?
Oh, yeah! Not to be compared to her playing at the rehearsal!
She's completely made the Stradivarius her own, huh?
Don't be so cheeky!
And Reiko-san's singing was beautiful, too.
Conan-kun!
You guys got here early.
If you're late, you can't get in.
That's why we wanted to come as early as possible.
What's that?
A recorder!
Are you stupid or what?
How can you bring something like that to a classical concert!
Don't scold him.
Because he can't speak, at least he wants to make sounds with it.
But still...
Of course, he won't play it during the concert.
Right, Genta-kun?
That means "yes"!
You'll hide it in the hall, right?
Cell phones are forbidden there, too, okay?
They know. And they left their detective badges at home.
Ah, I'm hungry!
Then let's have a bite to eat.
Good idea.
It starts at five. It'd be embarrassing if our stomachs growled.
"Eel and rice! Eel and rice!" he says.
It would be great if you could really talk like that.
Well, it wouldn't be impossible.
Convert the sound names into letters.
- The sound names? - In letters,
you say?
But for that you would need the alphabet.
That's still too high for him.
I can't get the sound out of my head.
I remembered that I have to do something.
I'll be in my seat before the concert starts.
Wait, Conan-kun!
The brat's doing whatever he wants.
That sound... It's a little strange, isn't it?
Yeah. I agree.
I noticed it when I was singing.
But I only know what note it is..,
but I don't know which register it was in.
There were several at the same time.
That's right. A note too low.
No doubt about it.
It came from that direction.
Probably a small pipe in a back row.
One whistle alone is not properly tuned.
It should still be corrected.
But nobody knows where Müller-san is.
That's right. I have to tell Dômoto-san anyway.
Doesn't seem to be here.
Yes.

Maybe he went out for tea?
Or maybe he's there?
But I'm amazed you noticed the wrong tone.
I just have good ears.
These are not the good ears.
Maybe you have absolute pitch?
It would be nice if...
Dômoto-san is not here.
Hm...
Don't you have any idea where he might be?
Well... Maybe he went to drink tea like you said...
We would like to make a request to all visitors.
Smoking is prohibited in the hall.
Akiba-kun still isn't here?
Yes, and she's not answering her cell phone.
The staff is looking for her, but...
Has she disappeared?
I don't know.
First Mueller-san and now her...
What's going on here?
It's 15 minutes before the concert starts.
What if she doesn't show up by then?
Please let me sing!
After what happened to Kawabe-san.
I kept taking lessons just in case...
I kept taking lessons just in case...
Yes, but...
Please, Dômoto-sensei!
I'll sing better than Akiba-san, all the best....
You don't need to sing better than her.
Music is a question, a request from man to God.
Sing as if you were praying.
Shin'ichi-kun actually didn't come.
But what about Conan-kun? The concert's about to start!
Where do you think Conan-kun went?
We don't have to worry about him.
I trust him.
You're right.
Just like he trusted us, we want to...
Don't worry. Conan-kun will surely...
A message to all concertgoers.
Unfortunately, we have been forced to cancel..,
to cancel the performance of Reiko Akiba-san scheduled for today.
She will be replaced by Lara Chigusa, a student in her 9th semester at the Dômoto
at the Dômoto Academy.
We ask for your understanding for this unforeseen change.
Why is that?
She had sung so beautifully at the dress rehearsal!
Surely nothing happened to Shin'ichi and her?
A plastic sheet? What...
Reiko-san! Reiko-san!
Ouch...
What the...?
Where are we?
Somewhere down the canal.
Our attacker must have ordered us
into the canal from the pond behind the hall.
But who would do such a...
I don't know.
And why did he just put us in a boat, knocked unconscious?
If we don't get back as soon as possible, the concert will....
But even if we swim across, we can't get up that wall.
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
There doesn't seem to be anyone around.
Look!
There's a phone on the wall.
If we could get to it, we could call for help.
Wait a minute.
Even if we can't reach it,
if the phone is off the hook, it might work.
How are you going to...
When dialing with tone dialing, you hear these "di-you-do" tones.
This signal is called a DTMF signal, where a high and a low tone are
a high and a low tone are superimposed,
this tone then transmits the number.
If we produce exactly these tones...
...we can call someone.
The 1 from the emergency call 110 consists of a tone of 697 Hertz
and one of 1209 hertz.
And the zero consists of the superposition
of 941 hertz and 1336 hertz, if I'm not mistaken.
Okay. I know the tones of the tone dial from hearing them.
But first we have to take off the earpiece.
Just leave that to me.
More importantly,
that some time after picking up the phone, the connection is broken.
So we have only one chance.
If we blow it, all we can do is wait for someone to find us.
I can't wait for that.
We have to try.
It's been decided. So let's get practicing!
What was that?
An explosion!
Something exploded!
It came from the hall!
Oh no...
Live from Nishitama's "Forest of Music"!
A few moments ago
two explosions took place in the concert hall.
At the back of the left part of the building and
at the stage entrance in the middle of the right part.
The concert started five minutes ago. How it was inside...
Again...
Next! The tone for the zero!
It could work.
Let's get closer.
Here's good. Stop the car.
How are you going to pick up the phone now?
Look at it.
Wow!
Let's go!
This is the central control station of the emergency call 110.
- What? Akiba-san and Conan-kun are... - Yes.
They were knocked out and put in a boat..,
...that carried them down the canal.
Location: Nishitama reservoir monitoring center.
There they are!

There they are! Down there!
So it was really the hall?
Yes. There have been more than ten explosions.
In each one, one of the outer columns exploded.
Cause still unknown.
Someone has installed bombs there.
And detonating them via timer or remote control.
Probably the same person who killed the four musicians.
That's right. The first incident was also a bomb explosion.
But why did he
Why didn't he just kill us, but take us away from the hall?
Was he trying to...
Another one.
Tell me...
Do you have contact with the hall?
Ran-Nekhan and the others are in there!
The phone lines are down.
Maybe the perpetrator cut it.
And the cell phones?
No chance.
During a concert, you turn off your cell phone...
and there's almost no reception in the hall.
But probably the people inside are fine.
The hall is completely soundproof and completely fireproof.
Maybe they haven't even noticed anything yet.
Could the concert still be going on?
Yes. It's entirely possible.
But it won't be confined to outside for long,
but inside as well...
No...
Maybe it has already started!
Ran...
Dear audience, good evening. Thank you for coming here today.
I am Kazuki Dômoto.
As I'm sure you know, today we're finally going to have this wonderful organ....
Quick, here it is! Over here!
What are you dawdling about! Quick, the hoses!
It's terrible...
But nothing has exploded inside yet.
I'm sure nothing's happened to those inside.
It's too early for joy.
All ways from the outside to the inside are blocked.
Evacuation impossible!
Oh no...
And we don't know which column will explode next.
There are 23 columns on the outside of the building.
Maybe he wants to explode all of them.
Damn... What are we going to do?
We have to enter from the roof.
How does it look?
We should be okay.
But since the roof isn't really a landing pad,
it's not sure it can take the weight.
All right. Get the helicopter as low as you can,
then we jump.
I'll show you the way.
The way from the roof to the fourth floor is complicated.
That's why...
But that's...
There's no time to argue.
Nothing's blowing up right now. We'd better get...
Further down!
A little more!
A little more!
And a little more!
We can't go any lower!
The airflow is too strong!
It won't stay stable!
If you're going to jump, do it fast!
Come on, Akiba-san!
See you later, Conan-kun. You stay here in the helicopter and...
Conan-kun!
I'll stay in the concert hall! Until Ran-nêchan...
and the others are rescued!
Conan-kun!
Besides, I saw the criminal.
He must not be the bomber, but I saw who knocked us down.
Maybe he's here in the hall! That's why...
Hurry up! I can't hold him!
Nothing doing. We have to take him with us.
Takagi-kun! Hurry up!
Yes!
The inner corridor of the fourth floor.
But we only went straight down!
I had to say that to be able to jump.
Like the boy here.
Did you actually see the attacker?
I'm surprised.
I didn't think they really noticed anything.
Yes.
Anyway, let's look for the bombs.
Evacuating that many people at once is impossible.
And if the perpetrator is planning to blow up the hall as well,
he's probably planted bombs here in the hall as well.
Understood.
Conan-kun, Akiba-san and you, please stay here.
I understand.
- Let's go. - Let's go.
Ran...
Hold on...
The inside!
What's it like inside?
The perpetrator must have known the layout of this hall,
so he could plant the bombs.
Probably someone from the employees.
This sound is really strange.
If he were playing the piano, Dômoto-san would have noticed him, too.
But in the first two years, you don't notice differences in tone.
Differences in tone...
"Dilettantes who can't distinguish tones..."
So that's it...
Kawabe-san would have recognized it.
She has perfect pitch.
Wait a minute. Then why did he...
Oh no... Is it him?
If that's true, why does he have her...?
HIKARU SÔMA BORN 03.08.52 (SHÔWA)
His mother, she was a single mother...
Aha, so that's how it is...
But...
What connects this sound and the explosions?

I just noticed something.
The time without explosions
was about the same length as Dômoto-san's welcoming speech.
Maybe it was done so that no one would notice?
No. That's not it!
Only during the game they explode!
So that's how it is! And that's why the wrong tone!
That sound again!
How many times has it happened?
Since the beginning of the concert...
How many times did the wrong note occur?
In the "Ave Maria" at the beginning, it occurred twice.
In the following cantata, ten times.
And in the present piece, eight times.
That makes a total of 20.
Then it will occur four more times.
The sound and the explosions are connected.
That is why there was no explosion during Dômoto-san's greeting.
Outside the hall there are 23 columns.
That is,
to blow up all the columns and then the hall,
you need 24 bombs.
That is, then...
Exactly.
If we don't stop the concert before the tone sounds four times..,
the bomb will explode in this hall.
That sound again!
Damn it...
It's really connected to the sound!
The culprit will probably be watching from somewhere.
Again!
I got him.
It was actually him.
Okay. I'll interrupt the concert.
Wait!
We do that, he'll blow up the bomb remotely!
I got him! The perpetrator, by remote control!
But...
Damn it, what now?
Is there no way to stop the concert safely?
No chance to delay the explosions?
Three minutes.
Is three minutes enough for you?
Yes. But...
Then I'm counting on you, little detective.
It's Reiko-sensei!
That song...
It's Amazing Grace, isn't it?
What does she want now?
The singer back then...
So it really was Reiko-san!
I should have erased her.
You can't.
Not the voice whose sound warms your heart.
That's why you hesitated, isn't it?
And besides, this is a song that your son...
Hikaru Sôma-san liked very much.
And the singer is the person your son loved.
The key to the solution is the one wrong note.
At first, I thought
the sound came from a mistake in tuning.
But it isn't.
In one of the organ pipes
there is a small sensor that is supposed to measure the air flow.
Because of it, the tone of this pipe changes slightly.
As soon as the sensor registers air flowing through the pipe,
it sends a signal to
the bombs and detonates them in sequence.
And when the last of the bombs explodes,
this concert hall will be destroyed.
They did not explode during the rehearsal,
because the detonators were not yet activated.
That's how it is, isn't it?
Director of the Dômoto Concert Hall and former piano tuner....
Takumi Fuwa-san!
There's nothing here either.
This is not good at all.
This way, the bomb will go off before we find it...
Shut up!
What's that noise?
- Don't move! - Police!
Müller-san!
How did you know it was me?
Absolute hearing...
You have absolute pitch, but you didn't point out
didn't point out the wrong note to anyone during the rehearsal.
That's what made me wonder.
I see.
And how do you know I was Hikaru's father?
The license plate on your car
is "52-83".
HIKARU SÔMA BORN 03.08.52 (SHÔWA)
The numbers are from your son's birthday, aren't they?
As a sign of the connection to the son, whom you loved, but could
but could never acknowledge publicly.
And on a photo
at Dômoto-san's home when you were younger...
You looked like him.
You killed the four musicians
to avenge your son's accidental death.
The parts of the flute left behind
to make the police think the third murder was the last.
The reason that you injured Kawabe-san with the help of the explosion was,
...was that she might have noticed the sound..,
because she has perfect pitch.
And only someone who has absolute hearing
fears someone with absolute hearing.
That is another reason why only you could be the perpetrator.
And someone else
has absolute hearing: Akiba Reiko-san.
But
But with her, your late son's fiancée,
you couldn't possibly
such a dangerous explosion as you did with Sôko-san.
That's why you smuggled the irritant substance into her tea,
and attacked her with a truck and a gun.

Because in order to thwart her appearance,
it was enough to make her lose her voice
was to make her lose her voice or break her leg.
He improvised?
He pushed her!
Why?
Why...
She's not going to explode.
Because before I came here,
I removed the sensor from the pipe.
Three minutes... no, two minutes was all it took.
You're really quite good.
What did you say your name was?
Conan Edogawa.
I'm a detective.
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo, bravo!
There he is.
With a remote control.
Then it's really him...
What do we do?
- Rush in before he detonates the... - No way!
As soon as we go in, he'll trigger the explosion!
But what are we supposed to do then?
From the balcony.
we might be able to do it somehow.
Somehow? How do we do it?
We shoot. Before he can push the button.
Sorry, little detective.
But I can set off the explosion with this.
You lost.
Do you really think so?
We don't know yet.
What don't we know yet?
I don't know how you got into the hall,
but the fact that the police aren't here yet means that..,
means that the hall is surrounded by fire as planned
and they can't get in.
The fact that you were able to remove the sensor was a bit of a miscalculation.
But oh well, never mind.
Because now I can blow up the hall whenever I want.
I should send him off...
to the afterlife while he's playing.
Damn! At that moment...
While you play your beloved organ,
Kazuki Dômoto.
Conan-kun!
No. I can't shoot like that.
That's right, continue with your concert now, Dômoto.
What do I do now? Without the anesthesia chronometer...
Another way...
Out of my way, Conan-kun!
Please, Conan-kun!
- Give it to me. - Hey, my flute!
I can talk!
I'm fine. Keep it up...
Damn!
This is goodbye, detective.
I won't let you!
Mi, Ia, Ia, Ia, fa...
Shoot... Shoot?
What was that sound?
The final whistle of our game.
What?
Police! Don't move!
I lost.
Fuwa-san, where's the last bomb?
Under the roof right above the stage.
Takagi-kun! Inform the commissar.
Yes!
Please forgive me...
But could I listen to the play until the end?
After that, I'll tell you everything.
All right.
The fire here is finally under control,
- We're going to... - Commissioner!
There's a gap on the east side.
All right, let's go.
I'll call you back.
Tell me...
Why did you plant those bombs here?
For 35 years, I...
I have used
Kazuki Dômoto as his personal piano player...
on his life's journey.
But two years ago
he suddenly gave up his career as a pianist.
And said that he wished me to take over the management of the
of the concert hall, which would be ready in two years.
Of course, I could have refused.
I was free to continue working as a piano tuner.
However, I was the personal piano tuner for 35 years
of the internationally renowned pianist Dômoto Kazuki for 35 years.
I could not have worked for anyone else.
My pride would not have allowed that.
But I am only a simple craftsman.
I would never trust myself with the job of director.
I was crushed by the feeling of despair.
Two years earlier, my wife had fallen ill and died.
A year later, my son died in an accident.
And now, since I had lost my only remaining purpose in life with my
my only remaining purpose in life,
I really had nothing left.
Even the music, which I had loved so much,
had suddenly turned into unpleasant, discordant dissonances.
Exactly...
That night, when the sounds haunted me again in the dream
and startled me,
I made up my mind.
To erase all that.
To get back my silent nights.
Of course, first the life of the four musicians,
then that of the selfish Dômoto, the organ,
which his interest had stolen, the hall itself
and also the lives of the musicians from all over the world and the audience,
who come to hear this organ,
all their lives...
That is why I
accepted the post of director of the concert hall.
To prepare the organ and to put the bombs in the hall,

it was most advantageous if I were the director.
And besides... The pile that Dômoto
had thrown away with me,
I felt incredibly sorry.
That means that...
You blew up the rehearsal hall and the grand piano...
because you loved it so much?
That's the end of my story.
Now then...
Would you please call Dômoto?
Fuwa-san! Calm down!
Don't worry. I need that to kill myself.
I have no intention of hurting you.
Conan-kun, please leave the balcony.
No! You've committed serious crimes,
I want you to atone for them, not just cowardly sneak away!
Conan-kun!
Fuwa-san! Don't do anything stupid!
Quiet! Call Dômoto over here right now!
Fuwa-kun...
If you're looking for me, I'm here.
Dômoto-san!
Fuwa-kun, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were in such pain about all this.
Have you finally realized how much I've suffered from your selfishness...?
That's not what I meant.
I gave up my career as a pianist..,
because I noticed that your piano tuning...
in your piano tuning.
Out of respect for your pride, I couldn't tell you directly.
I also didn't feel like
to join forces with another piano tuner.
That's why I gave up playing the piano altogether.
Impossible! I have an absolute ear!
That's right, you have absolute pitch.
But as you've gotten older, your hearing has diminished.
It often happened that you didn't
you didn't notice that you hadn't hit the right note.
That... is not true. It's not true. It's not true!
If I'd known what would happen...
I should have told you the truth.
I'm really sorry.
It's too late for that!
It's all your fault!
Wrong!
If my best friend had done the same to me..,
I'd think he had his reasons.
And maybe he didn't do it for himself..,
but out of consideration for me, who knows?
I think I would think that way.
And why?
Because I trust this friend.
It would be the same with me.
That such bombs exploded here...
We didn't notice anything.
I heard Conan-kun did something again.
I knew it! So it was just like I said!
I'm amazed that Shin'ichi...
recognized the recorder signal right away.
The transformation of tone names into letters
also occurs in detective novels.
In German tone names, the Si corresponds to an h.
But he knows that my mother was English,
so he must have realized immediately that I would use
would use the English names, where the Si is a b.
For the rest, I trusted his absolute ear.
I see.
Besides... I also trust him.
On him as a partner.
I was completely convinced that this Beethoven was the culprit.
You still say that?
Well, he didn't come after all.
That crazy snoop of yours.
Ah, Shin'ichi? I don't give a damn what he does.
Let's go, Conan-kun!
Wasn't he just here a moment ago?
What?
- You... That melody... - Huh?
Ah, a violin!
That's "Amazing Grace", isn't it?
That's not what I meant. The way it's played...
Playing?
Shin'ichi?
Hey, Ran!
Shin'ichi?
Shin'ichi?
Shin'ichi-nîchan just left.
Conan-kun!
Because of a case.
So Shin'ichi was really here?
Yes.
Reiko-san's song reminded him
reminded him of three years ago,
so he played the violin he found in the dressing room.
on the violin he found in the dressing room.
So that you, Ran-nêchan,
and he himself
hear it again.
Shin'ichi-nîchan said,
he treated you badly.
Did you have a fight?
It's all right.
I'm not going to forgive you now!
Idiot.
A find from last summer,
Natsu no otoshimono,
the days I spent with you...
kimi to sugoshita hibi...
Your smile, so fresh
Araitate no shatsu no yô na egao
like a freshly washed shirt,
ima mo wasurerarenai.
i can't forget it even now.
In the middle of the night
Mayonaka koe ga kikitaku natte,
I long to hear your voice,
unconsciously I turn the dial.
muishiki ni daiyaru mawasu.
But...
Dakedo... Hanasu yûki ga nakute,

I don't have the courage to talk to you,
setsunasa dakishimeta...
I only embrace my longing...
Spread your wings,
Tsubasa o hirogete
I will become you who depart,
tabidatsu kimi ni
soft words of encouragement after you...
sotto êru o okurô....
For no one at all,
Dare no tame ja naku,
only for yourself
tada kimi no tame,
aishiteta yo.
I loved you.
Two by the beach, sun goes down...
Nagisa de futari sun goes down...
Nomikake no kan jûsu...
An opened fruit juice can...
Kata o yosete
Shoulders close together
we had told each other our dreams...
yume katariatta
This day I was contemplating...
ano hi o mitsumeteta...
Friday night
Friday night kimi no heya e to isogu
Me, the guy who always rushed to your apartment,
he no longer exists...
itsumo no boku wa mô inai...
The shadows of warm people,
Sawagu hitokage kyûkutsu na michi...
the narrow, narrow way...
Machi wa burûsu sa...
The city has the blues...
Spread your wings,
Tsubasa o hirogete
I will become you who depart,
tabidatsu kimi ni
sotto êru o okurô...
softly shouting words of encouragement after you...
Dare no tame ja naku,
For no one at all,
only for yourself
tada kimi no tame,
I loved you.
aishiteta yo.
Spread your wings,
tsubasa o hirogete
i will you who depart,
tabidatsu kimi ni
soft words of encouragement after you...
sotto êru o okurô....
For no one at all,
Dare no tame ja naku,
only for yourself
tada kimi no tame,
I loved you.
aishiteta yo.
I used to come here with him a lot.
A regular part of our dates.
Oh, really?
In the spring after his death
I sang in this place
I sang the song that he loved.
And that was "Amazing Grace," right?
That's right.
You know...
At first, I was incredibly angry at those four guys.
So much so, I wanted to kill them.
Then I decided to forgive them.
After all, "Amazing Grace" is about grace and forgiveness.
I have to go now.
Conan-kun, let's harmonize again!
Take care!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Say, Ran-neechan...
How did you know it was Shin'ichi who was playing?
Well, because he plays so funny. I can tell right away!
I see... I see, I see.
Because I play funny? What does she mean by that?
