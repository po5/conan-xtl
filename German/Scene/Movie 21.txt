The colorful foliage, blown down from the stormy mountain of Mimuro....

Tormented by longing, I am...
The same favorite poems as your master...
I owe it all to you,
Momiji Ôoka...
Today, after the TV recording, I must thank you...
I must thank you.
That was fast.
He's here already?
You...?!
What's going on?
S... You don't want to...
During the winter
they rested, but now
spring is here, they bloom!
...they have rested, but now
the spring is here, they bloom!
Hast prevented me from bringing sacrificial silk...
What's up! The cards are flying here?
- Ah, don't bother! - Huh? Ah...
I beg your pardon.
- She's so cute! - Hey Pops, shut up, will you?
- She's beautiful! - Like a TV star!
That kimono looks great on her!
But tell me, why are we watching a karuta party here?
Mikiko told you earlier..,
to wait in the dressing room until the interview.
But you just followed the beautiful girl here to the studio.
Who's Mikiko?
I introduced you!
She with the glasses, playing against the beautiful girl!
The head of our high school's Karuta Club, to which I also belong!
"I'm a member of the Karuta Club?"
- You're in the karuta club, Kazuha? - Of course I am, didn't you know?
But tell me, wasn't your toilet break a little long?
Sorry.
The studio door was closed. I didn't know if it was okay to open it.
Excuse me, we're in the middle of rehearsal.
We're in the middle of rehearsal, please be quiet.
Yes!
To meet you,
I would have once
my life...
- Wow! How cool! - Hey, Kudô!
Did he forget that he came to Osaka for this interview?
Don't be so hard on him.
He has to play tour guide for the kids,
because the professor has other things to do.
Now that you mention it... Where's the rich girl?
Oh, Sonoko, she...
She got the flu.
But I didn't know..,
you were in the Karuta Club!
Next to the Aikido club, yes!
The club is on the verge of folding due to lack of members,
so I signed up
and practice with Mikiko from time to time. I'm like a zombie member.
Zombie member, that's funny!
How social you guys seem to have it....
It's like we're in a cafe...
Excuse me!
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE CRIMSON LOVE LETTER
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran..,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on it,
I didn't notice the man behind me.
He was administering a poison to me.
When I awoke...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised me not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked what my name was,
I spontaneously said: Conan Edogawa.
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father is a detective.
This is Heiji Hattori,
the "Detective of the West...
Clever like his father, the prefectural police chief of Osaka,
he has solved many tricky cases.
and is one of the few who know my true identity.
Kazuha Tôyama.
Hattori's classmate and sandbox friend.
According to Hattori, she's "always chortling around him..." I wonder what will become of them?
And the mysterious "future queen"...
Who might she be?
I am small, my mind is not!
No case remains unsolved!
There is always
one truth!
NICHIURI TV
Here we are at a TV station and we have to stay in the dressing room!
I wanted to see them filming...
No chance. They scolded Uncle Kogorô too.
THE WORLD OF KARUTA-SATSUKI-KAI MR. KOGORÔ MORI
It's my fault, I was too exuberant.
I got it! Let's go buy souvenirs when the others get back!
- Really? - Are you serious?
Yes. If you stay good until the end of the shoot.
Of course!
Yay!
- Let's go together! - That reminds me...
Where's Conan-kun?
Ah, Conan-kun, he's in my place...
He's been keeping an eye on my dad.
Hey, kid!

I told you to wait in the dressing room!
But Ran told me to watch the footage.
- For real. - Out of the way!
Clear the way! Here come the cards!
Wah, the cards of Satsuki Kai!
They're making a fuss about those cards!
What are you saying, Kazuha!
These are the famous cards
that will be used in the finals of the National Karuta Championship!
Oh yes!
It's your dream to play with these cards!
And not only mine!
Everyone in the 20-year history of Satsuki-Kai admires them!
Oh, if only I could touch these cards once in the finals....
Say...
Why are these cards only used in the finals?
After countless fierce competitions, they are very worn out.
That's why, except for the finals, they are always kept in a showcase
and usually exhibited in the museum.
But isn't this vigilance a bit exaggerated?
Garbage! After the last Cup they were lost, that was a huge excitement!
Fortunately, they were found right away,
but Yajima-san is said to have then persuaded President Achiwa,
LET'S COMPETE WITH THE FAMOUS "HYAKUNIN ISSHU"!
to strengthen the security measures.
I see. But tell me... Who are these two again?
Are you stupid, uncle? They're the two people you're talking to.
Oh, really?
Uncle, you're a paragon of concentration.
This is President Kensuke Achiwa.
A powerful man, the founder of "Achiwa Real Estate".
Nickname: Broker King of Naniwa.
But why does someone like that run a karuta club?
The game has always been his hobby. He's supposed to be really good too!
But it says here that Achiwa-san wanted to be a reader rather than a player.
Oh! Who is this
this beautiful woman?
Satsuki-san, Achiwa-san's wife.
Shoot, she's already married.
Satsuki-san was once "Queen" and founded the Satsuki-Kai.
Achiwa-san took over the president's seat after her.
What else could be a topic during the conversation....
Ah! This would be interesting too!
It says here: On the day before an important competition of his wife
Achiwa-san always washes his car.
A clean car is the secret behind success and victory, as he says.
So I'm going to talk to this superstitious couple?
No.
Satsuki-san died of an illness three years ago.
So your interlocutor today will only be President Achiwa.
A... I see...
Say... Who is this
who is that burly man who is always next to Achiwa-san?
Ah, that is
Achiwa-san's former secretary Tôgo Kaieda.
An astute man, responsible for the dark part of the business.
But he quit, no one knows where he is....
Hey, Hattori-kun!
Please stop with the baseless talk!
- Our president doesn't have a dark side! - That's right!
Don't worry... Those are just rumors.
The president is here!
President Achiwa! I must greet him.
Mr. President! Thank you for taking the trouble!
Ah, thank you for your trouble.
Thank you.
Today we have a presentation by Yajima-kun and Momiji-kun...
and then a talk, right?
Yes. Then in the broadcast, we'll also do a special on the Satsuki Kai cards,
that we recorded with Yajima-san last week,
and show the world the fascination of playing karuta!
Oh, and the Satsuki Kai cards are already on display, too!
- All right, let's get started! - Yes!
An impressive appearance...
Yes. Truly the broker king of Naniwa...
Excuse me, sir. Have you contacted Yajima-san?
He should have been here a while ago.
but we can't reach him!
That's strange.
He was supposed to be here an hour before the start of the recording.
I can't believe this conscientious boy is late.
For safety's sake, ask Sekine-kun to be here as well.
Then we'll ask him to step in in case of an emergency.
Oh... oh no!
- It's going to be a while before the recording... - Yes.
Where should we go for okonomiyaki?
It's obvious: at You-Know-Where!
Yes, you're right, they're really...
Excuse me. Are you all right?
You were playing karuta earlier, right?
It's fate.
I was so hoping to meet you!
You, my future husband!
Future...
...husband?!
What?!
I don't have any plans after the shoot.

- If you want to... - Wah... She's got huge boobs!
- Hey! What are you doing? - Ah, uh... I...
Momiji-san!
Please come back to the dressing room!
What, it was so nice just now!
- Well, the thing is, Yajima-san was late... - Yajima-san, really?
Well, he's been planning this show, so he's going to be busy...
Okay, Heiji-kun, I'll see you later!
Yeah, see you later!
Who the hell is that woman?
- That's the girl from before. - She's really beautiful!
- He called her Momiji-san... - Believe me:
I don't know her!
But she knew your name!
- Ran! Come on, we'll wait outside. - They seem to be fighting.
- Let's go! - But why is she so angry?
N... Well... maybe I've seen her somewhere before.
Ha, you see?
- So you do know her! - I'm telling you, no!
I couldn't forget such a beautiful girl!
Such a... beautiful girl?
You, on the other hand, are unforgettable in another way...
What?!
- Hey, what did you mean? - Tell me...
Heiji, do you really not know this person?
Momiji Ooka? Satsuki High School Cup champion two years in a row...
Second grader at Senshin High School, Kyoto.
MOMIJI ÔOKA
Touted as a sure future queen.
Momiji Ôoka?
Future queen?
OSAKA PREFECTURAL POLICE
This is that announcement?
Yes. It just says, "I'm going to blow up Nichiuri TV!"
And this photo of a karuta card?
It was attached to the threatening email.
We don't know what it means yet.
So, does Nichiuri TV know anything about this yet?
We warned them once...
What do you think?
A simple prank? Or is it a real bomb threat?
You can't tell just from the email.
But if it's not a prank, it's serious.
The prefectural police have just ordered the evacuation of this building.
Stop...
What's this announcement?
...escape via the nearest emergency staircase.
What? A disaster drill now, too?
- Is something happening now? - She's talking about the police.
Are they filming for TV?
...and recordings and escape into the open via the next emergency staircase.
- Hey, find out what's going on fast! - J... Yes!
What's going on?
Kazuha! Go to the nearest emergency staircase now! Do you understand?
What... what about you?
I'll find out what's going on. You go on out, okay?
Stop, Mom... Heiji!
Come on!
Watch it!
Hey there... Kid! Where are you going?
I left something at the studio!
Idiot! Didn't you hear the announcement?
- Really... - I'm sorry.
This is the first time I've experienced this.
This is my first such exercise in a kimono!
It's an emergency! We have to get out now!
- Calm down! What's wrong? - There's been a bomb threat!
- There's been a bomb threat! - What?
Maybe it's just a false alarm,
but we should make a run for it just to be safe.
Yeah. You're right.
Let's go! We follow the announcement and get out!
- Move! - J... Yes!
What are you waiting for, Mikiko-kun?
It's dangerous here! Get out.
You too, Achiwa-san.
What are you waiting for? Get out!
An announcement to all: please remain calm!
Nothing has happened that...
Let's all stay here and wait, okay?
Great, waiting again?
Of course I can't get through. I left Pop inside. I wonder if he's okay.
Run!
Dad! Conan-kun!
Well, well! What's all this about?
Is this a spontaneous disaster drill?
No. I asked someone at the TV station earlier.
He said it was a bomb threat.
Is that really true?
- But where are Kazuha-chan and Hattori-kun? - Hello?
- Weren't they with you guys? - No, they weren't.
- I'll go look for them... - No, you won't! I'm going! You don't move!
You hear me?
A drill, just when we've got so much to do!
Ah, Heiji!
Mikiko!
I told you to get out!
Yeah, but I was worried about you!
Kazuha, I'm sorry.
But I can't leave the maps here.
If I use the cell phone GPS signal to find his position...
Excuse me! Hattori's still in the building?
You there! What are you doing?
Leave that here and get to safety!
- Really... - Mikiko!
Kazuha!
Hattori-kun!
Do you have any idea how dangerous...?
We're sorry!

For real. I've secured three people in Studio 3.
Mikiko!
What are you doing!
I'm sorry.
But when I thought the threat was real..,
I just couldn't get it out of my head!
The bomb could go off at any time. We'll be standing by at a safe distance.
Thank you.
The three that were inside are on their way out.
- Is that all of them? - Yes.
Good. We're looking for the bomb now. All teams move into the building!
Copy that!
- They're in! - Is there really a bomb?
It's just a joke.
Let's go, let's go! This way!
No?!
Everybody take cover!
Everybody back up even further! We have to get away from the building!
President! Hurry!
Watch out!
Kazuha!
- Oh, my... - No, it's dangerous! Stay here!
Damn it! Where are they?
I hope you didn't get caught, Hattori!
Kazuha!
We can't stay here, it's too dangerous! Let's go.
Ouch!
- Are you okay? Can you walk? - J... Yes.
Good, let's go! This way!
- It's gonna be hard to get in now... - Yeah.
- Someone's coming! - Is there anyone else in there?
You said there were two still inside.
What?!
Kazuha, this way!
Damn it!
Heiji!
That was close...
Get back! Get back! Get back! Get away from the building!
We can't go down.
Kazuha, this way!
- We're going up. - What, why? Shouldn't we go down?
If we can't get out, we have to go somewhere with breathable air!
Is Hattori going...
going up?!
Shit... I can't get a connection.
Go, Kazuha!
Kazuha! This way!
This roof is made of concrete, right?!
Closer! We have to get closer!
No way! Closer is too dangerous!
Let me through!
Damn...
I can't see because of the smoke!
I can't do it alone... Not by myself!
Kudo!
It's all or nothing.
I have to try.
Go!!!
Is that him?
He's finally here!
Hattori!
Mom... Heiji! Where are we going?
Come on! It's the only way down!
Down? But how?
- Stay here for a while. Understand? - Heiji?
Down from here? You're not serious?
Hey! We're ready!
So am I. No time. We'll do it in one go.
Okay!
- Kazuha! - Do you really want to leave...
Hey! I don't look... Wha... You've got to be kidding! Heiji!
Close your eyes and hold on tight!
What? Hey! Mom...
Wait up!
You're kidding?!
I'll wait for you downstairs. I'll wait for you downstairs!
Yes.
I can't close my eyes! I'm scared!
Kudô!
Ah, damn it!
Kudo!
Impossible?! Someone's here! Quick!
Let go of me!
There's someone here!
Quick, bring a stretcher!
Kazuha!
H... Heiji!
Shit...
The only way down!
Think! There must be a way out somewhere!
The helicopter?
No, it won't work.
With the smoke and flames, it can't get close or land.
Wait a minute... There's a river next to the TV station.
If I jump there...
No, there's no more room.
No. There's no room to accelerate the board...
Damn... Just one breath and my lungs feel like they're burning!
I have to do something fast...
I've got to do something...
Ran!
I can't give up!
Somewhere there must still be a place where I can speed up the board!
This is it!
What are you waiting for, Kudo! Come on!
That one...
No doubt about it. It's Kudô. But what the hell is he up to?
I see!
That's it!
More...
Faster!
I can't breathe...
A little more... a little more...
It's falling!
Is that supposed to be it?!
Shit! Not enough acceleration?
Shit! It's not enough!
There you are!
And hop!
NICHIURI TV
Hey, are you okay, Kudô?
Yes... More or less.
Here. You dropped this.
Thank you.
But you had
the board... Did you know the transmitter was going to be blown up?
Idiot... Of course not!
I only had it with me in case of emergency.
Did you cause it yourself?
Heh, probably...
Kazuha-chan!
Ran-chan!
Are you okay?
Yeah. I don't remember exactly.
But I guess I just inhaled some smoke.
Fine, as long as you're okay.
- As long as you're okay. - Yeah, I'm fine.
Ran! I lost my car keys.
- I'll go find it. - Okay.
Where's Conan-kun?

Hm... I thought he'd be here at the rally point, too, but....
Ah, there's Conan!
- Yes! - Conan-kun!
- Where have you been? - We were worried about you!
Kazuha!
Listen, Heiji!
Where have you been?
Ah, well, uh...
You too, Conan-kun! I was really worried about you.
I'm sorry, Heiji.
But where's Mikiko?
She hurt her arm and was taken to the hospital.
Her arm?
I hope it's nothing serious...
I asked where she was taken. Shall we go together?
Yes!
- Let's go! - Let's go!
- Hei-chan! - Otaki-han!
Good luck, you're okay!
Kazuha, please go ahead, okay?
- What? I'll be right there!
I'll be right there!
- Let's go, Ran-chan! - O... okay... Come on, Conan-kun!
J... Yeah...
- You have to stay with us now! - Y-yeah...
See you later, Conan-kun!
Did the police really receive a bomb threat?
This is the mail that arrived at the police station.
There was a Karuta card attached to it?
Maybe there's a connection with the filming for the TV show!
But in the state the TV station is in....
- I guess the investigation of the crime scene will take a while. - Yes...
But what did the perpetrator have in mind?
NANIWA POLICE HOSPITAL
Thank you very much for your help.
Get well soon!
Mr. President! How are you?
It's nothing serious, just a small scratch.
Thank God.
To be involved in something like this right before the big tournament...
Yes. I really never expected it.
Now we may have to cancel the traditional Satsuki Cup.
Oh no!
Right now we have to show that the Satsuki Kai is alive!
But the cards that were to be used in the finals have been burned.
Don't worry about that.
They are intact.
Wha...
What are you saying? Wha... what does that have to...
Hiramoto-san
took them out with him.
Mi... Mikiko-kun took...?
If they were burned, it would be different, but they're intact!
Really?
Are the cards really intact?
A museum employee took them away to check for damage.
Mr. President, the maps are safe. You can rest assured.
Yes. I was beginning to think it was all over. What a misfortune.
But how is the woman who saved our maps, Mikiko-kun?
She's not critically injured, but...
She's still being examined.
I see...
Mikiko-chan is taking a long time.
- The doctor said it was just an emergency treatment, but... - Thank you very much.
Mikiko!
Your arm! Is it...
Yes. It looks like it's broken.
- I guess that's the punishment... - But...
For putting you and Hattori-kun in danger because of the cards...
What are you talking about?
Thank you, Mikiko-kun.
You saved the cards, which are like the face of Satsuki-Kai!
As a representative of Satsuki Kai, I can't thank you enough.
But Mr. President... I can't participate in the Cup like this!
Yes... It's a great pity for Satsuki-Kai that a good player like you...
that such a good player like you can't compete.
But concentrate on getting well now.
Yes. The tournament will be held again next year.
But that doesn't help us!
If we don't get a good result in the Satsuki Cup, our club will be disbanded....
I didn't want it to die out with my generation.
Mr. President!
The police are waiting. We have to...
Yes.
- Cheer up, Mikiko! - I want to, but...
The thing is... In our club.
we're the only ones who can play karuta properly.
That's it, Kazuha! You step up!
Represent me as the representative of Kaihô Academy!
But I can't just suddenly...
- Have you ever done that before? - What are you thinking?
- But you've always trained with me! - Yes...
You are strong enough, and your reflexes are good!
You have the will to win and are not afraid of any opponent!
And you have a certain impudence.
Somehow I have the feeling that this is not praise.
When does this tournament start?
It starts the day after tomorrow.
Don't worry! If you start training right now, you'll be fine!
An amateur competes in the tournament and wants to win it?
Should we change the discipline from Hyakunin-Isshu to Iroha-Garuta instead?
Don't laugh at her!

I know her talent best, after all, I always practice with her!
She has no competition experience, but in terms of ability she is class A!
She is?
This girl?
Oh yeah, you were with Heiji-kun earlier. What's your relationship like?
We've been together since we were little! Heiji is my...
He's my...
You love him, don't you?
- It's so obvious! - Even a blind man!
Shut up!
"I'm hiding it," what?
Sandbox friend who plays love...
Really heartwarming!
Let's do it this way:
Whoever wins the tournament tomorrow gets to be Heiji-kun's #1 bride candidate,
propose to him, and have him.
What do you say?
Listen, what are you saying!
If you're really serious about it, you must be willing to do it.
Kazuha, you don't have to make that kind of bet!
But I'm warning you:
I'm serious.
Wait!
This bet... I'll take it!
- K... Kazuha-chan! - Are you serious?
I hope your determination will last until the tournament.
And you won't be defeated until you meet me!
Then I'll say goodbye for today. I have to go to the nail salon
I have to go to the nail salon and figure out how to declare my love for Heiji-kun.
That girl is scary.
- Yeah. - That was really amazing.
You're really great! I can't believe you answered Momiji so sharply!
What am I doing?
I promised something bad...
- Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, don't mention it!
Dad! Did you find the key?
Well, about that... I've looked everywhere.
but I can't find it.
I guess we'll need a duplicate key...
What do you have there, Conan-kun?
That's what the girl dropped earlier.
What? Let me see it.
Yeah. It's Momiji-san's.
MOMIJI OOKA
- I'll take it back to her. - Do you know her?
This is really depressing. What am I going to do?
What you should do?
She was a little intimidating.
But she's really beautiful, isn't she?
If a girl like that confesses love to him, I'm sure Heiji-san will be crushed and...
But of course, you're the only one who fits him!
Really?
Really, really!
No time to complain. Starting tonight, I'll train all night long!
- It's my first time in the hospital! - It's so big, you get lost!
Ran, there she is! There.
Momiji-san!
Wait a minute!
Momiji-san! Wait!
It's gone. What do we do with it now?
We know her name and school.
and her address is in her purse.
You're right.
- Let me take a look too, okay? - Ah, yes.
Uh, this is... A photo.
Who is this man?
Oh, there's another one.
Looks like a child's picture...
That's Momiji-san and...
Hattori-kun, right?
They're making promises.
I wonder what they promised each other.
Maybe they'll get married one day.
- When they were little? - That's right, I'm sure they didn't.
They did. He's got a pretty reckless side.
Maybe he did.
Ah, that's Heiji's bike!
We'll keep the photo a secret, right?
- Especially from Kazuha-chan, right? - Yeah.
So you're the reception committee?
No, no!
What's wrong with her?
Ran! Were you able to give it back to her?
Uh... yes.
Hey!
- You've been gone a long time. - Huh?
And? Did anything come of it?
Nope. There's still confusion at the prefectural police station.
Otaki-han will contact me as soon as they have more information.
Mr. President, this is an urgent call. Would you please answer it?
Yes, of course.
Really...
- What's wrong with Ran? - What's wrong with Ran? Kyoto Prefectural Police?
Yes.
So, what happened to Yajima-kun?
What? Murdered?!
- Hattori! - Yes.
I see.
Hey there! You two! Wait!
KYOTO PREFECTURAL POLICE
Thank you very much.
Hey, you two! This is a restricted area!
We're here with Kogorô Môri.
- What are you...
- You can let those two boys
- can let you pass. - G... good...
Long time no see, you two!
Inspector Ayanokôji!
The murder victim is Toshiya Yajima.
Son of a respectable sake-brewing family, he lived alone in the mansion.
Presumed time of death: six in the morning.
The body was found eight hours later.
Watch your step. There's been quite a bit of rioting around here.
- J... yeah. - A robbery, you mean?
Looking at the crime scene, it could only have been a robbery-homicide.
Yes. That's what we think, too.

The perpetrator was after money and valuables and happened to run into Yajima-san.
He struck the victim with the sword he was about to steal.
Then he took the money and fled.
But why? Why...
As you can see,
the victim was playing karuta.
Indeed.
Why are you in here too?!
So, Inspector, let's quickly examine the crime scene, shall we?
The experts have already finished their work, so go ahead!
S... are you really sure?
However: The murder weapon, the sword, we will take.
Ah, fine by me.
- Let them look around as long as they want. - Yes, sir.
Alright, I'll wait outside.
- If you find out anything, let me know. - Yes, sir.
What do you think?
You can't tell anything yet.
- But that hand... - Yes.
- So you noticed it too. - Yes, I noticed.
Something was pulled out by force here that had blood on it.
What's bloodstained in this room?
The Karuta cards...
The perpetrator noticed the Dying Message and hid it under the cards....
Finding it underneath will be a bone-crushing job.
Leave it to me.
I know someone who can analyze it.
Well?
According to the blood traces, the remote control was lying next to the victim, but...
Excuse me, sir. But could we put the TV back?
Yes, go ahead.
Thank you.
If he was watching it right before he died..,
we might be able to see something.
This is Momiji Ooka...
Yajima-san was watching this right before the attack?
What have you got there?
- Looks like an old contest. - Yeah.
15th to 20th Satsuki Cup High School Competition...
Why did he keep these records...
The level of the finals is pretty high.
Tactics, card order...
You can learn a lot just by watching.
But I don't think it has anything to do with the murder.
- A... but... - "But, but!"
Stop it!
Come on, you're coming too!
Finished playing detective! Please excuse the interruption!
- J... Yes... - Put me down, uncle!
It's okay, it's okay! Let me go!
Now for the news. This afternoon at...
There you go again. I'm really worried.
Why do you turn off the TV?
If you're worried about every one of the reports, you'll fold up.
But...
You did reach the children, didn't you?
But Shin'ichi-kun hasn't called back.
Here.
CONAN
Speak of the devil...
Oh! Pass it on to me later, will you?
Yes.
For real! Just not contacting us. What have you been up to?
The professor's really worried!
I'm sorry. But it's not easy for us here either.
So? What do you want?
I just sent you an e-mail with photos.
Please check the Karuta cards on it.
First you get bombed...
and now bloody karuta cards?
Please locate the card that the victim was holding.
Pedantic montages like this are your thing!
Pedantic, huh?
There's a photo of a person in it too!
Oh, yeah. See what you can find out about this guy.
- Is he involved with Karuta? - Yes, he is. I think so.
Okay, I'll try. But give me some time.
Thank you. I'm counting on you.
- I'll see you later. - Hey, stop! The professor...
That heartless guy...
If that's the case, the top members of Satsuki Kai are the target.
We need to keep an eye on two people.
I'll watch Achiwa-san.
We'll stay at the same hotel.
Then I'll take over Momiji Ooka.
Hey there, hey there! What are you doing here?
I'm from Satsuki Wharf! Let me through!
Please wait. I'll go find out.
Sekine-kun!
Where have you been? We've been trying to reach you several times!
I'm so sorry!
But I had too much to drink...
...and I fell asleep without realizing that my battery was dead.
So really.
And when I woke up, the TV said the TV station had exploded!
When I called the association, they said you are at Yajima looking for me.
I rushed here, and here's this commotion....
What's going on with Yajima that there are so many police here?
Yajima-kun was murdered.
What?!
It seems to be a robbery. With a sword that was in the corridor.
Sword...
But that...
Achiwa-san, who is the master?
Ah, sorry.
I'm a cameraman and a member of the Satsuki Kai. My name is Kôji Sekine.
Sekine-kun and Yajima-kun were rivals.
For the last two years, the cup final was a duel between them.
I lost both times.

But this year I wanted to make it....
But now I can't compete against him.
But tell me, will you do the tournament as planned?
Ah... I was wondering the same thing...
But you can't!
If the traditional Satsuki Cup is cancelled because of Yajima's death..,
Yajima will have died for nothing. Beaten down for nothing!
Sekine-kun! Please watch your tongue, okay?
Ah...
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... I didn't mean to...
I'm from the prefectural police. We'd like to ask you a few questions,
Can you give us a moment?
Ah, sure, I'll answer any questions.
- Then please follow me. - Yes.
Môri-san, I will...
You, Kudô, I now know who the culprit is.
So do I.
He's probably Yajima-san's killer.
But to blame him for the bombing as well..,
...for the bombing of Satsuki Wharf.
You are right.
It is safer to watch Achiwa-san and Momiji,
as we decided earlier.
Yes.
HOTEL NEW OTANI
- I am the first! - I'm second!
That's mean, you two! Wait!
Wah, this room is huge!
Sonoko reserved it for us.
She was planning to come, too.
That's why she chose a hotel near Nichiuri TV.
The Suzukis don't mess around!
That's right.
They're training through the night, so cook them a midnight snack.
Yeah. Thanks a lot.
Really. Why do I have to...
When I see how eager you are to support your friends...
Never mind.
Let's start the training! Let's start training!
We'll help too!
Let us know if we can help in any way!
- We support you holistically! - Kids...
Thank you very much, really!
Telephone.
Who is it?
- The professor. - I want to talk to him too!
Let's all talk to him!
Yes, we will! And you do your best at the training, right?
We're going over there so we don't disturb you!
- So this is what they meant by... - "holistic support."
PROFESSOR
Oh, I can see you!
I hope you've been all right?
- Yes! - We are fine!
Now we're at the hotel!
We are? That's good!
- What? - Do you want...
Tadadaah! Here comes
the long-awaited quiz question!
So that's why you called us?
Let's do it!
It is said that karuta cards resemble in their appearance
of a very traditional Japanese occupation.
Which one of these four?
One: picking tea.
Two: flying kites.
Three: pounding mochi.
Four: rice harvesting.
Maybe tea picking? Because you pick up the cards, after all.
Or kites? They look like candy!
Stomping mochi? You have to be skilled at that too!
Is that your final answer?
- It's the four, rice harvest. - Hey, Ai-kun!
To bring home the harvest from the rice field, you need...
- A cart. Cards! - Huh? Huh?
Oh, truly, you are without love or heart!
Listen, children!
Even when traveling, you should not stay up too late.
Yes!
- Good. I'll hang up now. - Yahaaa!
That's right, it's late.
- A lot happened today! - Dad's late!
I wonder if Heiji is still with him?
Why don't you give him a call if you're worried!
D... You're right.
What's wrong, Kazuha?
There's no "what's up"!
Where are you hanging out so late?
What? In Kyoto?
What's up with that?
Sorry, but I can't see you home tonight. Go by yourself, okay?
What are you doing? I thought you were going to help me with my karuta training!
Training?
I have to take Mikiko's place at the karuta tournament!
But you've never been to a tournament!
That's why I have to train!
You played karuta as a kid and you were really good!
That's right! In elementary school, I once spontaneously participated in a tournament!
And you won it right away! I was really surprised!
That was a long time ago. I remember it only darkly.
I remember it well!
When Mikiko asked me to join the club, it occurred to me too!
Really? But are you done with the old stories now?
Then I'll hang up.
What kind of tone is that?
Do you really hate talking to me on the phone?
I didn't say that!
Yes, yes. Pah, I'll manage without you!
Huh? What's wrong with you?
I've had it! Heiji, you idiot!
Come on. What's wrong with that guy?
Come on. What's wrong with her?

Nothing to do...
Ah, it's me! Listen, I have a little favor to ask you.
Yes, that's right. Thank you very much!
ÔOKA
Ah... I'm exhausted...
Welcome back!
Ah... I can't believe I'm involved in a case here in Osaka, too...
Dad, where's Conan-kun?
He went back with us, but when we got to the hotel...
But when we got to the hotel, he went with Achiwa-san to talk about something.
What? Really...
That Conan-kun...
If that person is the culprit,
Achiwa-san will be left alone tonight...
What is it, Ran?
- Did you take care of everything? - J... Yes.
Then come back to us!
- I'm worried after everything that happened! - I'll be right there.
I'll be right there.
Good. That way I can track him even if he leaves the hotel. What's that?
That's the one...
But what's it doing here?
...a stormy fellow.
We promised...
Wah! You're so great!
I'm really not cut out to be a training partner.
Hey! Watch it, it's dangerous! I almost...
- Hello! Oh, Conan-kun!
We have a reliable supporter!
- Who's that?
Heiji's mother?
Heiji told me about it.
I rushed right over.
What? Why?
To help you, Kazuha-chan. You want to train Karuta, right?
Yes, that's right, but...
I'll train with you.
Maybe I'm not good enough as a former queen, but...
Former queen?
Heiji asked me to.
I will teach you everything I know and can.
However, we don't have enough time. The training will be hard.
Will you do it anyway?
Yes! Please teach me!
I thought you would come, Commissioner Ayanokôji.
It looks like we're thinking the same thing.
Yes.
Isn't the little detective here?
No, he's watching Achiwa-san.
I see. You make a good team.
Yes, but I regret choosing Momiji.
I didn't think she lived in such a huge mansion.
Thank you for your efforts.
Gladly...
I work for Miss Momiji.
My name is Iori.
How about a break and a cup of tea?
He came here out of concern for me....
My future husband!
...on Ojima, all drenched,
- don't change color. - Crap!
He seems to be still in the hotel.
The waves are rushing to the beach...
You're really trying hard.
I didn't expect you to make it this far.
Let's take a little break now.
No! I can keep going!
Breaks are part of training, too.
I'll go get some rice porridge.
Kazuha-chan!
Are you okay?
Let her sleep.
She gave it her all without nodding off once.
How do you rate Kazuha-chan?
She's better than I thought. But a place in the top four will be hard.
And honestly, a place in the final will be very difficult.
- But... - Please let me finish first.
Just because I say it's difficult doesn't mean it's impossible.
In competitions, mental strength and power of concentration are the most important things.
And she has that.
If she doesn't let her emotions get the best of her..,
she has a chance to win.
If I show her that, it will unsettle her....
It won't take long. Please remain seated.
Really. I have to go now.
Well? What do you want from me?
It's about Yajima-san's murder.
It was a burglar!
You really think so?
I've come to the conclusion that it was a cold-blooded murder.
Nonsense! Okay, Yajima wasn't a sympathetic guy.
But nobody hated him enough to kill him!
- And you? - Don't talk crap! Why should I...
Sekine-san...
They missed winning the Satsuki Cup two years in a row.
Because you lost to Yajima-san twice in the finals.
If Yajima-san died, you would be...
Stop this nonsense! Of course I want to win the tournament!
But that doesn't mean I'd be crazy enough
to kill my rival!
And anyway! According to the police, it was a robbery-homicide. Why?
There are several reasons.
First, the mess was too inconsistent for a robbery.
The perpetrator didn't touch anything related to the Karuta game.
He had killed someone. That's when he was shaken up!
I see. And I thought..,
the perpetrator couldn't have touched things roughly out of love for the game of karuta.

Detectives really do come up with the strangest ideas!
But as far as I'm concerned, you can assume whatever you want!
- It's none of my business!
Sa... say...
Huh? What is it?
The floor in the corridor over there creaks.
It squeaks. Do you remember that?
What about it?
The noise is so loud
that it's immediately noticeable when someone enters the house.
But the body showed no signs of struggle.
I see. I guess you're saying that Yajima knew the intruder.
But that's not true.
Even in training, playing karuta requires a lot of concentration.
You don't notice such insignificant noises.
So Yajima did not notice the intruder and was killed by him.
This is not possible.
The fatal wound was in the middle of his head.
If he had not noticed the intruder and continued to play karuta,
the wound should have been on the back or side of his head.
In other words, they knew each other, otherwise he would not have given him such a wound.
would not have inflicted such a wound.
The perpetrator is a karuta connoisseur,
knew Yajima-san and has no alibi for the time of the crime.
And he profits from Yajima-san's death.
That's strange. It all applies to me.
But everything,
But everything you just said is just conjecture.
If you want to make me the culprit, you must provide evidence!
Sekine-sama, it's time. Please come.
Yes, I'll be right there. I'm sorry. But I have to go. Goodbye.
Finally, answer me one more question.
You're really persistent! What was that?
One sentence stuck in my mind. I don't know if you remember...
If the traditional Satsuki Cup is cancelled,
Yajima would have died for nothing. Was knocked down for nothing!
That's what you said.
When you think of the sword as the murder weapon.
one normally thinks of "beating to death" or "stabbing to death."
Nevertheless, you said "struck down.
The fact that one cannot pull the sword, because it is
only the perpetrator knows.
Why did you know that he struck him down?
We... Because I had seen the body on the spot. That's enough now.
Just before they came, the body had been covered.
They didn't have a chance to see the body directly.
D... that... I just suspected it!
The blood splatters gave me the idea that he had been knocked out!
Anyway! I had nothing to do with the murder!
You're really pushy.
I wonder how he will behave after this shock?
Now we have to...
...check out the venue.
Yes. I did some research earlier. It's going to be quite a hassle.
But the area is really huge!
What's that building in the middle of the cliff?
The Satsuki Hall.
- Satsuki? That's... - Yes.
It's called that because Achiwa-san built it in memory of his wife Satsuki.
I see. And you can only go up once a year
Achiwa-san, the reader, and the two contestants in the finals.
Cameras and microphones installed in the hall broadcast the competition to the audience.
into the auditorium, which is separated from the hall by the river.
Really quite over the top...
A climate system
keeps the temperature and humidity in the competition hall constant.
Noise barriers around the hall exclude all ambient noise.
Only the most modern systems were installed.
Truly an ideal competition venue, built with only the game of karuta in mind!
- I'm hungry! - Shall we go to a buffet?
I want to eat cake!
- Alright, let's go. - Have a good time.
Thanks, Ran.
- Ran! - Let's go already!
See you later!
- Ciao! - Take care!
Thanks for waiting!
- The souvenirs will be sold out soon! - Come on, back to practice!
Wait a minute.
Get some sleep or you won't make it to the competition!
I can do it!
Wha... Kazuha, you can't let Shizuka-san, the former queen.
Shizuka-san, the former queen, train you?
- Yes! - That's great!
Then it could be that you, that you...
So let's go back to the room and continue training!
If you want to train so much... You wanna play me sometime?
I don't think you'll make it to the finals.
What are you saying?!
You rest, Kazuha-chan.
Aunt Shizuka!
I'll play you. Or am I not good enough for you?
Shizuka Ikenami, the former queen! Why did you...
So? Will you grant me a game?

If you're so insistent, I'd love to!
Achiwa-san and Sekine?
They want to go to Achiwa Complex, the venue of the tournament tomorrow,
and hold a rehearsal there.
A police escort will accompany them there, so they will be safe.
But at the Achiwa complex itself, things are probably different.
Where is Momiji-san?
Don't worry. She lives in Kyoto, too. They will be traveling together.
Ah, sorry, a phone call...
I know who the man in the photo is..,
in the photo you sent.
- What? Really? - And it's quite surprising.
I emailed you the details.
- Check them out later. - Thank you! Oh yeah!
- Huh? - How's it going with the cards?
I just put them into the analysis program.
The good professor...
We'll know in an hour what card the victim was holding.
Good. Please let me know as soon as the analysis is complete.
Okay.
Really...
HERE IS NAGORO'S PROFILE
Shikao Nagoro...
I've had a really good time for the first time in a long time. Thank you.
- Let's go back, Iori. - Let's go back, Iori.
But you've got guts, girl!
You want to enter the tournament, and you're already stunned by this!
Remember, my name is Momiji, "red autumn leaves."
I'm not just a blank slate like you.
- Leaf?! - That's enough now!
I won't pay any attention to an amateur like you either.
Once I underestimated an amateur and suffered a humiliating defeat.
I never want to go through that bad experience again!
That's why I'll give it my all, as best I can!
There... that's fine with me!
Let's end the subject of "Karuta" now. Is it okay for you to be here?
I'm sure the president is worried about you.
Thank you for your concern. But I'm safe.
After all, the detective of the West, Heiji Hattori, is by my side!
What do you mean?
Oh! Haven't you heard anything about it? Heiji-kun is my bodyguard!
What?!
He was standing guard outside my house yesterday, too, without a wink of sleep!
Well, I'll be going now. I'm looking forward to the tournament tomorrow.
Heiji really is a jack of all trades!
Hey, Kazuha! Are you okay?
Heiji!!!
I don't know what's going on between you two,
but I'm gonna kick her ass at the tournament!
You'll see, Heiji!!!
Good. Very well said!
What's wrong, Hattori?
I don't know why, but I just got a chill down my spine.
Did you catch a cold?
A cold? It wasn't that harmless!
It's something ominous!
Oh, there they are!
President Achiwa,
Momiji Ooka
and Sekine.
All three together.
No?!
Sekine's car is...
PREFECTURAL POLICE
So?
What's Sekine-san's condition?
According to the hospital, he hasn't regained consciousness yet.
There's a 50-50 chance he'll survive.
But Ooka-kun, who was also involved in the explosion, is okay?
I don't think she was injured,
but to be on the safe side, she and her driver are still being examined at the hospital.
After all, after this event, you'll have to explain the circumstances to us in detail,
Achiwa-san.
The explosion at Nichiuri TV... We suspect that they, too, are in fact targeting
the Satsuki Wharf.
Tell me, uncle...
Who is this Shikao Nagoro?
K... Kid! Where did you get this photo?
Your excitement shows that you must have some idea.
If you know something, would you please tell us exactly,
Achiwa-san?
In Kyoto, there was a karuta association called Nagoro-Kai.
Its attitude was very elitist,
and its members, not 20 people, trained very hard every month.
Shikao Nagoro was the leader of this club.
He was very talented and it was
only a matter of time before he would challenge the grandmaster.
But he was incredibly ambitious, and, frankly,
his karuta game could not be called beautiful.
Hey, I beat you to it! This card is mine, all right?
You want me to have touched the wrong card? What are you looking at?
Five years ago, Nagoro-kun...
...he challenged Satsuki, our president at the time, to a competition...
On the condition that the loser would disband his club.
What? That's like a dôjô assault!
But she didn't have to accept the challenge, did she?
Nagoro-kun had informed the media, so Satsuki had no choice.

Said the Satsuki-Kai would want to avoid a fight out of fear.
I see. He pushed them into the position of having to accept the challenge.
And how did the fight turn out?
The match did not take place.
Nagoro-kun didn't show up at the appointed time.
This was considered a challenge, Satsuki was declared the winner.
and Nagoro-kun was henceforth considered a stain on the karuta world,
who had fled from a fight despite the media hype he had caused.
He disappeared from the public stage.
And what about Nagoro-san and the Nagoro-Kai today?
The association was dissolved for lack of a president. Nagoro-san himself remained
remained lost to this day.
Do you think
...Nagoro might have done this as a revenge against Satsuki Kai?
I don't know. Only... It was Yajima-kun who, at that time, was the most insistent
to dissolve the Nagoro Kai.
What are you saying?
We at Satsuki Kai
would have preferred to finish the job quietly and without any fuss.
But that was not possible.
What happened to the Nagoro Kai members?
Those who wanted to were allowed to join the Satsuki Kai, of course.
However, only two of them entered.
Were these two...
Yes, they were Ooka-kun and Sekine-kun.
The two who were caught in the explosion earlier?
Yes. Ooka-kun had been studying Nagoro-kun's technique
in Nagoro-Kun's technique and continued to develop her skills.
She has the same favorite cards as he does.
And they both never missed the six with autumn leaves motif.
Momiji was, in fact, his first and best student.
Why are the autumn leaves cards Nagoro's favorite?
Because his name, Shikao, means "deer man."
Deer meat?
Yes. Deer meat is also called "Momiji," autumn leaves.
That his favorite student is now active in the Satsuki Kai,
is certainly not amusing for Nagoro.
But why only now?
And why did he send a bomb threat by mail on purpose?
We don't know the reason for his five-year silence yet.
But did he perhaps mean this mail as a hint that he had come back?
That means...
We must consider these incidents as revenge of Shikao Nagoro at Satsuki Wharf?
Excuse me.
What is it? Yes.
I think we should set up a joint investigation committee with Kyoto.
- Yes... - What?!
President Hattori! Sekine-san's smartphone received
right before the explosion!
Strange message?
The sender is unknown, and there was only one attachment to the mail:
a photo of a Karuta card!
And what does this card say?
"Hast hindered me,
to bring sacrificial silk on this journey. Take instead of it
the brocade..."
- One of Nagoro's favorite cards! - What?
- What's wrong, Hei-chan? - I have to find out something right away!
Momiji is in danger!
Iori-san?
That voice... Hattori-sama?
Yes. Please find out if there was a message
if there was a message on Momiji's phone without a sender!
A mail?
- What is it, Iori? - Hattori-sama's on the phone.
Heiji-kun?
Put him on, please, Iori!
Momiji, is that you? Please check your mail right away!
My mail? What's going on?
Let me tell you how happy I am to get your call!
Oh! What is this mail?
Just an attachment...
A Karuta card?
Wow! How did you know?
What kind? Read it!
Okay...
"The colorful foliage, blown down from the stormy mountain Mimuro..."
Momiji! Listen to me! You can't stay here alone tonight!
Don't go home! Come to the prefectural police immediately!
Do you understand?
Even if you ask me to, I can't.
I have to prepare for the Cup tomorrow.
Don't say that! Someone's out to get you!
I'm safe. Because I have you, Heiji-kun!
You'll protect me, right? Won't you?
I haven't forgotten your promise.
- Promise? - I'll see you later!
That idiot! She hung up!
- So she received a Karuta mail as well? - Yes.
Otaki! Strengthen Momiji Ooka's protection at once!
Yes!
That means that Yajima-san alone was not sent a karuta card....
There was a karuta message at the scene of Yajima-san's murder, wasn't there?
In other words, the real perpetrator, Nagoro, after the murder
his favorite card after the murder and then left the crime scene.
But Sekine, who came after him, covered this trace again.

I see... Sekine realized from this news that Nagoro was the murderer,
devastated the house and faked a robbery..,
to conceal his master's crime.
You mean that Sekine-kun was at the scene of the crime before the police?
Yes. That's very likely.
And we had photos of the crime scene analyzed.
- Based on the orientation and shape of the blood splatter... - Okay.
...we were able to deduce how they were arranged at the time of the crime.
Look here.
On the right are the cards that have blood on them because they were on the ground.
On the left are the clean cards and the ones with blood on them,
because they were mixed in with the other cards afterwards.
Inferred from the deformations of the cards with little blood on them,
Yajima-san was holding this card.
Poem number 32
by Harumichi no Tsuraki!
"The weir that the wind has built in the mountain stream, look, it is built
Of red foliage that, dammed, would not drift on."
So also at Yajima-san was one of Nagoro-san's favorite cards!
These are the cards that have been used so far.
From top left: at Nichiuri TV.
At Yajima-san.
At Sekine-san.
And at Momiji-san, as it turned out just now.
On all of these cards, colorful autumn leaves are mentioned.
So they were all favorite cards of Nagoro.
So we have to assume that the real killer is Shikao Nagoro.
I never thought Nagoro could be responsible for all this.
What worries me: There are a total of six cards with an autumn leaf motif,
which Nagoro is said to have never missed.
What do you mean?
That there are two cards left.
If Nagoro really uses the cards to point to himself as the culprit,
then he won't just leave two of them unused.
Besides Ooka-kun, who else...?
The question is: Who is the target of the two cards?
That's what we have to find out, otherwise we won't be able to prevent the deeds.
It seems to me that you're capable of stopping Nagoro before the police do.
Yes, but we need more information.
What happened between you and Nagoro-san five years ago?
- D... that... - Something happened, didn't it?
We don't believe "nothing."
You are right. Before, I couldn't say anything. But with you, I guess I can.
Come to my hotel room later.
I'll tell you exactly what happened that day.
So, kids, wait here a minute.
I'll take this to Momiji-san.
- Yahaaa! - We're waiting for you! - Yes!
Miss, I just got a call from the police.
They want to put more surveillance on your house.
Yes, fine by me.
Excuse me!
Momiji-san? My name is Môri, I called earlier.
Ah, it was you!
Thank you so much for bringing it to me!
No, it's... It's yours, isn't it?
It's yours, isn't it?
Thank you very much. It's like a talisman for me.
I don't know how else I'll get through tomorrow.
But now everything will be fine!
But for you, I guess it's like giving the enemy an advantage.
Don't!
I hope your girlfriend doesn't hurt her fingers during practice.
Your nails are pretty!
Ah, they are used to protect my fingertips.
I always wear them except when I'm training, because fingers decide the game.
Now that you mention it...
Oh yeah... I looked in when I was trying to find your address.
And there in a photo...
Do you mean this one?
- Who's the boy? - It's Heiji-kun.
So it is.
It's from a karuta competition where I lost to Heiji-kun.
When I was crying because I lost, Heiji-kun said to me...
Don't cry!
I won't do it next time just because you'll be my wife!
Wha... Really?
Yes.
I promise.
What?!
You really proposed?
That's why Heiji-kun is my future husband.
A... but a promise you make to yourself when you're a child...
Whether you're a child or an adult!
A real man can't go back on his word so easily! Right?
To understand exactly the heart of the woman you love....
You're right...
"Like the river's course, shallow and swift, dammed up, divided by rocks,
yet always reunites, so I want to see you again."
Our bodies are separated,
but our hearts are joined... I firmly believed in that.
Tell the leaf girl...
Leaf girl?

I won't let anyone take a card I want.
My master taught me that.
Momiji-san...
Ran-chan!
What are you dreaming about? You've been really weird ever since you went sightseeing in Osaka!
I'm sorry, Ran-chan.
But, how are you?
Oh... Heiji's mom said I had to pick a favorite card..,
if I wanted to win the competition.
But I can't find one that suits me...
Do you have to think about it like that?
There are many love poems in "Hyakunin Isshu."
So don't think about the contest or anything,
but choose one you like and can relate to!
Love, what...
If I had to choose, I would choose...
This.
"A chance meeting..." That's by Murasaki Shikibu, isn't it?
It's about a long-lost friend who disappears right away.
Yeah. I meet him once and he disappears again.
And I have so much to tell him!
You're right... If that's the case,
I'll take...
"I hide it,
yet my love is clear in my face,
so that people ask, "What are you looking at?"
Love you just can't hide....
That fits you perfectly!
Momiji-san noticed it right away, too.
But why is she so firmly convinced?
She pretends to be engaged to Heiji!
- You think so too, don't you? - Ah, yes...
I can't tell her that
Hattori-kun proposed to Momiji-san when she was a kid!
What?!
Nagoro came the day before to compete with Satsuki-san?
Is that true?
Yes. While I was out of the house.
This article says,
Nagoro fled for fear of competing with Satsuki,
but in fact he came the day before.
But why the day before?
We can't know until we ask him ourselves. But maybe
he wanted to defeat them with the Satsuki Kai cards, as Satsuki himself suspected.
They took those cards?
But those cards are usually kept in the museum, aren't they?
At that time we were not afraid of theft and kept them with us.
But you can't hold a duel without a reader, can you?
There are many cassette tapes on the shelf.
In those days, they were used to practice playing karuta.
And how did the duel end?
Satsuki won hands down
According to Satsuki, he had no chance against her.
I remember when I came home..,
he rushed out of our front door, face white as a sheet.
That was the last time I saw him.
Why didn't you tell the police?
Then there would have been a risk that the media and members would find out about it.
If it became known that we used the tickets for a personal duel,
there would be a lot of resentment in the club.
Well, I understand this objection yes, but....
It's not that I don't trust the police, but....
Why does this photo feel wrong?
Because it's a different car than Achiwa-san is driving today?
Please stop Nagoro as soon as possible.
Yes. You can count on us.
Ran-chan! Two is not enough.
Put two more in, please.
- My brain is craving for sweets right now. - O... okay.
Did she hear that?
That girl...
Not good. I can't guard or pass well enough.
and I can't see the play in front of me. If it stays like this...
she'll steal Heiji... Heiji!
What's wrong, Kazuha?
You're scowling!
Heiji!
- Did you have a fight with someone? - Shut up, idiot!
You're her bodyguard. Go back to her!
What are you doing? I wanted to practice with you
I wanted to practice with you. I've never lost to you at karuta!
That was in elementary school! Now you're no match for me.
Say, Hattori-kun,
Do you really not remember that tournament?
For example, do you remember the girl you beat?
Yes, I remember! That's right,
Kazuha! It was at the karuta tournament!
When you spontaneously competed and won?
Yes! There was this girl,
who lost and was crying loudly. That was Momiji Ooka!
I see. That was her?
And you don't remember?
Remember what?
That you promised her something back then or something...
I told her something like, "Just give it your all next time."
Anyway, Heiji, go back to her.
You have to protect her, right?
- That's what the police... - Anyway, go!

If she gets injured before the tournament, I can't compete against her.
You think so? Fine, I'll do it. Mom!
- I'll leave the rest to you. - I'll leave the rest to you.
"I hide it,
yet my love is clear in my face,
so that people ask:
What are you looking so absorbed in?"
Nagoro-sensei...
Please give me strength this year too!
Please watch over me,
Satsuki...

KAIHÔ
The autumn wind blows coldly...
Kazuha
- has the card! - Because she's wearing something completely different,
- you'll recognize her right away! - Yes!
That's her Aikido suit, isn't it?
No way. Apparently, it has to go somewhere with Heiji-san.
Got it!
Let's send him the picture of Genta-kun at the souvenir store!
After we got bitched at?
The former capital of Nara's cherries...
It's begun.
Yes.
As strict as the guard is,
Nagoro won't make it in.
No. And not only Nagoro:
Anyone not registered as personnel
will not be allowed in.
The investigation beforehand went perfectly.
We won't let Nagoro in.
What's wrong?
Oh, it's nothing.
Who do you think it is?
Well, it's Mitsuhiko.
Really, what's Genta doing?
Clutching his head like an eagle...
Oh, I see!
You gave your word, giving hope like the dew...
ACHIWA COMPLEX SITUATION PLAN
DISASTER RESPONSE SYSTEM
PLEASE ENTER PASSWORD
SYSTEM IS OFFLINE
Momiji is, of course, the first to finish...
And Kazuha?
Probably not yet.
That's her!
- That's her! That's Kazuha! - Whoo-hoo!
Kazuha-chan made it!
She made it past the first round. That was a pretty good start.
Sekine-san? Sekine-san!
KAZUHA TÔYAMA MOMIJI ÔOKA
Thank you very much.
- This girl advancing to the finals... - Yes!
What a surprise! That there is still such a talent!
It's amazing!
- I wonder if she can win. - Of course she can!
Great, Kazuha! Keep it up, then the victory is yours!
I wonder if she realizes that..,
If she beats Momiji-san, she'll have to confess her love to Hattori-kun.
Kazuha is really doing her best...
- And now she's going to face Momiji-san. - Yes.
What?!
Sekine-san has come to consciousness? Yes! So? So it was really like that?
Good! I'll leave this to the Kyoto people and come back.
- Has Sekine-san woken up? - Yes, it seems so.
It was all as you suspected, Hei-chan.
But why did Sekine-san go to Yajima-san in the first place?
Yajima-san was said to have been looking for Nagoro lately.
Sekine-san noticed that and
Yajima-san, hoping for a clue to the whereabouts of his master.
of the whereabouts of his master.
Then he noticed that something was wrong, and he discovered the body?
Probably.
Anything else, I want to ask Sekine-san in Osaka myself.
All right, leave this to us.
- Yes. - Ah, please wait! I'm coming with you!
This is the last one...
But why do you think it's necessary to bring the dynamite here?
- There's smoke! - A fire?
That would set off the alarm system!
- Is there a bomb... - Hey, don't joke!
What's that noise?
- What's in the forest on the west side? - Ah, there
is just an old storage shed...
What does the camera show?
- There is none outside the complex. - What are you saying?
Hey! The smoke, is that...
Yeah. Let's go!
That's the Satsuki Hall we're going to now.
What's that smell?
Ah...
The elevator was recently serviced.
That's the smell of the oil used. Does it bother you?
No, no, it's not that. Maybe I'm just too excited.
Yeah, you get really nervous. How do you feel?
I didn't think I would actually make it here,
so I'm crazy excited. Not like you.
Don't. My heart is pounding all the way to my throat.
What do you think Heiji-kun will say..,
...when I tell him that I love him? I'm so worried...
I can't lose. I can't lose, no matter what!
Don't come any closer!
- What's going on? - Commissioner!
An explosion?
Yes. A victim. The body was badly damaged,

so that we can't identify them right away.
Understand.
The question is when and how
the bomb was planted here.
Given the circumstances, the victim could have planted the bomb himself...
What?!
Nagoro accidentally blows himself up?
Yes, sir!
Yes? Ayanokôji speaking.
What's wrong, Kudô?
Hattori, take a look at this.
What's that?
- A finger ring? - Yes, it's a finger ring. Probably the victim's.
What's wrong, you two?
Here, this ring may have belonged to the victim.
- It's a pretty big ring... - Yeah, you don't see rings that big very often.
A big finger ring... Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Tôgo Kaieda!
Kaieda? You mean Achiwa-san's former secretary?
Yes, no doubt. This ring
Kaieda-san wore on his thumb!
- And this Kaieda is the real culprit? - No!
If we hadn't found the ring, we would have assumed that it was Nagoro.
In other words:
This explosion is to pretend that Nagoro died.
Wait a minute. If Nagoro is to be considered dead at this point,
the last two cards should have already been sent to someone!
Not two more.
Ôtaki-san just called.
Achiwa-san's secretary checked his mails again.
He got a mail this morning with one karuta card.
That means there is only one card left?
Only one card left. And only the final...
Got it!
That Achiwa-san has already received his means there's only one left.
And that it hadn't been decided yet to whom this card should be sent!
Oh no... Inspector! Examine Kazuha Toyama's smartphone immediately!
Huh? Yes...
But what does that mean?
Why wasn't the last card sent out?
Because it was not yet known who would advance to the finals!
That means that the target
is the three people in Satsuki Hall!
I really don't like it...
Please both give everything you can and show us a wonderful fight!
Thank you very much!
The flowers are blooming at the port of Naniwa....
One, two... Give it your all!!!
Kazuha-chan, show us what you're capable of!
And?
Did you get a Karuta mail?
Yes. About 15 minutes ago,
one of Nagoro's favorite cards.
There really is one.
Have them cancel the finals immediately! Got it?
- This way, Kudô! - Hey, where to...
The bike's faster!
What? Stop the finals? J... Yes! Got it!
I'll leave the room immediately...
What's that?
Probably an earthquake. We don't have to worry about that.
We'll just...
What do you think happened?
- Is something broken? - What's all this...
- Power failure? - No, the lights are on.
Damn!
It's started!
Hold on tight!
Hattori!
How are you going to get up there?
Trust me. I've got an idea.
You don't mean...
Even in those times...
I'm telling you!
She didn't budge.
So she gives up my favorite cards in advance....
Tormented by longing...
What is this, why is it burning so fiercely right away?
It must have been ignited with a fuel!
Hasn't the fire department arrived yet?
The roads here are narrow, the fire engine can't get through!
And the emergency response system was also offline...
Yes.
So all is lost...
Tell me, do you still think Nagoro-san is the culprit?
No. Only one man could have killed Kaieda,
who had left Satsuki Kai, could register as staff again.
and hand over the bomb to him.
The president Kensuke Achiwa.
I wonder if he plans to take them to their deaths with him.
There's no way I'm going to let that happen!
The card I'm having the hardest time getting to.... Momiji-san knows it too.
That this is my favorite card!
That's the card you want, isn't it?
But I won't give it to you. If I protect it, I win!
I'll get it. I'll get it at any cost! I must get it!
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Don't make a sound, get out of my ears!
What's wrong, Kazuha? You're scowling!
Did you have a fight with someone?
I'm sorry!
Yes. I'm not allowed to argue. No!
The sound of the air-conditioning, the rustling of kimonos, the sound of cards..,
the soft breaths... And the heartbeat in my chest!
You are all my friends! You can come inside me!
Thank you very much.
I catch the right sound!
Like Inaba's mountain pines, I'll be right back.
I...

The incidents were meant to make us think that Nagoro-san was taking revenge on Satsuki wharf like that.
That was the scenario imagined by Achiwa.
Five years ago, for some reason, Nagoro-san appeared the day before the arranged fight
before the arranged fight and there was a trial fight.
According to Achiwa-san, Satsuki-san won that fight, but something is
something is suspicious about it.
The photo in the newspaper article, right?
Yes. In the portrait of Achiwa-san,
that he washed the car before Satsuki-san's matches.
In the photo, it was dirty!
He did not wash it before this important match,
because he knew Nagoro-san would not come!
Since that farewell, when you looked at me, so cool....
It seemed to me that I was a little faster.
No. I was the faster one.
Aren't you the one who knows best which one of us
who was faster?
That they would drag the fight on to the showdown....
If Satsuki-san lost that preliminary fight five years ago..,
wouldn't that be a motive?
Yes. To preserve the honor of the club, they silenced Nagoro-san.
And when he saw the cards with the proof on them,
Yajima-san realized Achiwa-san's crime!
But what kind of proof do you think it is?
What if he unconsciously grabbed a stack that had blood on it with his hand?
Yes! Fingerprints!
I didn't realize it either until I saw this photo.
There must be Achiwa-san's fingerprints on the cards!
That's why Yajima-san suggested the Satsuki-kai special to the TV station,
to capture the Satsuki Kai cards, the proof, on film!
Yes, and that's why the bombing and murder of Yajima-san
and Yajima-san's murder happened at the same time!
You are right. But why...
Why does he continue his crimes until the finale here in the Achiwa complex?
And if in the hall where the finale takes place,
Nagoro-san's body is also there?
The hall would indeed be the ideal hiding place....
So he has planned the crimes from the beginning...
But even if he would present Nagoro-san perfectly as the culprit...
If his body would be discovered, everything would have been in vain!
- There he is! - Yes!
Ah, such is the way of love!
- Your heart... - An empty card!
- The flames are already so high! - We must go down!
But how? And we must extinguish the fire!
No time to hesitate!
You just think about how we're going to put out the fire!
Are you going to...
No?!
Let's go, Kudo!
Go, go!
What was that?
Okay... Now blow yourself up!
Hurry up! Make it in time!
What? Is it on fire?
Stop! Stay where you are!
Heiji?!
Why are you here?
- The water's diverted! - A miracle!
- The fire is dying! - Well?
What's going on?
I made it in time...
You're really good, Kudô...
Heiji-kun, what's going on?
I told you, it's dangerous here!
What? Conan, too...
What are you doing? Why are you two here?

Maybe we should ask Achiwa-san.
What do you mean by that?
Please both step back behind me.
Why would we do that?
Achiwa-san... It would be bad if we
to examine these cards, would it?
Now tell me, Heiji, what are you talking about all the time?
We want to check our answers to the incidents with that gentleman there.
What?
Everything began
exactly one year ago, when Momiji won the victory here in this place.
The arrangement of her deck at that time
was very similar to the one her master had played with in a certain competition.
Yes, I play as offensively as he does, and our favorite cards are the same.
But it
would have to be a pretty big coincidence for...
And that coincidence is exactly what happened.
Those black spots on the sides of the cards....
Yajima-san noticed that they had suddenly appeared five years ago.
What are those black marks?
Fingerprints of someone who had Nagoro-san's blood on his hands.
Nagoro-san's blood?
Nagoro-san, who disappeared without a trace five years ago, was killed then.
But that...
And the owner of those fingerprints is the real killer of Nagoro-san.
I have lost. I will confess everything.
But in return.
to refrain from using the cards as evidence?
The Satsuki Kai would be...
So that's how it was!
There was something I didn't understand until now.
But your behavior now explains everything.

The fingerprints on the cards are not yours, right?
Yes, they are mine! They are definitely mine!
In fact.
you and Kaieda-san were responsible for the recent incidents.
But the murder of Nagoro-san five years ago, the trigger,
was not committed by you!
It was Satsuki-san, wasn't it?
At the sight of that scene, I understood immediately.
That Nagoro had challenged her and Satsuki had lost.
As a reader, they used a tape cassette like the one I stored there.
Do you understand what that means?
Satsuki had heard this cassette countless times!
Of course, it was just one tape out of many,
but she knew the sequence of cards by heart to a certain extent.
So she was at an overwhelming advantage!
And yet, Satsuki lost.
Nagoro's skill had far exceeded our expectations.
What enormous fear Satsuki must have felt....
It was certain that she would suffer a heavy defeat the next day.
And this fear drove her to commit the crime.
After that, Satsuki lost all human emotions
and gradually withdrew from the management of Satsuki Kai.
And two years later, she succumbed to illness.
This is the truth. Please understand me.
- No! - Don't do it!
Everything is Nagoro's fault.
If he hadn't embarrassed her like that,
- it would never have... - He didn't mean to embarrass her!
Nagoro-sensei went to see her the day before!
Nagoro-sensei had told me once before...
When I asked him why he hated Satsuki-Kai so much.
Hate, you mean? From the outside, I guess it will indeed seem that way....
But I have to do it to compete with her.
I just want to win and be praised with a "You're great!".
From my first love...
E... first love?
Yes. He said he started playing karuta out of admiration for her.
But now his doctors gave his eyesight only one more year....
That's why I think his playing style became so aggressive.
Because he had no more time.
Then he wanted to show her what he could do the day before,
but give her the victory the next day in front of the others?
To find a reason for the Satsuki-Kai to take in his students,
whom he would soon no longer be able to take care of.
So Satsuki-san got him,
unaware of all this, killed him...
Oh... oh no...
What have I done...
Wha... what is this?
Kazuha!
Are you okay?
Yes...
But I can't stand...
Everyone get on the elevator now!
Momiji! Quick, go!
Yes!
Get up, let's go!
Forget about me. Leave me here.
Bullshit!
You can't die yet!
Momiji-san!
Get in!
Yes!
Kazuha!
- Come up here! - Yes...
Hurry up!
Damn it... Just a little more!
Got you!
Got what?
Please, don't...
Don't fall yet!
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!
What the...
No way!!!
- Are you okay? - We're coming!
Hello!
That was close... Hattori!
FIREWORKS
No good! It's about to collapse! Fly away!
What?
Hey? What, Mom... Why?
Wait! Don't fly away!
Heiji!
Kazuha, get on!
Hattori... Kazuha-chan...
Please... Get away!
Heiji! There!
Yes.
What's wrong, Heiji?
Hold on tight!
You're not planning on jumping to that cliff, are you?!
- That's exactly what I'm planning to do. - You're kidding!
What are you thinking? The distance is huge!
Hey, Heiji!
Shouldn't we jump into the pond?
No! If you jump from this height, the water surface will be as hard as concrete!
Hold on tight, Kazuha! If you let go,
I'll kill you!
Okay!
We can't...
die here!
What's that?
Hattori?!
There's something else..,
I have to tell you.
That bike...
Get it!!
Heiji!
Kazuha!
It's okay,
Kazuha?
Yes.
I'm getting tired of these escape thrillers...
Are you okay?
Really, those two...
- For a moment, I wondered how it would end! - Tell me...
What do you have to tell me?
W... What? What are you talking about? What are you talking about?
You said you couldn't die until you told me!
- Ah, you heard wrong. - No! Because of the training
I have super-sharp ears now!
So if you've got something to say, say it!

Wait, no, Mom...
What is it?
- Wait! - What do you want to tell me?
I just want to tell you that...

You're overlapping the two nestling together,

DIRECTOR: Kôbun SHIZUNO
Thank you for coming to see us off!
We are the ones who have to say thank you!
What happened to your karuta club?
Well, the school appreciated that I made it to the finals.
The club is allowed to continue after all.
However, I lost at the very end.
Kazuha-chan...
Come with me.
- What's wrong?
What's wrong?
They just go and whisper!
- Really? - Yes, it's really okay.
"I'm hiding it" I got!
You actually took it as a favorite card!
Oh, not just because of the poem!
But also because of the poet's name!
Taira no Kanemori. The only one among the 100 poets
whose name begins with the same character as Heiji's!
That's why the card can't be any other than Heiji's!
I'll send Heiji a photo of the card later.
With the note: "These are my feelings."
You declare your love by sending "I'm hiding it"?
That would be breaking the rules!
Momiji-san!
Did you just hear that?
You're not the only one with good ears.
Oh, Momiji!
What are you doing here?
Declaring my love like I promised!
However, Heiji-kun has already declared his love for me.
Huh?! What are you talking about?
This is the proof photo of it!
- They're interlocking their fingers! - He really promised her.
If you break your word, you'll have to swallow a thousand needles!
Hey, wait a minute! What am I supposed to have promised?
- "I won't marry you just because you'll be my wife!" - What?!
The most embarrassing moments are really held and held up!
Or do you want to declare this old story undone?
Ah, I remember!
At that time I said:
Don't cry. We'll just compete against each other again someday! And

then I already you not, just because you're a woman! So patience!
Only...
because you're...
a woman?
Yes. She was a girl. I couldn't hurt her.
so I was gentle with her.
Iori...
- Retreat! - Yes, Miss.
So, I'll let it go for today.
But I won't be deprived of a card I want.
So please remember this,
Kazuha-chan!
What?
Does she want to play karuta with Kazuha again?
Did I wake you up?
You know "Hyakunin Isshu," right?
Yes, we often play it at home on New Year's.
After I sent Shin'ichi the card "A Chance Meeting,"
I got "Like the River's Course" in reply.
What does that mean again? I forgot!
"Even though I am now separated from my beloved, someday we will surely meet again.
we will surely meet again." The poem in love is by ex-emperor Sutokuin.
Lucky you!
Hey, stop, Sonoko!
Don't forget something like that, will you?
