DETECTIVE CONAN - THE CROSSING OF THE LABYRINTH
HIS NAME IS SHIN'ICHI KUDÔ
I am high school student detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was with my friend Ran
at the amusement park,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on what was happening
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He administered a poison to me
and when I came to...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked my name,
RANPO EDOGAWA CONAN DOYLE
I said Conan Edogawa.
To go after the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
I am Naniwa's high school detective,
Heiji Hattori.
Logical thinking and the talent for kendô
from my father, the chief of the Ôsaka police.
I get my courage
from mother.
By the way, I got my skin color from my grandfather.
"Hattori of the West" and "Kudô of the East" were what
they used to call us. But...
Ah, typical Kudô!
He uses funny things
from Professor Agasa
and solves one case after another.
Not only the professor and I
know Kudô's identity.
His father and mother.
And his classmate in elementary school, Ai Haibara.
This little miss
once belonged to the men in black.
To escape them,
she swallowed the poison that was also given to Kudo..,
and shrank.
By the way, I also have a sandbox friend.
Her name is Kazuha Tôyama and she is so annoying.
Who's annoying?
H... h... hey!
Don't scare me! Idiot!
You're the idiot! Who are you talking to, anyway?
Who are you talking to? I'm explaining something to the audience!
- Aren't you? - Huh?
Are you crazy all of a sudden?
You're more like it!
I'm small, my mind isn't!
There's always only one truth!
Beika, Beika. The exit...
So you can't go back so fast?
Yes. I'm very busy with a case.
So...
It's gotten cold lately. Don't catch cold!
And you don't sleep with your belly open!
I don't sleep without a belly! Fool!
Mount Yoshino...
Making his way through the snow on the summit.
Do you long for the footprints of a human?
You're not Yoshitsune and Shizuka!
What?
We've known each other so long, it's okay to worry!
Dad's bugging me, I'm hanging up.
H... Hey!
Really.
Next time I'll call when the old man isn't here.
Yoshitsune and Shizuka?
They never saw each other again after they broke up...
Hey, hey!

The investigation revealed
that the five murder victims found in Tôkyô, Ôsaka, and Kyôto
were found
belong to the "Genji Botaru" gang of thieves.
Consequently
- in this case... - Satô-san,
FUMIMARÔ AYANOKÔJI POLICE COMMISSIONER IN KYÔTO
this inspector Ayanokôji from Kyôto
is Commissioner Shiratori's year?
Yes.
They call him "Commissioner Ojaru."
Look, in his left pocket.
W... what's that?
His chipmunk.
He's supposed to carry it with him at all times.
He must be even stranger than Shiratori-kun.
Genji Botaru began making famous Buddha statues and art objects
famous Buddha statues and art objects
especially in Tôkyô,
Ôsaka and Kyôto.
Their trademark is,
is that they bear the names of Yoshitsune's followers...
and carry the "Chronicle of Yoshitsune" with them.
CHRONICLE OF YOSHITSUNE

The leader is Yoshitsune, followed by
Benkei, Saburô Iseno as well as the five members,
who were murdered in this case.
CHRONICLES OF YOSHITSUNE
Their chronicles were taken.
Clues to the perpetrator?
The perpetrator is a master swordsman and bowman.
ÔTAKI POLICE COMMISSIONER IN ÔSAKA
But as for Yoshitsune, Benkei and Saburô Iseno,
we do not know their ages or genders.
However, we are continuing the investigation,
to find the culprit
the perpetrator and the rest of the
and the rest of the gang of thieves as soon as possible.
HOUSE OF THE HATTORI FAMILY
The Yoshitsune of the Heisei era
is the head of a gang of thieves...
Heiji, are you there?
What are you doing?
This is valuable to you!
J... yes, that's right. I should put it away.
Heiji, are you leaving?
Yes, I want to check something.
Huh?
Did you want something?
No.
I thought we were going to see the cherry blossoms.
But it's okay.
I see. Okay, I'm off.
Take care.
Jo!
Why do I have to wave cheerfully?
Kyoto is just home to us Japanese, isn't it!
Listen up! I've brought you along for once.
So don't disturb me while I'm working.
Yes!
Conan-kun's in a good place! He's in Kyoto...
I heard that a temple called Sannôji...
Môri-kun was hired by a temple called Sannôji.
Pff. We want to go to Kyoto, too!
I could take you there.
- Really? - We're going to meet Conan-kun!
Today is a beautiful day,
- Tomorrow is... - But only if you solve my riddle.
- Oh, no. - They won't take us anyway.
Why not?
Just try it.
Maybe it's entertaining.
- What do we do? - Let's try it!
J... That's right!
Does "Benkei" mean anything to you?
Yeah. He's one of Yoshitsune's henchmen.
Hey, who's Yoshitsune?
His name was Ushiwakamaru when he was a child. On Gojo Bridge in Kyoto...
he defeated Benkei, who wanted his sword,
and made him his retainer.
This was Yoshitsune Minamoto.
At that time, the Genji were fighting against the Taira.
Yoshitsune defeated the Taira,
but his brother Yoritomo hated him.
HIRAIZUMI
and he committed suicide
at the Koromo River in Hiraizumi in present-day Iwate Prefecture.
Hey, you know all about it.
And here's the question!
Benkei's first love was named Uzune.
But the girl was married off to someone else.
What did Benkei do when he found out?
1. he got angry?
2. he was happy.
3. he cried.
Well, what?
So first love...
Of course he got angry!
As if you would be happy about that!
So you take answer 1, "he got angry," right?
He cried.
The answer is third. He wept.
I'm sure it's about "Benkei's weak point."
I'm no match for you, Ai-kun.
Benkei's weak point?
Even someone as strong as Benkei..,
has a spot that can hurt enough to make you cry.
Here. The shin is Benkei's weak spot.
But what does all this have to do
to do with the riddle?
Ah, well, to wit.
I've got it!
The groom and Uzune-san are getting married.
Both words together make shin!
GROOM (MUKO) + UZUNE = SHIN (MUKOUZUNE)
Another bad joke.
But we solved the riddle.
We can go to Kyôto!
Well, but Ai-kun was the one....
Haibara-san is
a member of the Detective Boys, too!
You can't just exclude her from us!
Mom says that I shouldn't become an adult..,
who doesn't keep promises!
Thank you.
Yes, thank you.
SANNÔ-TEMPLE
But don't, this should stay between us.
RYÛEN (34) PRIEST AT SANNÔ TEMPLE
Oh, Môri-san!
Thank you for coming all this way.
I am Ryûen, who spoke to you on the phone.
Let me introduce you.
This is Enkai, the head priest.
ENKAI (65) HEAD PRIEST AT SANNÔ TEMPLE
These three support our temple.

Shôzô Sakura-san.
He runs an art store in Teramachi.
Are you the famous Kogoro Môri-san?
What? Am I that famous?
SHUNTARÔ MIZUO (33) NÔ-ACTOR
Next to him is the young founder of the Mizuo style
Shuntarô Mizuo-san.
And this is Taiga Saijô-san, who runs an antique shop.

TAIGA SAIJÔ (35) ANTIQUARIAN
Nice to meet you.
Well, but we are also kendô sports comrades.
Oha! You all do kendô?!
That's why you all look so hale and hearty!
Hm. Kendô sports comrades.
By the way,
I heard that there is a Buddha here,
that is only exhibited every 12 years.
Yes!
This is the Buddha of healing.
The day after tomorrow is the exhibition, isn't it?
We are really looking forward to it.
Oh, how nice.
I'm sure the Yakushi-sama would have been pleased.
What?
The statue was stolen?
Yes. It's been eight years already.
BODHISATTVA OF SUNLIGHT
On the right is the Bodhisattva
of Sunlight on the right and that of Moonlight on the left.
BODHISATTVA OF THE MOONLIGHT
In the center should have been the Buddha of Healing. However.
I immediately wanted to alert the police,
but the head priest stopped me.
If fate
wills it, she will return to us, he said.
How careless...
Eight years went by.
And five days ago I found this in the mailbox.
TO THE SANNÔ TEMPLE
No stamp.
And no return address.
IF THE RIDDLE OF THE PICTURE IS SOLVED, THE LOCATION OF THE STATUE WILL BE KNOWN.
"If the riddle of the
of the picture is solved, the location of the statue is known."
What kind of picture is this?
IMBISS JIRÔ
Thank you.
It was too early in the morning for there to be any witnesses.
Stop the thief!
Get away!
Ouch! You'll pay for this!
That was Benkei's weak spot.
That hurt!
Here. This is yours, isn't it?
Thank you.
You did very well.
No kidding. Don't mention it.
My name is Tae Yamakura. I run a restaurant in the Miyagawa district.
TAE YAMAKURA (52), MANAGER OF A GEISHA RESTAURANT IN MIYAGAWA DISTRICT
a teahouse.
Come, give him yours too.
CHIKASUZU (19) GEISHA TRAINEE
Yes, I am Chikasuzu.
CHIKASUZU
It's a pleasure to meet you.
How can I thank you?
Oh. I haven't done anything special.
Then please come and visit us sometime.
Get home safely.
Thank you.
What's the deal with this picture?
At the top of the fifth step, there's a cicada..,
a tengu and a goldfish.
On the fourth step, you can see a rooster and....
A loach?
A yellow loach? That's disgusting!
I wonder what that dot means?
I'm sure it's a stain.
Between levels two and three are
a violet, a tengu, and Fuji-san.
There's an acorn next to it!
Say, Pop,
can you find it in time?
K... don't worry!
A picture like this is not a difficult puzzle for me after all!
Hey, hey! Are you serious?
Come on, let's leave the search for the statue
to the professionals and take a look at Kyoto!
Yes, do that.
If you're here, you'll only be a nuisance.
You know, I talked to Kazuha-chan on the phone.
She's going to show us Kyôto tomorrow.
But she's not taking Hattori-kun with her. He's already busy.
That's okay. He has a girlfriend, after all!
So he's not coming...
- Conan-kun, you're coming too, right? - No, I'll pass.
I'm going fishing with some local kids.
Oh, you've made friends already?
- But be careful. - J... yes.
There's no doubt that Genji Botaru
stole the Buddha statue.
But...
who brought this picture to what?
And what does it have to do with the five murders?
Genji Botaru.
Yoshitsune and Benkei...
It must be this place.
GOJÔ OOHASHI
Nothing here seems to have anything to do with the picture puzzle.
On the Gojô Bridge in Kyôto
the tall Benkei
raised his long sword,
aimed at Ushiwakamaru and struck!
H... Hattori!
To meet you here...
God must have been joking!
Huh?
Hey! Give me back my shinai!
Sure. Sorry. Thank you.
- Come on, let's go! - Yes!
Practice hard!
Borrow a shinai...
Say, what are you doing here?
I could ask you the same thing.
The old guy from the diner who was killed in Osaka..,
is an acquaintance of mine.
He was probably a member of a gang of thieves.
I've been going there since middle school.
He has always been good to me.
So I want to find the culprit and avenge him.
So you went to Kyoto
to look for clues about the culprit.
In that case, I have something for you.
Huh?
That's how it is.
If you solve the riddle,
you find the statue
and maybe even the killer himself.

Therefore, you are...
Yes.
If Genji Botaru stole the statue,
I was hoping that places connected with Yoshitsune..,
might provide clues to solving the mystery, I hoped.
But I don't know my way around here.
Then leave everything else to me.
I will guide you!
GOJÔ TENJIN
The Gojô Tenjin Shrine.
According to the chronicle
the two met here, not on the bridge.
So?
Do you see any connection?
No, it doesn't look like it.
Then we'll keep going.
- But I don't like it. - Huh?
Why didn't the priest from Sannô Temple hire me?
I'm the most famous detective in Kansai.
I'm sure that's because..,
I didn't want the police to find out.
Your father is a bigwig in the police force.
Hm. Well, never mind.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Now that he says that...
We're here. Here it is.
BENKEI STONE
Benkei Stone?
They say Benkei used to rest on this stone.
Or he threw it from Mount Hiei.
There are different legends.
The place doesn't seem to fit either.
It doesn't? Let's move on to the next one.
Where to now?
To "Keage Incline."
Ayanokôji of the Kyôto Police.
It looks like you're investigating the Genji Botaru case.
But this isn't Osaka.
Amateurs don't get involved!
A chipmunk...
Do we understand each other?
Weird cops are everywhere, I guess.
Yes.
KIYOMIZU TEMPLE
- I'll take your picture! - In front of the cherry blossoms!
How beautiful!
Ah, such a beautiful view...
...I'd like to enjoy with Makoto-san...
with Makoto-san. That would be great!
Oh, my God! Ran!
That was the revenge.
What's wrong?
Kazuha-chan, did you have a fight with Hattori-kun?
To be honest,
Heiji is in Kyoto because of a case.
But Kyôto is also where his first love lives.
KEAGE-INCLINE-SOSUI-PARK
YOSHITSUNE DAINICHI TATHAGATA
Probably a failure, too.
Shall we have lunch?
Okay.
Cherry blossoms...
Huh?
When I see cherry blossoms, I always think of that one thing...
eight years ago.
I was exploring the temples of Kyoto..,
when I jumped at a lattice window.
The grate broke and I hit my head
my head on the ground
and lost consciousness.
I don't know how long I lay there like that,
but when I came to...
Past Hatchô, the Tôji way.
Kujô, at Tôji the destination is reached.

The story is really true.
I'm sure I'll run into her again someday.
Hey! What are you laughing at?
I'm sorry. Go on.
Whenever I'm in Kyoto, I always have this with me.
A crystal ball.
The shape looks familiar.
Really? Do you know anyone who has one?
No.
So, does your girlfriend know?
Girlfriend?
Ah, you mean Kazuha!
No details, but she knows.
Actually, she found out when...
An interview in a magazine?
Yes. This information magazine is totally famous in Kansai.
Heiji was asked
Heiji was asked about his first love.
He himself was in the third grade.
and she was a little older than him.
Then he talked about a precious object
and asked to be photographed with it!
What is it?
Just a crystal ball.
It must be from the girl.
Then you know who she is?
Of course not!
Heiji doesn't seem to know her either.
Because he looks for her when he's in Kyoto.
Ah! That's why he had the ball photographed!
Maybe he hoped that the girl
would read the article and contact him.
Isn't that disgusting!
Not only that, but there's even a photo from that time.
Oh, how cute!
Isn't it? Heiji was so cute at the time...
Ran-chan, that's not what this is about.
Don't worry about it.
Even though she's Hattori-kun's first love..,
that's all in the past.
Now you two make a nice couple.
Well, for men...
...first love is special.
Sonoko!
Enough of this depressing topic!
Let's eat instead!
Waiter! Three Zenzai!
And please hurry!
This is the west gate to Kurama Temple.
The actual entrance is the Deva Gate..,
but the way is faster.

This is the Sôjôgatani Fudôdô.
Ushiwakamaru met the Tengu here, who instructed him in the art of war.

Well, in fact, this place is ideal for a sword training.
Oh man, this cedar is huge!
Hattori, there's also...
Duck down!
- Wait! - Hey! Kudô!
He's jumping like Ushiwakamaru!
Damn it!
Kudô! Here! Let's go!
I've got you!
What's he doing?

Please hurry to board the train.
The train is leaving...
There's no need to hurry...
Hey! This is a railroad line!
Don't distract me! Don't distract me!
It's forbidden and
and you'll lose your license.
What's he doing?
Shit!
We almost had him!
That guy was the killer...
the murderer of Genji Botaru's members.
Probably.
But why was he aiming at you?
- Hattori-kun! - What are you doing here?
I ran into Ku... I mean...
I mean, the little guy...
I thought I'd help with the picture puzzle.
So, did you solve the puzzle?
Not yet. It's quite difficult.
By the way, did the uncle solve it?
Well, you know...

Yes, chikasuzu-chan, you are the best!
Thank you very much.
Now come and give a refill to Môri-sensei.
With pleasure.
- May I? - Of course.
Oh, Kogoro-chan could ascend to heaven like that!
Then go ahead and do it!
You guys here? Why...?
The head priest informed us.
That's how it is. The head priest...
Well? Would you like to join us?
Yes, please. Excuse me.
Didn't we meet in Miyagawa?
Yes. I'm Chikasuzu.
Thank you for the other day.
You know her, Heiji?
Yes, vaguely.
Really, as soon as they let you out of their sight...!
Ran-san, please don't scold your father.
After all, we invited him.
That's right, Ran-san. We want the famous detective...
to solve the "Genji Botaru" case.
HOSTESS OF THE GEISHA RESTAURANT SAKURAYA
The members of Genji Botaru all keep
carry the Chronicle of Yoshitsune, don't they?
I have that too. It is a good book.
Isn't it, Mr. Antiquarian?
Yes, but I don't like it that much.
It's called "The Chronicles of Yoshitsune",
but it's more like Benkei's.
So I think it's good.
Especially Benkei in "Ataka" is great.
What does "Ataka" mean?
It's part of the Noh theater.
Yoshitsune and his people are
on the run. They disguise themselves as mountain monks,
in order to pass the border post of Ataka.
But Yoshitsune's disguise was almost discovered,
when Benkei suddenly hits Yoshitsune with the pilgrim's staff.
What? Why?
To fool the guards at the border post.
It's inconceivable that a subordinate would hit his master.
So Yoshitsune's troop safely passes the border post.
Later, Benkei tearfully apologizes to Yoshitsune,
but the latter praises Benkei's quick reaction instead.
A beautiful story about their
deep connection.
Please forgive me, I haven't slept much lately.
May I lie down for a while in the room downstairs?
In that case, there aren't many guests tonight.
- You're welcome to use the next... - No, the downstairs room is quieter.
Oh, yes, yes,
please wake me at 9:00.
Please enjoy yourselves.
Oh! You can see the river!
That's the Kamogawa.
- The cherry blossoms look beautiful! - Yes, really!
Ran, look at that!
Strolling along the Kamogawa Riverbed as a couple is nice,
but the cherry blossoms on the Misogi River,
which flows below this building,
are very special.
- Yes, beautiful! - Yes, beautiful!
Such long, white fingers, you want to pick them up.
Did you hurt yourself?
Yes, a little.
Kogoro-chan will cure you.
That's enough!
He's incorrigible.
Hey, look there!
What?
Inspector Ayanokôji!
What's he doing down there?
You could look at the cherry blossoms at night from the balcony below.
The sky should clear up soon
and the moon will come out.
- Shall we? - Yeah, sounds good!
- I'll stay here. - Me too.
Why?
Are you busy with Maiko-san?
Idiot! Don't talk nonsense.
Hey! Hepp!
Yes!
Hey! Hey!
Ah! Darn it!
The old man's really going full throttle!
He always does.
Chikasuzu-chan, revenge, revenge!
I have to pee too.

Don't worry. I'm not drunk. Take care of Môri-sensei.
Yes.
Okay, let's go!
Hey!
Oh, the moon is showing.
The moon...
What's wrong?
Oh, I just remembered meeting Ran.
When I remembered our date, I was two hours late.
That's intense.
I didn't think she'd still be there..,
but I went just in case...
Who is it?
I'm sorry, Ran.
I was really busy.
I'm so glad.
I was afraid something had happened to you...
At that moment, you realized..,
that she was more than just a good friend to you, right?
S... You're crazy.
No way!
It was much earlier...
I guess she's still waiting for me now...
What is it, Ran-chan?
No, it's nothing.
That Heiji! He really pisses me off!
- Kazuha-chan, I envy you. - Huh?
Well, you see him when you want to.
Ran-chan...
That's right.
I hardly get to see Makoto-san either.
A girl's grief just won't end.
On the other hand.
the men are doing just fine.
Let the tiger, tiger out!
Sakura-han, it's 9 pm.
Sakura-han...
Excuse me.
Oops? Where'd he go?
He's not going to...
Sakura-han?
Yikes?
What was that scream?
Help!
What happened?
Sa... Sakura-han...
S... Sakura-san!
No one enters the room!
Ran! Call the police!
Yes!
The carotid artery was cut.
A clean cut.
It could be that serial killer.
I thought you looked familiar...
Aren't you high school detective Heiji Hattori?
Yes.
Everyone, please wait upstairs until the police arrive.
And no one leaves the building!
Roger that.
It seems..,
Sakura-san was killed while looking around the storage room.
What was he looking for?
The buttons of his jacket are loose.
Yes.
Unbuttoning them with gloves on was probably too troublesome.
But he didn't touch the full wallet.
There's no sign of a robbery-homicide.
Don't touch the body!
When will you learn?
Ouch!
Yes, please?
I am Ayanokôji, Kyôto Police.
Thank you for coming. You're welcome.
- Check out the front. - Yes!
Oh, the policeman from Kyôto.
You sure got here fast.
Where's your chipmunk?
As if I'd drag it along with me all the time!
What do you think? Was it an outsider?
Could be, but
the front door is pretty loud.
The landlady would have heard it.
But most importantly, the perpetrator knew that
Sakura-san would be in the storage room.
That means...
It's very likely
that it was Sakura-san's acquaintances
Saijô-san, Ryûen-san, or Mizuo-san could be.
All three went to the restroom after Sakura-san left the room.
left the room.
And the stairs downstairs are just nearby.
So all three of them could have gone to the restroom
and killed Sakura-san in the storage room.
There's one thing that's bothering me.
When Mizuo-san went to the bathroom,
Chikasuzu-san went with him.
Yes.
The maiko all seem to do that.
But she didn't go with Ryûen-san and Saijô-san.
There, she had just been playing with the old man.
In other words, the perpetrator could have timed it.
So the culprit is
Ryûen-san or Saijô-san and
Mizuo-san is innocent?
If Chikasuzu-san is not an accomplice.
Right.
Shall we?
Don't pretend!
That's why you examined Sakura-san's jacket.
Yeah. That's what you mean?
Sakura-san's store is on Teramachi Street, right?
SAKURA ANTIQUES
Yoshitsune Chronicle.
SABURÔ ISENO
Saburô Iseno?
Hattori!
What? Sakura-san was the Saburô Iseno?
What's that?
That's...!
A copy of the picture!
What does it mean?
If Sakura-san possessed this picture, it means...
That he was the one who brought the letter to Sannô Temple.
But what for?
What?
Sakura-san was Saburô Iseno?
Yes. He was a member of Genji Botaru.
Wait a minute. So far, people have been killed...
Am I next? The "Five" is in my name!
Huh?
That was a different case.
Tell me,
if the picture from Sakura-san's house was a copy,
he could have had the original with him.
And that's what the killer stole.
Yeah, right!
The killer certainly didn't think there was a copy.

Yes, and? Who is the culprit now?
I think it's either Ryûen-san,
Saijo-san, Mizuo-san or Chikasuzu-san!
But none of them had a murder weapon with them.
After you sneaked away, we were all searched.
Well, no one would keep the weapon on them after a murder.
You throw it away or hide it.
But it wasn't found here in the store either.
And the river Misogi?
He could have thrown it out the downstairs hallway window.
Couldn't he? I was thinking the same thing!
Sonoko said,
she heard a splash, like something falling into the water.
- Really?
But the police
checked the river and found nothing.
Isn't that strange?
Then there's an accomplice!
He must have fished the gun out of the river.
I don't think so.
Why is that, Kud..., um, Conan-kun?
There's a full moon and it's bright outside.
The balcony has a gap in the floor and you can look down.
If there was an accomplice at Misogi..,
the girls would have noticed him.
That's right.
Well, it happened that way.
The perpetrator is a stranger.
Before the girls went out onto the balcony,
he got in through the window downstairs,
hid in the bathroom or something, waited there...
and murdered Sakura-san while she was rummaging through the storage room.
Then he fled with the murder weapon
through the window.
But we didn't see anything.
Neither did any of the people on the dam.
Coincidence, nothing but coincidence. The killer was just lucky.
Hm, somehow unsatisfactory.
That guy from Kurama Mountain!
Kazuha! Hold on tight!
What?!
Hey!
You stay here, got it?
Heiji!
So, you want to compete with me? Very well.
What? An open stance?
Forearm protectors?
Are you Sakura-san's killer?
If so, here!
Hit me!
That's not something you want!
My eyes...
Superintendent! Over here!
Heiji! Are you okay?
Kazuha... Where's the commissar?
A lie. It's obvious!
Where did you learn to do that?
You're really scary!
Heiji!
UMEKOJI HOSPITAL
Heiji, you're awake?
Kazuha.
- How nice. - We were worried, Hei-chan.
Ôtaki-han,
who else were you?
Shiratori from the police department.
When I heard that the victim
was a member of Genji Botaru, I rushed over from Tôkyô.
- Does it hurt? - A little.
When we searched the store, we found
we found stolen artifacts.
Are you conscious?
Commissioner, the dagger?
It's going to an appraiser.
Please keep me informed.
If the evidence is not enough,
I can offer my injury.
What? Evidence?
Evidence that this dagger was used to kill Sakura-san.
Even better would be something that touched the perpetrator's skin.
The motorcycle!
What about the motorcycle?
It was stolen.
Evidence for identification?
By the way...
Do you know what this picture is about?
It was in Sakura-san's "Chronicle".
Are you sure?
Very well.
Learn from this and keep quiet in the future!
I apologize, too.
Take care, Hei-chan.
I'm going to call Dad.
Yes.
I'll ask the doctor.
- I'll check with the doctor. Conan-kun's with me, too. - Ran-chan,
I have to go out for a while. Take care of Heiji.
Shouldn't you stay in bed?
I'm okay.
Oh man, that was a weird guy.
And that unknown swordsmanship!
He must have protected his forearms with splints.
Then I had to cut myself so that the wound...
so that the wound would indicate the weapon.
But he left the dagger.
Why? There are more!
He tried to pick up
He tried to pick up my sack during the fight,
which I dropped.
Really not comprehensible.
Maybe this old man was your first love.
Exactly!
What nonsense!
MIZUO'S HOUSE
You were attacked? After?
Yes, and now we want
to hear your alibi.
After all, the perpetrator was wearing the old man's noh mask.
The old man's mask?
Could you tell me your alibi
your alibi right now?
- What? From us, too? - Do you have to?
I came here because we wanted
to talk to Chikasuzu-san about Sakura-san's killer.
Yes.
Very well.
I went straight home and to sleep yesterday.
However, I am single

and Mother's room is far away.
I can't prove that I was there all night.
It's the same with me.
I live alone above my store on Teramachi Street.
I read the sutras in the main temple for a while,
then I went to my room.
There are no witnesses.
That's how it is. One more thing.
Do you also do archery?
Archery? No.
I use a bow on stage during the autumn scene.
I once sounded a string,
to pretend I was expelling demons.
Were there any archers in the tea house at that time?
Archers?
That reminds me, Yamakura...
What? Yamakura-han is an archer?
TAE YAMAKURA
But she wasn't there at the time.
Well...
How do you do?
Oh, you came!
- What's up?
Please.
- Are you Chikasuzu-san? - Yes, I am.
She looks different without her maiko costume.
Come in.
Yes, thank you.
Thank you for yesterday.
Come again soon.
No, thank you.
Thank you very much. Goodbye.
The Sannô Temple is on Rokkaku Street, right?
This is Ebisugawa Street.
Maru Take Ebisu Ni Oshi Oike
Ane San Rokkaku...
So from here, it's the sixth.
Maru Take Ebisu Ni Oshi Oike...
Say, what's the name of that song?
Well, we here call it the Temari song.
You count Kyoto's east-west roads...
from north to south.
Maru Take Ebisu Ni Oshi Oike
Ane San Rokkaku Tako Nishiki
Shi Aya But Taka Matsu Man Gojô
Sekida chara chara Uonotana.
Rokujô, Hitchô are passed.
Passing Hatchô, the Tôji way.
Kujô, at Tôji the goal is reached.
The children of Kyôto
all learn the street names by heart with this song.
Hmm.
So you yourself are also from Kyôto?
- Yes, that's right. - How old are you?
I'm 19.
19...?!
This is Oike Street.
This is where I say goodbye.
- Goodbye! - Goodbye.
- Do you think she...? - No doubt about it.
She's from Kyôto and two years older than me.
I don't know. All the kids here are learning the song.
I finally met her!
- Yes, hello? - Hei-chan, what are you doing?
Just leave the hospital!
Ah, Ôtaki-han.
KYÔTO POLICE DEPARTMENT
Well, that aside, the results of the blood test are in.
The handle of the dagger
the same blood type as Sakura-san.
The shape of the edge also matches Sakura-san's wound.
I see.
Hei-chan, please remember,
don't overdo it.
If something happens to you,
what should I do to your...
Yes, I know. Thank you, Otaki-han!
So there's no doubt that the guy
who attacked me is Sakura-san's killer.
If that's the case,
the four of them who didn't have time to get rid of the murder weapon
can't be the killers.
Conan-kun!
What are you up to?
What are you guys doing here?
The professor gave us a ride because we solved his riddle.
But Genta-kun...
...got lost.
Why don't you use our badge?
We've already contacted him.
But Genta-kun can't read the characters...
...so he doesn't know where he is.
So we thought you could track him down with your glasses.
Okay. Leave it to me.
So...
- Oh, come on. - Hey.
This is interesting. That way!
Really.
A lot of things seem to have happened here.
Yeah, I'll tell you more later.
Again. Ai-kun, the medicine.
- What's that? - It's a remedy for stomach growling.
It's for use in ceremonies.
If you can't take alcohol,
there's one that gives you an instant red head.
For people who want to take a break from work, there is one that
produces cold symptoms.
For everything, Ai-kun helped me.
All useless.
ROKKAKUDÔ
Here it is. It's here at Rokkakudo.
Phew, I'm glad.
Yeah, me too.
- Mom... - Ah! There's Genta-kun!
I'm saved!
That's great, Genta-kun.
- I thought we'd never see you again. - I didn't think so either.
I must say, it's very convenient.
Hm.
A badge with a built-in transceiver.
Yes, the goggles are tuned to the frequency
that the badge emits...
- Hattori! - A... I see!
Wha... what?
K... Kudô! You mean...?
No doubt about it!
Yes, what the girl heard was indeed

the clap of the murder weapon.
That means the perpetrator is one of the four after all.
No, there are three.
As if my first love could be the perpetrator.
Hey, hey!
But one thing is strange.
There was one part of your text that didn't match...
from my memory.
My first love has
sang "yomesan rokkaku" instead of "anesan rokkaku".
Why?
How do I know?
There it is. A piece of the mask!
Commissioner?
What are you grumbling about?
What is it?
This is what the three who were killed in Tôkyô were wearing.
One wore the cap,
one wore the scarf, and one wore the gloves.
The color, pattern and fabric are the same.
Don't you think that's strange?
Yes, you are right.
Huh? What do you think?
If Shiratori-kun were wearing those three things alone,
there'd be nothing strange about it.
But if Megure...
the hat, me the scarf...
...and you wore the gloves, it would be strange.
Indeed.
It's almost as if Shiratori-san were dead...
and we had divided his inheritance among us.
That's it!
W... what's wrong?
- Boy, am I hungry! - Get a hold of yourself.
Chikasuzu-san's mother was a geisha in Miyakawa district.
She died when Chikasuzu-san was five.
Since the mother was single,
she was taken in and raised by the tea house boss, Tae Yamakura.
and raised her.
Unmarried mother? What is that?
It means...
It is a woman who gives birth to a child unmarried.
We don't know who the father is, but
but every month the teahouse received an anonymous money shipment.
But three months ago, that stopped,
without knowing why.
Hm,
that is indeed something to be concerned about.
Three months ago?
Inspector Shiratori, how do you know all this?
- Probably from Inspector Ojaru. - That's not true.
Even if you don't think it, I'm quite well known in Gion.
He is proud.
They think he's my rival, but someone who has a chipmunk...
- but someone who's always got a chipmunk with him... - Chipmunk?
Yes. He keeps it in his jacket pocket.
But he leaves it at home when he goes to a crime scene.
Chipmunk...
Hello? Shiratori speaking.
Megure speaking.
Something's come up on Yoshitsune or Benkei.
Souvenir distribution?
In that sense, the mystery is solved.
We're assuming
that Yoshitsune or Benkei,
that one of them has already died.
Got it!
Môri-san, is it true that you know who Sakura-san's
- Sakura-san's killer? - Yes.
Well, I'll tell you. The culprit
is you, Chikasuzu-san!
What nonsense!
That lacks any logic!
- Do you think he'll be all right? - We should hear him out.
The motive is revenge for your father's murder.
What's more, he was the head
Yoshitsune, the head of the gang of thieves.
He was betrayed and murdered
and murdered by his people three months ago.
Therefore, the payment to the teahouse stopped.
I see.
And you had an accomplice.
- Benkei! - Benkei?
Who might this Benkei be?
Inspector Ojaru, it's you!
What?
Chikasuzu-san, when you came to the teahouse,
you were carrying something.
The dagger and the inspector's pet.
That chipmunk!
How cute!
This chipmunk is the key.
Chikasuzu-san, you pretended..,
you pretended to go to the bathroom,
killed Sakura-san in the camp,
attached the dagger to the animal that was hiding somewhere
somewhere in the camp,
and released it out the window.
The squirrel jumped into the river and headed downstream.
There the inspector waited and took it in.
Later he tried to kill Heiji with the dagger.
I see. The sound was made when the squirrel jumped into the water.
The other murders were also committed by the two.
Inspector, what about archery?
I've never done anything that complicated!
Well, is it true?
But Chikasuzu-san...
An archer
often injures his thumb from the arrowhead.
In fact, I got this injury
from archery.
But I am a beginner!
I could never shoot at people!
I don't think so either.
My friend who does archery thinks,
that this injury is typical for beginners.
The distribution of souvenirs doesn't fit with murder.
Môri-han,
do you really think this child is the murderer?

- Yes, but... - Don't be silly!
A maiko is very busy with training and hosting.
She doesn't have time to kill anyone!
- You... - What is it?
The chipmunk.
Isn't a dagger too heavy for that little body?
Shut up!
I'll prove it to you!
Hey, move it, chipmunk!
What can I say...
You want to escape punishment and you refuse, don't you?
Stop it!
You can't do that! Don't do that!
This is cruelty to animals!
Shut up!
- Genta-kun, free the squirrel! - You got it!
Kudo!
Yeah, thanks to the old man, I now know who the killer is.
So do I.
Only someone who practices archery would say that.
Now all we need is proof and...
...the location of the Buddha statue.
You poor chipmunk.
Let's give him something to eat!
I brought an acorn!
Look!
It's like the song "Acorn, goo-goo"!
Acorn, googly googly?
Like...?!
Hey! What's wrong, Kudo?
It occurred to me that the picture
might be Kyoto's street name.
What?
First, the east-west.
The fifth one is the Gojô.
GOJÔ STREET (GO = FIVE)
The fourth is the Shijô street.
SHIJÔ-STREET (SHI = FOUR)
Between the third and second stage, i.e. between Sanjô and Nijô,
lies the Oike Street.
OIKE STREET
Here is the proof.
Acorn, kuller kuller....
Next, north-south.
The violet is from the song "Haru no Ogawa". Ogawa Street.
OGAWA STREET
The tengu is from "Karasu Tengu." Karasuma Street.
KARASUMA STREET
Fuji-san contains the character "tomi". So Tominokôji Street.
FUJI (TOMI)
TOMINOKÔJI STREET
What about the loach?
The loach belongs to the
Yanagawa stew. Yanaginobamba Street.
YANAGINOBAMBA-STREET
The rooster...
Maybe the nishi no tôin?
The rooster is looking west.
TORI (BIRD) →NISHI (WEST) NISHI-NO-TÔIN-STREET
That's really complicated.
And which one is meant by that?
Um.
The cicada is from "Aburazemi," meaning Aburanokôji Street.
ABURANOKÔJI STREET
Tengu is Karasuma Street.
KARASUMA STREET
To the goldfish:
"The food of the goldfish is wheat cakes". Fuyachô Street!
FUYACHÔ STREET (WHEAT CAKE = FU)
Let's connect equal colors, violets and Fuji-san,
rooster and loach, cicada and goldfish
and the tengu with a line....
This is the sign of king.
The point. Like this, maybe.
TAMA (BALL) →GYOKU (JEWEL).
It means jewel when you read it "gyoku."
This place...
Bukkô Temple!
We have as good as found the treasure!
What's wrong?
I'm just dizzy.
ROKKAKUDÔ
ROKKAKUDO
Thank you.
So, how are you?
Ah, I'm better now.
Hattori, that temple you went to eight years ago..,
...was the Sannô Temple, wasn't it?
How do you know?
Fool! When you looked at the cherry blossoms, everything was clear.
And there are your mentioned lattice windows there.
That's right.
I found the ball under the cherry tree.
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but your first love
didn't drop that crystal ball.
What?
Probably
it's the Byakugo from the statue's forehead that was stolen.
BYAKUGO
Byakugo?
Do you mean the tuft of the Buddha's hair that is supposed to glow?
Yes.
With Buddhas, it is often represented by crystals.
Like in no masks.
My conclusion:
Eight years ago, a gang of thieves called Genji Botaru...
broke into the Sannô temple and stole
the precious Buddha statue.
But during the removal the Byakugo
the Byakugo and fell to the ground.
When Yoshitsune noticed this later,
he sent one of his men back to the temple.
But then...
- I like to eat bean soup! - I want fruit jelly!
By necessity, the statue was kept in Sakura-san's camp.
And eight years later.
the perpetrators found out by some stupid coincidence..,
that you were that boy.
This magazine!
Something else happened at the same time.
Probably the leader became seriously ill.
Aware of his death,
he hid the stolen statue in another place,
gave the picture puzzle to each of his people, and stipulated
that the one who solved the puzzle would become the new leader.
He then passed away.
His people eagerly tried,

to solve the puzzle, but no one succeeded.
And then...
...gang member Sakura-san...
suggested that the perpetrator team up.
He persuaded him to kill the others..,
because he knew of the perpetrator's ruthlessness.
Further, he suggested,
to look for the statue and the crystal in pairs,
sell the statue and split the proceeds.
Yes.
Probably, within the gang
only Sakura-san, as an antique dealer.
had the ability to sell stolen goods.
Therefore, he probably thought that nothing could happen to him.
The perpetrator pretended to agree.
But he wanted from the beginning
to have the treasure for himself.
But for that he had to
the riddle that the leader had left behind.
BUKKÔ-TEMPLE
So he hoped...
...Master Detective Kogoro Môri would solve the riddle.
The Bukko Temple. This is it.
But is the statue really hidden in here?
Hm. Something seems wrong.
- Ah! - H... hey!
What's going on! Hey, Kudô!
What have you stumbled upon?
That's...!
RUINS OF GYOKURYÛ TEMPLE
Gyokuryû Temple. The dot in the picture points here!
Yes.
Kazuha. It's me.
I've got the girl.
Come to the Gyokuryû temple
to the Gyokuryû Temple on Kurama alone in an hour.
If you call the police, the girl will die.
Heiji! Don't come! He'll kill you!
Kazuha?
Kazuha!
Hattori?
- Kazuha... Kazuha's been kidnapped. - What?
He said to come to Gyokuryû Temple in an hour.
Gyokuryû Temple?
RUINS OF GYOKURYÛ TEMPLE
That fits!
Let's go right away...
Hattori!
MODORIBASHI (BRIDGE OF RETURN)
WHEN A CHILD HEARD OF HIS FATHER'S DEATH FAR AWAY,
HE RUSHED BACK AND SAW THE HEARSE ON THIS BRIDGE.
AT THAT MOMENT, THE FATHER BRIEFLY CAME BACK TO LIFE,
SO THAT THEY COULD TALK TO EACH OTHER. SO THE LEGEND SAYS.
Hello?
MOUNTAIN KURAMA
GYOKURYÛ TEMPLE
Instruction from the teacher. Sword in Benkei's,
bow and arrow in Rokkaku's drawer!
Um, Benkei's drawer was....
from above hi - fu - mi - no...
What does he mean by Benkei's and Rokkaku's compartments?
Bukkô temple?
I heard the two of them talking about it.
BUKKÔ-TEMPLE
So really, where did those two go?
And Kazuha-chan isn't even answering her cell phone.
RUINS OF GYOKURYÛ TEMPLE
Gyokuryû Temple?
- I'm hungry. - Yes? We'll have something at home soon.
Excuse me.
This Gyokuryû Temple, where is it now?
Up on Kurama Mountain.
But I heard it's been empty for a long time.
Thank you.
Mount Kurama?
He's late.
As if he'd walk into a trap so easily!
You think so?
Maybe cowardice has gotten the better of him.
Heiji!
You're not going to touch Kazuha, are you?
I'm fine, Heiji.
What you really want,
isn't it?
To get the crystal back,
you attacked me here yesterday.
But you failed.
You wanted the treasure for yourself.
...and killed Sakura-san at Ponto's teahouse.
Why Ponto and not Gion or Miyagawa?
Because it's the only place where a river flows.
The river...?
You killed Sakura-san who was looking for the statue..,
...and then took a tracking device like the ones security companies use..,
and threw the gun out in a bottle.
Later, you used your cell phone
to the company's website,
tracked the device and collected it.
After that, you ambushed me on the motorcycle and tried to kill me..,
and tried to kill me with the same dagger.
Although Kazuha thwarted the assassination attempt..,
but you left the dagger behind to divert attention from yourself.
The culprit should be someone who fled the teahouse with the dagger.
Isn't that right, Taiga Saijô-san?
Or should I say Benkei Musashibô?
Quite the high school detective from Ôsaka.
Heiji Hattori, right?
How did you find me?
You didn't admit to archery.
Your right foot went
when you knelt down.
That's the "half step back."
HALF STEP BACK
Archers often sit down like this out of habit.
And when
was asked about people who do archery,
you said "Yamakura."
That reminds me, Yamakura....
But you didn't mean the landlady Yamakura-san,

but the "Ya no makura", the left thumb joint,
ARROW PAD
on which the arrow rests when you draw the bow.
Presumably you meant to say something like:
"That reminds me, an injury to the yamakura
has Chikasuzu-san."
The word "Ya makura" is only known and used by people from archery.
By the way, Ryûen-san is a bow amateur.
GEN = BOWSTRING
He called the bowstring "gen" instead of "tsuru."
We used to go to the town's kendô hall together.
But one day I learned
about an old style called the style of Yoshitsune.
I taught myself this style,
stopped going to the kendô two years ago,
and appointed myself the representative of the Yoshitsune style.
And that as a Benkei...
From the beginning I liked
I liked Yoshitsune better than Benkei. I wanted to be Yoshitsune.
But the boss took "Yoshitsune"...
and I, as head of the gang of thieves.
got the call sign "Benkei" from him.
You wanted the statue for yourself just for the money?
for the money?
That's right! But not out of self-interest.
I want to build a Kendô Hall in Kyoto.
The boss was the head priest in this temple.
After his resignation, the boss stayed behind as an administrator.
I was allowed to use the hall for my kendô training.
But three months ago the boss died,
and the temple is now destroyed.
I will have no more training hall!
There is one thing I would like to know.
Was Ryûen-san just used by you?
Yes. I had heard about the statue before.
When I brought the letter to Sannô Temple,
he asked for my advice, as I had expected.
TO THE SANNÔ TEMPLE
I advised him to entrust Kogoro Môri with it.
IF THE RIDDLE OF THE PICTURE IS SOLVED, THE LOCATION OF THE BUDDHA STATUE WILL BE KNOWN.
I took care of Sakura,
because even without his help
I found a buyer for the statue.
Nowadays there is such a practical thing as the Internet.
So, we've talked enough.
You will give me the crystal now.
In return, you have to let go of Kazuha!
All right.
If you tell me where the statue is...
What?
Where is it?
Where is the statue?
- In this temple! - What?
If you're too close, you see less.
You're lying! I searched the temple long ago!
- It's nowhere! - I'm not lying!
Kazuha! Run!
Heiji!
These are my sweet students.
Don't interfere!
Heiji!
Stop it! That's not Heiji!
W... who... who are you?
Shin'ichi Kudô!
A detective.
What?
What? You gave him the medicine?
Kudô-kun called and asked if it was possible..,
to become Shin'ichi Kudô again, at least for a short time.
MODORIBASHI (BRIDGE OF RETURN)
But
I no longer have an antidote for Apotoxin 4869.
Even the liquor he once
as a substitute for cough syrup,
is no longer effective, as he is now immune.
PAIKARU (CHINESE LIQUOR)
That's when the idea came to me.
If he takes the cold pill and then drinks
and then drinks paikaru again,
he should get his old body back at least once.
Yes, and?
The experiment was successful.
Kudô-kun got his body back.
But now that his body has a severe cold,
he is not fit
and his survival is uncertain.
So, how is Heiji-kun?
Well, he is to be examined carefully tomorrow.
Until then, he has to lie still.
I was asked to keep an eye on him, just in case.
Kudokun...
Damn it!
You tricked me!
She has to escape somehow.
But my body's on strike.
Darn, the Paikaru's effects are wearing off.
For a detective you are unique,
but as a samurai you leave
you leave much to be desired.
- Hattori! - Heiji!
Sorry I'm late.
What do you mean, "sorry"? Idiot! What took you so long?
Hey Kudô!
Just steal my clothes!
Besides...
I don't know what this is,
but I'm not that dark.
- Oh, well... - Never mind.
I'll take it from here. You get out of here quick.
Hide until you're small again.
Then come back here!
Stay here!
I'm your enemy!
Kazuha! Don't tell anyone about Kudo.
Not even that girl!
What? Not even Ran-chan? Why?
Because!
He won't meet her anyway.
Better she doesn't know anything.
You won't get out of here alive!
The sword has no hardness!
After him!

Do you see them?
- No! - Keep looking!
What are you...?
Shh. Be quiet. Don't move.
Shin'ichi!
You look the same as before.
What's wrong with you? You're all sweaty.
And who were those people just now?
Where did they go?
I don't care! We're going back!
Sorry Ran.
It's not a good time.
They locked the door. The door's locked!
Do something.
That tatami smell!
I was locked in here.
Go! Get an axe! Hurry up!
Damn it! It's only a matter of time now.
Is there nothing that can be used as a weapon?
What's that? That cabinet has a lot of drawers!
Sword in Benkei's drawer, bow and arrow in Rokkaku's!
Heiji, there's a sword in Benkei's drawer!
- There's a sword in Benkei's drawer. In this cabinet? - Yes!
There are so many! How am I supposed to know which one is Benkei's drawer?
Somehow it looks familiar.
These lines. Don't they look like Kyôto's streets?
Got it!
This is Karasuma, and this is Takoyakushi Street.
Wait a minute.
Could it be that the drawers have place names?
Place names?
That's right.
Rokkaku is Temple Rokkaku.
ROKKAKU-STREET
Benkei's drawer would be....
The Benkei Stone!
SANJÔ STREET
Sanjô, Fuyachô, heading east....
FUYACHÔ STREET
The Temari Song!
Um, Maru Take Ebisu Ni...
Maru Take Ebisu Ni...
What happened next?
- Damn it! I can't figure it out! - Maru Take
Ebisu Ni Oshi Oike
Yome San Rokkaku Tako Nishiki.
Heiji! The Sanjô is two ahead of Tako!
J... yes.
Two above the Tako. East to west...
Teragoko Fuyatomi.
Fuyachô is the third.
Here it is!
Now you're due!
This match of both sides.
This is a Yôtô Muramasa sword!
Just the thing to kill a monster..,
that is possessed by Yoshitsune!
What?
Get out of the way!
What are you standing around for? Go after them!
Yes!
Listen. I'll pull them towards me.
Meanwhile, you run!
No, I'm staying with you!
Listen to me!
Heiji...
There they are!
Hurry! Run!
You get the girl!
Yes!
Conan-kun!
Kazuha-nichan. Where's Heiji-nichan?
There!
Hattori...
Damn it!
The emergency call doesn't work. There's no signal on my cell phone.
That's it!
Go, go, go! Now Iöschen!
Yes!
Good. If anyone notices the fire...
Hey! Hey, Ran!
You're awake.
Dad!
- Where's Shin'ichi? - Huh?
Are you still asleep? Why would he be here?
You better tell me why you slept here.
What about you, Pop? What are you doing here?
I told him you were here.
That Kazuha-kun was kidnapped by the Genji Botaru...
Môri-san!
Let's get this over with!
That's what I want.
I won't fall for it twice.
Well then, what about this?
A short sword...
Not just any short sword.
It's coated with a deadly poison.
What?
A light touch and you're dead!
What a cowardly bastard!
Oh no! Heiji's in danger!
You can't escape now!
They're aiming arrows at you!
We have to do something!
- Conan-kun! - Wait!
Hello! Here!
Take this!
- Take it! Hattori! - Heiji!
Benkei, who wanted to be Yoshitsune.
If you had been Benkei,
Yoshitsune would have been killed at Ataka.
The master was defeated!
- Arrest everyone! - Yes!
- That went well. - Yes.
You said "Hattori" to Heiji. That's rude!
Sorry. I was so excited.
There's Heiji!
- Heiji! - Hi!
This temple...
Now all the mysteries are solved.
Apparently, the drug only worked temporarily.
Well, thanks to you, I was able to gather more valuable data.
- Are you okay, Heiji? - I'm fine.
But where's the statue?
Hattori-kun, Shin'...
- Huh? What? - Ah, no, it's okay.
I guess it was just a dream.
SANNÔ TEMPLE (EARLY MORNING)
I feel very uncomfortable
that I didn't find the statue.
But you didn't.
Buddha wanted it that way, too. You need not
don't feel bad about it.
Get home safely.
Goodbye.
But now we have a problem.
There is only one hour left until the exhibition.
Come on, we'll show it as it is.
Y... Yakushi-nyorai-sama is...
has returned home!
GYOKURYÛ TEMPLE (BEFORE DAWN)
Here she is, Kudô!
Just as I said, isn't it?
That the temple has the shape of the Tama sign
TAMA (BALL)

and exactly at the point there is a tower...
Even I didn't think of that.
And with a roof radical, you get the sign for treasure.
TAMA →TAKARA (TREASURE).
The roof radical pointed to a roof.
I see.
Now it is complete again.
Yes.
Those two made a good team.
Almost like it was Yoshitsune and Benkei.
You mean the Hattori boy
and Master Detective Môri?
Looks like you still have a lot to learn.
Huh?
So, next up is Ayumi-chan.
Oh yeah!
It's so cute!
Do you think I'll take it home?
No way! It's my best friend.
Inspector, can it be that you have few human friends?
Well,
forgive me for suspecting you two of being the culprits.
No problem.
To be honest, I know who my father is.
I told him he didn't need to send any more money.
I... Your father?
Who is it?
That's classified.
That damn baldy!
Maru Take Ebisu Ni Oshi Oike
Yome San Rokkaku...
Not "yomesan", but "anesan", stupid!
Where did you learn this song?
With relatives in Kyôto.
It must have been around the third grade.
We were both visiting there, so I learned it.
With me?
What? You don't remember? Oh, yeah,
You couldn't wait for me to finish...
and said you were going to the Sannô temple to play.
I was given a kimono to wear at that time.
I also got hair and some makeup done.
Then I went to the temple to look for you.
But I didn't find you and played ball for a while.
Really. I would have loved to show you that.
It looked so beautiful with the cherry blossoms floating down.
Maru Take Ebisu Ni Oshi Oike
Yome San Rokkaku Tako Nishiki...
So I finally met her.
What? Met her? You met your first love, Heiji?
Who is she? That maiko?
As if I'd ever tell you, silly!
Why? Tell me!
Well, in 1500 years I'll tell you.
- Man, what is this? - Ugh!
Conan-kun! What are you doing?
You're all sweaty.
Shi... Shin'ichi...
Oh, yes, I called Shin'ichi-nîchan.
He was supposed to pretend to be Heiji-nîchan and save Kazuha-nêchan.
Wasn't it?
J... Yes. But he completely weakened
and ran away in the middle of it.
And you said that no one should know.
So it was Shin'ichi after all.
We finally met.
If I ran into you by chance,
Moshimo kimi ni meguriaetara...
I would never let go of your hand again.
nido to kimi no te o hanasanai.
The flower temple that heralds the end of spring,
Haru no owari tsugeru hanamidô
misty flowers, a petal.

It comes back,

Even now

I hear your voice in the wind.
Kaze ni kimi no koe ga kikoeru.
A thin layer of ice settles on the distant memory.
Usurai saekaeru tooi kioku.
We knew no fear of being hurt and swore:
Kizutsuku kowasa o shirazu chikatta.
Someday again in this place.
Itsuka mata kono basho de.
Let's meet,
Meguriaou
when the bright red

Time after time - alone
time after time - hitori

But the easy time does not return

the landscape was unchanged,

Crying tears, I waited for you.

The petals fluttering in the wind,

The more you feel for someone,

One ice cream please.
Yes. That's 300 yen.
In the end, only my longing remained unfulfilled.
You'll see Kyogoku-san again soon. I'm sure of it!
But you know...
I'm not good at waiting for people.
Don't you feel the same way?
Oh, I don't have a problem waiting for someone.
After all, the longer you wait,
when you see them again...
You look exactly the same.
...the joy is even greater.
Oh, what a pity. What you said just now...
Kudô-kun should have heard them.
