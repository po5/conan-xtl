- Oh, the Fuji-san! - It is really beautiful.
In fact, it's Japan's No. 1 mountain.
Oops, what's that?
That's the new twin-tower building of Nishitama.
The towers have a height of 319 m and 294 m
making them the tallest twins in Japan.
I'd love to go there!
Professor, let's go there tomorrow after camping!
Hmm, that will be a little detour.... Well, why not.
Nishitama...
TEIJI MORIYA MAYOR OKAMOTO
Because I convicted the former mayor,
Teiji Moriya had challenged me.
Hard to believe,
how they love camping.
...camping tomorrow too, and the day after tomorrow too....
CAMPING PLACE
Thanks for the food!
What? You left grains of rice!
If even one grain of rice is left over, punishment follows, mom always says.
That's exactly how it is.
The farmer invests 88 times
time and effort into growing rice.
- 88 times? - Yes.
If you take apart the character for rice, it becomes 88.
RICE - 88
Yes?
- Yes, that's right! - Indeed!
And that's why the 88th birthday is called "beiju" (rice-wishing).
88 YEARS - BEIJU (RICE CONGRATULATIONS)
The 77th birthday is called "kiju" (joy-gratitude)
77 YEARS - KIJU (JOY-CONGRATULATIONS) 99 YEARS - HAKUJU (WHITE-CONGRATULATIONS)
And the 99th "hakuju" (white congratulations).
Do you see why "kiju" is the 77th?
Because the italic form of the "ki" of "kiju" looks like the 77,
KI - KI
isn't it?
If you take away the one from the 100, you get "white".
100 - WHITE (HAKUJU)
You both know amazingly well as always.
You are much older in reality, aren't you?
Hehe, right on the mark!
And now a quiz from me.
What do you call the 44th birthday?
The 44th?
As a hint, it's one kanji and three syllable characters.
"-Ju" is not necessary.
44
A Kanji and three syllable characters...
What might this be?
44...
88...
It can't be...
Professor,
I got it, but it's pretty silly.
You think so?
And Ai-kun, did you figure it out?
- I don't know either! - I don't know either!
Neither do I!
Then I'll tell you the answer.
44 is half of 88, right?
88 is rice. Rice in English is "rice".
88 - RICE RICE - RICE
Half of that makes "half rice"!
I knew it.
Oops, what's the matter with you?
Half rice, if you open three times, you have "sunrise". Just kidding.
TOILETS
A little wet.
I'm cold.
We'll probably go to Nishitama's Twin Tower building tomorrow.
Of course he'll be there.
All right, brother.
At the Twin Tower building...
I hear that's the closest place to heaven.
I like that.
Very close to the other world.
I'll send you to the afterlife there.
DETECTIVE CONAN - COUNTDOWN TO HEAVEN
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was with my friend Ran
at the amusement park,
I was watching men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on what was happening
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He administered a poison to me
and when I came to,
my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked my name,
I said Conan Edogawa.
To trace the men, I moved in with Ran,
whose father runs a detective agency.
Okay.
I am the genius inventor Hiroshi Agasa.
Let me introduce you to my masterpieces.
ANESTHESIA CHRONOMETER
The narcosis chronometer, the voice transposer in fly form,
VOICE-TRANSPOSER
the Power-Kick-Boots,
SKATEBOARD WITH TURBO DRIVE
the skateboard with turbo drive
and the glasses to hunt criminals!
RADAR GLASSES
The one goggle lens I added a new mechanism.
Namely.
the infrared light zoom function!
AII the items I made for the shrunken Shin'ichi.
He uses these items
to use Môri-kun's voice
to solve cases or hunt down criminals.
Take this!
Yes, that's it! I almost forgot.
His classmates, the Detective Boys,
MICROREMITTER
all wear a detective badge
and a flashlight watch, which are also mine.
Incidentally, his identity is known to four
is known to four other people.

His father, the crime writer Yûsaku Kudô, and his mother,
former actress Yukiko Kudô.
The West Japan high school detective Heiji Hattori
and his classmate Ai Haibara.
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She was one of the men in black,
who, however, murdered her sister Akemi Miyano.
To escape the organization,
she drank the same poison that was administered to Shin'ichi.
and shrank as well.
The men in black
are doggedly pursuing Haibara's trail.
And now
something is brewing that I am not yet aware of.
I am small, my mind is not!
Iöse each case!
There is always only one truth!
It's really cramped in here.
You're sitting in the back now, Genta-kun.
You were in the front on the way over.
It seemed a lot more fun in the back.
Hey, Conan, move over a bit!
Do you have to eat five bowls of rice in the morning?
I'll slide over, Ayumi-chan.
Mitsuhiko, let's play a game!
Then we'll play the 30-second guessing game.
When you've counted 30 seconds..,
you hit the stopwatch!
That sounds fun! Let's all do that now!
I'm driving...
I'll pass too.
28... 29... 30!
40 seconds. 10 seconds too much.
29... 30!
27 seconds!
Just missed.
30!
59 seconds? That clock must be broken!
It's you, Genta-kun!
28... 29... 30!
Exactly 30 seconds!
- That's great, Ayumi-chan! - Are you psychic?
It's just a coincidence.
That reminds me, Haibara,
who were you calling so late last night?
I didn't make any calls. Kojima-kun, you must have been dreaming.
Yeah, you think so?
NISHITAMA-TWIN-TOWER-BUILDING
It's so high!
You can't see the top!
It seems to reach all the way into the clouds!
There's Conan-kun!
Oops? Ran-nêchan,
- you're here? - Hey, you! What are you guys doing here?
We came back from camping and stopped by. And you?
The owner of the Twin Towers, Mio Tokiwa..,
attended the same seminar at the university as me.
I was invited exclusively by her before the opening next week.
- I didn't know that. - Didn't you?!
Even he kept it from me.
He was so weird. I pressed him, and he confessed.
- Confessed? I'm not hiding anything... - I see.
You went along because you wanted to keep an eye on Uncle.
After all, Mio Tokiwa is the daughter...
...of the Tokiwa family of industrialists and is still single!
It's obvious that Ran is worried..,
since her parents are separated.
Please forgive me,
- Are you Kogoro Môri-sama? Yes.
I'm Sawaguchi, the secretary of the company president.
CHINAMI SAWAGUCHI (29) SECRETARY TO THE PRESIDENT OF TOKIWA
The boss is having a guest right now,
so I'll show you the showrooms.
This Tower A consists only of offices
and from the 31st floor onwards, all offices are occupied by Tokiwa.
The showrooms are on the 2nd and 3rd floors.
Tell me, what kind of company is Tokiwa?
Their main focus is computer software and everything else computer related.
Then there must be console games. I'm looking forward to that!
Oh, there seems to be a lot of interesting stuff here!
Hello everybody, welcome!
This is our programmer Mr. Hara.
- Nice to meet you. - What might this be?
A game console?
Want to try it out?
YOSHIAKI HARA (32) TOKIWA MANAGING DIRECTOR
The computer tells you what you will look like in ten years.
Ho, ten years from now...
- That's impressive. - Professor, let's test it!
Then please both of you sit down on the chairs.
I wouldn't feel like looking at my face that's aged ten years.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
Here are the faces ten years later.
What? You can't tell the difference.
The machine must be broken.
No, it's not broken.
Look at Ayumi-chan's picture.
Oh,
how cute!
You look much better than her! Absolutely!
What does a child know about a woman's allure?
- We should try it too! - Yes!
What?
No, right?
- Yes, there are such high school students! - You both look pretty good on it!
- Really? - Yes!
Next, it's you and me.
Yes, there are such aunts!
- Shut up! - How beautiful!
You look like Eri when she was young.
Too bad for Shin'ichi.
- To think what he's doing to you... - What are you talking about, Sonoko?!
You're kidding.
What's that?

- Why are you blushing? - No, no, you're wrong.
So that was...
Next up, Conan and Haibara are...
Oops?
Hey, Haibara!
- Not interested. - I'll pass.
In ten years, I'll look like
like Shin'ichi and Haibara like Shiho Miyano.
You!
Let's see what you look like in ten years!
Haibara-san, you have to join in too!
Wait!
That's not good!
I wonder what Conan-kun will look like.
Error? That's weird.
Lucky!
Maybe it means we'll be dead in ten years.
Yes, I understand.
Dear guests, I will now escort you to the ballroom on the 75th floor.
We'll take the elevator.
- Oh, I'm sorry. - No problem.
She was born in the Year of the Pig and likes to rush in blindly.
That's how it is.
It happens all the time.
Does this elevator go straight to the 75th floor?
Yes,
Yes, this elevator is specially designed for VIPs
and goes non-stop to its destination.
From outside you can only stop it
from the concert hall on the 66th floor.
How beautiful!
What a view!
As if one is approaching the kingdom of heaven!
The opening ceremony is being prepared here right now.
That's why there is so much going on.
Môri-senpai!
Long time no see, Mio-kun.
Thank you for coming from so far away.
I was planning to come alone...
I'm Ran, his daughter. My mother sends her regards.
Hey, Ran!
Let me introduce you.
My friend Sonoko Suzuki and Professor Agasa.
This is Conan Edogawa,
Ai Haibara, Ayumi Yoshida,
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya
and Genta Kojima.
Good afternoon, everyone.
I am Mio Tokiwa.
May I introduce myself?
Hôsui Kisaragi-sensei, painter of paintings, who is teaching me how to paint.
HÔSUI KISARAGI (60) PAINTER OF JAPANESE STYLE PAINTINGS
Hôsui Kisaragi? You mean the famous Fuji-san painter?
I know who you are too!
You are the detective "Napping Kogoro".
It's "Sleeping Kogoro"!
The old man stinks of alcohol.
The Nishitama city councilman, Iwamatsu Ôki-sensei.
IWAMATSU ÔKI (55) NISHITAMA CITY COUNCILMAN
He worked very hard for us regarding the construction of this building.
MIO TOKIWA (36) PRESIDENT OF TOKIWA PC CO.
And this is the architect, Hidehiko Kazama,
who designed this building.
HIDEHIKO KAZAMA (41) ARCHITECT
I have a certain relationship with Môri-san.
Namely, I was
a student of Teiji Moriya!
- Eh? - Teiji Moriya?!
But don't worry.
I won't blow up this building like Moriya.
S... blow it up?
Because the buildings are different heights and not symmetrical, right?
You know your stuff, kid.
Get over here quick! He looks very close!
- Beautiful! - Huge!
A fantastic view!
You can see Fuji here even at night.
Even at night?
What does she mean? That it can be seen at night?
What can you see from over there?
What's that?
It looks like a dome.
The B tower is a commercial block.
There are stores at the bottom,
on the top there's a hotel.
On the top floor there is an indoor swimming pool.
The dome can be opened.
Very impressive.
Say, Mio-kun, can I stay at the hotel this weekend?
But we haven't opened yet.
So you don't want it?
Got it.
I'll have the suite on the 67th floor prepared.
If possible, I'd like to have dinner together.
That's an original brooch.
A gift from an admirer?
No, I bought it myself.
Mio-kun,
I'm going home.
- I'll go with you. - That's not necessary!
He seemed upset about something.
Mio-san bought up his paintings and resold them at a high price.
That's why he's holding a grudge.
There's chocolate!
Oh, I've been caught.
You get one, too.
Hooray!
- Here. - Thank you very much!
- Thank you. - Thank you!
He is a genius as a programmer, but so childish.
Well, that's why he can make funny games.
Yes, exactly!
I'm thinking about a new game right now.
Would you give me your opinion about it?
- Of a game? - With pleasure.
I live in the Sôhô district.
We live in Beika.
That's close by. Just a few bus stops!
Do you want to come visit me next Sunday?
Yes, we'll come!
What's wrong, Ai-chan?
Nothing...
Ran-san,
I'd like to talk to you about something urgently.
Would you meet me tomorrow?

Yes, of course...
I'll tell you the time and place later.
Ran-onêsan,
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I'm sure it's the hair that's the problem.
I wonder if I'll get waves too.
I never thought I'd see a car like that these days.
- What was it called? - It was a Porsche 356A.
What?
You there! The elevator is for VIPs only!
Take the regular elevator!
- Yes! - Excuse me.
Where did you see this car? What color?
Oh, it's parked in front of the building. The color is black.
That's Gin's car!
- Hey, Conan-kun! - Hey, where are you going?
Faster, faster!
There he is!
Damn it!
But
why were they here?
COW BURGER
To be honest
I've liked Ayumi-chan since kindergarten.
But
Ayumi-chan seems to like Conan-kun more.
Please tell me, Ran-san,
how do you go from being sandbox friends
to becoming lovers like you and Shin'ichi-san?
Wait a minute. Shin'ichi and I aren't... at all.
Also
I've been thinking about Haibara-san a lot lately.
Am I a bad man because I'm in love with two women at the same time?
at the same time?
There's nothing wrong with that.
Being fond of someone is great, isn't it?
You should take good care of those feelings.
So...?
But isn't it better to just be good friends now?
With Ayumi-chan and Ai-chan? And also with Conan-kun and Genta-kun.
Got it!
Now five donuts for half price!
Welcome!
I really love
I love Conan-kun very much.
But Conan-kun is in love with someone else.
Could it be Ai-chan?
No,
It's you, Ran-onêsan!
That's impossible.
Conan-kun only has eyes for you.
I'm sure of it! That's why
I want you to tell him..,
...that you already have Shin'ichi-san...
and that he should give you up.
So you know...
Otherwise Conan-kun
is so poorly off.
But it's not at all certain that Conan-kun is in love with me.
I can tell!
- How can you tell? - Female intuition.
So...
Huh? What did you say?
I said that Conan-kun seems to be in love with me.
What are you talking about? He's not, stupid!
How could you possibly know that?
Ah, well,
childhood love...
passes quickly. So don't worry.
Hey! Can't you be serious for once?
Then cut out the excuses and be honest with yourself.
Honest with myself?
Then I'm sure the answer will become clear to you.
I'll call you back. I'll call you back.
Actually, it's me who should tell the truth.
NISHITAMA-TWIN-TOWER-BUILDING
TOWER B: THE SUITE ON THE 67TH FLOOR
B TOWER: THE SUITE ON THE 67TH FLOOR
What?
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
I called you here for a reason.
In the suite of the Twin Tower building.
this man was stabbed to death.
This man!
The councilman of Nishitama, Mr. Iwamatsu Ôki!
When he asked Mio Tokiwa-san for quarters,
I heard you were nearby.
- Chiba-kun! - Yes!
The estimated time of death
is between 10:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m.
A knife is probably the murder weapon,
...but none was found at the scene.
The only thing found in Mr. Oki's hand was a broken sac dish.
- Sac bowl? - This one.
The bowl is a very expensive piece.
Probably the sake lover
Ôki, a sake lover, probably brought it with him...
and wanted to send us a message.
That is our assumption.
So the police think that the culprit
among the five people who were present.
After all, the crime scene is a building that has not yet been opened.
Ah! Got it!
The ocho-soak dish indicates "chocolate"!
The culprit is chocolate lover Yoshiaki Hara!
- Eh? - Impossible!
It certainly wasn't Hara-san!
Hara-san gave us some of his chocolate and is a nice man!
Yes!
- Hey, quiet back there! - Hara-san must be innocent.
Hey?
The interrogation of the five revealed
that only Hara-san has an alibi.
An alibi?
That wasn't very nice of you, inspector. Why didn't you say so before?
Maybe the bowl indicates a scatterbrain?
In that case, Môri-san would be the most suspicious.
Hey! Shiratori!
I'm kidding...
Really.
What about the motive?
The investigation is still ongoing,
...but Mr. Oki, as a city councilman...
...had more power than the mayor.
For the construction of the building, he
the regulation prohibiting the construction of skyscrapers.
forcibly changed.

That is why Mio-san
Ôki-san's request to stay at the hotel before the opening could not be refused.
Don't you think that the brooch Mio-san wore..,
...resembles the broken saki bowl?
Wait a minute.
- As for Mio-kun... - No, in terms of feasibility.
...she is the prime suspect.
After all, she lives on the 68th floor, one floor above the suite,
A-TOWER B-TOWER: 67TH FLOOR, 68TH FLOOR
where Mr. Oki spent the night.
Well...
Doesn't the bowl look like one you use when painting?
My father paints Japanese pictures for fun.
It looks like a mortar used to grind shell white.
PESTLE/SHELL WHITE/MORTAR
That gives a connection to Mr. Kisaragi.
But no connections can be made
to Sawaguchi-san and Kazama-san.
Inspector, was Kazama-san really a student of Teiji Moriya?
Yes, that's right.
However, unlike Moriya the artist, he is more of a technical type
he's more the technical type and doesn't mind much.
As for Chinami Sawaguchi-san...
Her father was a newspaper reporter and died of overwork,
while she was still a student.
We have not found a connection to Mr. Ôki.
Superintendent,
couldn't it be that the case
the upcoming opening...
The cabinet is only splattered with blood at the bottom.
Besides, it looks so unnatural.
- It's no sight for children. - Yeah.
And what were gin and vodka doing
gin and vodka in the Twin Tower?
Wait a minute!
Saké dishes lead to alcohol!
Hey, Haibara, were they possibly...?
Certainly their code names are spirits. But
but leaving a straight message like that..,
doesn't happen to them.
All right?
BEIKA STATION
Mitsuhiko-kun, here, here!
You two are early.
I'm so excited.
The thought of outdoing Conan makes me feel so blissful!
Who are you trying to outdo?
How did you know...?
You guys are so transparent
in what you think.
You were afraid that if I found out..,
from investigating on your own when I found out.
V... Bull's-eye.
Now it's too late, but from here on
- no more unauthorized actions. - Yes!
I wonder if they really understood that.
And?
Who are you going to see today?
Kazama-san and Kisaragi-san.
Tomorrow we're going to Hara-san's house!
Kazama-san's house is in Setagaya..,
but he has a station before Nishitama,
in Asahino, an office apartment,
where he is staying until the opening.
Kisaragi-san is single and three years ago bought a house with a studio in
built a house with a studio in Asahino three years ago.
They have done thorough research.
I think Haibara-san could have come, too.
You invited Haibara?
Yes!
But she declined because she wants to clean her room today.
Brother!
In the end, this is the fate of a traitor.
is like this.
Brother!
Brother!
ASAHINO STATION
Kazama-san's
Apartment should be very close to the station.
The house of Kisaragi-san
is probably on that hill there.
Let's go to Kazama-san's apartment first.
Oh, that's a CAD system, isn't it?
The designs are all made on a PC, right?
You know very well.
I don't think anyone uses a drawing board anymore.
What's a drawing board?
I see.
You don't even know anymore.
In the old days
paper on a big board and drew with a pencil and a ruler.
Hey, that's how it was.
By the way,
what's on your mind?
Hey, go ahead, ask him!
Me?
It was your idea!
It's okay.
And that is, Kazama-san, we are...
This is a pretty fancy room!
The air is fresh and you can see Fuji-san.
Hopeless.
We are the Detective Boys!
We're investigating the case in which Ôki-san was murdered.
That sounds very promising.
I agree. You can ask me anything,
you little detectives.
Now then.
What did you think of the late Ôki-san?
Oh, right off the bat!
I thought he was vulgar.
But because he changed the city's rules, I got the job.
So I am grateful to him.
Did you have any disputes with Ôki-san during the design phase?
There were no problems with Ôki-san.
You had a fight with someone else?
That's not what I meant...
Oops? That photo!
That's my son. Isn't he cute?
Sometimes when I'm alone at night, I want to hear his voice.

I know he is asleep, yet I call.
Crazy, isn't it?
KISARAGI ESTATE
Hey!
Me?
Um,
we're the Detective Boys.
We're investigating the Ôki-san case.
Kids shouldn't imitate the police!
Argh, well...
But you
don't go home empty-handed.
I'll give you some goodies.
It was nice of him to draw us pictures...
But we couldn't question him.
I wonder if you have to be a cop to do that.
That's what it looks like.
It's 6:00. Let's go home.
AGASA-ANWESEN
W... what was that noise?
Must have been my snoring.
Haibara was talking on the phone at night?
At the camp the other day, Genta-kun...
said something about that.
She must have been talking on the phone.
But she doesn't have anyone to call right now.
I really believe in her.
But the fear of the men in black...
might cause her to defect to the enemy.
Don't worry, professor. Don't worry about a thing.
See you.
Yo! You're all early!
Good morning, Conan-kun!
- You're late! - We've been waiting for you!
Haibara-san wants to come to Hara-san's place, too.
- I see. - That's okay, isn't it?
After all, I'm interested
what Hara-san's game software is.
Number 407.
This is Hara-san's room!
Oops? The door is open.
How careless.
Hara-san! We're here!
C... Conan-kun!
Hara-san is...
Call the police and an ambulance!
Shot in the chest! Instant death!
A knife?
Was he about to eat the cake?
That's...!
A sac dish!
That means... The same perpetrator?!
What do you think?
I can't be sure without an autopsy..,
but the time of death is between yesterday afternoon
and this evening.
Hara-san was probably eating chocolate cake.
The killer came in.
and he tried to resist with the silver knife.
But how can we classify the sac dish?
It is logical!
It is a serial murder of the killer of Mr. Ôki.
Besides, the small bowl is not a death message from the victims,
but rather a message from the killer.
Hello, boy!
Tome-san, you're done already?
Yes, I heard you found the body first?
Yeah, that was a scare!
Ah! Is this the bowl I mentioned?
Yes, that's it.
Oops? There's no blood on it.
Tome-san, are these all the pieces of the bowl?
Of course it is! Nothing escapes Tome's expert eye!
See you then.
Now you know it wasn't them.
They wouldn't leave something like that behind.
Thanks to the autopsy, we now know the approximate time of death,
which is between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. last night.
Also, all the data has been erased from
Hara-san's computer.
This could also have been part of the motive.
Mr. Kisaragi was with the children from 5 to 6 pm. Thus, innocent.
Mr. Kazama, on the other hand, could have made it
could have made it to the time of the crime by car.
And what about Mio-kun?
Tokiwa-san and also her secretary
don't have a clear alibi.
I'm sorry, Môri-kun,
But I think the culprit is
Mio Tokiwa, Hidehiko Kazama, or Chinami Sawaguchi.
Also, it is likely that the murders will continue.
That's why Inspector Megure advised Tokiwa-san..,
to postpone the party on Saturday, but she
would not listen.
Not only that, I got something like this.
- Talk about an invitation to a party! - What's more
PARTY TICKET: KOGORO MÔRI, RAN MÔRI, CONAN EDOGAWA, SONOKO SUZUKI...
Conan-kun's name, my name, all of our names are on it.
What, us too?
I mean, really. What is she thinking?
Brother.
So this is her room.
The janitor recognized her from the photo.
I can't believe she'd choose a place like this
she could choose such a place to stay.
The rent was paid for a year in advance.
The answering machine is on.
According to the neighbors
now and then someone calls and seems to speak on it.
But the examination of the answering machine
revealed something strange.
The messages were not recorded.
Huh? Yes.
What in the world is this all about?
At the end of the day, she's still a woman.
There's a computer in the car. Bring it here.
This is a trap circuit from the organization.
We can trace the call in 20 seconds.
Roger that.
Hello, this is Miyano.
I'm not at home.
Please state your name and business
Please state your name and business after the beep.
Nurse, it's me.

The day after tomorrow I'm going to the opening
of the Twin Tower building.
FAILED
Kudô-kun.
You actually called your sister.
The phone in your sister
Your sister Akemi Miyano's room, which she had secretly rented.
That's how it is. You wanted to talk to your older sister.
I understand your feelings,
- but the risk... - No one can understand what I feel!
- Hey, Haibara! - Wait!
Leave her alone for now.
Damn it. In a few seconds we would have had them!
Brother!
Hello, this is Miyano.
I'm not at home.
Please call...
The message has been deleted.
Do you think we've come to her attention?
No, it can't be.
She just doesn't want anyone to listen to the message later.
I'm sure she wouldn't dream of us sitting eavesdropping
sitting by the phone.
I wonder if she'll call again.
She won't call here a second time.
But it looks like the heavens are supporting us.
The opening ceremony of the Twin Tower building.
Soon I'll finally be able to worship it, Sherry!
Your blue frozen
dead face!
TEITAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Sorry about yesterday.
I was aware that it was dangerous,
and that I'd have to stop at some point.
And yet... When I felt lonely
or I was overcome with fear,
I picked up the phone.
I wanted to hear my sister's voice.
Fool!
You are not alone.
I thought it was time soon anyway....
I'll stop.
I deleted the message. So don't worry.
But
lately I've been asking myself, who am I?
Who am I?
And where do I belong?
I have no place here.
What? Haibara-san has no place?!
What are you talking about, Haibara?
Haibara-san, your seat is right there!
I'm sitting here!
And I'm sitting here!
And I'm sitting here.
Aren't you? I told you, you're not alone.
TWIN TOWER BUILDING
CENTRAL CONTROL ROOM
B1 CENTRAL CONTROL ROOM
DETECTIVE MÔRI
Hey, is the rich lady still not here?
She has already left.
I'm looking forward to the party.
I'm sure there will be many delicacies!
I want to eat eel on rice.
I don't think there will be anything like that.
Could it be
that Hara-san
was really one of the men in black?
There is that possibility.
They have always been promising young people
from politics, medicine, chemistry, etc. To their side.
- What about Councilman Ôki-san? - He was not a bright one.
Maybe in the past?
Anyway. Once you join the organization,
any attempt to leave or betray it
is punishable by death without mercy.
Just like they're going to kill me.
Now if the perpetrator is one of the four...?
Then that one probably has something to do with the organization as well.
Thanks for waiting!
Sonoko! What's wrong with your hair?
A change of image for a change!
I copied it from her
and had it wavy.
And? Does it suit me?
Well, do you want to say something?
No, not at all.
Ah, you were just fascinated by Sonoko-san!
- Really, Conan? - That's not true.
I wonder if I should curl my hair too?
Commissioner! We should go to the party too!
We can't!
Tokiwa-san canceled on us, so we have to be ready here.
All we can do now is pray that nothing happens.
Oh! Caviar, foie gras and duck!
It's enough to make you weak!
Well, so do I!
No! You, Professor, eat Japanese!
I'll get you some low-calorie food.
She acts like a wife.
Thanks to her, I'm hungry all the time.
That car is cool!
It's a Ford Mustang Convertible.
But how did they get such a big car in here?
They must have assembled it here from parts.
No, they used the freight elevator.
The freight elevator?
There's one in our apartment building.
It's bigger than normal and holds closets.
Even an elephant?
I think so.
Who would keep an elephant?
Beautiful.
If I could enjoy this view with Shin'ichi,
it wouldn't matter what happened to me.
Right?
What's that supposed to mean?
Actually, you should be able to see Fuji-san from the tower,
but the ground conditions didn't allow it.
I see,
Fuji-san is not visible from the B Tower.
Dear guests,

Thank you very much,
for attending the opening ceremony of the Tokiwa Twin Tower building today.
today.
I would now like to entertain you with a game.
On behalf of my
late father Kanenari Tokiwa
and on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Tokiwa Group: time!
It's a 30-second guessing game!
You came up with that game!
Whoever hits the time exactly
or closest to it,
gets the Mustang Convertible
Mustang Convertible on display.
Wow!
That car there!
That's a foreign model!
It's so cool!
However, if
two people guess exactly right, there's a toss-up
and the loser has to settle for a helmet and a mountain bike.
I'd love to have the mountain bike.
- Me too. - We can't drive yet anyway.
Hurray, Mitsuhiko!
We have Ayumi-chan on our side!
That's as good as winning.
I wonder where Conan-kun is.
Those of you who wish to participate in the game,
please turn in your watches.
They will be returned to you later with a matching gem.
Incredible! A gem!
Tokiwa is not letting itself be taken in.
Please.
Have a flag.
Here you go.
- Please. - I don't want to.
Neither do I.
I don't wear a watch and I don't feel like playing.
Now, children, come forward, all of you, so we can see you better.
What? You two don't want to play along?
Let's begin.
Let's count off with the start signal and at 30 seconds
please raise your flag.
I'm ready!
And...
Start!
- 8... 9... 10... - 15... 16...
21... 22... 23...
7... 8...
- 8... 9... - 24... 25...
8...
24, 25, 26, 2...
Oops, where was I?
Here!
- Here! - Here!
Oh no, then with someone...
Ah!
Yes, sir!
The gentleman with the blue flag.
Congratulations! That's right!
Dad!
It's not true?
It's you, Môri-senpai.
Over here, please.
Excuse me.
Dear guests,
this is master detective Kogoro Môri-san!
I would like to say a few words.
Now I can say goodbye to my life with a rental car.
Dad, really.
I guess I missed.
I was only at 25...
I was only at 12 seconds!
- I'd love to. Well, let's... - Excuse me, please.
Kazama-san, please follow me.
Excuse me, sir.
Dear guests!
We would like to present to you the works of our guest of honor.
Hôsui Kisaragi-sensei,
the master of Japanese painting and the pride of Japan.
Kisaragi-sensei loves Fuji-san above all else
and for over 30 years has been
this majestic view on paper for over 30 years.
And to congratulate his student Mio Tokiwa on the opening of the
the opening of the Twin Tower, he has given her his
his latest work to her.
I present to you, "Fuji-san in Spring Snow!"
That's...!
What?!
Boss!
Damn it!
Put her down!
Put Mio-kun down!
- Close the curtain right now! - Yes!
Too late.
A string of pearls with a piano string?
The piano string is connected to the painting.
It's a...
A small sac!
Then this murder...
this murder...
I beg your pardon? Mio Tokiwa-san?!
Let's go!
A picture of Mount Fuji.
You can see Mt. Fuji here even at night.
So that's what she meant.
In short, someone attached the piano string to her chain with the hook.
The string leads across the catwalk,
so that when the picture was lowered, Mio-kun was pulled up.
I see. Who was on the stage at that time?
Kisaragi-sensei and I.
Please stand back there.
Chiba-kun, you take Tokiwa's place.
Yes!
We were standing by the lights.
Mio-san was in the middle.
I was standing here.
At that time, Sawaguchi-san, you were standing at the edge?
Yes, I was there controlling the up and down of the picture.
What about the pearl necklace?
She said it was a gift from someone,
but didn't say from whom.
How long has the painting been here?
Since yesterday evening.
We had it brought here in the presence of Kisaragi-sensei.
It would have been easy for you to prepare the trick....
I'm sorry, I don't know anything.
That reminds me, Kisaragi-san,
Weren't you upset when Mio-kun bought your paintings...
and resold them at a high price?
I don't immediately think of murder because of something like that.
By the way, judging from your conversation earlier..,
...this is a serial murder.
If that's the case,

I can't be the culprit, because I have an alibi for the second case with Hara-kun.
I have an alibi for the second case with Hara-kun. Isn't that right?
We didn't tell Kisaragi-san about the sac bowls.
He couldn't have planted one,
...to frame the serial killer for the crime.
Excuse me...
After dark, someone ran up to Mio-san...
and whispered something to her.
- Really? - Was it a man? Or a woman?
I noticed a slight scent of perfume.
Yes! I was with her!
A... but I only checked with her because of the program schedule.
Commissioner! I now know who the culprit is.
The culprit is you, Chinami Sawaguchi-san!
D... That's not true! Why would I...?
Sawaguchi-san,
Your father was an upstanding newspaper reporter..,
who was said to have constantly followed the injustices of politicians.
After his death.
you started working for Tokiwa and became an executive secretary.
But in the case of the construction of the Twin Towers, things did not go right.
Mio-kun and Hara-san conferred
...and decided to give money to Councilman Oki..,
...to change the city's regulations.
Since you inherited your father's trait,
you could not approve.
That's why you killed the three of them.
But no...
But Môri-kun,
The saki bowl that the killer left behind..,
...has nothing to do with Sawaguchi-san, does it?
Yes, it does, superintendent.
"Choko" is written as the wild boar's mouth.
CHOKO = WILD BOAR'S MOUTH
SAWAGUCHI (YEAR OF THE WILD BOAR)
Sawaguchi-san is year of wild boar.
Mouth is in sawaguchi.
Together it makes "choko", which means sac dish.
WILD BOAR MOUTH X SAWAGUCHI
She has the little bowl,
which represents her second self,
so as to be able to
from her father as a message
as a message at the scene of the crime.
Oh, that sounds plausible.
Although you don't sleep, the logic is right.
You just boldly interpreted coherent details.
Excuse me?
The third bowl wasn't broken.
If you want to show your biting anger....
You shut your mouth!
Ouch!
Seems difficult.
Yeah, better let's hear some good ideas!
Well,
I can only say..,
Mio-san must have been pretty drunk.
Sober, she would have
she would have noticed if someone hung a piano string...
on her chain.
A pearl!
Here on the floor?
Wait a minute!
But not...!
Kazama-san! Say it wasn't me!
It was so dark, I can't tell anything.
If he's the culprit...
I see.
So that's the motive!
But then the murder the other day...
Now I get it.
So that's what it meant.
Now it's all clear to me.
The three strange murders make one unit.
ELECTRIC SPACE
W... what was that?
Why is it shaking like that?
An earthquake?
What's going on here?
Explosion?
- What? - And where?
In the electrical and generator room in the basement!
And in the computer room on the 40th floor!
The computer room?
Kazama-san, that's where Tokiva's central computer is!
We're going to lose all the data!
Fire is coming out of the back of the 40th floor!
HAJIME TSUKAMOTO (51) SECURITY CHIEF
Please leave the building immediately!
Understood!
Commissioner, we should leave the building immediately!
If the generator has exploded,
the emergency power is also affected!
Then the elevators won't work either?
Yes.
No,
The panorama elevator should work.
Really?
As a VIP elevator, it has its own power source.
It moves!
- How many people? - Nine adults.
It takes too long for that crowd!
Other escape routes?
Via the escape stairs to the 60th floor,
from there the passage to the B tower.
Good!
Senior citizens, women and children use the VIP elevator.
The others take the escape stairs!
What's the situation?
The generator room has exploded. The sprinkler system is not working!
- The fire doors? - Closed.
How do you get from the B tower to the bridge?
An elevator goes right to it!
Good.
Groups A and B to the electrical and generator room!
Group C goes with me to the transition bridge.
- We're going down to the 40th floor! - Yes!
Go, Conan-kun.
Ran-nêchan, you go first!
Go on!
It's overloaded.
- Conan-kun... - Don't worry.
I'll catch up with you.
Please go!
The rest of the ladies,
Conan-kun
and Kisaragi-san, you take the next one.
I'll take the stairs.
But...
Kisaragi-san...

I am not an old man!
Yes good. Understood.
Please, Kazama-san, take over.
Now then,
I will take the lead. Please follow me.
Shiratori-kun, you go with me, please.
I'll join you later.
Okay.
Professor!
Okay. Got it.
Yikes?
Sorry.
You're welcome.
- But, uh... - No problem.
We'll take the 60th floor bridge
and go up to the B tower.
See you down there!
Hurry up!
Thank you, children.
Oh no, it's completely dark!
You can't see anything at all.
What are we going to do now?
We turned in our flashlight watches earlier.
We're in a real fix.
I mean, really.
You should've thought of that before you got out of the car.
That's right, you and Conan-kun didn't take part...
You and Conan-kun didn't play in the game.
Let's go quickly.
Wait a minute,
Wouldn't it be better to wait for the elevator?
Fool! The next one will be crowded too.
Anyway, let's hurry.
B-TOWER: 45TH FLOOR, ELEVATOR LOBBY
B-TOWER: 45TH FLOOR ELEVATOR LOBBY
Let's go!
The scale of the explosion, the elaborate plan...
Could the men in black have planted the bombs?
Then I can understand why the computer room was blown up.
But why the electrical system?
Please get in!
You too, Chinami-san!
We'll talk later.
We'll talk later.
So the sprinkler system won't turn on?
Or is there another reason?
Fortunately, this elevator
has its own power source!
Otherwise we would have
we would have had to take the stairs!
But not...!?
Gin!
Sleep, Sherry!
Forever!
Sonoko, your panties are showing!
How now? Why's he stopping?
Is that someone else?
The laser dot's gone.
He's noticed.
He's not going, nothing's happening!
Ran-nêchan, put me on your shoulders!
Conan-kun, leave it to me!
You can do it, Ran-Nekhan!
Please!
That's amazing!
A-TOWER: 45TH FLOOR NORMAL ELEVATOR LOBBY
A-TOWER: 45TH FLOOR NORMAL ELEVATOR LOBBY
I wonder which floor we're on?
On the 45th floor.
Here's the crossover!
Oh no! The smoke!
Get across the bridge!
It's me. What's your status?
B-TOWER: 60TH FLOOR TRANSITION HALL
B-TOWER: 60TH FLOOR HALL BEFORE THE CROSSING
Nothing.
Only men come over here.
She saw through us and stayed upstairs.
You can't escape me!
Destroy the bridge!
A-TOWER: 45TH FLOOR HALL BEFORE THE CROSSING
Ladies! This is the way to the other building!
Ah! There's the crossing!
Look out! Conan-kun!
- What happened? - The bridge fell down.
Môri-san!
The panoramic elevator's stopped!
What?!
Ran...
Ran! Are you okay?
I'm fine!
What now, Conan-kun?
Our escape route is cut off.
There's smoke behind the doors.
But, Conan-kun...
What do we do now?
The batteries!
Running around is too dangerous.
Let's wait for help.
Are you okay, Conan-kun?
Ran-neechan, are you trying to...
I don't know if it's going to work like in the movies...
Hold on tight, Conan-kun!
Ah! It's Ran-san!
What's that?
Give it to me!
Wha... what's she up to?
Ran-nêchan,
aren't you scared?
I'm scared.
But you're with me and...
Shin'ichi told me to wait for him.
I have to live to wait for him.
Conan-kun,
I...
It's going to be okay,
Ran-nêchan.
I'm all too painfully aware of your feelings.
Shit, the hose is catching fire!
Are you okay, Conan-kun?
You're really great, Ran-nêchan!
Môri-san!
Ran!
I'm so happy! You're fine!
What a crazy idea!
Watch out!
Look! The panorama elevator!
Professor! Where did that person go?
Sorry, I lost sight of her.
I can't find the other children either.
What?
Ayumi! Genta! Mitsuhiko! Can you hear me?
We hear you, Conan-kun!
Where are you guys right now?
We're on the 60th floor in front of the connecting bridge.
What?
So that's where they are.
Takagi-kun! Call the rescue helicopter!
Yes... Yes, sir!
B-TOWER: 60TH FLOOR ELEVATOR LOBBY
B-TOWER: 60TH FLOOR ELEVATOR LOBBY
- Uncle, I'm borrowing it! - Hey, kid!
Hey!
What's that?
That noise!
The skateboard!
Conan?
Ouch...
Great, man!
That was cool!
You are the savior!

Really, it's not the time to be impressed!
What was that?
Conan-kun's skateboard!
Conan-kun just jumped over the bridge on the 60th floor!
What?
Megure here.
Commissioner, we're all going upstairs now.
Have the helicopter land!
Who's we? Where are you?
It's tough going up 15 stories!
Put your back into it, Genta-kun!
We're almost there.
J... Yes, we're almost there.
You guys go ahead!
Where are you going?
Hey! Where are you going?
Hey!
- What are you doing? - It's Conan-kun.
Surely he knows what he's doing.
Let's go up to the roof.
Ah! Let me think!
A-TOWER: 75TH FLOOR BANQUET HALL
A-TOWER: 75TH FLOOR BANQUET HALL
There's someone there!
It's the murderer of Oki-san and Mio-san!
He decided to kill Mio-san...
...and gave her a pearl necklace.
With this necklace
she was to stand on the stage
and present his picture.
Then the culprit is...?
That's right.
Mio-san's painting teacher.
Hôsui Kisaragi-san!
You were...
Conan Edogawa, detective!
The necklace you gave Mio-san..,
was tampered with so that it could be easily opened.
Furthermore, you had a similar second necklace with you.
You took it out
at the party and attached the hook
the hook with the piano string that ran along the painting frame and curtain.
and along the curtain.
Next
you approached Mio-san with the help of the lights...
and eyed her necklace.
You said to her:
"Don't worry. I'll do it," or something like that
and put the other necklace on her.
The one with the piano string.
- In short... - Mio-san was
not the hook on her chain,
but the chain with the hook was put on her.
Therefore, she did not notice anything.
This bead that I picked up
is from the first chain that fell to the ground.
The sac dish was used
to make it look like a serial murder.
Wait! Kisaragi-san has an alibi in the case of Hara-san.
That's not surprising.
After all, someone else killed Hara-san.
The fire has reached the 70th floor!
Hey! Where's the rescue helicopter?
I'll go find out!
Conan-kun...
That night..,
...after we left...
you went to Hara-san's apartment to kill him.
However,
Hara-san was already lying on the floor shot.
That's when you had the idea
to disguise this murder as a serial killing
to take advantage of your alibi.
If you have an alibi in a case,
you can't be a serial killer.
They broke
as in the case of Ôki-san, you broke the bowl you had brought with you.
Fragments fell
fragments fell onto the already dried blood!
That's why there were no traces of blood on the fragments in Tome-san's bag.
And the blood
in Ôki-san's hotel room, which I saw in the photo,
was only on the bottom of the closet,
because there was probably a painting above it that you had done.
Under the pretext of wanting to give Ôki-san a painting,
you went to see him so he wouldn't suspect anything.
Very interesting conclusions, young detective.
But you have for it...
I have proof!
It's in that stick!
The pearl necklace Mio-san wore at the beginning should be hidden there!
How did you know it was in here?
The sound!
Before Mio-san's death, the sound of the stick was a little different than after.
Indeed, the ears of a detective.
There he is!
But what is your motive?
Because Mio-san resold your paintings at a high price?
No. The motive is probably that twin-tower building.
That's why Ôki-san and
Hara-san should die too.
Your pictures all had
all had the same angle,
the same composition.
You painted them from the same place, didn't you?
From a small hill on the outskirts of Nishitama.
I climbed the hill for decades and painted my pictures.
But as I got older, the climb became more and more arduous.
And then, three years ago, in order to always be able to paint Fuji-san,
I bought the whole hill and built a house.
And in the best place, the studio was built.
If you looked out the window,
you could see Fuji-san in all its glory.
But this woman
did that!
Then the
broken sac bowl
was supposed to represent Fuji?
Yes, it was his angry message that Fuji-san
was divided by the Twin Towers.
But
Mio-san's bowl was whole.
He put it down to disguise the act as a serial murder.

He did not need to leave a message,
because the image of Fuji-san was divided by Mio-san's body.
Now that you have found the necklace as evidence,
I can no longer talk my way out of it.
I'm sorry, but as a detective, I can't let you die.
Hey! Here we are! Over here!
You've got his motive
...you've figured out his motive.
Ever since we were with him, something kept bothering me.
When we arrived at Asahino Station..,
we could see Fuji-san split in two behind Mitsuhiko.
And just on the other side was Kisaragi-san's house.
But
he had drawn a curtain in front of the large studio window.
He didn't want anyone to see Fuji-san destroyed by the Twin Tower building.
Fuji-san destroyed by the Twin Tower building.
But one more thing.
It's about Hara-san's killer, isn't it?
That's my own theory.
He was holding a silver knife.
The Japanese word for silver is G I N.
Look!
GIN (ALCOHOL)
When you write G I N on a spirit,
the pronunciation changes.
Gin...
Probably Hara-san,
when Gin was aimed at him,
Hara-san impulsively grabbed the knife.
Even the clever Gin
thought it was only a defensive weapon.
He did not recognize the message in it.
Was Hara-san one of them?
Yes.
He probably hacked into their computer
and stole secret data.
That's why they killed Hara-san
and erased the contents of the computer.
They also blew up
they also blew up Tokiva's central computer.
So that's what happened.
Oh no! The batteries are dead!
I'll go up and get help to carry it.
You stay here and wait!
B-TOWER: SWIMMING POOL IN THE ATTIC
Hooray! Hooray!
There's no wind, they should be safe now.
Come back!
Hurry up!
W... who does that?
The helicopter can't land like this for a while.
If they wait until the fire goes out,
by then...
...time's up!
I'm busted!
What's wrong with this building?
We have no choice but to wait for the fire to end.
We don't have that much time.
A bomb?!
There's one under every table!
The detonator is...
We only have four minutes!
Damn it!
They're trying to blow up the ballroom..,
to cover up who they were after.
Ran...
Hurry up!
Commander, it's too far!
Damn it! So it won't work.
Wait a minute!
That roof there...!
Good. The key's in the ignition. The key's in it!
I see.
We'll jump over in this car!
Forget it!
The distance between the towers is 50 meters.
To land on the other side,
it's 60 meters.
The height difference is 20 meters.
The objects on the earth
move horizontally with the same speed.
But downwards the force of gravity acts
and the speed of falling is increased.
The formula to calculate the time for the fall,
is t = root of (2s/g).
T is the time we are looking for.
G is the acceleration due to gravity
9.80665 m/s2.
S is the distance of fall of 20 meters.
If you insert the values into the formula,
you get 2.02 seconds.
In short,
to fall 20 meters, you need about 2 seconds.
ABOUT TWO SECONDS
If you have to overcome 60 meters in 2 seconds,
that means...
30 meters in one second!
That's 108 km/h.
From the size of the hall
you'd get 50 to 60 km/h at the most.
We'd fall off before we got to the other side.
But what would it be like?
E... like, with the blast wave?
What?
What are you talking about?
Conan-kun wants to use the blast wave from the explosion..,
- to fly over! - What?
If we don't do something, we'll die.
Let's do it!
I'm with you, Conan-kun!
- I'm in! - With flying colors!
Timing is crucial.
If at that moment..,
...the car breaks through the windshield..,
if the bomb doesn't go off, we'll crash.
Yes.
The problem is: we can't see the timer from the car.
And my watch battery is dead.
Ah! We have
Ayumi-chan!
She could count 30 seconds exactly.
- But she was wrong before. - Oh well...
So, Ayumi-chan?
- Can you do it? - I... I don't think I can do it,
But since you, Conan-kun, are with me...
If you're by my side..,
I'm sure I can do it.
Ayumi...
Then I'll
I'll stand by the detonator and count down to 30.
After that, I'll get in the car. Would that be okay?
No time to think!
This is how we do it!
What? There are bombs in the banquet hall?
You have to open the dome now!

From the swimming pool?
Yes! Quick!
Kazama-san!
Hello,
it's me! Open the dome now!
- Right now! - Excuse me.
What are you up to, Conan-kun?
Ran-neechan, we're coming over to you now.
Hurry up!
Hello, Conan-kun?

What are you doing? Come on!
Fool! It's much more accurate this way!
She doesn't want to
to stay behind and sacrifice herself?
- 21... - 20...
What are you doing?
My mother always says:
If even one grain of rice is left behind, punishment will follow.

Ran-nêchan!
We're fine!
Yeah!
By the way, Conan-kun, where did you learn to drive?
In Hawaii, from my...
brother. There were only...
there were only five kids and an old man.
The woman didn't seem to have gone to the party.
No matter.
Our real job is done.
Yes.
I can't believe he of all people
betrayed us and got into our computer.
You got it, bro.
Nishitama's twin tower building is where the hacker is located.
So it's really Hara's doing.
We took out Hara.
We blew up Tokiva's central computer.
Now no more information will leak out.
I wanted to turn the building into her scaffold.
Well, you save the best for last.
That this Kisaragi-san is the killer...
That came as a surprise.
Did it?
I thought he was suspicious from the beginning.
The police investigation ends here.
Yes.
Even that Gin shot Hara-san,
will never be revealed.
The truth about the bombs never comes out either.
Thank you for earlier.
You saved me.
No kidding,
I did what a man has to do.
You too, Kojima-kun.
So I'm a grain of rice to you.
But tell me, Ayumi,
How come you guessed the exact 30 seconds this time?
It was just a coincidence.
The truth is, I owe it to you.
Near you, I'm all excited
and my heartbeat tells me the time.
Now that you mention it, even the first time....
28, 29, 30!
That's why I should be near you.
Mitsuhiko-kun, you were really cool!
No kidding...
You too, Genta-kun!
Really?
So, what are you going to do now?
What do you mean?
If you hurt Yoshida-san..,
you'll have to deal with me!
Hey, hey!
Always give my love
Always give my love to you
Always give my love
Always give my love to you
It's no loss! Even from now on.

Manchmal gewinnst du, manchmal verlierst du. Das spielt keine Rolle.
Du machst Fehler, aber aus einem bestimmten Grund gibt es eine Chance zu gewinnen.
Gott segne dich dafür, dass du du selbst bist.

Hey! Wartet!
Dieses Auto ist doch nicht...?
Doch, genau!
Das ist der Mustang Convertible,
den du gewonnen hast.
Mein Traum vom eigenen Auto...
Moment mal.
Wenn man ihn trocknet, fährt er vielleicht noch.
