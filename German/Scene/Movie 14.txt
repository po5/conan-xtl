Um, today, shortly after 9:50 p.m.,
the National Institute for Microorganism Research of Tokyo was attacked
was attacked by a group of seven people.
The armed group overpowered two guards,
grabbed the researcher on duty
and forced their way into the high-security laboratory.
Using plastic explosives, they then blew up the lab
- and fled. - Excuse me.
Inside the blown-up lab
were stored extremely dangerous bacteria.
We suspect that the perpetrators took them with them.
Dangerous bacteria?
The bacteria have a lethality rate of 80%...
and there is no treatment yet.
Could bacteria have been released into the environment?
No, not at all.
Due to the strength of the explosion
all the remaining bacteria would have
would have been completely incinerated,
says the head of the institute.
What did the perpetrators intend to do with it?
We don't know.
But we are considering the possibility of bio-terrorism.
Bio-terrorism?
That is why we have a request to you.
To avoid panic,
we will mention only the explosion
and the bacteria
and the possibility of bio-terror untouched.
A news blackout?
Commissioner.
The perpetrators spread a letter of confession over the Internet.
- It is the terrorist group... - The Red Siamese.
"We, the Red Siamese Cat.
have attacked the Tokyo Biological Research Institute...
and captured killer bacteria.
Within a week, we will go into action again. Take care!"
They did indeed take her.
But the Red Siamese Cat was destroyed...
- ten years ago? - Commissioner!
So no news blackout?
Unfortunately not.
Today we invited...
...we've invited bacteriologist Chiaki Ota to join us.
When you get infected..,
the first thing you get is a rash...
Oh boy! This case is pretty bad.
They're just reporting it now.
Yes...
The mode of transmission is droplet infection.
Young children in particular are easily infected...
...and the symptoms...
So, what are you going to do?
Conan-kun who's become a toddler?
Shut up.
But, Hattori..,
...there's something...
Why the perpetrators blew up the lab, right?
If they only wanted the bacteria,
the explosion wouldn't have been necessary.
That's right. But other than that,
do you know this organization called
Red Siamese Cat?
No,
All I know is that over ten years ago.
they terrorized the Zaibatsu.
Well, we were both just kids at the time.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're still a kid.
You're annoying.
By the way, Kudo, aren't you going to take that airship?
The one that goes from Tokyo to Osaka?
Yes.
The old man never learns.
He's challenged the Kid again.
Just now the OK seems to have come.
Surely the old man is now....
You damn red stray cats!
I was the center of attention! You're the ones who got the news...
the news about my airship off the front page!
My challenge
to my archenemy, the Kaitô Kid, has become quite insignificant because of you!
Well then, Kudô,
why don't you spend the night at my place?
Then we'll go to that okonomiyaki restaurant.
Yeah, sure. See you later.
I'm high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran..,
I saw black men doing a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on it
that I didn't notice the man behind me.
He administered a poison to me.
When I awoke,
my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised not to reveal myself.
Ran asked what my name was.
That's when I said Conan Edogawa.
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
One, two...
One, two,
three, four.
One, two...
Jirokichi Suzuki, 72 years old.
Excuse me!
Thank you very much.
He is the cousin of Sonoko Suzuki's father...
and an advisor to the Suzuki Group.
He won all the prizes he wanted
and boasts that he has fulfilled all his dreams.
Now he's eager to compete with Kid.
But I'm concerned with these others.
Those terrorists,
who stole the dangerous bacteria.
What is their goal?
I am small, my mind is not!
No case remains unsolved!
There is always only one truth!
Oh! Tropical Land!

The castle looks very small!
Like a toy land!
A picturesque landscape!
Pops, the view is fantastic!
Come over here!
Quiet! I'm thinking!
Menno.
That reminds me, Môri-kun was afraid of heights.
That's not it!
Tell me, does Kid-san always enjoy a view like this?
That's enviable.
But do you think the Kid will really come?
Of course he will!
Uncle Jirokichi has received quite a response.
Here!
Hmm, I'll take... on... on.
Huh?
You can't just read the simple words.
Really.
Watch this.
"I accept your invitation
with pleasure.
However, I don't want you, at your advanced age of 72.
to be under tension for six hours.
Therefore, I will come
in the evening when the airship reaches Osaka.
Until then, please enjoy your flight at your leisure.
Kaitô Kid."
Ah, can't you come to get me too,
Kid-sama?
I've always thought
she's a bit of a weirdo.
Yes, that's right.
By the way, are we the only guests this time?
Eh? Well,
Fujioka-san, one more reporter...
Ah, that one.
He asked to write about the encounter between Uncle Jirokichi and the Kaitô Kid.
and the Kaito Kid.
- Also... - Excuse me, sir.
Are you Kogorô Môri?
Huh?
Nice to meet you. My name is Mizukawa and I'm a television director...
at Nichiuri TV.
Hm.
These are
reporter Kasumi Nishitani
and cameraman Junpei Ishimoto.
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.
This time we'll be broadcasting exclusively
the contest between Mr. Suzuki and the Kid.
Wasn't there a special broadcast tonight?
Yes.
Actually, just like when we did the air walk.
the broadcast was supposed to be big,
but the time is inconvenient.
Inconvenient? Oh, the Red Siamese Cat.
Yes.
She wanted to be back in action within a week,
so the station is on alert.
Right. According to her announcement, the deadline is today.
Ch.
Because of them
the helicopter ride I had planned was not approved.
What disgusting street cats!
Right, Lupin?
Uncle Jirokichi.
- Oh. - Ah, good afternoon, Mr. Suzuki.
We look forward to working with you.
This is truly a magnificent airship.
Tch.
And this magnificent airship is worth
is worth only two employees?
Well...
Excuse me.
At the moment, the station is at full capacity.
By the way..,
what do the criminals want with the bacteria?
Yes, exactly.
If they are infected, there is supposed to be little salvation.
They are transmitted by droplet infection.
How scary.
Through potty-sized portions of fish?
- Droplet infection. - Coughing or sneezing transmits them.
Children in particular are said to be very susceptible. So be careful.
What?
Oh, no,
Killer bacteria or not,
I've been in so many places that were full of germs...
and I'm still healthy.
Humans are much stronger than bacteria.
Yes, aren't they?
However, I'm sure it'll knock you kids
...it's gonna blow your minds.
What?
Don't do that! You can't scare the kids like that!
That's right, it's reckless!
It was nothing.
No, it wasn't. Even if the germs are released somewhere in Japan,
as long as you're on board, you're safe.
So calm down.
But only as long as we stay on top.
What?
Isn't it time for tea soon?
Yes, but first I'm going for a quick smoke.
I'll be right back.
The perpetrators couldn't be identified?
No.
The leaders of the Red Siamese in jail
know nothing.
At the moment, this ampoule
is our only lead.
But it does not come from any of the usual manufacturers.
We suspect that it is an original.
The fact that the vial was found...
...the ampoule was found in the parking lot...
It's highly probable that the perpetrators...
that the perpetrators had several empty ampoules with them.
Then they transferred the bacteria that were in the lab..,
into these ampoules and took them with them.
And they dropped one of these empty ampoules...
accidentally dropped.
Yes.
Transferring the bacteria
is extremely difficult
and risky.
The perpetrators must have very good scientific knowledge.
But why didn't they just take them away?
but decanted them?
And why do they reappear after ten years
they reappear like ghosts?
What is their purpose in doing so?

Hey! There are windows here too!
The three of them look very happy.
Yes.
To be able to ride an airship at such a young age...
Sonoko-kun deserves a lot of thanks.
For them, it's like..,
It's like they're sitting on a cloud floating in the sky.
Huh?
Oh, nothing.
I just remembered something from my childhood.
When Ran
saw an airship for the first time...
Shin'ichi! It's horrible!
A UFO! There's a UFO flying!
UFO?
Look! There...
A giant balloon monster
floated leisurely in the sky
and probably scared them.
Well..,
Is someone bragging about his princess?
That was not bragging.
But it comes across enough how girlish she was.
Even I would like
to fly on this magic flying ship
to the dreamland above the clouds.
I'm kidding.
Yeah, right...
Guys!
Uncle Jirokichi wants to show us the sky deck!
We're going to see the big jewel!
Hooray!
A treasure! A treasure!
Okay! You want to see the treasure?
Yes!
- So, let's go! - Let's go!
Are you coming, Conan-kun?
Yes.
I don't want Peter Pan to steal her away from you...
...and take her away to dreamland..,
...you'd better hold on tight.
What do you mean?
Oh, professor,
...that story you told me about the UFO... Don't tell Ran.
I know.
Is everyone here?
Yes!
Good. I'm Asano. I am Asano, the cabin chief...
and I will now escort you to the sky deck.
Wow!
The walls are all glass!
We can see the inside of the airship!
Then we'll take off now.
Is this exciting!
Yes.
This Bell Tree No. 1
has a total length of 248 m
and a diameter of 42.2 m
and compared to the Hindenburg
one meter more in length and
in length and height.
This makes it the largest airship in the world.
Damn. Why does everything have to be made of glass here?
In the cockpit, the most modern computer-assisted
control system.
Hm. Oops, there are some things that look like balloons.
They're helium-filled
filled with helium.
Almost like the lungs of a whale.
Yeah, right. It's like they're alive.
You feel like you're rising up in the belly of a whale.
Oh, it's bright!
You can see the sky!
That's where the treasure is!
This is the place Mr. Suzuki is particularly proud of.
The Skydeck.
The roof can be opened.
You can sunbathe
or look at the stars.
The deck offers many possibilities. But today
it holds some devices
to catch this guy.
Show us the treasure!
This is not for kids!
- What?
No!
Hey, you!
You...
Superintendent Nakamori.
Oh. Môri-san. You, here?
- Let me introduce you. - Wait a minute!
This is the lapis lazuli that serves as bait today.
The big jewel, Lady Sky...
Beautiful.
This blue color is indescribable.
There are golden dots shining in it.
Like stars!
Among those golden dots is a very big one.
Doesn't it look like something?
The really big dot?
Ah!
It looks like a woman's face!
That's exactly what it is. That's the reason for the name, Lady Sky...
The naturalist of ancient Rome Branius said,
that this stone was like a sliver of sparkling starry sky.
A treasure that is appropriate as a jewel for this skydeck.
Why display such a treasure in a glass case,
which is completely ordinary.
Oha,
don't you recognize the bulletproof glass,
that can withstand even a machine gun,
and that this iron pedestal will only open
only opens when my fingerprint
and my PIN match?
Such things are not useful at all.
Even the institute with the bacteria had....
I wonder if you can press on it.
Just try it!
Huh?
Let's see what happens.
Hey...
Pops!
They didn't have anything like that in their rig, did they?
Well, uh...
What was that all about,
you rascal!
Pop?
I see what you mean. With that sensor there...
It's amazing what it can do.
As a matter of fact...
there weren't any of those devices.
But what if this guy does something like that?
If he's pointing a gun like that at you,
then you're gonna have to open the box.
Well, I don't think he's going to do anything like that,
but if...
Inspector Nakamori!
Then I'll just do that.
Did he fall into the sea?
Of course not.
Damn it! What a trick!
Well? Do you think differently now?
He just gave...

I see. So that's how it is.
In any case, he won't show up until tonight.
Until then, you don't need to stand guard here.
We'll rethink the plan downstairs.
- Let's go! - Yeah!
A very entertaining interlude.
It'll make a good report.
Please forgive me,
smoking is only allowed in the smoking room on B deck.
Môri-san, are you coming?
No, I'm going to my room.
My head is spinning.
No wonder.
Ah, that felt good.
Your father got it bad.
Oh, yeah, the Band-Aids are great, aren't they?
Eh?
The first-aid patches!
Haven't you noticed?
Have you done something to the plasters?
Ah! Wait a minute, what's this?
Do you like it?
Really. What are you up to?
Oh, my God!
When I got on, I gave one of the staff a Band-Aid!
Come on, hurry up!
Whoops.
It's dangerous to run like this, young lady.
- Thank you. - Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Ah, blood!
On the elbow.
Oh, that must have just happened.
Just a moment.
Please use this.
Thank you. Oh, dear.
Oh dear, if he thinks I wrote that...
I'm sure he won't notice. The writing's really small.
It really is.
I wonder if I'll take another look
I'll take another look at that gemstone?
Eh?
With all those people, I didn't see much.
So?
I'm going to my room.
I promised Makoto-san an email.
But I won't say anything about the Kid.
- See you later. - See you later.
Who's this?
Hello.
Hello. Ahem.
Ah, I'm a waiter on this ship.
I stole away for a moment
to see the famous jewel.
Heh.
Oh.
Oh, dear. I've got to get back.
Have a good time.
Ah, thanks.
Wait!
Oooh! Wha... what is it?
This patch...
Ah, I burned myself a little earlier.
- You're lying! - It's not a lie.
Then take a good look at it! This plaster!
Oh no!
Why do you have a Band-Aid that I gave to someone else?
You're the Kid!
Argh, busted.
Come on, confess!
What am I doing?
Denying everything is pointless.
To break free by force...
What's so funny?
- Confess! - What if I confess?
Will you arrest me and hand me over to Nakamori?
Pff. An interesting thought.
If you do that, you'll be setting yourself up.
Still don't get it? Who I...
really am?
That's right. Kaitô Kid's true identity...
That's me!
- Oh no! - Sorry about that.
Are you okay, Conan-kun? A cold?
No, I'm fine.
What's wrong, Conan-kun?
Did you forget my face?
The Kaitô Kid is really Shin'ichi?
Don't make me laugh! It's just a mask...
Isn't it?
Of course it isn't! This is my face.
No.
Even with the Shin'ichi who once made me crash-land..,
the mask stayed on when the commissar pulled on it.
You just look alike.
Damn it. That was stupid of me.
I'm sure he'll come early to look around.
Commissioner Nakamori!
There's no way to escape from that airship.
Give it up!
Not airship.
A UFO,
isn't it?
That's what I think you said when you were a kid.
For you.
I'm an alien in a UFO..,
whose true form you don't know.
But I have to be..,
I have to be the Kaito Kid to solve a case.
Eh?
Don't I give
the stolen stones back to the owner later?
But,
after all... eh?
Well, yes,
Detective Shin'ichi Kudô
wouldn't ignore the flamboyant Kaitô, would he?
I thought you would understand.
But fine, arrest me.
I give up.
Shin... ichi?
What's wrong?
Did something happen?
No...
If you've noticed anything...
No, it's nothing.
A misunderstanding.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Well, then...
What do you mean?
Shin'ichi is supposed to be the Kid?
And if he said he was busy with a case,
was he on the prowl?
Can you pass me the glasses there?
Eh? Sure.
Huh? Is something wrong with your arm?
Some insect seems to have stung me. It's so itchy.
I never thought there'd be bugs in a place like this...
- Here. - Thank you. Bye-bye.
See you.
Say...
Huh?
I don't... don't believe you.
Well, excuse me.
Ah, Time! Time!
Fujioka-san!
Oh, that was tactless.
Quite the karate champion from Kantô.
You have great muscles.
Hey! Look! An airship!
- Wow! - It looks like a whale!
It's a flying whale!
There you go!
Awesome!
Girl, another one!

Hey!
Girl, another one!
Your father has recovered well.
And way too well.
Here you go.
Your cakes.
Thank you.
I've been waiting for this. It looks delicious!
Well..,
what's in the cream?
Ah,
aren't those blackberries?
What do you think?
Hi Ran!
Why are you staring at him so seriously?
- Eh? - Is he your type?
No, he's not.
You think I'd tell your husband?
No, it's not that!
If you open
you come out in the middle of the hallway.
And if you go through the front...
Is that where you go?
That's it.
You guys, you going somewhere?
Ah, no, um, we were thinking..,
playing cards in our room.
They're cooking up something again.
I can't wait!
I want to reach Ôsaka quickly and meet Kid-sama.
Then I wish..,
that my lips
to meet his bold lips...
No! No! No way!
The Kid's a criminal. Don't be so rash.
Why are you getting so upset?
I'm not.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
- Come on, men! Eat quickly! - Yes, sir!
Commissioner Nakamori. Take more time to eat.
The treasure is guarded by my men.
- But right now, Kid... - Thanks for the food!
We'll go up to the room and play cards.
See you.
They're in a hurry.
Thanks, Kid.
Ahchoo!
Aah.
Oh, sorry.
Really. You better watch it.
Didn't your mother
taught you to cover your mouth like that when you sneeze?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's all right. It's okay. Let's go!
Ah!
Who might this be?
Hello?
We released the killer bacteria in your smoking room.
What?
What is this nonsense?
Look under the left sofa!
Hey! Wait!
Is something wrong, uncle?
No, it's nothing. It was just a prank call.
Inspector...
That's...!
No doubt about it.
It's the same ampoule as the one we found.
We haven't published anything about it.
That means...
That the man on the phone was telling the truth.
They probably left the ampoule
on purpose, so that we could use it to confirm the authenticity
the authenticity of the others.
Shit!
I'll pass the message upstairs.
Yes please.
The man was telling the truth.
That's terrible.
Makes Kid's arrest seem so insignificant.
Seal off the smoking room.
For safety's sake, we'll put this bar under lock and key as well.
Eh?
What?
Are you sure?
Kidding...
Regrettably, no.
The head office has just confirmed it.
Anyway, as I said earlier,
the smoking room on B deck is off-limits.
Hey, uh... help me...
A rash!
Is he infected?
The gentleman was in the smoking room earlier.
Help me, please! Please!
I feel kind of sick.
Calm down! Calm down!
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
You're welcome.
Ran-kun. Go disinfect your hands right now.
This way!
Here's some disinfectant.
Yes!
I didn't think anyone could get infected on my ship...
Who else was in the smoking room?
Are you all right?
It's the rash.
On the hand and the arm...
Damn it. You too, then.
Where can we isolate these two?
There's a sickbay in the doctor's quarters.
There's no doctor on board,
but the room can be locked.
That's good. That's where we'll go.
I'll take you there.
Yes.
- Hey!
We should also close off the dining room here.
Good.
Then please all proceed to the lounge.
Pops, wake up!
Good thing the kids weren't here.
Yes.
Oh, yes, I must inform the children.
Yes, that's right.
Ahchoo!
Aah.
Oh, sorry.
Oh, no!
- That was funny! - Yeah, right.
Let's go to the whale's tail now.
Genta-kun.
A whale doesn't have a tail.
It's called a fluke.
- I see. - Genta!
Ah!
Conan-kun!
Ah, um,
-...it's forbidden to enter... - Genta!
Are you okay?
Huh?
No rash.
Not infected?
Or is it still incubation?
Hey, Conan?
What's up?
Yeah, that's it. Let's explore the airship together!
No, not now!
Something bad happened!
Something bad?
Let's go back first.
- Eh? - Yes...
Duck down!
Wait here!
Who's that?
What's he doing
up there?
A lock...
Did he take the bacteria...
Who is that?
- Kid's accomplice? - Come on.
No.

He probably does not belong to Kid.
Probably rather to the Red Siamese...
Oh no!
Not good at all!
Darn it!
Are those
Bombs?
To the rear!
Up the ladder next to the gas pipe!
Quick!
Hepp.
Don't move!
Who are you?
Did you find the vial?
The Red Siamese.
We've planted bombs inside the ship.
Follow our instructions and none of them will explode.
But Lupin! You be good!
Was I not clear?
Status?
Cat F, cockpit under control.
Cat D, galley under control.
Cat C, skydeck under control.
Guest quarters are empty.
Good.
Tell the crew to assemble in the dining room.
Conan-kun, what should we do?
All personnel!
Proceed to the dining hall immediately!
I repeat:
All personnel are to report to the dining hall immediately!
This airship
is now in the hands of the Red Siamese.
Hand over your cell phones now!
Pop, wake up!
I don't have one.
Yes.
The airship has been boarded.
I thought so. What do they want?
What do you want? Money?
Or the release of a comrade?
Pff.
The Suzuki group is a thorn in our side.
And especially that old man!
In fact, ten years ago, I helped the police
to smash your organization ten years ago.
That's why I'll be your hostage.
Please release the others.
I can't do that.
Why not?
The airship will maintain its course.
Notify the police.
But at the first suspicious movement.
the airship explodes.
Tell them that!
One more thing.
These are the killer bacteria I told you about.
Don't think you can catch us.
Or I'll let...
...the killer bacteria...
...in all the other rooms as well.
What should we do, Conan-kun?
We have to save the others!
Above all, we have to disarm the bombs.
Haibara. Among the hostages...
...the perpetrators may have an accomplice among the hostages.
- Be alert! - Okay.
Say, you weren't in the smoking room, were you?
Eh?
Were you inside?
Ah, well,
I only looked in for a moment.
But since it smelled like cigarettes,
that was enough.
That too!
First he gets sneezed on and now this!
Don't worry.
We weren't in there.
We haven't got pimples either.
What about the bombs?
Eh, yes,
there are four in all.
Two are in the back of the lower corridor.
Probably near the fuel tanks.
Do you think
you'll find the bombs?
Sure you will!
Don't touch them
...don't touch them!
Just let me know.
Yeah, I got it.
And if you feel the least bit nauseous..,
let me know. Got it?
- You got it? - Yep!
I'm sure Ayumi and Mitsuhiko are okay.
But Genta...
Damn.
I hope he didn't catch it.
What about the kids?
Don't worry. Conan-kun's with them.
As expected.
Behind the smoking room.
If there's an explosion...
the bacteria could spread to the rest of the ship.
And a hole in the ship's wall
lets them out.
But why do
bombs and bacteria?
One of each would be perfectly sufficient.
Why?
Why do the perpetrators use both
bombs and bacteria?
To provide themselves with double protection?
Be that as it may,
as long as they don't make demands,
we can only observe.
Pursue the airship
inconspicuously.
I'll inform the police authorities in the areas overflown...
and those of Osaka.
Understood.
- Conan-kun. We've got a bomb! - There's one here, too!
Okay. One more to go.
Get down!
I'm looking for the last bomb. You stay here!
Open up!
And don't try any tricks
if you want to keep the hostages alive.
What are you doing, Mizukawa-san?
Mizukawa-san, are you...?
- It, it's nothing. - Mizukawa-san!
I've got nothing.
- The rash? - No!
It's just hives!
Yeah, he smelled like cigarettes.
He was in the smoking room!
- I'm sure... - No!
I was there, but I didn't get infected!
Nowhere...
- Now you could... -overpower them.
Throw it in the smoking room.
Am I...
There she is.
By the way, the children aren't here.
Children?
Yes,
Three boys
and a girl about the same age
as the girl there.
Look for them!
Did you have to do that?
Edogawa-kun, your absence has been discovered.
Edogawa-kun, Edogawa-kun...
There are two men looking for you. Ah!
That's very clever.
They?

- What are you doing? - Are you okay?
Ai-chan?
You don't hit children!
One more suspicious move and you're dead!
Good. That's all of them.
Did you do this?
I did.
It's not their fault.
Hm. You're very brave.
Conan-kun!
Wait!
Shin'ichi...
Shit!
Kid?
- Hooray! - Good catch!
That's my Kid-sama!
My enemy, but great!
Shin'ichi.
Kid had actually stayed on board.
Good, now we're rid of both of them.
Put on two more bombs!
Unbelievable. Just throw yourself out the window.
What now, Mr. Detective? Are you going to give up now?
Of course not! Take me back right now!
Impossible.
My hang glider has no engine.
Be happy you're alive!
It's heading straight west.
So you're really going to Ôsaka?
The airship is just passing through Tsû in Mie Prefecture.
At this rate, they'll reach
they'll reach Osaka in about an hour.
In Nankô stands
the Bell Tree Tower, the landmark of the Suzuki Group.
That's where this test run should end.
They ram the airship into the tower and blow it up....
Is this the kind of thing terrorists who hate the Suzuki Group imagine?
We don't know.
But if that happens,
...the bacteria will spread all over Osaka...
and endanger the lives of over
7 million people.
We have to prevent that at all costs.
What can we do?
Heiji!
Oh, you're late?
Sorry.
Who's that?
How do you do?
This is Satoshi Kawaguchi. We're related.
He moved to Nara from Yokohama...
and he's visiting. So I took him with me.
Satoshi-kun wanted to meet you
Well..,
since you get along well with Conan, I guess you like kids.
Eh, well, maybe.
It's nice to meet you.
Yeah, it's nice to meet you.
Let me ask you indiscreetly.
Are you two lovers?
Idiot! Why would someone like that be my girlfriend?
- What are you talking about? - Heiji is just a childhood friend.
Then is it okay if I take
Kazuha as my bride?
Sure, no problem.
If she's enough for you, I'll give her to you.
Thank you, Uncle Heiji.
- Who's uncle here? - Don't get excited. He's just a kid.
Satoshi-kun, I appreciate your sentiments..,
but it's something you should think about carefully.
First and foremost, you're...
I know.
Boys have to turn 18 before they can get married.
Then we'll talk about it when you're 18 and your feelings...
...haven't changed. Yes?
Good. Then the subject is closed.
Can't the airship come at last?
But before that, there's the duel with the Kid!
The sky is the stage.
You can sure see good from here.
The best seats right on the ring!
I think the Kid is great!
- We'll take lots of pictures! - I'm so happy!
Kudo...
Yeah, where are you right now?
On Sakushima in Mikawa Bay.
What do you mean, this is as far as you go?
That's what happens when you get promoted.
Promoted out?
Actually, Hattori...
Hattori... What?
Is that true?
Yes. An airship with bombs, killer bacteria...
and kidnappers on board is on its way to you.
That's what I call luxury!
Meat, fish, octopus... A pancake with everything on it!
Two are already infected.
- There are three! - Eh?
Director Mizukawa got the rash on his right hand.
Three it is.
You should know.
Are you okay?
Yeah, for now...
That's a police helicopter.
Is it following?
Police headquarters?
Sorry, see you later.
Hey! Wait!
- Damn it! Do what he wants. - That's the way it is.
When you see a good place, you want to go right in.
Didn't you talk about restaurants?
So? Who are they?
We have
We've expanded our investigation
...of the alumni...
There was no one who came to mind.
But it's no use.
- Megure speaking. - Commissioner Megure. This is Kudô.
Oh, Kudô-kun!
I'm at Sakushima in Aichi-ken right now.
I saw one of your helicopters.
Yes. Satô-kun and Takagi-kun are on board.
You know, Kudô-kun...
I know about the kidnapping.
So I have a request.
What's that?
I'd like to go for a ride in the helicopter.
I, Shin'ichi Kudô.
Hey. I don't see any Shin'ichi Kudô here.
It's you.
That's why
I want you to pretend to be me.
Really. Do I have to go as you again.
Eh?
Ah, nothing.

I'm happy to help, but don't interfere with my work!
I can't guarantee that,
but I'll do my best.
Good.
Cat E, start preparations.
Roger that.
What is it?
What are you guys up to?
- Long time no see, Kudô-kun. Hello.
I was surprised to see Conan-kun here, too.
What were you doing in Sakushima?
I'll talk to you later.
We have to go to the airship.
Fly there!
There it is.
The airship.
Get closer, please.
From high up, so that...
- nobody notices. - Roger that.
Wind direction and speed?
East-southeast, 200 kph.
Once you're in front of the airship,
adjust your speed.
Kudô-kun?
Kudô-kun, what are you going to do?
All right, we'll say goodbye at this point.
Kid?
Wings! Wings! Wings!
Fold the wings!
Quick! Fold them!
I can't reach the button because of you!
Shit!
Ah, hey, where are you touching?
Stop it!
Don't wriggle! I'm looking for the button!
- That's easy for you to say. That tickles. - Hold it out!
Hey, that's...
Look out!
Retreat!
By the way, is Kudô-kun...
is Kudô-kun the Kid now?
Well then, good luck to you.
You're not coming?
I'm going to check things out first.
The leader has the jewel anyway.
Oh, yes...
- Here. - Hey.
What's that?
Jirokichi-san's fingerprint.
Thank you very much.
A fingerprint recognition system
was actually in place,
but I don't need it anymore.
As for your dear friend,
take good care of her.
This Fujioka had grabbed her
grabbed her arms.
She pushed him away immediately.
And he didn't cough.
I'm sure she's not infected.
You should know that, though.
None there.
I was sure I'd find one here.
Not here either.
Did they put them somewhere else than before?
In the end, I only found two.
And in the same place where the three of them
found them the first time.
Why?
Why not where they would have
would have been released?
I'll defuse this one first.
Hey! Kudô!
You were going to call!
Where's your call?
- Kudô? - Ah, no, Conan-kun.
I'm sorry. I completely forgot. I completely forgot.
Really. Where are you now?
In the airship.
You're back there? That was fast.
So, what's the deal? I'm a little busy right now.
The hijackers put the story out on the net.
The whole of Osaka is panicking.
What panic?
The train stations are packed with people fleeing west!
There are no more seats. But eastbound...
That's where the bacteria are coming from!
The next train is coming!
- Don't push! - There's room for one more!
Take the next one!
There's also a huge traffic jam on the roads heading west!
Bank employees and security guards
have been taken to safety.
Now you can break in.
You'd better not do that.
Banks are perfectly secured.
It was a joke! Don't interrupt adults.
Secured...
Hey.
You are.
Oh, man!
There's something to see.
I'll call you back.
Hey!
Damn. Again.
What's this?
You, Kazuha-onêsan?
Yes?
Who was Uncle Heiji talking to on the phone just now?
- Oh, Conan-kun. Conan-kun?
Yes, he's an incredibly smart elementary school student just like you.
He and Heiji get along really well.
So no grown-up talk...
Don't talk nonsense!
Yes, yes. I beg your pardon,
Uncle Heiji.
What's so interesting?
Smoking candles?
What for?
Beyond that mountain is Nara.
When people see the smoke,
they must be surprised.
Not just surprised. They'll panic.
Panic?
The hijackers published the story about the bacteria and the bombs...
and the bombs.
- Right now, all the residents are being evacuated. - Well,
with everyone out of Nara,
a burglar will be happy.
Idiot! Even if there's no one left,
everything's secure...
Secured?
No, it's not... Is that why you went to Nara?
It's possible.
But if that's the case, then why are they using
the bacteria for that?
Yes... So that's how it is.
Got it.
Leave it to me!
Where are you going, Heiji?
- To Nara! - Nara?
That's where you're going? Does it have something to do
to do with the airship?
Yes. It's dangerous. You stay here!
Please take me with you!
Fool! Didn't I just tell you to stay here?
I know my way around Nara. I can help!

- I'm coming too! - Don't start too!
- The bike is only for two. - Don't worry!
I have a good idea!
Hold on tight!
Of course!
Satoshi-kun? Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine. - We'll be right there. Just be patient.
I hope this goes well.
Oh, no! Why?
Ran?
Ran!
Run! Run!
Don't get up!
Run...
The rash?
Please help me! Please!
Let go!
Let go! Get in!
Don't touch me!
Damn it...
What does it mean?
She can't be infected. She was just touched.
Ran pushed him right away
and he didn't cough or sneeze.
Genta, on the other hand, sneezed and looked into the smoking room...
into the smoking room. But he is not infected.
Why?
Director Mizukawa's hand
showed the rash.
Could it be...
The airship is falling!
Bacteria! It's going to rain bacteria!
The ship is supposed to be full of bombs!
It's getting closer!
Hurry! Hurry!
We've got to get out of here!
But the Buddha...
The Buddha can't get infected!
Please get in!
- Will we be punished? - What if we are?
Get in!
Ran...
Ran-onêsan...
- Go and see! - Yes!
Hey!
You?
Cat A...
Cat A, what's wrong? Answer!
Ch.
- Go and see! - Yes.
Hey, what is it?
Hey!
Is he sleeping?
Cat B?
What's wrong? What happened?
Cat B!
Cat B has stretched out on the roof.
Strange. Cats don't usually
don't usually fall on their backs.
It's Conan!
- He's back! - Kid-san must be with him!
Kid-san is not here.
Damn! Cat C, D, E,
catch this peck!
No, if you find him, kill him!
Got it!
You guard the dining room.
- Cat F! - Roger that!
I'll switch to autopilot and be there!
Shit!
Damn it!
The brat's in the skydeck!
1 and...
7.
The trap for the Kid was very helpful.
And also this...
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
he wanted me to use it.
Don't move!
Throw it away!
Keep your hands up!
I was watching. You got a lot of tricks up your sleeve.
Come on! Put your hands there!
Do you really have to do that?
- Don't argue! - Yeah, right.
I'm not like the others...
Oh dear. And I asked.
You...!
Ah!
Eh?
Hey, this can't be true?
What was that?
That was the third trap that Jirokichi had prepared for you.
I see.
If I had used my harpoon
I'd have fired my harpoon at the window...
That's dangerous.
The old man is unbelievable.
But tell me, have you been up there
have you been up there all this time?
Take that!
Wow!
The warrior gets a medal.
The rest of you, are you listening?
Your leader is finished.
The three of them too.
What? What nonsense!
Come on, let's go! Lupin!
Hurray!
Really, waving something like that around!
Edogawa-kun?
Both of them are finished.
Got it.
So many calls? And all in the last...
...in the last two or three hours.
Who were you on the phone with?
And so many times?
You don't want to talk?
What are you going to do with it?
If you don't confess,
I'll pour the contents over you.
Do what you want.
Okay. Put it down for a second.
Slowly.
So that's how it is.
That's a pretty clever plan.
The airship bioterror was a diversion.
The real goal was to evacuate everyone
was to evacuate everyone so that from the empty temple...
the Buddhas, the state treasures, in one fell swoop.
You knew that temples are not heavily secured.
You don't think that someone could steal a Buddha.
That will be punished.
What are you talking about? We just want to protect the Buddhas....
Then name us any commissioner
of the Nara Prefectural Police.
Well...
What do you mean? You can't think of anyone?
That's strange. You're a cop.
Well, there's one,
whose name matches Nara exactly.
They're just kids.
To them!
Hello? What did you say?
It's just kids or something he said.
- Excuse me? - I think they are stupid.
Yes, really. To catch thieves, the three of us
wouldn't come all alone.
What?
Shit!
This is
from the Nara Police, Third Division,
Inspector Tsuyoshi Shikatsuno. Remember that!
You underestimated the police.
Hello, Kudô,
the Buddha thieves
have all been arrested. Of course, the priests
- are also safe. - Understood.
Thank you, Heiji-nîchan.
Like now,

the detective boy from Ôsaka had the threads in his hand?
Strings in his hand...
Oh, yes,
Here you go.
Oh, thank you. Kid.
We should get Ran to the hospital fast.
Yeah, about that...
I don't want to die.
Ran-neechan...
Conan-kun?
No, don't come here, Conan-kun!
Don't worry, Ran-neechan.
None of you have contracted the bacteria.
But the rash?
Just a harmless reddening of the skin.
It's probably paint poisoning.
Varnish?
The man who brought you here earlier..,
brought Mizukawa here, too, right?
Yes...
I knew it.
I'm sure he was the only one of those guys who was resistant to varnish.
He had black fingernails.
I guess he used to be involved in lacquer work.
In short,
the perpetrators hadn't stolen any bacteria.
They just blew up the lab,
to make the bioterror look real.
This vial is the proof.
I pretended to open it in front of the leader..,
but he remained calm.
If the bacteria had been in here,
he would have stopped me.
Just like you tried to stop me.
Conan-kun...
Right, Uncle?
Yes...
Are you all right?
Yes.
Also,
you've got the rash
on the palms of your hands and the back
on your arms and thighs.
What? Really?
The perpetrators must have sprayed
sprayed paint in various places around the room.
On the walls, on the sofa or on the door handle.
That's why..,
where Fujioka grabbed you, who came in contact with the varnish..,
you have a rash.
In the other places
you only have the rash, where you touch something
here touched... have...
Wait a minute! Then why did he...
He didn't...
Hey! What's wrong?
Conan-kun...
Damn it!
According to the police report from Nara.
...the kidnappers have been identified.
The group served as mercenaries abroad.
Mercenaries, huh?
Then the Red Siamese...
She was uninvolved.
The name served as a distraction,
to steal the Buddha statues in peace.
And the one who hired her for money this time was....
Wait!
Are you trying to run away without your people?
Isn't that cowardly?
Boss of the kidnapping group,
Takamichi Fujioka-san?
Not bad, so you've uncovered my identity.
Well,
when you claimed to be the first infected,
that's what I believed.
Probably right after the launch
your subordinate distributed the poisonous varnish substances and
and put down the vial.
On your instructions, of course.
Afterwards you exposed yourself to the varnish substances
in the smoking room,
to simulate an infection
by the bacteria.
You tried to lure Uncle Kogorô into the smoking room....
Môri-san, are you coming?
And grabbed Ran by the arms,
in order to infect her
and get her out of the way.
But since my uncle didn't go, you put sleeping pills or something in his beer.
Sleeping pills or something in his beer.
He was sound asleep until just now.
Mizukawa-san and the waitress had their
Mizukawa-san and the waitress had red palms and upper arms.
They had been in contact with something.
Genta, on the other hand
only peeked into the smoking room and therefore did not get a rash.
In short, only with you are
hard-to-reach areas such as the face and neck are reddened.
Also
the leader was constantly on the phone.
That's how it became clear to me.
You created the rash in the smoking room with the help of the varnish
on your body to create the rash
and you created the fear of contagion,
to isolate yourself
and thus be able to give instructions to the group unseen,
as their head honcho.
Hm,
an almost perfect deduction, kid.
But you missed something important.
What?
For one thing, I have no intention of escaping on my own.
Unfortunately.
- all your people... - But not them.
They work for money.
My true subordinates.
There are others?
Don't move!
Sonoko!
Don't move!
Edogawa-kun, there are two more!
The cameraman and the reporter.
Damn it!
Second, me being up here isn't to escape.
It's to lure you out.
What?
Do you know why we chose the Buddhas...
was not money, but the Buddhas?
In this information society
money can be tracked down quickly.
That's why we thought the priceless statues
were safer.
The Buddhas from Japan are very popular abroad.
We already had buyers.
You ruined my profit. This is my thanks!
We still have plenty of time.

Let's enjoy them!
Hattori-kun, a great performance!
The peck is the hero.
Would you please follow the airship?
I can't get a connection anymore.
I have a bad feeling.
All right.
Listen, Satoshi, you're going home now.
What? But...
I know.
Thanks to you, the Buddhas are safe.
You, Uncle Heiji,
I think thieves would choose Gôfuku Temple.
There are many national treasures there.
All right, I understand.
- Then take me with you! - No.
Too dangerous. You go home with Kazuha.
Satoshi-kun. Let's go, okay?
Your mother's worried about you.
That's fine with me.
But in exchange...
...introduce me to Conan-kun.
You're going to help him now, right?
It's a deal. I promise.
Kazuha, I'm counting on you.
Of course you are! Take care of yourself, Heiji.
Sure!
Okay, let's go.
- Ah... - Eh...
That you two are one of them, too...
Pff.
Everything's okay over there!
Hey!
Untie me already!
Oh, sorry. I forgot to tell you guys about this.
There's been a slight change of plans.
Change of plans?
After all, this is our only loot.
You're gonna die with these guys.
with these guys.
What?
Finally, I'll tell you something.
We're going to disappear
with a cruiser that's near the bridge.
Shortly after, the airship will explode.
From the cabin with the hostages.
Oh, so that's why...
You must have removed the two bombs from the fuel tanks,
but there were still two bombs left
for the cabin.
Shit!
But before that...
you'll meet your end here in the sea.
Damn, what now?
Is there...
...nothing I can do to turn things around in one fell swoop?
There it is! The airship!
They're going pretty low.
Tell me, with the course they're on...
Yes, they're going to hit the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge.
Ah! I can see the port tower!
I can even see the anchor sign!
Wow!
Are you trying to distract me
so I'll bump my head on the bridge girder?
I'm not falling for that.
- What was that? - What's going on?
Shit!
- Whoa! - I can't believe it!
A whale is blowing up!
Hello?
Hey, Kudô, are you okay?
Oh, Hattori, just fine.
Inform the coast guard.
The coast guard?
Boss Fujioka fell into the sea.
The culprit fell into the sea?
Yes.
there's a cruiser of theirs near the bridge.
Have it impounded.
Understood.
See you later. Tomorrow we'll have okonomiyaki.
Look forward to it!
Hattori-kun?
- Did I just hear Kudô-kun? Eh?
Yes...
I have a question.
Is Kudô-kun the
Kaitô Kid?
Huh?
Hey, are you
okay?
Yeah, kind of...
Just a little scared.
What about those guys?
The two criminals are lying back there.
They crashed into the wall when we were climbing.
Serves them right.
We're unharmed because we were tied up.
What a surprise.
I go to check the situation
...and all of a sudden, the ground tilts.
Kid, you bastard!
- Kid-sama! - What about Conan-kun?
The kid's fine.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.
So, would you please untie the others?
Ah, Kid-sama, me too...
- Wait Kid! Hey! - His ties at the end, of course.
Wait! Hey!
Now then,
I'll take the treasure as promised.
- Wait! Stay here, kid! - You petty thief!
Kaitô is the name!
Hm... Yes...
And the bombs too?
Ah well, got it. Good work.
The hostages are safe.
The whole gang has been arrested.
That's the end of the case. Right?
Yes.
Hungry!
Finally, the long-awaited dinner arrives.
Do you think they have eel on rice?
- Haven't we forgotten something? - Now that you mention it...
Then here comes the long-awaited quiz.
Nobody's waiting for that.
Ayumi-kun, Genta-kun..,
Mitsuhiko-kun may be good kids..,
But which of you three has nothing to do with an airship..,
hikôsen?
That's it?
I'll give you a hint.
All three of you have something to do with it, right?
Eh?
That all three are very well-behaved means,
that they don't commit any misdemeanors.
Hikô shinai.
In short form: hikô sen.
- So hikôsen. - I see.
I see.
Oh yes,
If this guy was like this simple riddle..,
I would have caught him and ended up on the front page.
You, Sonoko-nêchan,

- where is Ran-nêchan? - Eh?
That's right. She's late.
I should go first. I thought..,
she had to go to the bathroom.
She took the elevator up.
Maybe she's meeting the Kid.
What?
- Nothing shines through here. - Shin'ichi...
You, Shin'ichi...
Oh my gosh, I forgot something.
Hello Ran.
It's been quite an eventful day...
Shin'ichi!
Please turn yourself in!
A thief is a thief! You can't do that!
Please, Shin'ichi!
I understand.
Then...
If you give me the treasure
I'll go to the police.
Eh? But I don't own anything.
I mean, of course...
Ah, Mo... mo... mo...
...ment...
Just the sound of the wind
Kaze no oto dake ga

You're not Shin'ichi, are you?
Conan-kun!
Kid, you...
Yes, I'm not a detective, but a thief.
And a thief who steals.
Even a person's heart.
Eh?
Kid-sama! You are wonderful!
Not after what he did to me.
Eh?
Eh? Something like that?
Ah! Lady Sky! The Kid gave it back!
Well, tell me! What did the Kid do to you?
Something Shin'ichi would never do.
Eh? Why?
Why wouldn't he do that?
Why do you think that?
It's because...
It's not because I like him.
Don't think wrong!
Think what?
Wait, Ran-neechan!
Oh dear, what does she mean
by "something like that"?
