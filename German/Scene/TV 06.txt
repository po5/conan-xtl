Hello? It's me. Can you come here?
Yes, that's right. Lab 4.
I'll show you something interesting,
Yes.

Smell?
I didn't smell anything.
Just like a shark...
he smells the scent of blood, rushes to the crime scene.
and uses all his senses to find the culprit.
And once he has taken a firm bite, he leaves his teeth
firmly in the flesh until the perpetrator gives up.
That's what a detective does.

I think we'd better forget about that plan.
BEIKA AQUARIUM
Trying to rekindle their love in an aquarium where a murder happened!
You're right about that.
Crap! It's starting to rain!
That's right! Then let's run home!
Hey! I told you not to run!
Why wouldn't I...
No?! What's my phone doing in my hood?
Shit, I'm sorry.
I was testing where the perpetrator put her phone to film.
And then I forgot it was still in there.
How could you? I just got it!
Please don't cry.
I'll buy you a new one soon, okay?
That's the worst! Everything always goes wrong with you.
Even in America, it was one case after another...
Okay, okay! Good.
I'll take you to Tropical Land, okay?
"Tropical Land?
Sounds exciting, what is it?
Ah, a park that's opening soon here in Tokyo,
Nothing will ever happen in an amusement park like that.
If the cost is all on you, I'll come along.
What?!
Then invite me if I win the Municipal Karate Tournament! Okay?
Wait a minute. You came in second last year, right?
And your friend from 3rd grade who won it..,
she quit the team.
That's a promise.
What, really? I get relatively little pocket money!
And if you buy me a cell phone,
it'll be with one of the sea cucumber man pendants from the aquarium, right?
- Yes, sir. - And...
What, there's more?
All right, I'll settle for that.
Thank you very much...
Wah, it's pouring!
The forecast was way off.
Same as him, please.
Aren't you going to check the content?
If it turns out to be fake, we'll just take your life.
I'll check my content,
Do what you want.
Okay, it's all true,
Here you go.
What's my next assignment?
I should at least know roughly what it's about....
Did you know
that we've had a rat sniffing around our neighborhood
has been sniffing around our neighborhood?
Well?
. Well...
I haven't heard anything about that.
You didn't?
So my next assignment is to find this rat?
No.
We already have an idea who it might be.
Oh, really?
The cocktail tastes delicious!

What's his name?
Rum...
Cointreau,
and a little bit of lemon juice.
It's called "X-Y-Z,"
which means end, finite, out.
G... good. Get back to me when you have another assignment.
Are you sure, brother,
you want to let him go?
He's the rat, no doubt about it.
Yes...
That's no problem.
...which means: over, finite, out.
It's me.
All right.
Get the fuck out of here.
So, brother? What do we do with this?
With this information about the arms smuggling?
It doesn't matter.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
You put up the money to find out..,
to see if he realized we were serious?
Yeah. But it could be a trap.
We'll be able to tell if we're in contact with him.
Right again.
Besides...
I'd hate to give up this place.
KUDÔ
Yes?
Shin'ichi?
Ran, is that you?
- What do you want so early in the morning? - Excuse me?
It's already eleven, eleven o'clock!
What, really?
Really...
- Sorry to bother you... - So?
What are your plans for today? It's Sunday...
Yep. He forgot.
Huh? Was there something?
Nothing there "was there something"!
When I said I didn't have karate practice today..,
you yourself suggested I go buy my cell phone!
Sorry... I completely forgot.
Really.
You must have been up all night reading mystery novels again.
Bingo.
Anyway, get dressed.
I'll make something to eat while you're waiting.
- You haven't eaten yet? - No... Thank you.
Don't you dare forget the Sea Cucumber Man pendant, okay?
Got it!
What's up?
Last week, when we were at the Beika aquarium..,
a car exploded nearby,
Yes.
Is there something wrong with it?
Apparently, the case hasn't been solved yet.
Really? It's kind of scary.
But I'm sure they'll solve it soon.
- The Japanese police are great, after all. - Uh-huh...
"And I, whom they keep asking for help, am consequently super great!"
Is that what you mean?
Well...
Be a little more modest, okay?
I was just kidding.
All right, shall we get going?
You're right.
And...
Mitsuhiko-kun! Watch me, watch me!
Ayumi-chan!
I'm going to shoot!
Go ahead and shoot!
Piece of cake.
Too bad, too bad, Ayumi-chan!
Okay, now me!
Go ahead!
But, Genta-kun, where are you shooting from!
Oh, I'm sorry...
Sorry!
Please catch the ball!
Great...
Are you a soccer player?
Yes... I used to be.
Catch!
- Thanks! - Bye-bye!
If we had a friend who could play as well as him..,
we'd get better too, right?
That's right!
If you hadn't quit the club..,
you might be in Samurai Blue today!
- But not as a high school student! - You think so?
Besides... I was just playing to build up my reflexes..,
to be a detective.
After all, Holmes fought too, didn't he?
He's just a character in a novel!
But he's the master detective the whole world knows!
That's true, but...
He's really great...
He's always calm.
Is intelligent and cultured!
Excellent at observation and deduction!
And plays the violin like a pro!
Sherlock Holmes, as imagined by the author Arthur Conan Doyle,
is the best master detective in the whole world!
Help, catch him! Catch the pickpocket!
Get out of the way!
- Excuse me! - Let us through, please!
Who are you?
Hina Wada, 2nd grade, Haido High School.
That's...
Hey, Ran! Come on, let's go! We have to support her!
No need. Probably
she'll be fine.
Damn it! Don't get in my way! I'll get you for this!
Oho, so you pull out a knife? Good, so you want me
I'll be serious, too?
HAIDO
Karate?
Again?
Ha, it seems pretty good!
- No. - Stop it!
Not only does she seem good,
she /s♪ good.
This was the first encounter with the rival, which she would
would not be able to easily avoid on her life path of karate.
It was in the spring, and Ran Môri was 16 years old at that time.
Sonoko.
Just kidding.
Don't just play the narrator! And it's not even spring yet!

It doesn't matter! It's all about the atmosphere!
And it's not even our first meeting.
You know each other?
Yes. From a few tournaments,
But more importantly, come to my place.
But we were going to...
You can go on dates anytime. Come on, come on!
Wait, Sonoko!
SUZUKI
I'm back!
Welcome back, madam.
Come in, come in!
- Sorry to disturb you! - Welcome, Môri-sama, Kudô-sama.
Today we have fluffy soft cheesecakes,
specially ordered from Hokkaido!
FLUFFY SOFT CHEESECAKES
The ones you wait three months for after making a reservation?
Yes! Let's eat them together!
I'm in!
Are you sure you should eat that much before a tournament?
Don't complain if you gain weight.
Don't worry!
I heard that Kazumi-senpai is also coming to practice tomorrow.
And I'll double the basic exercises.
- Really... - What a nagging hubby!
- G... Hubby? What are you... - What are you doing, Sonoko?
Excuse me, ma'am. You have guests?
Welcome back!
It's not proper to enter without knocking!
Don't do that!
It's good to have so much energy.
Is this your daughter?
Yes. My second daughter, Sonoko.
How do you do?
Oh dear, I'm so ashamed!
She doesn't know how to be a company heiress.
That's why I have my sister.
You've got the wrong attitude.
Oh, yes, that's right.
The two behind our daughter...
That's her friend Ran Môri and Shin'ichi Kudô.
Ran-san's father used to be a police inspector,
but now he works as a private detective!
Why don't you ask him for advice on this matter?
I don't know...
What kind of thing?
Well, Seva-san is having a little party next weekend...
and he and his wife have come to invite us.
But unfortunately
there's a meeting for the jewel show at the Beika Museum,
so we had to cancel.
Ah, the one with the "Black Star" that Uncle Jirokichi told us about!
Right.
But as Sewa-san told us, he received a threatening letter
a threatening letter ordering him to cancel the party!
Otherwise, someone would lose his life at this celebration....
I see...
You can trust Shin'ichi Kudô with this kind of thing!
Why should we hide it! He's the well-known high school detective who has solved
who has solved countless cases! I feel sorry for Ran,
but he's a better choice than your father!
Perhaps I could be of some use to you indeed.
Now that sounds trustworthy!
But we have
we have already increased our security staff.
and will probably not need your detective services..,
All right, it's about time for us to go again. Come.
Yes.
Oh, no! Darling!
Oh, really! How dare you!
Watch where you're going!
Oh, I'm sorry, I...
You saved us.
Thank you, young lady,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Ran, you're amazing!
Thank you so much. You're not hurt, are you?
I'm fine! Just like my father, I have a robust nature!
Oh, you took my words to heart just now? Sorry!
But believe me: The Môri family is really robust!
Really, Sonoko!
Kudô-kun?
Did something happen?
Ah, no. It's nothing.
Oh! This is great!
It's made of a super-light fabric that our group's textile fiber manufacturer
of our group of companies has developed brand new!
Since the sleeves are a little tighter, you can move around without them flapping.
It's not like me, but I'm a martial arts fan....
But can I really keep this?
Sure, sure! And by the way: I was also
a little bit involved in the design of this suit!
You were?
Yes! Call me "Sonoko, the charismatic star designer" from now on!
In this tracksuit...
SHIN'ICHI LOVE
...you are sure to win! This is the power of love!
- Ah, about that... - What's the matter?
She can't wear the suit at the tournament,
What, really?
No... Depending on the tournament, there are rules for the fighting suits.
Sorry, Sonoko!
But I'll give it my all in training!
I guess there's nothing I can do. But then you have to win, right?
I'm sorry for you too.
It's okay.
Unfortunately, we can't watch, but good luck anyway, okay?
Thanks!

After all, we didn't buy you a cell phone....
Yes...
I have to buy dinner before I go home.
Fine. We'll buy your cell phone another time!
Yeah. Take care!
Take care of yourself.
Oh!
I left my wallet at your place!
Really...
KUDÔ
Shin'ichi?
Shin'ichi? I've got it and I'm leaving!
Yes...
I'm really amazed all the time... So many books!
And all of them are crime novels!
Also because he read them all,
your father could become such a world-famous crime writer!
You, on the other hand, have only become a crime fiction freak.
Be quiet.
And then your mother is the legendary film diva Yukiko Fujimine...
That's really enviable.
It's not that great.
Say, Shin'ichi... Your first love must have been your mother, right?
S... s... surely not!
Then who was it?
Me... my first love, that was of course....
That was...?
My first love was...
Stop it, Professor Agasa!
How's your homework coming along?
I thought you were getting sleepy, so...
You're awake now, aren't you?
Hold still, Professor!
I'm sorry.
So, what did you experiment with this time?
Oh, so you do care!
It doesn't.
If you really insist that much, I'll tell you.
Tadaah! This is a rocket for everyday life, tadaah!
"Tadaah" is a bit of an exaggeration...
Once it's developed, there'll be no more traffic jams...
and I'll be a rich man!
And also no more accidents and I'm a rich man!
But isn't this thing dangerous?
It's still a kind of rocket!
What are you saying!
With all my inventions, safety always comes first!
That was just a coincidence.
- Shin'ichi... - Pro... Professor!
He's hopeless.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
What?!
Shut up, it's annoying. Stop complaining.
I don't feel like spending time with d/r/ either.
It's just that... Ran has...
Of course parents support their children!
I'm just saying:
Could it be that you have more important work to do first?
You didn't have a single job this month either, did you?
Don't give me that crap!
I've already found three critters this month!
Three critters?
What?!
Is the great master detective looking for lost dogs?
It's not dogs! It's cats! And don't underestimate it!
The other day I saw a diva having a fling with her producer...
What? You bet it's a case!
- A super-mega-case! - I'll call you when dinner's ready.
This busybody! He's taking the piss out of everyone!
That company director...
Why do you think he chose such a conspicuous place...
in such a conspicuous place?
He probably thinks
we wouldn't cause any problems in such a place. And he underestimates us.
If he has any accomplices with him..,
they'll be able to hide in the crowd.
So it's a trap after all?
According to Bourbon, this director is pretty tight with the Deisan-kai!
Is he?
This guy really has a good nose....
Hm...
But even so...
As long as we know about it, it's not a problem.
As soon as he tries anything, he's dead.
HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS KARATE CHAMPIONSHIPS
Stop it!
- Whoo-hoo! - Super!
Blue: Jödan-geri, one point!
Blue wins!
Super, super! Ran is just great!
Your next fight is the final, finally!
Ha! She can do that with her left hand, with her left hand!
The fact that she's so strong in competitions..,
she gets that from me, her father!
Let's pray that she doesn't get carried away like you and lose
- and loses the ground under her feet. - Huh?
But Ran is my daughter, so we don't have to worry about that.
You miserable...
Ran!!! Give it your all in the finals, too, yeah?
But...
Where did that guy go again, of all times!
Yes... Yeah!
All right. I'm on my way, Commissioner.
I'm on my way, commissioner.
We now come to the final match
in the girls' kumite.
Red: Hina Wada from Haido High School.
Yes!
Blavu: Ran Môri from Teitan High School.
Yes!
Begin!
Go for it!
- Give it all you've got! - Stay calm!
Yes, yes! That's it! That's it, that's it!
Take it easy, Ran!
Stop it!
WADA
Red: Chüdan-geri, half a point! Keep going! Start!
Stop!

Really... What are you doing, Ran!
Ran! Show some spirit!
Fighting spirit!
And have guts! Guts!
Super guts!
HAIDO
Super guts!
Take it easy!
TEITAN
Shin'ichi?
What?
A... case...?
A case?
It's really always the same!
Over and over again it's "one case, one case!"
You miserable crime fiction freak!!!
I wish you would stop doing that.
I don't have time for your fruitless investigations anyway!
Please don't say things like that!
After all, it is undoubtedly the case
that the culprit is among these people.
Then find this culprit, and hurry up!
We already know.
We know who the culprit was.
Oh, Kudô-kun! We've been expecting you!
Sorry it took so long.
What kind of guy is he? He seems pretty young to me...
Have you forgotten? We met the other day at the Suzuki house.
The Suzuki house?
What are we hiding! He's the famous high school detective..,
who has solved countless cases!
The high school detective...
Mr. Yamazaki, director of the Beika Bank, was murdered in one of the guest rooms
in one of the guest rooms on the third floor at a time when the celebration
when the party was in full swing.
The cause of death was a fatal stabbing.
The room door was locked from the inside
and the key was in Mr. Yamazaki's pocket.
Only the French window to the balcony facing the courtyard was open.
In a nutshell:
The perpetrator entered from the balcony,
stabbed Mr. Yamazaki, who was resting,
...and then fled through the French windows.
But there were no footprints under the balcony!
And the rooms around the guest room were
were locked with keys!
Yes.
In fact, there were no footprints under the balcony
and the windows around were locked.
Then how did the perpetrator...?
He came flying.
What?!
It can't be!
There, there!
But Kudô-kun!
Of course he didn't fly through the air!
But there's a smaller window diagonally across from the crime scene.
The perpetrator jumped from there to the guest room window.
Don't give me that crap!
Those two windows are at least five meters apart!
No one could get that far...
Along the edge of the roof next to the small window
there is a narrow ledge.
If you continue on the ledge until it meets the house wall,
it's only a meter or two to the balcony.
Briefly:
The perpetrator knows exactly about the structure of this house.
And he can move freely through the house,
without arousing suspicion.
Come on, tell me!
Who killed Yamazaki?
The killer...
is you.
Mr. Yamazaki's close friend.
and the master of this house.
You, Mr. Takanori Sewal.
E... don't talk crap!
How could I with this leg...
The proof is in!
How dare you, you brat!
- Va... Father, father! - Mr. Seva...
M... My dear...
Your leg...
When I met you at the Suzuki house, I saw it.
When you braked the wheelchair, you put this very leg against the ground!
It has been healed for a long time, hasn't it? Your leg...
V... damn!
W... wait!
You can't escape us!
Tooooor!
Oh dear, now you've bailed us out again, Kudô-kun!
You're welcome!
Next time you have a tricky case.
just turn to master detective Shin'ichi Kudô again!
HIS NAME: SHIN'ICHI KUDÔ! CONCLUSION BAFFLES ADULTS
Have you heard?
Another tour de force from the high school detective!
Yes! He's just great, isn't he?
MASTER DETECTIVE KUDÔ SOLVES THE MYSTERY OF THE MURDER BEHIND CLOSED DOORS!
You have to admit:
This kid is the savior of the Japanese police!
Ouch, what are you doing!
You're grinning like an idiot!
Are you mad at me for something?
Of course not. Just because of what you did.
my father's office is going from bad to worse,
doesn't mean I'm mad at you!
Aaagh!
But the fact that your father doesn't get any orders is not because of me
but because of his abilities...
That's why I'm telling you: I'm not angry at all!
The karate club boss, as she lives and breathes.

Really...
Everyone's fawning over you and praising you as a master detective...
but you're just a crime-fiction geek.
But look how much fan mail I get!
Everybody says they love this crime freak!
They do?
TO KUDÔ-KUN
You're welcome to flirt and joke around, but...
but settle on one you're serious about!
You want me to be serious...
I mean it.
What's the matter?
You've been staring at me the whole time!
Ah, it's nothing...
You'll regret it one day if you keep sticking your nose...
in cases like this!
Maybe.
Why do you want to be a detective?
If you love detective stories so much..,
you could be a detective writer like your father.
I don't want to be a detective.
I want to be one.
I want to become the Sherlock Holmes of the 21st century!
The more difficult a case is, the more exciting it is!
The thrill of finally driving the culprit into a corner.
I finally drive the culprit into a corner! This delight!
Once you start, you never get enough.
Of being a detective.
Let's go!
Wait, Shin'ichi!
You remember our date, don't you?
Date?
You said yourself
you'd take me to Tropical Land if I won the tournament!
What are you talking about?
Well, never mind. I didn't really want to go with you anyway.
Why don't you go have fun with your pen pals?
Come on, it was just a joke! Don't get mad.
I remember.
Tomorrow at eleven:
Tropical Land.
How could I forget?
And don't forget: Everything's on your bill!
Oh dear, that's right...
H... Hey, wait a minute! Ran!
Really? We're finally back in Japan, and...
and you're leaving without meeting Shin-chan?
And we went to so much trouble..,
to surprise him with our disguises!
Now all that was for nothing!
Well, we only came back to get some old documents.
We can save the disguise for another occasion.
Besides...
As it is,
we'd only be disturbing him anyway.
I want to disturb and piss him off, though.
TROPICAL LAND
Here, you must be thirsty!
Thank you...
Come on, come on!
Hey, where are we going, Shin'ichi?
Just follow me, come on!
Ten, nine, eight,
seven,
six, five,
four, three,
two, one,
zero!
How great, how great!
It's amazing!
You like... You like that, don't you?
Yes!
And what's really amazing about Holmes...
When he meets his companion Watson..,
he deduces from a single handshake
that he was a military doctor in Afghanistan!
And it's like this!
You're in a gymnastics club, aren't you?
Where... how do you know that?
Know what? Do you know him?
No...
Your hand gives it away.
A girl with such calluses on her palm
can almost only be a gymnast!
But in tennis, for example, she'd get them too!
Oh, I'm just kidding. In fact, just now,
when the wind blew up her skirt, I saw...
The unmistakable bruise, which is only found on uneven bars gymnasts.
gymnasts.
A detective must always watch carefully,
no matter what the situation!
Don't act so smug!
That you recognized it from her handshake was bogus!
Hey there, peck!
Don't you dare make a move on Hitomi, okay?
Is he a friend of yours?
Uh jg
In that case, shall we let you go first?
No, no, we don't have to!
It wouldn't be nice to disturb them...
Ran...
The thing is, I fell in love with you a long time ago...
Shin'ichi, I feel the same way!
Shin'ichi!
Shin'ichi?
Shin'ichi, come on!
...Yes!
- We hope you had fun! - Please get out carefully.
- That was scary! - I want to go again!
And then Holmes actually...
Two more passengers, please!
Do you understand?
I'm sure what Arthur Conan Doyle meant to say was that Holmes...
Stop it with your Conan Doyle and your Holmes, will you?
You crime fiction freak!
I've been looking forward
I've been looking forward to coming here with you...
How come you just don't notice how I feel?
Ran...
Ran, listen...
Here's the thing, I...
You're really stupid!
Why are you getting so upset!
It was just an act!

Wha... 2!
Damn...
Oh, you took it seriously?
If you fall for tricks like that, you'll never be a good detective!
Here we go!
Have a good time!
But...
That I was looking forward to it is true!
NEW NEWS
GET AWAY AGAIN
What, we're not going to the field?
Come on. We're pulling out.
They want us to run again.
What? Are you going to drive that?
What is that, water?
Tastes salty.
What is it?
What?!
- We hope you had fun! - Please step down carefully...
- E... an accident! - Call an ambulance immediately!
And contact the police!
PREFECTURAL POLICE
TROPICAL LAND
Why was Kishida-kun...?
Shin'ichi!
What an unlucky guy.
Anyway, it was an accident. So we'll take the liberty of leaving.
Wait.
That was no accident.
This was murder.
And the murderer was in the same car with the victim,
it's one of the seven of us!
Shin'ichi...
Pah! I don't have time for this.
Excuse me, sir!
Please let us through!
Excuse me!
Here it is.
Oh! Kud6-kun!
And Ran-kun's here too!
Ah, Commissioner Megure!
Kudô?
Oh! So this is the famous high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô!
The one who solves one unsolved case after another?
The savior of the Japanese police!
Come on, look, there! That's KudS-kun, that's Kudô-kun!
Now let's see him live in action!
Well, uh...
I mean, really...
I see.
In fact, there's no sign of an accident or malfunction on the roller coaster car.
there's no sign of an accident or malfunction.
And the circumstances make
that suicide is unlikely.
Yes. Therefore, Commissioner...
It was obviously murder,
but who killed him, and how?
Inspector...
Those passengers who were on the roller coaster, please stay here.
All others, please withdraw from this area.
NO ADMISSION
Please leave!
There's room for eight people in the car.
If we exclude you and Ran-kun for now..,
there are five suspects.
The victim's girlfriend A, who was sitting in the front row..,
as well as the victim's girlfriend B.
Then the victim's girlfriend C,
who was sitting next to the victim, and who was also his mistress.
And the men D and E in the black suits,
who were sitting in the row behind the victim.
But all of these suspects could not move because
the security bars were closed.
This means that woman C, who was sitting next to him, was actually
the only one who could have killed him.
No, the men behind him could have done it too.
Please hurry, will you?
We don't have time to play along with your detective game.
Brother...
I'm sorry,
but you have to stay here.
What's that? What a cold look this guy has!
He looks like he's already killed countless people without moving!
W... what kind of man is he?
Commissioner!
Huh? What's wrong, Chiba-kun?
In that lady's bag...
we found this...
N... No?! I've never seen that thing before!
Aiko! Why did you do that?
N... no! That wasn't me!
I thought everything was going well between you two?
Why?
Believe me! It wasn't me!
Well, you see? It's clear: the culprit was that woman.
Come on, hurry up, let's go, Mr. Policeman,
They found the culprit much faster than I thought.
She seemed suspicious to me from the start.
Relationship troubles as a reason... Women scare me.
Good! Arrest her as the suspected perpetrator!
Follow me.
D... This can't be...
And we'll take the particulars of the other people on the roller coaster...
to be on the safe side.
You don't have a problem with that, do you?
Please wait.
Huh? What's wrong, Kud6ö-kun?
She's not the perpetrator.
Sh... Shin'ichi?
Kudo-kun...
The real culprit,
The one who killed Kishida-san on that train..,
That's you!
Wha... what are you saying?
What are you saying? You saw that the knife was in Aiko's handbag!
But you can't cut someone's head off with a knife like that.
Even less with the strength of a woman.
Besides... If she really was the culprit,
she could have easily thrown it away.

She didn't have to hide it wrapped up in her bag!
Isn't it rather the case that you put the knife in Aiko-san's pocket in advance
in advance in order to frame her for the murder?
E... don't talk nonsense!
I was sitting two rows ahead of the row where Kishida-kun died!
How could I cut off his head?
And anyway... You just said that..,
...that with a woman's strength, it wouldn't be possible!
With that alone, it really isn't possible.
But with the help of the speed of the course
and a piano or steel wire loop it is!
Commissioner Megure! With the help of your officers
I'd like to reconstruct the sequence of events.
Yes.
Very well,
All right, pay attention!
I'm the perpetrator, so I'll play Hitomi-san.
And you, Inspector Megure, will play Kishida-san.
Okay.
First of all, before I fold down the hanger..,
I put a bag or something behind me..,
and then close it.
If I then remove the bag before doing the deed, there will be enough free space and
I can easily slip out from under the hanger.
Then I take a pre-prepared piano or steel wire loop with a hook at the other end.
with a hook at the other end,
climb onto the safety bar, stretch out backwards and put the noose around the
and put the noose around the victim.
All this, of course, in the pitch dark tunnel.
Finally, I hang the hook on the other end to the
to the railing of the roller coaster.
Then the speed and power of the coaster ensure
that the victim is decapitated.
Q... Nonsense! In a moving roller coaster car, no one could possibly...
Yes, they could.
You do gymnastics.
Maybe not another woman,
but you, with your practiced sense of balance.
can do it in a moving train.
- How dare you! Stop it there... - Where's your necklace?
I mean the pearl necklace
that you wore around your neck
before you got on the train.
You had replaced the thread of the necklace with piano wire.
And you hid the hook attached to it in your pocket.
Wait a minute. Even if it happened the way you say..,
...the two men behind Kishida-kun...
...could've committed the murder much more easily.
No.
They look very suspicious, but they're not the ones who did it.
Why not?
I don't know what their intentions were when they took the train..,
but since the police arrived,
they suddenly seem to want to get out of here, and that's strange.
If they were the perpetrators, surely they would have known that all this was happening.
That's the way it is.
The perpetrator knew. That the victim was going to die.
That's why her tears came!
What is this, water?
From the moment we realized the victim was dead until we got here,
it didn't take too long.
In other words, only the perpetrator herself could shed tears that big,
while we were still driving.
Are you saying..,
you saw Hitomi crying on the roller coaster?
Can you prove it?
The traces of her tears are irrefutable proof.
Only on a roller coaster or something like that...
do you have tears
tears flow from the sides of your eyes..,
E... it's...
It's all his own fault!
He left me!
Hi... Hitomi! Did you used to date
...with Kishida-kun?
Yes!
Long before we met you in college..,
...we were a couple, and we loved each other.
And then Aiko... that woman has everything...
That's why...
That's why...
In a roller coaster, where we had our first date,
with the necklace he had given me,
and blaming Aiko for it...
That's how I wanted to kill him!!!
Afterwards, we found in her handbag
a large quantity of sleeping pills.
From the looks of it, she was planning to follow Kishida-san to his death after the murder.
A few hours later...
the chain with which she had committed the murder was found.
The string had indeed been replaced by wire and almost all the beads scattered.
The few that were still there gave off a pale glow in the sunset.
It was almost as if they were big, round tears....
Oh, come on, stop crying already.
I'm amazed that you remain so unmoved!
Oh, I'm just used to crime scenes, scattered body parts and all....
- You're horrible! - Don't!

Just forget about all that as quickly as possible. Look,
this often happens.
No, it doesn't!
That man there...
That's the weird guy from the roller coaster!
- You always said that at the amusement park... - Sorry Ran.
You go ahead by yourself.
I'll catch up with you in a minute!
Shin'ichi!
He's leaving...
Shin'ichi...
For some reason, I had a premonition then.
That I would never see Shin'ichi again after that...
A very bad premonition...
TROPICAL LAND
Shit...
I lost him...
Thanks for waiting...
Mr. Director...
There he is!
I... I came alone, as agreed!
Yes. We know that you came alone.
We made sure of that from the roller coaster.
A... so come on, give me the...
Don't be hasty.
First the money.
You don't mind, do you?
Oh, my God! There must be 100 million here.
All right. The deal is perfect,
So, give me the movies!
Films?
Here you go.
The negatives and prints that prove your company smuggles guns.
You shouldn't do such evil things.
Shut up!
Compared to what your organization does, we're...
Hey!
What exactly do you know about us?
Huh?
Ah, don't...
Consider yourself
lucky to get away with only 100 million for your life!
Now pack up your company and take it somewhere else!
We want to build
to build a new laboratory on that piece of land, you know?
J... Yes, sir.
Hey, hey, are you serious?
No more playing
No more playing detective!
B... Brother!
You idiot!
You let that brat chase you...
That brat...
The detective from before!
Damn you! Should I kill him?
I'd rather not. Because of what happened earlier.
there're still cops all over the place!
What do we do with him?
We'll use this.
The poison the organization has developed from scratch.
They say it's undetectable in the body.
It makes the perfect crime possible...
But it's a prototype that hasn't been tested on humans yet.
Brother! We must hurry!
Yes.
Farewell, master detective.
Damn ♪
I'm so hot!
It is... it's like my bones are melting!
Damn it...
I can't...
... I can't...
Hey! Come here!
There's a dead man.
What?
So I actually died?
No! He's still breathing!
Quick! Call an ambulance!
I'm still alive? I see!
So the poison doesn't work on humans! Lucky me!
That looks bad. He's bleeding from a head wound.
The police? And a lot of them...
Good. I'm going to expose the evil machinations of these guys now!
Hey, come on! Can you stand up?
Kid?
You okay, kid?
"Kid"?
What are they saying? I'm in the second grade of high school!
Where did you get that head wound?
Wound?
Oh, yeah!
The man in black
hit me from behind...
Avutsch...
Well, two!
What's wrong with my clothes?
You must have been terrified, huh, kid? But
we're here now, and everything's fine again.
D... he's lifting me up like I'm light?!
We found a boy with a head wound under the Ferris wheel.
We're taking him to the doctor,
Uh... He's about six or seven.
Probably an elementary school kid.
Elementary 2! Vo... who are they talking about?
DETECTIVE MÔRI
I'm back!
Oh, you're back, Ran?
Oh, really! It's chaos here again!
That's why you can't get any work!
And mom left you!
Shut up! I choose my orders!
But... Where's that guy who likes to play detective?
Didn't you go out with him today?
I'll catch up with you in a minute!
I wonder what's going on with Shin'ichi?
You guys had a fight, huh?
Forget about him.
Detectives are useless anyway.
You're a detective yourself!
SANCTUARY
But if I tell you!
I saw them!
That gunrunner and the other one who blackmailed him!
But then a third one spotted me and hit me from behind!
There, there, kid. You've been watching too many crime shows.
I'm not a "kid"! I'm in the second grade of high school!
It's strange... Something's not right here.

We just checked.
There's no missing persons report that matches him.
How they react to me...
My loose clot...
And...
my shimme.
Damn... This can't be happening!
No. No matter how improbable..,
there's only one...
What the... 2!
This can't be happening!
Did I actually shrink?!
Because he doesn't want to go home, he says whatever comes to his mind,
You mean he probably ran away from home?
We'll have to contact the police
and take him to the police kindergarten.
Ki... Kindergarten?!
So, kid...
E... he's gone!
The window! He's gone through the window!
Don't make jokes! I'm not gonna be deported!
Hey! Kid!
He's huge!
There he is! Over there!
Damn it!
Wait, kid!
Come on! Did I do something wrong or what?
- Hello! - Kid!
Hello!
Hey!
DETECTIVE AGENCY MÔRI INCOMING CALL
DETECTIVE MÔRI - Ran!
That's it! When Ran comes to pick me up here....
But with the voice I have now....
And this body...
Damn it!
I got it! At least I got a message...
No, forget it. I could never explain that to her.
Someday you'll regret it if you keep sticking your nose...
...into cases like this...
Look over there!
Damn it! Damn it! Damn...
Damn it!
DETECTIVE AGENCY MÔRI INCOMING CALL
Hello, this is Kudô.
I'm not at home.
Please leave your message after the beep.
He's not at home either...
He's out having dinner with his father, that famous writer,
with his father, that famous writer...
What are you saying!
His parents have been living in America for three years!
Shin'ichi is living alone right now!
Oh, really?
Something must have happened after that.
I'm going to see Shin'ichi!
What?
Hey! What about my dinner?
I can't believe I got so winded just running around...
And this body...
What happened to me?
Wait a minute!
I remember...
After he hit me...
Let's use the poison that the organization has developed from scratch.
However, it's a prototype that hasn't been tested on humans yet.
Am I, because I swallowed this poison...?
Is it possible?
Are you crazy? Don't stand in the middle of the street!
Watch it, you fucking brat!
III "Kid", eh?
That's pathetic,
Damn it!
Ah, what a bummer!
Can't I even get into my own house?!
KUDÔ
I can't do anything like this!
Oh no, not good at all!
Professor Agasa!
Who are you?
It's me!
Shin'ichi!
So, you're related to Shin'ichi, my boy?
That's right, you look just like him when he was little.
No! I'm Shin'ichi!
Look! Shin'ichi Kud6ö, 2nd grade of Teitan High School!
Hey, Shin'ichi! You have a visitor!
Ah! He just doesn't believe me!
Ah! Aauauaua...
Hey, are you all right?
Then let me tell you a little about yourself!
Hiroshi Agasa, 52 years old.
Eccentric inventor, lives in the house next to mine.
Claims to be a genius, but only produces junk.
Has a birthmark on his butt with a thick hair!
A... on my butt...
A... but only Shin'ichi knows that!
Is that guy telling
my secrets all over the place?
I haven't heard about it, no, I b/n Shin'ichi!
A strange poison made me shrink!
You shrank... shrunk?
Yes.
Poison?
Ha, if there were such a poison, I'd like to see it!
Come with me, you shady kid! I'll take you to the police!
In that case... What do you say:
You've just come home from the Colombo Restaurant...
And in quite a hurry,
How do you know?
Because of your clothes.
You can see that you got wet in the front, but not in the back.
So you ran through the rain.
Also, there's mud on your pants.
What?
Around here, the only place where mud splashes up is at the construction site in front of the "Colombo"" Mud splashes up.
In addition, there are traces of the characteristically colored Colombo meat sauce
on your mustache.
D... that is, you...
It's obvious, my dear Agasa.
Sh... Shin'ichi...
Are you really Shin'ichi?

I've been saying it all along! I was shrunk with a poison!
I still can't believe it.
Scientifically speaking, it can't be.
But the thing about the birthmark on my...
Just let me in my house!
What did you say?
Wha... Gunrunning?
Yes.
I saw two guys blackmailing another guy for it.
And then they gave you poison to shut you up?
I see.
And your body was damaged by an unintended side effect...
of this unfinished poison?
That's exactly how it is.
I beg you, professor! You are a genius!
Develop a remedy that will change me back!
Don't ask for the impossible!
As long as I don't know the ingredients of the poison...
How uncool... My kid clothes fit me perfectly.
So we have to find out where the guys are and get the poison.
Yeah. If we had the poison, maybe I could do something, but...
Shin'ichi!
You can't tell anyone else that you shrunk!
Why?
You're still alive.
But if they recognize you as Shin'ichi Kudô,
they will try to kill you again!
And that would also put the people around you in danger.
Do you understand?
That you are really Shin'ichi Kud6 must remain a secret between us!
You can't tell anyone else! Ran-kun, of course!
Yes, I understand.
Shin'ichi? Are you home?
No kidding! At least answer the phone if you're home!
And the door was still open!
1 NEW CALL
. there... that's Ran!
M... Shit, hide, quick!
Ve... Hide? But where?
Wha... Professor Agasa!
Oh, look at that! Long time no see, Ran-kun!
Where's Shin'ichi?
Ah, he was here until just now, but...
But, uh...
- But then he... - Daddy's glasses! Dress up, dress up!
Who is this boy?
Ah, uh... That's, uh... well, uh...
There, there, you're a little shy, aren't you?
Come on, turn to me.
G... not good...
D... that boy...
Damn...
...Is Yes lovely!
I... her breast...
Tell me, Professor, who is this boy?
Ah, uh... The son of a distant relative of mine...
How old are you?
Ah... sixty... Uh, no... I'm six!
Oh, so you're in the first grade?
...Yes!
And what's your name?
I... My name is... Shin... uh, no...
Uh, uh...
Uh... My name is...
RAMPO EDOGAWA CONAN DOYLE
Conan.
Uh... My name is Conan Edogawa!
Ow damn it! I just blurted it out!
Conan? That's an unusual name,
Uh, my dad's a big fan of Arthur Conan Doyle, so...
Somehow you remind me... of Shin'ichi...
- Doyle's good, but you need drill! - Professor?
Conan? What are you doing? You're not a foreigner!
It's not my fault! I couldn't think of anything else!
Oh, by the way, Ran-kun... Do you think it's possible..,
...he could stay with you for a while?
What? What? What?
That's not funny...
His parents are in the hospital because of an accident...
...and they've asked me to take care of him..,
but in my bachelor household...
Hm... I'd like to, but I'd have to discuss it with my father.
Oh, really? You'd take him in?
What if they find out who I am while I'm living at Ran's house!
Listen to me first! I'm sure the men will soon find out
that your body hasn't been found!
Then they'll suspect the people who come and go here first.
But then I could live with you too!
To change you back,
we first have to find the guys who poisoned you.
That's true, of course, but...
And Ran-kun's father runs a detective agency...
Oh, I see. That might be a good way to get some information about them!
That's right.
Hey, Professor!
Jal, I want to go home with you!
How sweet!
Good. Ask Shin'ichi to call me when he gets home, will you?
Yeah, all right.
Well then, Uncle! Bye-bye!
See you soon, Co... Conan-kun!
Now, the rest is up to you, Shin'ichi, uh, no...
Conan Edogawa!
Say, Conan-kun...
Conan-kun?
What, Ran-nechan?
I'll never get used to that name!

Is there a girl you like?
Surely you have a girl you think about often?
N... no, I don't...
But I do!
One that I think about all the time!
Could it be that boy named Shin'ichi you were looking for earlier?
That's right.
He's been mean to me since we were little..,
and is a cocky crime-fighting freak.
But when it comes down to it, you can count on him, he's brave and cool.
I'm incredibly fond of Shin'ichi!
But you can't tell him that!
...[]a.
You're the only one I've told this to.
You really can't ever tell Shin'ichi, okay?
...[]a.
So, this is where I live.
DETECTIVE AGENCY MÔRI CAFE POIROT
It's like I suddenly have a little brother.
As if I could tell you everything...
Ran...
Dad's here, I'll introduce you.
Come on, let's go.
Listen Ran...
E... here's the thing, I...
What's wrong?
Actually, I'm...
Yay! I did it!
What's the matter, Pop?
I got one, I got one, I got one! A job!
The first real assignment in six months!
Hey, that's dangerous! What kind of a job is this?
Men in black suits kidnapped a daughter from a rich family!
Men in black suits?
Conan-kun!
Wait, you men in black!
I'm going to find out where you're hiding, get that poison..,
And when I'm transformed..,
I'll expose all your evil deeds!
And so I went,
to track down the men in black,
to Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
But that old man is a really bumbling detective.
Unbearable! And so I took his place
using deductive powers and gadgets developed by Professor Agasa...
I solved one tricky case after another.
Then Dr. Narumi intended to die in the process from the very beginning....
- Narumi-san! - Don't, Conan-kun!
Let go of me, Ran-nechan!
What's that noise?
It's a code...
Narumi-san is playing the piano...
Amidst the flames...
You idiot!
Conclusions are never about
about "won" or "lost"...
Because there is...
only one truth!
Tell me, Hattori...
Have you
Have you ever killed a man?
Huh?
You idiot...
A detective who drives a perpetrator to suicide with his conclusions..,
is nothing but a murderer.
Hattori...
When you've ruled out the impossible, what's left is..,
no matter how unbelievable it may seem, is the truth.
I told you, this is the last chance.
Ma... Masami-san!
Ran-nechan, call an ambulance!
- And tell Uncle Kogoro! - Okay!
It's no use...
It's too late.
Don't talk! Or your wound will...
Kid...
You're the kid who was in the detective agency, right?
The organization...?
That's right.
A mysterious, far-flung organization.
I was at the bottom of it. All I know is..,
is that their color, their trademark, is "black."
"Black"?
That's right.
What their members prefer to wear,
are... black suits,
black as ravens...
Oh no?!
The men in black?
I'm counting on you,
my little detective...
There are countless terms to describe him.
"Lupin of the 21st century",
"moonlight magician," and so on.
But he has a pseudonym by which the vast majority of people know him.
Pseudonym?
He wraps policemen around his finger as if they were children.
And when a young writer interested in this "Master Thief 1412",
saw this number 1412, he read it like this:
"K-1-D."
K-1-D?!
But... that's...
Genav.
Master Thief 1412...
Also known as...
"Kaitö Kid "1
Kid... There's more to you than meets the eye.
I'm Conan Edogawa, detective.
Yes, that's right.
I'm on my way to shoot the TV drama.
It will be the last shoot for the series, after which I can go.
So you want me to make sure Pisco doesn't screw up?
I was planning on going anyway.
I want to see him again.
I'm gonna hang up now, because I gotta go...
...to get rid of the FBI kitty.
See you there, Gin.
Shoot! Move it! Out of my way!
Move it!
Forget it.
But Shü...

With your driving skills
you won't catch up with them.
But rest assured. I know where she's going.
What? Where?
To Japan.
TWO MONTHS LATER
SHIN'ICHI, WHERE ARE YOU?

And you told me that you had something to do at someone's house
at someone's house in Beika.
Oh yes, Shin'ichi Kudô's house.
That was the name! Conan lives with a detective near there.
And what about the boy?
There's something wrong with him.
For his age he is always very calm.
Somehow he seems very grown up.
I see.
