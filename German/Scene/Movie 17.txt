Is that
is that...
Oh... oh no!
Patrol Kurata
to Wakasa Central.
Urgent!
In the fourth district
there is a boat with explosives and a detonator...
Next reports.
A ship has been found in Maizuru Bay,
SELF-DEFENSE MARINE
that appears suspicious...
SUSPICIOUS SHIP IN MAIZURU BAY
Maizuru Bay is here, isn't it?
Yes.
Has something happened?
What's going on?
A suspicious ship was found this morning.
Huh?
Why suspicious?
Hey, you peckers!
Move up and don't leave a gap!
Yes!
TOKYO SPIRITS FINALE COMING UP!!
Hey, Pops!
As the person in charge, you should watch the kids!
Don't be a pain!
I'm just here dutifully as an escort.
SELF-DEFENSE NAVY AEGIS WARSHIP "HOTAKA"
Being allowed on an Aegis warship is extremely rare!
They were really hard to get!
It's just too bad it's not a betting ticket.
Menno!
No matter where he is, Uncle is only thinking about one thing.
What is an
an Aegis warship?
- Um... - Aegis warships are ships
with a weapon system
developed by the United States Navy.
They are insanely powerful!
Yes!
That was pretty easily explained.
Are you interested in that too?
No.
But I like the sea. And it's an asset.
That's true. It's rare to have an experience like that.
- That signal... - Forget about the races.
- Yes, yes... - Ah!
Conan-kun?
I'm going to the bathroom!
Please hurry!
It's almost our turn.
Yes!
What is it, Professor?
1ST INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE FORUM
I just wanted to test
the newly developed satellite phone.
We're not even on the ship yet.
What? It's taking you guys a long time.
Yeah. I guess the discovery of the suspect vessel
must have increased the security check.
I see.
Perhaps it would be best, for the time being,
...not to use the satellite phone for the time being.
By the way, did the meeting in Osaka go well?
Yes. Thanks to Ai-kun's help.
It was a complete success.
Good. When the maneuver is over, I could come and see you.
- Ah! I should get back... - By the way...
If you've had to wait this long, the children must be bored.
No, not at all...
Okay. I'll give you a quiz.
That's why you called, isn't it?
I'm sure you know that the "Aegis" from Aegis warship...
comes from Aigis, the shield that casts out evil,
which Zeus gave to his daughter Athena.
This Zeus is said to have
during the fight against the Hydra
was bitten everywhere by the sharp teeth of the Hydra.
But in one place he was not bitten.
Which place is that?
First, the neck.
Second, the chest.
Third, the abdomen.
Fourth, the hip.
So he said.
I should definitely ask you this trivia question.
Conan-kun, when did you talk to the professor?
Huh? Ah... When I was in the bathroom just now.
I have no idea.
I give up.
What's the solution?
It's fourth, the hip.
Why?
Kaminokoshi (God's hip). Left to bite.
What? Another pun?
Next, please have your card ready and advance.
Ah, it's our turn!
Hooray!
- I'm already tired from waiting. - Hey, there's no running!
Open your bags
and give them
to the staff for inspection.
Cell phones are not allowed on the ship.
We will keep them here for you.
WARSHIP HOTAKA
Thank you for participating in the Navy's public maneuver today.
public maneuver.
I am Inoue, and I will be showing you around the ship today.
around the ship today.
Here's to good fellowship.
WELCOME TO THE AEGIS SHIP
I will now explain the details of today's maneuver.
SKETCH OF THE SHIP'S INTERIOR
Please look at the sketch behind me.
The places marked in red may
be freely visited by you.
All other corridors and rooms
please avoid.
More details are also in the brochure in front of you.
Next, I will explain the timing.
Sonoko. What time is it?
- Um... - Ran-neechan, what's wrong with your watch?
It's broken and is in need of repair.
Meanwhile, I've been using my cell phone as a watch....
But it's been collected.
You can have
my watch.
Huh? But what about you?
My digital camera also shows the time. Don't worry.
Punctuality is paramount.
You hear that? Borrow it.

Then thank you, Mitsuhiko-kun.
Please.
She's waterproof. It doesn't mind the sea breeze.
And since it's a radio-controlled watch, it's accurate.
What's a radio-controlled watch?
You don't know?
It's a clock that receives the exact time
the exact time by radio waves.
Oh...
My watch receives it at five in the morning and at five in the evening.
- Where does it receive it from? - Huh?
Well...
The Fukushima transmission tower should be responsible here.
I see.
Conan-kun, you really know your stuff.
That's because Shin'ichi-niichan...
Huh? What's that?
What sounds so scary?
What's that?
What happened?
Calm down. Don't worry.
What?
When the wastewater intake system draws in large amounts
of seawater, it makes this noise.
- Hey, Pops. - Have a seat.
Also, the mouth drainage
the mouth drainage valve seems to be loose.
Be careful.
- Oh, sorry. - Pop!
Please. Sit down.
Huh? Yes.
Oh, boy.
But does sucking water really make such a noise?
...leaving the port of Maizuru.
DETECTIVE ON THE HIGH SEAS DETECTIVE CONAN
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran..,
I observed men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on it,
I didn't notice the man behind me.
He was administering a poison to me.
When I awoke,
my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive,
my friends...
and I will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked what my name was,
I said Conan Edogawa.
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father is a detective.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
These are my classmates.
Genta.
Mitsuhiko.
Ayumi.
They are the Detective Boys,
with me as an unsolicited member.
And
this old man is Kogorô Môri.
Explanation unnecessary, isn't it?
These are inventions
of Professor Agasa.
He develops for me
one unique device after another.
The soccer belt.
One push on the buckle and
a ball pops out. Great!
This time the highlight
is a jazzed-up wristwatch.
Satellite phone
and USB memory.
An excellent part with even more power.
By the way,
besides the professor, someone else knows
knows my identity.
Ai Haibara.
Actually Shiho Miyano.
She belonged
to the Men in Black organization.
In order to escape from them,
she took the poison that I also received,
...which caused her to shrink.
And so
Haibara, who now lives with the professor,
I and the others lead the lives of first graders.
I am small, my mind is not!
No case remains unsolved!
There is always only one truth!
Anti-aircraft combat exercise start!
Sections clear!
Enter anti-aircraft combat.
All hands to your posts at once!
Those with small children
- please step forward. - We will begin the exercise...
Airspace Control!
This is the CIC, the heart
-...of the Aegis warship. - Target detected.
The first target is approaching!
Is it coming towards us?
That's the scenario.
I see.
What are you doing? Scaring me like that.
You're pretty calm.
Yeah, it's got nothing on an act.
This is what you call real, right?
The second target is coming right at us.
The second target is a threat.
Prepare to attack immediately.
Anti-aircraft combat exercise! Target CIC command.
Attack launch!
Guns ready!
Mark 45 Mod 4 is prepared!
Second target locked on, range calculated.
Target is in firing range!
Ready to fire!
Open fire!
Fire!
30 seconds to target!
How now? Just a monitor picture?
But, Dad...
That alone is enormous.
The Aegis ship has the highest security clearance.
You're the first civilians here.
Well, it's all...
...very mysterious.
Second target down.
It's like a game.
Second target, launch confirmed.
Do you think we can handle it?
Of course not!
- I see. - Oh, man. Not you guys, too.
Prepare to fire!
Fire!
Automatic mode.
Mark intercept!
First target losing altitude.
Down to target one, two...
First target down.
What? Did it hit?
Yes. That shot down all enemy targets.
That was great!
- Yeah. - Is it over?
I didn't understand much.

- Well, this is... - Sonar message.
Target alpha, calculate values!
It's approaching the ship!
Target alpha, five degrees,
...8,000 miles.
This is CIC.
Target Alpha detected. 5 degrees, 8,000 miles.
Target Alpha?
Captain.
Yes.
This is Captain Tateishi.
Use all radar
for reconnaissance!
I'm coming into the CIC.
I'm coming with you.
I'm going to the CIC.
The bridge belongs
to the first officer.
Target alpha, readings unchanged.
Set a course directly for the ship.
Roger that, sir. Prepare to make changes!
Prepare for attack from target!
No sign of life forms.
Identification signal unanswered!
Object is not an ally!
Stop ship at present position!
Full stop!
90 degrees port!
Stop with bow to target!
Roger that!
Full stop!
90 degrees port!
Aligned and stopped!
We're really stopping?
Vot guidance suddenly seems quite real.
Very riveting.
Anti-submarine warfare! Flare!
Roger! Signal rocket ready!
Signal missile fire!
Picture on monitor three.
- Wow! - So cool!
Isn't it great? Do you think the light is real?
Hardly.
Prepare for anti-submarine warfare!
Red alert!
Aye, sir!
This ship's about to
- a little rocking in a few minutes. - Get the data confirmed!
I wonder if anything happened.
This is a drill, right?
Of course.
Finally, it's gotten exciting.
No,
this is...
The echo is getting weak.
What is the situation?
Image indistinct,
no identification.
Set SPY.
Confirm target with SH-60K.
- Target continues to approach. - Prepare SH-60K!
- Range 3200 meters. - Coming into torpedo range of target!
What?
Any reaction from the target?
Nothing yet.
Target still closing!
Range 3100 meters!
Within torpedo range of the target. 100 more...
Captain.
How do we proceed?
Prepare to attack.
Wait, Captain!
Such an action
could lead to war!
Target, speed 10, range 3000.
Within firing range of the target.
Keep range at 3000!
Full speed ahead!
Roger that. Full speed ahead!
Evasive action!
Hard to starboard!
Full ahead!
What a tremendous amount of tension.
This is much more gnarly than a game.
A little scary.
No wonder they're scared.
This Aegis warship...
...could really be under attack.
No response.
Approach from port.
I want to see something. Flares!
Prepare flare! Full power on port side!
Prepare torpedo!
CIC to bridge. Engines full power port!
Engines full power port!
Port!
Left tube here.
Projectile loaded!
Torpedo fire!
Light torpedo fire!
Visual coming up!
On monitor three!
Impact coming!
It's going to wobble.
Please watch your children!
Hey. You guys all right?
That was shaky.
It looked great.
Where's his date?
What's that?
A submarine?
No, I don't think so.
Fishing boat?
Shipwreck?
That's...
It's not carrying explosives.
It's a wreck that was swept along
by the current.
Terminating anti-submarine warfare.
Ship resuming public maneuver.
Repeat.
Ship resumes public maneuver.
Notification to forces that...
Is it over?
Ah!
Yes.
This concludes
the antiaircraft and antisubmarine exercise is over.
That was impressive!
Yes! I thought they were really going to fight.
I forgot all about my hunger.
So they make it out to be an exercise.
Well,
enjoy the bow inspection.
Hooray!
These people look so cool.
I want to wear a uniform too.
- What a sight! - Conan-kun, come quickly!
That ship is so huge!
- I wonder how big it is. - The cannon is huge.
The pictures showed..,
...when it was fired.
Come on, Conan-kun, take pictures!
Ah, yes...
Over here!
Yuki, let's go!
- Take my hand. - Isn't that...
Hey, you! So your name's Yûki-kun?
Yes.
That's great.
Your dad's back.
What do you mean?
Son?
Earlier, when the ship was rocking like that..,
you weren't there.
I was worried.
I see. I was in the bathroom.
Oh, so that's how it was.
That's why you were alone.
Let's keep watching,
Yûki.
Yes.
Even in the toilet...
you can feel a swing like that.
But the man was

not in the CIC after the end of the combat exercise.
He only showed up now for the bow inspection.
That's funny.
Hey! Don't walk around here alone!
Menno.
Looked away once and you're gone.
Excuse me.
A female marine on board?
Hey you! Are you ashamed of yourself?
Ah! How cool!
Huh?
There's a woman working here too!
What?!
That's rare. We ask you to take a picture!
- Really! - Wonderful!
Photo! Photo!
Hello you! Ms. Marine.
May we take a photo with you?
A photo?
What a beauty!
Master detective and marine.
That's good.
Young lady,
no, no,
Divine woman soldier, forgive
for bothering you with those brats.
Ah... How?
What's that, Pop?
What? I was just about to ask them for a photo.
- Keep your distance! - Mitsuhiko,
- lend me your digicam. - What? Yes.
Thank you.
Look, everyone!
Ah, no photos...
Photos are allowed, right?
After all...
Now with us on it, right?
Is the greeting okay?
Yes, it is...
Hooray!
- I'm standing next to her! - Me too, me too.
Don't you want to be in the picture?
No, it's okay. You move a little closer.
Yes.
Okay! I'll take the picture.
Ah, sorry!
One more.
- What? Hey!
Do you even know how to do that?
Yes. The setting was wrong.
Okay. Now it's perfect!
Now really!
- Good. And Aegis! - Yeah!
And?
Did it work?
Yeah. This time it's perfect!
Let me see, let me see!
Thanks a lot.
It's okay. I'll say goodbye then.
Tell me, Mrs. Marine!
What is it?
What kind of work do you do here?
I'm... I cook food for everyone.
That's right.
She's lying.
She's a staff officer, first class.
That's captain class around here.
Excuse me, but I have work to do.
I apologize.
Thank you very much.
At least take my card...
Excuse me, sir. Please don't let me keep you.
Huh?
- Shiny gold business cards? - Well done!
Wait!
You beautiful person!
Oh man, this is so embarrassing.
Sorry, Sonoko. Hold this.
How ugly are they?
No matter the crime scene, they should stand out well.
That's why he had new ones printed.
He's just using them wrong...
Mitsuhiko, can I borrow your digicam?
Sure.
Here.
Give this to Ran-neechan.
- Yeah, okay... - I have to go to the bathroom.
- Huh? - Conan-kun!
What's he doing in the bathroom?
By the way, Ai-kun.
What's up?
Do you think my riddle went over well with the kids?
If the answer had been different.
Yes, hello?
Professor, can you check something?
It's you, Shin'ichi?
Yes.
You sent a photo to Ai-kun's cell phone...
Yes.
Got it. I'll check it out.
Tell me..,
Did something happen?
No, but something's bothering me.
Is the photo there?
Yes, it seems to have been sent.
A naval employee.
This one photo, yes?
Yes. Find out her affiliation from the photo, please.
In the self-defense navy, only 4% are women.
Mostly they are used for advertising purposes.
It should be easy.
Yes, good.
I'm sure we'll figure it out quickly.
By the way, the next riddle.... Ah!
Hung up.
That's too bad.
Satellite transmission?
Where on deck?
In the starboard forward section.
That's near the passengers.
Check it out.
Yes.
CIC to all!
Captain!
I wonder if X is among the passengers.
Maybe the shipwreck we saw earlier...
has something to do with X?
X...
This is the radar of the Aegis ship,
its eye.
It doesn't look like it,
...but the radar is picking up targets..,
...over 450 kilometers away.
It can also handle over 200 targets
at the same time.
Wow!
A real master detective at sea.
Totally cool!
That corner...
That's where I was on the phone earlier.
The transmission was detected.
Or...
The Aegis system
...is only given to countries the U.S...
...trusts.
Copy that.
We should call this in just in case.
Yes. I'll continue to check the deck.
Next, I'll brief you
about the SH-60K helicopter
that we're carrying.
Wow. A helicopter.
- Exciting! - What's wrong, Conan-kun?
I'm going to the bathroom.
What? Again?
Wait, Conan-kun!
Huh?
I'm coming with you.

What? You don't have to.
I do! Because otherwise you always disappear right away.
No, I don't.
For example, just now you were gone.
Come on, let's go,
Let's go.
Yes.
I almost got lost when I went to the bathroom earlier, too.
High school girl and still gets lost.
That's right.
no sense of direction.
Seriously, where did you go shopping?
Sorry. I got lost on the way back.
That's why I suggested I go with you.
But...
Don't go off on your own again, okay?
You'll never find your way back.
No problem.
If I get lost,
you'll find me.
Huh?
After all, you are a master detective!
Kaaaalt!
Oh no!
Don't worry.
One or two of your kind
I'll find one or two of you. No matter where.
A hundred percent!
What's up?
NO ADMITTANCE
Weren't the toilets here?
Huh?
I'm sorry. We got lost.
Hey, hey, not really...
What? That scream...
Conan-kun!
Sawamura-san...
- We've sucked in something terrible. - Terrible?
What? Is that...
- You two...
- This is off limits! - Human arm.
- This is intense. - What do we do?
In any case, you'll have to report it to the captain.
Yes, sir!
Ran-neechan, let's tell Uncle Kogoro.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me.
You could ask my father for advice?
What?
That was an arm there on the table.
Well, that's...
My father is Kogorô Môri.
How?
You don't know him?
The sleeping master detective Kogorô?
KAIHOU SCHOOL
What is it, Kudô?
What?
A dead body?
Aboard the Aegis warship?
Well, only the left arm was found.
Nevertheless.
It looked like the arm was stuck in a Marine uniform.
A marine was murdered?
Whether it was murder or accident is still unclear.
But
it was a lieutenant captain.
That makes you think.
Yeah, roger that.
I'm on my way. Let me know.
Gotcha!
Training's already started!
No time. I have to go
to Maizuru.
What?
Maizuru?
Wait up, Heiji!
Nothing there.
Yes.
No satellite transmission equipment.
My transmission has indeed been detected.
X could be there somewhere.
- Yes! - X?
Oh no!
- Wasn't there a noise? - Yes...
Shin'ichi broke off the connection.
Did something happen?
NO CORRESPONDENCE
I wanted to tell him what we found.
We must have made a mistake.
Yes.
There is nothing here.
We'll continue the search.
That was close.
The level of vigilance on an Aegis ship is truly enormous.
I'll have to find...
...find another way.
If I use this, I'll be blown to bits.
This mark...
That indicates a strong magnetic field.
In this room...
I am Captain Tateishi.
You're Môri-san?
Indeed I am. I am Master Detective Kogorô Môri.
Captain Sekiguchi has already taught me.
Sekiguchi, military police.
The police within the Self-Defense Forces?
Yes.
I see.
And the body part in question
is this?
Yes. This arm here.
I see.
Judging from the cut, it was not a sharp edge.
And judging from the wound.
there was no vital response.
Then the arm was severed after death?
Yes.
Where was this arm found?
In the filter of the water intake system.
The water intake system, that was...
When the sewage intake system draws in large amounts
of seawater, it makes this noise.
That's why there was such a noise earlier.
When leaving the harbor
sometimes a lot of garbage is sucked in,
which is driven by the ocean current.
This arm got caught
caught in the filter.
And this filter?
A kind of net
at the water inlet, which is supposed to prevent
that when seawater is sucked in.
large trash, fish and shells from getting into the ship.
How did you find it?
NO ACCESS
If the garbage interferes with the work of the filter,
we collect it for examination.
Usually it is seaweed or plastic....
Do you have any idea who the arm belongs to?
Do you then.
Who is it,
Captain Tateishi?
From the rank insignia on the sleeve
and the watch,
it's probably Lieutenant Captain Sasaura of Wakasa Squad.
The base knows
the whereabouts of Lieutenant Captain Sasaura.
Then it's probably safe.
His watch stopped at 5:30 in the morning.
How can you know that?
You can tell by the course of the calendar.

If the previous day can still be seen,
it is still before noon.
Is Sasaura-san
a crew member of this ship?
Now and then, but
this time he was not assigned.
When we sailed,
was the sewage suction system turned on?
Yes.
We suspect that the arm
from the water valve.
I see.
That means that the body was already floating in the sea...
was already floating in the sea off Maizuru harbor.
And when water was sucked in,
the body was sucked in,
got caught,
and only the left arm reached the filter.
Am I seeing this correctly?
Yes.
That's exactly what happened.
So, when do we return to port?
In the afternoon at half past five.
Not good at all. Judging by the condition of that arm..,
he ought to be examined at once.
That reminds me...
There's a helicopter!
Wow! Wow!
The controls from the ship!
Conan-kun!
Hey! Squirt! Don't just come in here!
I was looking for the helicopter.
and then I heard your voice.
Helicopter?
Yeah, that's it.
That's faster!
But that
would alert the passengers.
Does it matter now?
Môri-san.
If the passengers find out what happened,
there might be a panic.
I'd like to see the helicopter fly.
The way they moved the cannon earlier.
They might say the flight was a demonstration.
Exactly!
That way we'll avoid any leaks.
Captain Tateishi!
This matter requires haste.
Understood.
The helicopter will be ready in a moment.
What? On the Aegis ship?
Yes. Understood.
We'll inform the Kyoto Police.
As soon as we get permission,
we'll come aboard.
Yes. Please do.
The perpetrator could be on board the ship.
Yes.
First, the examination of the arm.
Yes. Thank you.
We will now demonstrate
the launching of the helicopter.
Whoopee!
The launch is dangerous.
Stay behind the tape.
How beautiful.
We made it.
Yes.
Ah, you're...
What's the matter?
Has your dad left again?
You were alone before.
Are you okay?
Where are your parents?
His father should be here.
They must have been separated.
I see.
Your name is Yûki-kun, right?
Yes.
Then you stay with Yûki-kun.
I'll go tell one of the crew members.
No! If you do that...
If I do that...
I... I
am okay.
I'm okay!
Wait,
Yûki-kun!
Here. Here you go.
Thank you.
What are they for?
For itching hives and stuff.
Are you sick?
I can't drink milk and stuff.
Oh, I'm allergic to food.
Yukie-kun, wait!
Dad said to me...
Huh?
...to become strong.
That's why he named me Yûki, courage.
That's why I'm okay.
Yûki!
So this is where you are.
Ah, you're the father?
Yes.
How nice. He looked so lost.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Look. Because you're walking around alone.
Hey!
Aren't we in Maizuru already?
Yes.
We're gathering clues from the surrounding area first.
What are they doing?
I can't believe something like this happened on board.
I was surprised too.
There's a lot of static. What's going on?
A hiding place to camouflage our phone call.
Then I should modulate the connection.
So? What about the marine?
Checking. But she doesn't exist.
What?
It's a human!
Heiji! What's wrong?
Don't ask and wait there!
But Heiji!
His left arm is missing!
- Have you called the police? - On their way!
A corpse without a left arm.
Officer's rank.
No doubt about it.
It must be that Sasaura-san of Kudo.
Is that blood?
No blood.
But what is it then?
Ah! Don't! Don't!
What is it, kid?
Until the police come, don't touch or move anything.
SELF-DEFENSE MARINE
Megure, police headquarters.
Wakasa security gave us a ride.
Thanks for coming.
I am Captain Tateishi.
Satô.
Takagi.
Kurata, Coast Guard.
Munekawa, Criminal Investigation Division.
We'll talk inside.
Yes.
What?
Wakasa Bay? The shipyard?
Yeah. Almost certainly.
Rank and missing body part match.
In short,
Sasaura-san lost his arm to the Aegis ship in the harbor...
and his body was washed up here.
How was he washed up there?
The ocean current must have carried him away.
There's such a current?
I'll check it out.
Along with whatever was on
Sasaura-san's body.

He had something stuck to him?
Yes.
I don't know what, but there was something red on his neck.
Something red and sticky.
Hattori, please meet the professor.
Enjoy your meal.
Delicious!
The navy's curry is really delicious.
It's the tastiest of all.
It really is. It's delicious!
Yûki-kun...
I guess I was wrong.
I wish my curry was as delicious as this.
Yes, yes,
Thanks for the food.
What's that?
"I made a delicious curry..,
so hurry home," you might say over the phone.
Nonsense.
As if he's coming back for a curry.
That's right.
I'm going to make a phone call.
- That's the way it has to be. - That's not the point.
I have something to tell Shin'ichi.
Yes. Have fun.
What does she want to tell me?
Oh no! She's calling!
Where are you going, Conan-kun?
To the bathroom.
Again?
I'll be right back.
That's all that's suspected and currently known.
I see.
So, because of the maneuver.
- there hasn't been a thorough investigation. - Yes.
Where are the guests?
They are having their meal in the dining room.
In the meantime, we should check
the places that are open to the public.
But the body of Lieutenant Captain Sasaura...
was found in a shipyard in Wakasa Bay.
Is an investigation still necessary?
Just to be sure.
The body could
before the ship sailed.
All right.
I'll take you there.
Ran?
How do you know it's me?
Doesn't matter, what's up?
Unimportant?
Shin'ichi, I'm on...
On an Aegis ship.
Huh?
You're lucky.
I'd like to be there, too.
How do you know?
I told you once..,
no matter where you are, I'll find you.
Shin'ichi...
I got it!
It was Conan-kun!
He told you.
Ah, well...
Don't worry.
It'll all be cleared up soon.
Geez, you're far away. That's easy for you to say.
What?
Do you feel insecure without me?
Wha... what are you talking about?
Of course not!
That's right! There's your fighting spirit! Take care. Good luck!
Ah, wait a minute!
And I'm near her.
Idiot.
NO ADMITTANCE
Commissioner Megure's team
found it on deck.
Where on the deck?
I don't know.
Let's hurry.
You found something?
Here!
Here it is.
I found Sasaura-san's cell phone
I found Sasaura-san's cell phone.
Where was it?
In that crack.
May I?
What's the last data?
The last mail came yesterday after 9 p.m.
The last conversation
was at 5:30 this morning.
Early at 5:30?
That's when his watch stopped.
And it's the estimated time of death.
What?
According to the autopsy, Sasaura-san died between 4 a.m.
between 4:00 and 6:00 this morning.
Then Sasaura-san
was on board this Aegis ship until then.
Do we know the cause of death?
Yes, death by drowning.
So at 5:30 this morning, Sasaura-san...
Sasaura-san fell into the water?
It looks that way.
I see. Of course!
Sasaura-san got into an argument with someone this morning..,
and dropped his cell phone.
After that, Sasaura-san ran away,
was harassed here
and pushed into the sea.
In that case, we're talking about murder.
Then, Sasaura-san's body was sucked in by the water inlet
was sucked in by the water inlet
and got stuck.
Yes.
After leaving the harbor
the water suction system was
was put into operation,
at which point the arm was severed.
The remaining body was caught by the current
and
and carried out into Wakasa Bay.
With this happening
it makes sense that the cell phone was on deck....
The flap for the microSD is open!
I didn't open it.
And the card?
It's not in there.
Do you think the killer took it?
Then whoever killed Sasaura-san...
wanted his memory card!
Damn it! To get a good look at the phone,
I have to show myself.
It won't get away from me!
What's wrong, Môri-kun?
Huh? Oh, nothing.
Upstairs?
What?
Broken?
What's wrong?
What?
The captain's cabin?
It's a microSD!
Go!
He's got
the data from here...
I'll be in my cabin.
Let me know if there's any news.
Captain. May I have a picture?
Son..,
you're not allowed in here. Let's go to the back.
Okay!
She pulled out the memory card.
But she probably didn't have time to erase the data.
RECOVERY

And where is the cell phone now?
In the conference room.
And the people from the presidium?
- They're... - Why is the captain here?
Damn it! That voice before...
DO YOU WANT TO TRANSFER THE DATA?
DATA BEING COPIED
Busted! Shit.
I've almost got it.
Freeze!
Too late.
Damn it. I couldn't copy everything.
Why does X have that data again...
- X? -...reset everything.
Oh yes...
No trace of X to be discovered.
X?
I must as quickly as possible
what I have to the professor...
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
If I transmit from here,
I might be able to learn her identity.
Satellite transmission detected!
From the captain's cabin!
What?
He's in a meeting!
Could it be X?
Find out the captain's whereabouts immediately!
Yes!
This is bad.
Important data is stored there.
Download complete.
What did Shin'ichi
sent us this time?
Well.
It's from Kudô-kun.
Probably something he wants us to check out.
Oh, we've reached Kyôto.
Stop!
What are you doing here?
It's none of your business.
Captain Fujii...
It was you...
Captain..,
I'll talk to you later.
Ah! You're...
Who's that?
She doesn't matter.
Go.
Yes.
Wait!
There were suspicious radio waves here.
That's why we rushed here.
Yes,
and then she was here.
I think we're entitled to know her identity.
Excuse me, but
we can't reveal your identity to outsiders.
Outsiders?
You're kidding!
Exactly. The police and we, the Coast Guard..,
are investigating this case together.
Ah!
- The woman soldier! - Oops!
- You prowler! - A friend of mine told me..,
a female crew member aboard an Aegis ship is rare.
That's enough!
Yes! Does it ever happen that a woman is on board an Aegis ship?
on an Aegis ship?
Yes...
There is
a movement that wants women to serve here as well.
They want her to show the visitors around.
I see.
So that's how it is.
But she said she was in charge of the food.
Yes, she did. That's what she said.
Would you enlighten me?
Well...
As it stands now,
I can't help but think that Sasaura-san's killer...
is among you.
Please wait!
We want to support you as much as possible.
Captain!
As things stand,
we should say so.
I'm with
Intelligence Security.
Intelligence Security?
The office of the secretary of defense?
Yes.
We manage military information
and monitor people's ideology.
But what's intelligence doing
doing on an Aegis ship?
Ah!
It's about the suspicious ship.
Yes.
We think it's a ship from another country.
Yes, there were antennas on board the ship,
indicating radio transmissions,
as well as explosives with detonation devices.
You know very well.
It was I who found the ship.
I see.
That's why I'm investigating the case.
Since the suspicious ship...
...was near the Maizuru harbor with the Aegis ship..,
we suspect that a spy snuck on board.
- A spy? - Yes.
We'll call him "X" and investigate.
X?
What is the spy after?
He's probably after the classified information...
...from the Aegis ship.
The information?
What if he gets his hands on it?
Then we'll lose the trust...
...of the U.S. Armed Forces..,
...the source of the Aegis system.
If the navigational data...
of the Aegis ships leaks out, the strategy of our defense line
of our defense line will be exposed, so that Japan
in the event of a military invasion
Japan would be defenseless.
In short, the defense
of our country is getting into an extremely critical situation!
And surely the assassinated Sasaura-san
must have known about the existence of the spy.
Yes.
If only because of his work...
His work?
What were Sasaura-san's duties?
As a lieutenant captain, he was on the officer staff?
Lieutenant-Captain Sasaura was a member of the
of the MSDF's Wakasa Region Intelligence Service.
Intelligence?
He protects data about the Aegis ships.
Ah!
That's why X killed him, because he wanted to get that data.
So X took the memory card...
from Sasaura-san's cell phone.
No, she took it.

But why is she keeping this a secret?
Excuse me.
Please let me through.
Excuse me, sir.
We're checking the room for communication devices.
- Oh, no! -including your personal possessions.
You, uncle!
Huh?
What's wrong?
I ordered seconds of curry!
Curry?
Oh, man. Why are you even here?
Get out of here!
Yes!
Nice! Uncle.
Thanks for coming.
Hattori, can you hear me?
Yes, I'm with Professor Agasa now.
What about the red substance?
It's being examined.
Hold on a minute.
I can't believe..,
I can't believe you guys are able to do this in a car.
After all, Ai-kun is a chemist.
Chemist?
What are you talking about? All I see is a little kid.
It doesn't matter that she's small.
There it is. Here.
TBT?
Self-polishing paint.
A paint for ships.
A ship's paint?
Can you match if this paint belongs to the Aegis ship?
I'll have the little big one check it out.
Little Big One?
By the way, about the ocean current....
There is no current,
from Maizuru Harbor to Wakasa Bay.
Then how did the body get there?
What about the data I sent?
Oh, yes, those.
Huh?
Kudô wants to know about the data.
Yes.
Shin'ichi? From the looks of it,
these are part of the Aegis ship.
I knew it!
And it seems that the data was copied from a cloud.
Cloud? You mean that service for data storage on the Internet?
Yeah. If you can get the ID and password, you should be able to see...
you should be able to see the original data.
I see.
Sasaura-san has
the Aegis ship data
to the cloud service first.
and later copied it to the memory card of his cell phone.
But
storing such explosive data with a civilian cloud service....
Why did Sasaura-san do that?
Professor.
Please use Sasaura-san's ID to send this data
from the cloud to the captain's cabin.
- But... - Don't worry.
I memorized the address.
Please.
I'm sorry to rush you right into this, but...
but could you share your findings with us?
Of course.
Captain.
Before we came here,
we tracked Sasaura to his murder.
Sasaura was killed at about 5:30 this morning...
on a cliff at Maizuru harbor.
waving the Japanese flag,
testified someone from a tour boat.
Why did Lieutenant Captain Sasaura do this?
We don't know,
but there is another lead.
Sasaura was interrogated by you at the Wakasa base...
at the Wakasa base,
Sekiguchi-han.
Why did you interrogate Sasaura?
There... that...
Secrets again?
Captain Fujii.
Can't you even tell us?
Not without permission from above.
That's enough!
We're dealing with a murder here!
If you don't tell us anything,
we can't even cooperate.
He was one of your people, wasn't he?
- A comrade... - Not like that!
Huh?
That's no excuse.
That's...
Why is the data of the Aegis ship...?
Inspector!
Yes.
If you don't cooperate..,
...we'll use force.
That's...!
From the cloud service
with Sasaura-sans ID.
Good timing, Professor!
- Cloud? - You mean to show it to X?
Wait!
Storing Aegis data on the net is a violation of the rules!
I see.
So that's why you interrogated Sasaura.
And the captain there knew about it.
Where are you going?
Stay here! We're still...
Let go of me!
Unlike you.
I work for my country...
If you think like that, you can't
you can't protect the nation,
let alone get your hands on X.
Let's cooperate.
For Japan.
Aegis data is leaking out of
Aegis data is leaking out.
Stop, Captain Sekiguchi!
Captain Fujii
ordered the investigation.
So it was...
Was it Lieutenant Captain Sasaura who betrayed
who leaked the Aegis data?
Yes.
To whom did he give the Aegis data?
To a long-dormant company..,
headed by a man named Takekawa.
So a dormant company?
Yes.
Someone buys this company..,
calls himself Takekawa, and starts spying.
A common method in Japan.
So this man called Takekawa..,
is the man Sasaura-san sent the data to.
Yes. It came out, and the next day
came the news
of the discovery
of a suspicious ship near Maizuru.

A suspicious ship near the Aegis ship....
This could not be a coincidence.
Parts of that country were found on the ship.
Yes.
That's why we think
that a spy from Takekawa's country came here.
Really?
And that's X!
X could be with
Lieutenant Captain Sasaura's help
with the help of Captain Sasaura.
And it happened today
on this barely guarded adventure cruise.
Why didn't you tell us this in the first place?
That a soldier leaked classified Aegis data...
...to a spy?
A scandal like that...
...you can't talk about.
Until the facts are clear..,
...we were the only ones who wanted to investigate.
That's why when I found his cell phone on deck...
Did a passenger lose it?
Ah! Lieutenant Captain Sasaura's cell phone!
YÔSUKE SASAURA
Why is this lying here?
Let's check the deck first.
You had discovered it before me?
Then Sasaura-san was indeed aboard this ship.
And was killed by X.
Let me inform the Ministry of Defense.
You communicated via satellite transmission?
Yes, I'm sorry.
After the riot...
I was in the degaussing room.
Oh, dear.
Almost went wrong.
Fujii here.
The police and the Maritime Safety Bureau...
...about the secret case we're...
Huh? Takekawa?
Two hours ago?
Yes.
Confirmed he's in Kyoto...
You found Takekawa?
That Takekawa has come to Kyoto means...
That he wants to meet
with X.
And where is Takekawa now?
The Intelligence Security Service is looking for him.
Where did you see him two hours ago?
A hotel security camera picked him up.
A photo of Takekawa...
You have it, right?
Yes.
We're tracking him with Orbis
and the street surveillance cameras.
We, the Kyoto Police, will assist you.
The Coast Guard will also help.
Please send all recordings to this ship.
Yes, that's right!
The Aegis ship Hotaka can
can analyze the images immediately.
Yes! The whole thing is beginning to take shape.
Yes.
The footage from Kyoto in the last two hours.
I asked that..,
to send the footage from around the hotel first.
Telegram from Maizuru!
They've examined the shipwreck
and discovered parts of that country.
On the monitor.
The parts are from the same country.
Another nation in Japanese territorial waters?
That means it was no coincidence..,
that the wreckage approached us.
About...
A terrorist attack using the tide?
No, it can't be.
Earlier today, because of
because of the tidal current
and the ships in the area
we changed the planned route to the left.
Changed this morning...
- This morning? - So that means the route...
Sasaura has this morning around half past five
on a cliff at Maizuru harbor
waving the Japanese flag...
Could it be that the...
I'll have to check it out!
A change of course in the morning.
Without knowing that,
it's impossible to drive the wreck with such precision.
Yes.
Who all knew about the course change?
Only Wakasa Base.
I see. The spy couldn't know anything.
Hey, kid!
- Hey, kid! - You again!
- You can't do that! - What's wrong?
- There it is. - Hey!
You came in again without asking.
- Well? That's not mine. - Ah!
That's obvious! Now you've gone too far!
- Wait! - Huh?
Only the Wakasa people knew about the course change, didn't they?
Yes.
So Lieutenant Captain Sasaura knew about it too.
This signal flag here.
When it's still dark in the morning,
it could be mistaken for the Japanese flag.
Indeed.
I see. Sasaura-san sent a signal to X...
Sasaura-san sent a signal to X.
A signal?
What does the flag mean?
That the ship is changing course to the left.
What?!
That means yes...
Yes. X knew about the course change in advance.
I guess what I'm looking for wasn't here after all.
I'm going again.
Of course you are!
Wait up, kid!
Oh, my...
Target detected!
Without a doubt?
Yes.
Matching 93%.
It must be Takekawa.
Where?
In Pontochô Park.
Noon at 12:03.
I'm enlarging.
- Pontochô Park? - Yes, hurry up!
Otherwise they'll collect everything.
Stop stressing!
And please get a photo of Takekawa.
A photo?
What for?
I'm counting on it.
He hung up on me.
Never mind, just hurry.
You got it.

Oh no!
Conan-kun, there you are!
Um...
Where have you been?
The treasure hunt's about to start!
J... Yes...
Target spotted!
12:10 PM.
Gion Shijô station on the Keihan line.
That's the direction to Ôsaka.
Ah! He's getting on.
FAST TRAIN
- A fast train! - Then it
it doesn't stop often.
I'll ask the Ôsaka police for help.
Yes.
The boy is gone.
From Gion Shijô on the Keihan Line to Yodoyabashi.
all the images from the cameras where the express train stops..,
should be sent here.
To the CIC of the Aegis ship Hotaka?
Yes please, Ôtaki.
It is urgent.
Yes, sir!
As for the treasure hunt:
There are five treasures in the dining room
there are five treasures.
Please collect them all.
Found it!
Guys, I got one!
Wow, great!
Well done! That's our third one!
That means two more to go.
Collect and hit the deck.
Yes.
Run! Give me a hand here!
Yes.
The suspect ship.
Sudden battle condition.
And the death of Sasaura-san.
If it's all because of
of the spy X...
His target is probably the secret information
of the Aegis ship.
Son...
Got a minute?
Something's burned.
Yes.
This must be it,
Kudô was talking about.
The police are here.
There it is! There!
Okay. Report immediately!
Yes!
Conan-kun?
You did a good job back there.
Huh? Did what?
What are you, anyway?
What kind of data do you need to be on board this ship...
on board this ship?
For example
for data on a submarine attack?
How do you know that?
I thought so.
To get this data,
...X sent out a shipwreck?
Where do you get this data?
In the CIC, where we were earlier,
and in the captain's cabin.
That's it!
During the exercise
the emergency suddenly arose
and the captain came into the CIC.
At that time, the captain's cabin was empty!
Right.
Meanwhile, he sneaked there and stole the data!
That means X must be that man!
Hey, wait!
Conan-kun...
It's that little brat again.
I'd better go check it out.
What? Mo... Wait a minute, Ran!
Don't move!
Captain Fujii!
Takekawa has reached Osaka!
Osaka?
Yes.
Yodoyabashi Station.
Kudô?
Takekawa burned some notes.
Notes?
Yes. Almost everything was burned.
It's indecipherable.
As for Takekawa...
He got off at Yodoyabashi Station.
Please follow him.
Yes, sir.
Yuki-kun.
Amemiya-san!
You're...
Is Yuki-kun all right?
Ah! Where is he?
He went to the bathroom because his atopy broke out.
Oh.
Atopy?
Yes.
You wash your hands before you apply the ointment, right?
J... yes.
So on toilet.
Are you worried about him?
Yes, of course.
And yet you weren't with him
when the ship was rocking.
I told you, I was in the toilet.
No. You were in the captain's cabin.
Although I called out "Amemiya-san," there was no response at first.
What Yûki-kun is using is not ointment,
It's pills.
It's because of a food allergy.
As a father, you should have known that.
In short,
you're not Yûki-kun's father.
Isn't that right,
Mr. Spy from somewhere?
Who on earth are you?
Conan Edogawa.
Detective.
What can a peck
do?
KOGORÔ MÔRI
Kid, are you all right?
Wait!
Don't do that!
Don't do that! Or my dad will be killed.
Damn it.
Uncle...
I can barely read this.
Senshu...
And behind that?
If it has to do with the ship,
maybe it means the bow of the ship.
The one behind it could be an anchor.
No, no. The anchor sign is longer at the bottom.
It looks more like an arrow.
An arrow means,
that you're supposed to look up at the sky, maybe?
Sky?
Yes, exactly! Kazuha,
you said something great!
What's that?
Hey Grandpa, to Senshu Airport.
What?
Neither anchor nor arrow!
An airplane!
A plane?
Is there an airport called Senshu?
Kansai International Airport.
COMMISSIONER ÔTAKI
It used to be called Senshu Airport for a while.
Before leaving Maizuru Port
his father disappeared
and so he boarded with a strange man.
He said he would kill my dad
if I did not obey.
The man who was not in the CIC during the exercise?
Yes.
This man certainly

in the captain's cabin stole the data.
So the man is X...
Can you describe the man?
Please assist us.
I'll do it.
I know what he looks like.
Then we'll show you the pictures from the cameras in CIC,
okay?
Yes!
All right, let's go.
Come on, boy.
J... yeah.
Your father told you..,
why he named you Yûki.
Let's be brave.
Takekawa and X.
Neither have been found yet.
There.
- To the airport! - Huh?
Takekawa went to Kansai Airport...
- What? - How do you know?
Hei-cha... No, your son...
Heiji?
Heiji?
I tried to stop him, but he's already gone.
Tôyama, go to the airport area immediately!
Otaki, call the airport police!
Get him!
Here we go.
SERVER ROOM
SERVER ROOM
Where's Takekawa now?
The last sighting was at Nanba Station.
I see.
What about the eyewitness from X?
Conan-kun will help us with that.
Huh?
Then take a seat and check the monitors.
Yes!
How does the kid know X?
If you see him in the pictures, let me know.
Yes. Oh, no!
They're getting away!
What?
- These pictures? - They were saved on the server.
- What's going on? - He's got us.
He beat me to it.
Are there other images?
Via Real Time it is
possible.
- Switch immediately! - Yes.
Boy,
wait a minute, will you?
Yes.
X is certainly smart enough to avoid the security cameras.
I'll have to ask Yûki-kun which route X often took.
Telegram from Osaka!
Takekawa is most likely headed to Kansai Airport.
- What? - Is he planning to leave by plane?
We're sorry,
but the treasure hunt on deck must be canceled.
Let's continue in the dining hall.
Where could Conan-kun have gone?
Excuse me.
We're expecting heavy seas.
Please go inside.
I'm looking for a little boy with glasses.
A lost child?
N... no, I don't
I don't think so.
Then
go in, please.
We're closing the deck.
Ah... yes.
Takekawa wants to go to the airport!
Let's request Coast Guard assistance at the airport!
Yes.
Inoue-san,
you'll hold on?
Yes.
Okay!
Just X left on board.
Your papa told you
why he named you Yûki.
Let's be brave.
Me too.
I want to help catch the spy, too.
Target detected!
Match rate 89%.
North wing terminal.
Camera outside gate number 3!
He's entering the building!
We're almost there, Yuki-kun.
Yes.
Excuse me. A quick question.
Ah, yes.
Ah! Are you...
X?
What is it, Yûki?
I'm not going to leave you behind knowing my actions.
Get up!
Get up right now!
Oh, Conan-kun...
He just can't wander around by himself anymore.
What?
Yûki-kun and Father.
Don't they know the deck's locked?
Are you sure you want to get out of here?
Yes. Takekawa will be here for sure.
I'll go find a place to park.
Yes, we'll go ahead.
Wait up, Heiji!
Why here?
Takekawa's face
is familiar to all security guards.
Passenger plane won't work.
Where did you get that picture?
I begged it from Ôtaki.
The only way to remain undetected...
...is cargo.
He has to blend in with the international cargo.
Hey, kid!
Get back! It's dangerous.
Yes!
Wait here until the next tour.
Got it?
If you're good, you'll see your father.
Excuse me!
Have you seen Conan-kun?
The boy with glasses who was with me earlier?
No,
I haven't.
I see.
Yûki-kun, and you?
Yûki was with me,
so I don't think so.
Kids are always running away, aren't they?
Yes, they do.
See you, Yûki-kun.
He always disappears.
Oh, by the way, the deck was temporarily closed.
I see.
When Yûki's not feeling so bad, we'll go in.
Please help me!
That man's a spy!
Yûki!
Do you think that's a good idea?
Yûki-kun, what's wrong?
Are you all right?
I'm sorry.
We were playing "Spy."
I'm still in character.
No!
That man is not my dad!
Not your father?
Then you stay with Yûki-kun.
I'll go tell one of the crew members.
No! If you do that...
If I do that...
I... I'm
okay.
He's really not your father?
No. He's not.
Please help me!
That's enough, Yûki!
Yuki-kun! Come here!
Yes!
Stupid goat.

Your interference will now cost you your life.
So you are really a spy?
That's what it looks like.
But
it's too late to repent.
What?
Yûki-kun! Go get the others!
Yes.
What a brat...
You're not getting away from me!
He's good. But, uh...
Target detected!
Zone G, international cargo.
Okay.
Without a doubt?
Yes.
Match rate 97%.
I'm counting on you, Hattori.
Hello. This is Megure at police headquarters.
Takekawa has been spotted in Zone G.
Roger that.
Takekawa is in Zone G!
Zone G is here!
I can't do that!
- Let go of me! - You can't go in here!
- Let go of me! - Hey!
Let go of me!
Yuki-kun!
- The spy! - The spy?
The spy was there!
That's an ordinary face.
How are we supposed to find him?
Hey, watch out!
Are you okay?
Thanks.
You're so apathetic.
You'd better wait here,
or something will happen.
Got it?
What?
I'll be right back!
Wait, Heiji!
Menno. I'll find Takekawa before you do.
Ta... Takekawa?
Ah!
Wait! Takekawa!
You can't escape me!
What's wrong, Kazuha?
Kazuha! Where are you?
Is she...
alone...
There he is!
That man there!
Police! Freeze!
Get out of the way!
Stop!
Nanami-san! Wait!
Hit the deck.
Huh?
The unmasked spy
won't stay on board until we dock.
I agree.
But you should...
Wait, Conan-kun!
Yuki-kun, go join the others!
Do you understand?
A... but...
Oneechan...
Don't come any closer!
Don't come any closer!
Don't take another step!
Give up!
There's no way out!
I don't think so.
Stop this nonsense!
Too many obstacles.
Almost vertical.
Shooting at that angle...
That's it!
Nanami-san!
Can you turn the gun to the left?
- The gun? - If so, turn it now!
Please!
Kazuha!
Die.
Hey...
...ji.
Get down!
Are you okay, Hei-chan?
Don't do that!
Not with me!
Leave it!
Loooos!
What?
Into custody!
- Give up, Takekawa! - Okay, take care of him.
Hei-chan, are you okay?
Quick! An ambulance!
Don't exaggerate.
Heiji!
Don't worry. It's just a scratch.
Really, Hei-chan?
Yes.
What's wrong, Kazuha?
Stop it! Don't cry!
Ow ow ow. Hey, I got shot!
Hey, let go of me! Kazuha! Ow ow...
That hurts!
Phew!
So much excitement.
- But at least... - Inspector! Here!
The airport police have informed us..,
that a pressurized device was found
a pressure-generating device was found
disguised as a healing capsule.
He was trying to escape with it.
Regarding Takekawa's arrest at the airport...
We found a suspicious call on his cell phone.
I have it here.
Let's hear the call right away.
It could be Sasaura's message.
Yes, sir.
I'll get everything ready.
Yummy!
Excuse me...
What's the matter? Lost?
Where's the other tall girl?
You mean Ran?
Yeah, where's Ran-oneesan?
She wanted to go look for Conan-kun.
Access ID is
a e g i s
0902.
Password is
0505
informer.
No doubt. That's Sasaura's voice.
...morning, 5:30 a.m.
That's Sasaura-san's presumed time of death.
This call was made from Takekawa's cell phone.
This is solid evidence
that he passed the Aegis data to Takekawa.
You can hear the sound of waves.
Maybe he was near the ocean?
The sound of waves?
You can also hear someone else.
Huh?
Play it again.
Yes.
The Aegis data is stored...
...at KRY Cloud.
Access ID is
a e g i s
0902.
- Password is... - Those metallic sounds...
The end again, please.
Yes!
The password is
0505 informer.
There's really something there!
A man's voice?
I can't make out what he's saying.
I'm sending this to voice analysis.
Excuse me, but...
Something's not right.
It's like the pieces don't fit together.
Shin'ichi?
The TBT we found on Sasaura-san..,
didn't come from the battleship Hotaka.
HOTAKA
But it's ship paint, right?
Yes.
When we matched it with the colors of the other ships,
we found that one of the cruise ships had left
left the Maizuru harbor
and then passed through the Wakasa shipyard.
MAIZURU BAY EXCURSION SHIP
As expected
our color matched the TBT of this ship.
Then Sasaura-san's body got
got caught on this ship

and was thus towed from the port to the shipyard.
Yes, that is very likely.
A cruise ship with departure
from the harbor...
Sasaura has waved the Japanese flag on a cliff
Sasaura waved the Japanese flag on a cliff at Maizuru harbor,
testified someone from a tour boat.
- The password is 0505 informer. - April 20,
5:30 in the morning.
His watch stopped at 5:30 in the morning.
The last call
was this morning at 5:30.
Early at half past five?
That's when his watch stopped.
It's the estimated time of death.
When Sasaura-san was being watched...
His message on the machine...
When he died...
It was all at the same time
at half past five!
That's right!
I was totally wrong!
Takekawa, who was arrested at the airport.
has been handed over to the Osaka police.
We want to hand over X, too,
as soon as we reach the port.
No interrogation by the armed forces?
It does not matter who is conducting the investigation.
We should investigate Takekawa
and X together.
Yes, I agree.
Yes.
And once again, a case is solved.
Indeed. From the looks of it,
we don't need Môri-kun's conclusions this time.
Môri-san!
Môri-san?
Excuse me, this is the captain's seat.
Are you all right?
Don't worry.
I felt a little dizzy.
Seasick?
On such a big ship?
No.
I was dizzy from my conclusion.
You're coming to that now, Môri-kun?
I know now.
Who killed Sasaura-san.
Who killed him?
Wasn't that X who was arrested?
In fact, X boarded the Aegis warship
to steal information.
Yes.
To get the memory card, he killed Sasaura.
No.
The memory card from the cell phone was pulled out by Captain Fujii.
That's right.
Well?
Why was Sasaura-san killed in the first place?
That's right.
There was no reason.
In other words, X didn't kill him.
What?
Then who did?
Remember.
Sasaura-san was standing on a cliff
on a cliff at Maizuru Harbor.
Yes.
He waved the flag.
Yes. After that, he fell into the sea and died.
That is,
Sasaura-san was not on board that Aegis ship today.
What?
But his cell phone was found on deck.
To fake his presence on board.
The perpetrator put it there in a hurry.
Now think. Fujii-san.
Huh?
What about the time and place when you found the cell phone.
Yes, we were
out of the harbor a long time ago.
And it was lying there in plain sight.
But nobody noticed it before.
Exactly.
And that's
because the false evidence was put down much later.
In short, the perpetrator came aboard this ship only on the way.
Isn't that so,
Kurata-san?
Wha... what?
I've never heard of Sasaura-san before this case.
That's right, Môri-kun.
- He had no motive to kill Sasaura-san. - Yes, he did,
I'm sure he didn't intend to.
What?
Conan.
Let's hear the call from Sasaura-san...
on Takekawa-san's cell phone.
The Aegis data is
stored at KRY Cloud.
Can you hear the metallic sound?
- Yes. - It sounds familiar.
Where does it come from?
The sound is made
when a telescopic baton hits the gun at the hip.
Isn't it?
Kurata-san.
Please wait!
Both baton and gun are carried by each of our guards.
I see.
But
the call was made at 5:30 this morning.
The time of death was...
This morning at 5:30.
So..,
he didn't have time to get on board with his cell phone.
In addition, the suspicious ship in Maizuru Harbor
was discovered
was discovered by you.
In short, you were on patrol at Maizuru Port at the time.
Are you still going to deny it?
Don't move!
I never..,
never thought that something like this
could happen.
At this hour?
Very suspicious.
Hey you!
What are you doing?
Damn!
Stop!
This is the Coast Guard!
Hey!
He was definitely suspicious.
Let go!
Since he had just passed on the Aegis data..,
...I guess he took off on the spur of the moment.
I didn't know anything about that.
I rushed down to the sea..,
to look for the man,
when I found the ship.
I called headquarters, and I called
the MSDF, and was busy for the time being.
At that time
the report that
Captain Sasaura's arm was found in an Aegis ship.
was found in an Aegis ship.
Hastily, I searched the man's private property.

I learned
that the suspicious man this morning was
was Lieutenant Captain Sasaura.
YÔSUKE SASAURA
A misconduct of duty, yes.
That a soldier died because of me,
appalled me.
I asked to be assigned
to be assigned to this case.
Why?
It was said that he might have died here on board as well.
I thought if it really looked that way..,
I'd be in the clear.
So I put the cell phone
in an easy-to-see spot on the deck...
You all know the rest.
My selfish actions
have complicated the investigation.
I apologize to you
my sincerest apologies.
Uncle! Have you seen Ran?
No.
She's nowhere to be found!
She's probably just lost.
- No! - We searched everywhere!
She fought with the spy, then she was gone!
What?
Superintendent!
What is it, Satô-kun?
X said something disturbing.
Something disturbing?
Yes. Just before we arrested him..,
a female passenger saw through his disguise.
To keep her from talking,
he threw her into the sea.
This woman was of high school age...
and she practiced karate.
Karate?
Like...
What? Ran?!
No.
What? Ran-san?
Seriously?
Is something...
Ran!
Please hold on tight!
Please help...
the little kids.
According to X, Ran Môri is
fell into the sea
fell into the sea in this area.
We are already quite far away.
H... hey you!
Let them. Prepare the helicopter!
Yes!
Move aside!
According to the current, she must be
she must be in the area.
What?
Four times the usual?
The low pressure area from the southwest
is accelerating the ocean currents.
The waves are also getting higher.
It won't survive for long.
We have to hurry!
Helicopter is ready for takeoff!
- Okay! Take off now! - Yes!
I want to go!
Don't be stupid!
But...
A child will only hinder the search.
Damn it.
We don't have much time to rescue the victim.
We have to find her before sundown.
Understood.
No time to lose? Ran is...
Ran is okay, right?
What happens if you fall
fall off the deck?
She should have put on the life jacket.
But it's high.
If she falls badly...
No.
Of course there's hope.
- Ran-san! - No!
Oh no! It's my fault!
Isn't there any way to find out how she is?
We can only count on the helicopter.
We've got the area narrowed down,
but searching it by sundown is almost impossible.
The waves
The waves are sweeping Ran away, plus her own motion...
Help me,
Shin'ichi!
Search area reached.
Commencing search!
We're calling you!
On speaker!
Roger that.
Môri-san!
Ran Môri-san!
Your rescue is here!
We'll save you!
One more thing!
Hang in there!
Ran! Ran, where are you? Ran!
- Oneechan! - Hang in there!
- You can't die! - Help will be here soon!
Stay calm.
There must be something,
to find Ran.
The waves are getting faster!
Expand the search area?
We don't have time.
Restrict area to Alpha Bravo Box
and continue the search!
Roger that. Flying to Alpha Bravo Box.
Ran Môri-san!
Your rescue is here!
One more thing!
Hang in there!
It's already getting dark.
No more 15 minutes until sunset.
Sunset...
Who cares about sunset?
Keep looking for her!
Keep looking for Ran until you find her!
We'd really like to...
This time of year.
the water temperature drops rapidly around 5:00 p.m.
just before sunset.
Even if we were to find them later....
Oh no! So the water temperature is already dropping.
Damn! No more time.
Isn't there any way?
The clock?
That's right, Ran was talking about Mitsuhiko...
Why?
Why did you stop looking?
- We'll find it! - Please don't give up!
- This ship is so great! - Yes! You've got to do something!
It's a master detective at sea!
Master detective at sea?
Yes!
With the ship's radar...
At one seven zero zero
the rescue will be entrusted to the experts
and we turn back.
The radio clock!
Ran is wearing a radio watch.
The ship can locate the radio waves, right?
Mitsuhiko! Your watch is totally waterproof?
Yes!
The watch receives at 5 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon.
Captain! It's almost time!
- Quick! - Yes.
Radio wave locator ready!
One minute and 40 seconds left.
Can you do it?
We will!

Radio wave locator emergency start!
This is not a drill!
Repeat. This is not a drill!
Deck crew clear the deck immediately!
Repeat.
Deck crew, clear the deck immediately!
You've got to make it!
Deck cleared!
Radio wave locator ready!
Start radio search!
Start search!
Time: One Six Five Nine.
Ten seconds to five.
Nine,
eight,
seven,
six,
five,
four,
three,
two,
one.
Just!
And?
Within the search area
no response.
What? Why?
It could be that the radio clock
has already sunk into the sea.
Ran.
Not true!
It can't be...
- impossible! - You'll find me, right?
That's why I suggested I go with you.
But you...
Don't go off on your own again, okay?
You won't find your way back.
No problem.
If I get lost,
you'll find me.
Huh?
You're a master detective!
I can't even find Ran.
Master detective?
Ran!
Ran.
Run!
Was that
Conan-kun's voice?
I told you.
I'll find you no matter what.
You're late.
Shin'ichi...
Is that...
Radio waves detected, albeit weak!
They're getting stronger!
That's Ran!
Ran must be there!
Send the helicopter!
Have him fly there immediately!
Roger that! Target coordinates:
4 km northwest of the ship.
Latitude 36° 4' north.
135° east longitude! SH immediately
to the search point!
Roger. Proceeding to search point!
Arriving at search point shortly.
Are at the search point. Visibility is poor.
Also, the waves are reflecting the light....
- To find them in time... - Reflect?
Tell me! Is it possible that
the reflection is concentrated in one place?
How? Um...
How is it? Answer!
Ah, yes!
One place reflects the light particularly strongly.
That's it!
Follow the light!
Ran is there for sure!
Listen to him!
Send the helicopter!
Captain, please!
Good.
Follow the shining trail!
She could be at the concentration point!
Roger!
Concentration point reached.
Going down!
There's something below us!
Definitely not flotsam!
Spotted!
The girl!
She's alive!
Commence rescue!
Yes!
Hooray!
Whew.
Thank you. Good job.
Get her to the hospital now!
Copy that. She's conscious, but
but we're flying her to the hospital.
Body temp's low,
heartbeat stable.
Shin'ichi...
