Damn! Where did he go?
There!
Let's finish the game,
Mr. Opportunity Thief.
Yes, all right.
Playing hide and seek with you just takes too long.
Young detective...
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE MAGICIAN WITH SILVER WINGS
HE MAKES GROWN-UPS LOOK PALE
I am high school detective Shin'ichi Kudô.
When I was at the amusement park with my friend Ran,
I watched men in black making a suspicious deal.
I was so focused on what was happening
that I didn't notice the third man behind me.
He administered a poison to me
and when I came to...
...my body had shrunk!
If it becomes known that I am still alive..,
my life and the lives of my friends will be in danger.
Professor Agasa advised not to reveal myself.
When Ran asked my name,
I said Conan Edogawa.
To track down the men,
I moved in with Ran, whose father runs a detective agency.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
The culprit
is you!
This old man is Kogoro Môri.
He is Ran's father.
A master detective that everyone knows.
Also known as the Sleeping Kogoro.
That's because...
I don't have to explain, do I?
ANESTHESIA CHRONOMETER STIMULATION TRANSPOSER
These two utensils
are from Professor Agasa.
Now that I'm small,
he has invented all sorts of unique devices.
FOOTBALL BELT
With this belt you can fire a ball.
You press the buckle,
a ball inflates and pops out.
By the way
besides the professor
others know my identity.
My father and mother.
High school detective Heiji Hattori,
and Ai Haibara, who goes to the same elementary school
elementary school with me.
With her sister Akemi Miyano, she was one of the men in black.
she was one of the men in black.
But they killed her sister.
Haibara turned against them
and drank to escape,
she drank the same poison that was given to me...
and shrank as a result.
And there is another one.
Kaitô Kid!
The fight between us is still going on.
On my honor as a detective,
I'm going to get him!
I'm small, but my mind isn't!
No case remains unsolved!
There's always only one truth!
TEN HOURS EARLIER
DETECTIVE MÔRI
I see.
So this is Kid's announcement letter.
Yes.
It was in the mail this morning along with
JURI MAKI (37) ACTRESS
a big bouquet of roses on my porch.
That he always has to put on a show.
Romeo... Juliet...
WHEN THE 26 LETTERS FLY AROUND, I COME FOR THE JEWEL.
Victor... Bravo!
When the 26 letters start flying around,
I'm coming to get the Jewel of Destiny.
MASAYO YAGUCHI (32) ASSISTANT
Kaitô Kid.
Plus a playing card cut in half...
Here you go.
Thank you.
What do you think, Môri-sensei?
Well, you know...
What is meant by "Jewel of Destiny"?
JEWEL OF DESTINY
Ah, he means this.
How magnificent!
A star sapphire, isn't it?
Yes.
These three intersecting lines on the surface
represent "trust", "hope" and "destiny".
Hence the name "Jewel of Destiny."
That's right.
It's a gorgeous piece.
Since Josephine loves blue sapphires more than anything, I'm currently wearing it
I'm wearing it on stage.
Stage?
I know!
You're in the play "Josephine," which is being performed at Sora,
the new theater in Shiodome, aren't you?
Josephine?
She was Napoleon's first wife.
She was also famous for her collection of roses.
That's right. Hence the bouquet of roses.
That's right, boy. You know all about it.
He's only got boring things like that on his mind.
WHEN THE 26 LETTERS ARE FLYING AROUND, I'LL COME FOR THE JEWEL.
Romeo... Juliet...
Victor... Bravo...
Romeo... Juliet...
Yuri-san?
Yes?
Wasn't the theater you're in now..,
wasn't it Romeo and Juliet?
Yes.
It was the opening performance. But I wasn't there.
Is there a connection?
I know now.
You do?
In Kid's announcement letter.
there are three "W "s and an "H."
In other words:
It shows the who, when, where, and how!
WHO (WHO), WHEN (WHEN), WHERE (WHERE), HOW (HOW).
Ah, I see.
Oh dear, I wonder if this will work.
First the "who."
Not much needs to be said about that. It's Kid.
Next, the "where."
Where "Romeo and Juliet" was performed.
It is the "Sora" stage.
Now the "when".

From the "Bravo" in writing is when the audience applauds.
Lastly, the "how."
Victor means conqueror.
This means Napoleon,
who the Kid will disguise himself as.
Also, there's the map.
The two-part card shows the V sign for victory.
In short, Kaitô Kid will
the moment you receive the applause for your performance as Josephine.
for your performance as Josephine,
you will appear as Napoleon,
to steal the ring.
Bravo!
Bravo, Môri-san! You are truly a master detective!
No kidding. I'm not that good.
You, Uncle?
What does this "when the 26 letters fly around" mean?
Fool. Count those English letters up there.
Romeo, Juliet, Victor, Bravo.
That makes 26 letters altogether!
I see.
By the way, Yuri-san,
when will "Josephine" be performed?
Today is the last day.
That means the Kid will make his attack...
That's strange.
What's wrong now?
It's funny.
Look, it's only 22 letters.
It can't be.
No, I counted too.
Even with the exclamation mark, there are still three missing.
The... the Kid must have miscounted.
Kid must have miscounted.
I mean, really.
Anyway
there's no doubt about it,
...that the Kid's going to get that jewel tonight.
Yeah, got it.
But what I wanted to ask you...
Of course, I'll still go to the police..,
but would you come to the show..,
to protect the jewel from the Kid?
Certainly.
Myself, Kogoro Môri..,
always honors the request of a beautiful woman.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, Masayo-san.
Yes.
These are tickets for tonight's performance.
You're welcome to come with company.
Thank you.
When the 26 letters fly around...
When you think of 26 letters, you think of the alphabet...
...I'LL COME BACK FOR THE JEWEL. KAITÔ KID
Plus this card.
It's definitely not the V sign.
DETECTIVE MÔRI
SHIODOME OBSERVATION TOWER
SORA THEATRE
PLEASE BE PATIENT A LITTLE LONGER. SORA
Ah, I'm so excited.
So am I.
Because I wanted to see this play anyway.
Hey, Conan.
What are you doing with that backpack? It's a nuisance.
Well, this and that.
This and that?
Did you bring
brought food just for yourself?
I'm not you.
Hey you!
You were allowed to come along for once,
so behave yourselves!
Yes!
Thank you for letting us come along.
No way...
Môri-sensei!
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Yaguchi-san, good afternoon.
DRESSING ROOM JURI MAKI
This is Yaguchi. Môri-sensei is here now.
Yes, please.
Here you go.
Excuse me.
Welcome, Môri-san.
Good afternoon.
Forgive my appearance.
Natsuki-chan,
this is the famous Kogoro Môri-san.
You know him, don't you?
NATSUKI SAKAI (26) HAIR & MAKE-UP STYLIST
I am Natsuki Sakai.
Hello.
How huge!
So many flowers!
Wow!
Excuse me, sir,
I took you up on your offer and brought the kids.
No, it's okay.
Yuri-san, you go diving?
Yes. I just started, though.
Why don't you come with me?
That sounds good. I'd love to.
But he's never been diving before.
Did you say something, Ran?
No, nothing.
So many cosmetics!
Yeah, right.
It's called foundation, right?
Yes. There's one, two, three, four
there's one, two, three, four...
five kinds.
- Five kinds? - Hey!
Young ladies,
you're much too young for cosmetics.
Kids should act like kids.
Yes.
Yes?
Ah, Masa-chan.
Narusawa-san.
I heard Môri-san is here.
Ah, Môri-san.
You're the master detective, aren't you?
My name is Narusawa.
BUNJIRÔ NARUSAWA (34) ACTOR
I'm a big fan of yours.
Oh, thank you very much.
Are you playing Napoleon?
What? Y... yes,
Forgive my appearance.
Yes, that's right. May I introduce you?
This is
Tenko Tajima-san. She plays Josephine's friend Theresia Thalian.
TENKO TAJIMA (36) ACTRESS
Nice to meet you.
Isao Shinjo-kun. He plays
Josephine's lover Hippolyte Charles.
ISAO SHINJO (28) ACTOR
Pleased to meet you.
And this is
our director, who plays Josephine's patron
Paul de Barras.
TÔRU BAN (45) DIRECTOR AND ACTOR
I am Tôru Ban. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
We've got everyone together.
Superintendent Nakamori!
Hello, Môri-san.
Long time no see.
Thank you for last time.
Oh, it's my pleasure.

Are they real? Those guys there?
In fact
the Kid often disguises himself in advance
as one of the participants.
He may already be here.
Oh yes, for once I've brought someone with me
to help us with the investigation.
I told you it wasn't necessary..,
but this Megure...
...um..,
I mean, Commissioner Megure recommended him, so...
Come in.
Hello, I'm Shin'ichi Kudô.
- Shin'ichi! - Kudô-kun!
Oh, it's him.
Shin'ichi Kudô...
The famous
The famous high school detective?
Who's that again?
What are you talking about?
He's Ran-onêsan's boyfriend.
That's not true.
- Her husband! - Sonoko!
He's the Kaitô Kid!
That's not Shin'ichi-nîchan!
It's the Kid!
Kid?
How do you know?
I'm the real...
Real what?
Oh, nothing...
I see.
There is that possibility.
Ow ow ow. Please don't do that, Inspector Nakamori.
What's the meaning of this?
I don't know,
but Kid's face is similar to mine.
Or you...
you could be the wrong guy.
Nonsense.
Okay!
No doubt about it. He's real.
In fact, I'd like to pull
pull on everyone's cheeks around here...
No, that won't be necessary.
My gut tells me the Kid is not among us.
He is!
Besides, I already have a secret plan to catch the Kid.
Then let's hear your plan.
Maki-san,
if you don't mind, I'd like everyone to leave the room.
That's no problem.
I'm done here.
Excuse me.
I'll do it my way.
Excuse me?
You're welcome. We don't need a detective boy.
We'll say goodbye here.
We're looking forward to the play.
Hey, say,
at least let me know when you're back.
I'm sorry,
Your surprised face is so cute.
- Cute? - Oha, you're off to a good start.
Well, I'm gonna go check out the roof.
Ran, you want to come with me?
The top floor is like an observation deck.
Go ahead, Ran.
I'm coming with you!
You stay here.
I want to go! I want to go!
What are you doing?
I want to go with you! I want to go!
It's a deal. Let's all go together.
Hooray!
Say, Conan...
...he's a different person before Ran, isn't he?
I'm sure he still has a need for leaning.
I see.
He's just a kid.
So are you.
As if I could leave her alone with the Kid.
EMERGENCY EXIT
Okay. It's locked.
EMERGENCY EXIT
So, how did it go?
All the doors to the roof were locked.
Were they?
In short, if my assumption is correct,
the Kid won't be able to get to the roof.
J... Yes, that's right.
He's already there.
Listen..,
I'll take Conan-kun.
Then you two can be alone.
No, there's no need.
Besides,
...there's something different about him.
Huh?
Well, he doesn't usually say that.
Like that?
Never... cute and stuff.
He's just become more honest.
You should be, too.
If you like him, tell him.
Oh... such nonsense!
I told you, it's not like that.
It's madness. Madness. It's completely insane!
Genta-kun, all you've been saying is "madness" ever since we met.
It's not my fault. It's amazing.
What a beautiful landscape.
It's amazing, isn't it?
You see.
Yes, really. It's magnificent.
He's got a lot of nerve.
Dressing up as Shin'ichi, of all people.
Yes.
I'm sure it'll make it easier for him to do his job.
For that, we don't need to look for him anymore.
Yes.
By the way, are you familiar with Napoleon?
Well, not well. He conquered Europe for a while.
and was a hero of France.
Okay. So, in preparation for the play.
I have a Napoleon quiz for you.
What? You're giving us a quiz?
It's like Professor Agasa.
Don't make stupid puns.
My quiz is based on history and is educational.
Guess, kid.
Shut up!
Ready? On Napoleon's property
two Japanese built a house.
Which of the closest are these two?
1. Fuyuno-san.
2. Furuno-san.
3. Fukano-san.
Fuyuno-san, Furuno-san, Fukano-san...
FUYUNO - FURUNO - FUKANO
All have "fu" and "no" in them.
FU NO
Ah, I got it!
Don't tell.
The three differ in the middle part:
yu and ru and ka.
Got it. It's Fuyuno-san and Furuno-san!
Only Fukano-san has a "ka" in the middle.

"In the middle is ka" results in Chinese.
IN THE MIDDLE IS "KA" = CHINESE (THUS CHINA)
Fukano-san is a Chinese!
What? Are you saying I'm wrong?
The answer is correct, but your solution....
Don't you know Napoleon's saying:
"My dictionary doesn't have the word 'impossible'"?
I heard that once!
The quiz refers to this saying.
Dictionary also means landed property.
LAND = LANDED PROPERTY (JISHO)
"Fukano" means impossible.
FUKANO
IN/ON MY DICTIONARY/LANDED PROPERTY THERE IS NO IMPOSSIBLE/FUKANO.
In short, "On my landed property, there is, fukano' not."
I see.
By the way, Napoleon's words were:
"The word, impossible' exists only in the dictionary of fools."
That's what I think it was.
That's our Haibara-san!
But it was punning after all.
Besides...
...it wasn't really educational.
J... yes, you mean?
Josephine. Theresia.
May I help you? Viscount Barras?
General, may I present
Theresa Thalian and Josephine. This is...
I know who he is.
General Napoleon Bonaparte.
I have heard you are very brave.
Oh, no, you flatter me.
General, may I ask you for a dance?
I'd love to.
I've grown so fond of it all.
These bright days...
Bonaparte...
The island of Elba...
The Roman Emperor...
Tell me, Ran..,
isn't that your father next to the pope?
So that's his secret plan to capture the Kid.
Haibara, you watch out!
Yeah, go ahead.
In the name of the Father, the Son...
I place this crown as a testament
of the French Emperor...
I do it myself.
I, Napoleon the First, am hereby declared emperor...
Are you all right?
That's dangerous!
Yes, I'm all right.
- But, uh... - What is it?
Ah,
this boy came running around the corner,
bumped into me, fell down.
Hey, you all right, kid?
Yeah. I'm fine.
That's a hell of a police stick you got there.
It's a lot longer than this guy's.
It sure is. It's pretty long.
Well, there are different canes.
Maximum length 60 cm,
Diameter maximum 3 cm,
weight maximum 320 g.
The prefectural public safety
of the prefectures regulate this.
Your baton is
too long.
Say, why?
Why is it so long?
It's because...
it's not a police baton.
You can't escape!
Stop!
Damn it!
All this world has to offer...
Glory! Victory!
The future is mine!
And it's ours, too!
As soon as the curtain comes down!
It's clear.
Now! Grab the Kid!
He's the Napoleon!
H... hey! What's the idea?
You were careless, Kid!
Your pathetic cipher
I, Kogoro Môri-sama, have long since deciphered!
N... no! I'm not the Kid!
That's enough! Show us who you really are!
Kaitô Kid!
Ow ow ow.
He's real.
Then where's the Kid?
Let's finish the game,
Mr. Opportunistic Thief.
Yeah, all right.
Playing hide-and-seek with you just takes too long.
Young detective...
You still know how to talk.
Come on, let's finish it.
Yes, because your girlfriend is waiting for you with dinner.
Conan-kun!
Dinner's ready!
Hurry up or you won't get anything!
Looks like it's time to make a decision,
...young detective.
Yeah, it looks that way.
Oops!
Hey, hey.
That's how it is.
He countered my glider with a paraglider.
That was impressive.
Was this paraglider
Professor Agasa's invention?
There's no escape now.
You are wingless
and therefore just a simple thief.
Then I should become
...the mysterious thief again.
That noise?
Darn it!
Make it good!
Damn it!
HANEDA AIRPORT
Rain is falling in Hokkaidô, in the area of Hakodate
HOKKAIDÔ TONIGHT
HAKODATE...
and isolated thunderstorms are expected.
Thunderstorms for Hakodate.
What a lousy weather.
What if lightning hits the plane?
Don't worry. After all, we are flying above the clouds.
But the landing will be under the clouds, right?
I got all dressed up and now it's raining.
If you walk around like that,
Grandma says the storm god will take your belly button.
Oh, yeah?
Let him, if he can!
Ha!
Really, thank you,

that you invited us all to the closing party.
Thanks to you, nothing happened to the jewel.
That goes without saying.
Yes, that's right.
Don't bother and enjoy Hakodate.
I think Yuri is quite late.
You're right.
Excuse me.
Natsuki-san is doing her makeup...
in the car in the parking lot.
Makeup it is.
It's hard to be a big star.
It's more difficult for Natsuki-san.
Yes, she is so busy with Juri.
and even has to take on assistant duties.
So, I see.
Hi!
Thanks for waiting!
Oh, you become more beautiful day by day!
Thank you very much, Môri-san.
Everyone seems to be here.
No, Shinjo-kun is still missing.
Oh yes, Shinjo-san called me this morning.
He's not feeling well and canceled.
I see. That's too bad, isn't it, Yuri?
Huh? What?
No, nothing.
Excuse me,
aren't the other actors coming?
Of course not!
What was the point of inviting all the supporting cast?
What was that all about?
HAKODATE ÔNUMA LAKESIDE
J. MAKI JURIS COUNTRY HOUSE
My sixth sense tells me
that he'll definitely show up here.
Superintendent Nakamori, everyone's here.
Good.
Group A the front,
Group B in the rear, Group C securing the perimeter.
Yes.
- Commissioner Nakamori! - What's up?
There's a light on in the country house.
What?!
What? That's...!
SKY JAPAN 865 HAKODATE 18:15
Sky Japan Airlines,

Flight #865 to Hakodate,
departs at 18:15,
is ready for boarding.
We kindly ask the passengers
of flight 865 to Hakodate to proceed to gate 8...
How great! The seat is quite soft!
Not bad at all here.
I feel like a director!
On domestic flights, only Sky Japan offers these "Super Seats
offers these "Super Seats" on the upper deck!
Hey, Ran!
What?
What's wrong with you, Ran?
All the time you're looking backwards.
No, it's nothing.
- Welcome aboard. - Thank you.
There she is!
Who's there?
Shh. Be quiet.
Excuse me, is this seat taken?
Please.
Eri!
It's you?
Mrs. Môri?
Hello.
Are you going to Hakodate, too?
What a coincidence!
You two just have a connection!
What are you talking about?
You asked me to accept
to accept Juri-san's invitation because dad can't.
Ran, you again...
It's okay.
Now both of you sit down.
Are you kidding?
Why should I sit next to her/him?
Can't you two...
Pops!
Excuse me, Yuri-san, can I sit next to you?
What? Yes, please.
Oh, my...
Ah, mother!
Excuse me, you're Juri Maki-san, aren't you?
Yes.
My name is Eri Kisaki.
I would like to thank you very much for inviting me.
Ah, no problem.
Oh, yes,
If that vulgar man next to you
is bothering you,
I'll be glad to help.
So, you're a lawyer.
I'll see you later.
Yes.
Why does it always end like this?
It was to be expected.
As usual.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Shinjo-san?
Didn't you cancel because you felt unwell?
Yes, but I'm fine now.
and since I have no plans,
I thought I'd join you.
I'm late, Josephine-sama.
Why don't you keep the agreement?
Don't worry.
There will be plenty of time after you arrive.
Have a good flight.
Yes, thank you.
To the cabin crew.
Please secure the doors now.
What are you thinking about?
It's the Kid, isn't it?
Yes.
Whether he really intended to steal the jewel yesterday.
Playing hide-and-seek with you just takes too long.
Young detective...
Also
that police stick is much too long.
He's not usually this careless.
Hey you!
My seat is 4K.
That's the K of Kid.
My seat is the 4J.
That's the J of Jumbo!
Well, mine is 4B,
so... um...
I see.
The four English words
in Kid's writing
are a phonetic code!
Phonetic code?
Yes,
It's used to avoid hearing errors in radio communications.
R Romeo is like that,
J Juliet,
V Victor
and B Bravo.
In addition one uses
this alphabet also in air traffic.
Sky J 865,
runway 16 Ieft,
cab inner,
Juliet 10, Echo 10, Charlie 10.
Sky J 865,
Juliet 10, Echo 10,
Charlie 10.
In short,
that "when the 26 letters fly around" means
that the deed happens on the plane,
where these words are used.
Still more

on this plane flying from Tôkyô to Hakodate.
Why? It could also be the return flight.
The playing card!
Yes.
The 2 of spades was cut in half.
That indicated
odd numbers not divisible by 2.
The flights from Tôkyô
have odd numbers like our flight 865,
those to Tôkyô are even.
Looking at it that way, yesterday's thing makes sense.
He sought my attention
and pretended that the coup had failed,
so we'd all get sloppy.
If that's the case...
...the Kid is somewhere on that plane...
and he's still after the ring.
Ladies and gentlemen..,
...thank you for coming...
Is something the matter?
I don't feel well.
It must be the strain.
Here, Yuri, hold my hand.
Vitamins.
The captain of this flight is Ôkoshi.
I am your flight attendant, Shindô.

Oops, my ears are funny.
Ah, mine too!
The air pressure has changed.
It'll go away if you swallow.
Still funny.
It doesn't help!
Then you have to hold your nose and blow it out.
But don't do it too fast,
or you'll get dizzy.
It's gone.
Oh, look, something came out!
Conan-kun, look ahead.
It's really gone!
- She really is a girl. - How?
It doesn't look good to hold your nose...
...when you're holding your nose and blowing air.
You don't want to show that
to the person you care about.
Oh.
TOILETTE
Excuse me, Yuri-san,
would you give me your autograph?
A... but of course.
Oh darn, I forgot the signing pen.
Maki-san, here you go.
Thank you.
She's just indispensable.
What's Pop up to?
Don't bother with such a disloyal guy!
You better tell me who all these people are.
Yes.
Oops.
Excuse me.
- Are you all right? - Yeah.
- Here. - Thank you very much.
Would you like Japanese or Western pastries?
I don't want anything.
Japanese or...?
Neither.
Nothing to drink either.
I'd like beer and nibbles.
One moment, please.
In Super Seat class, you can get bi...

Everything all right, Captain?
Yes, yesterday my youngest developed a fever
and I didn't get much sleep.
Shall I order some coffee?
Yes, that would be nice.
Everything okay with the ring?
Yes, but it's not over yet.
That was fast.
Hey, Masayo-san!
The chocolate.
Cockpit service?
How unusual on a domestic flight.
This is Misawa. I'll bring the coffee.
You're welcome.
- Excuse me, sir. - Hello!
Huh?
S... You can't come in here.
It's okay, Misawa-kun.
She used to work for us.
Long time no see, Captain.
Yeah, since you quit. Must be five years.
It's seven years.
It's been that long?
Hello, Nakaya-san.
Hello. I saw "Josephine".
I'm glad.
Yes, the play was great.
Really? Thank you very much.
All the best.
Well, Captain, see you around.
Maki-san!
- Here you go. Chocolate. - Thank you.
Môri-sensei, would you like some?
Yes, please.
Yummy!
Oh no!
Uncle, it smells like almonds.
Yes, cyanide poisoning.
The chocolate! There was poison in the chocolate!
The chocolate?
Dad!
Don't worry.
If the chocolate of the uncle had been poisoned,
he would have shown symptoms long ago.
But then why Yuri-san...
The captain wants me to tell you..,
that until the arrival at the airport silence is kept about
until the arrival at the airport to avoid panic.
Understood.
But how could the perpetrator
Juri-san the poison?
It could only be the chocolate.
She ate one and collapsed!
That's what I think.
U... impossible!
I don't know anything.
I bought the chocolates today at the usual store on the Ginza...
and just opened them. Right, Natsuki-san?
Huh? Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't look that closely.
Natsuki-san!
But you ate one without any problem.

So only one part can be poisoned.
How could
the perpetrator know which chocolate Juri-san will take?
Which chocolate she eats first,
as a manager, you'd know.
I didn't.
Besides, she doesn't have a fixed eating order.
Juri-san looked
very indecisive when choosing the chocolate.
Kids shut up!
Anyway, I'll put the chocolates away.
Yes.
We will have to leave everything else to the police.
Yes.
To secure the scene, I'm going to ask you
to sit further back.
And no more use of the front restroom.
Since we've been on board,
the only thing Yuri-san has eaten besides the chocolate...
he's only been taking vitamins.
But you could
that she would take them.
I got it!
I know who the culprit is!
- Pop? - Who? Who? Who is it?
Ahem. Ever since the late Yuri-san
boarded this plane,
she only took two things.
These two things are
the chocolate that caused problems earlier,
and Tenko-san's vitamin pills.
D... you?
Now it should be clear
who killed
Juri Maki-san on the plane.
It's you, Tenko-san!
M... are you kidding? You are completely wrong!
I don't even have a motive.
Do you?
I think everyone of us has a motive,
to kill Yuri-san.
Wha... what are you talking about?
You're the makeup artist Natsuki Sakai-san?
What do you mean?
Well,
I've been with Juri-san for a long time, and I believe
that I know well about her relationship with other people.
Ban-san, for one.
He was also the director for the play,
but in reality
Juri-san gave the instructions.
Although it was he
who raised her to be an actress,
but in the meantime
he can no longer assert himself.
I have
often observed how Tenko-san reproached him
strongly reproached him for that.
Three years ago, Juri-san
filed for divorce from Narusawa-san.
But he was still attached to her and wanted
a second chance,
which she refused.
Juri-san also seemed
of her lover Shinjo-san,
because she asked me if I knew
I knew someone cute.
And finally, her manager Masayo-san.
Juri-san always called her
"colorless" and "inattentive," and often ridiculed her
often ridiculed her in front of the others.
As for me, I was constantly
I was constantly pushed around by the egotist.
If I had another job offer,
she interfered. It flattered me,
but it also made me angry.
It would not have been surprising if one
one of us had done it.
Hey, Genta-kun,
how can you eat in a situation like this?
Well, it's a shame if it gets away.
It's delicious!
What if the poison was on his finger?
First, Shinjo-san had touched Juri-san's hand.
Maybe that's where he got the poison...
No, there were others.
If there was poison on the pen...
Or there was poison on the light switch.
Poison on the light switch...
Or in the toilet
There was poison applied to places she would touch....
Oh yes, Juri-san came
out of the toilet pretty quickly.
Wait a minute. Before that, there was...
Oh, I see.
So that was how it was. That's why she had...
I don't feel good.
Now I've figured out the trick!
And the culprit who set it up!
Uncle?
What's that?
What is it?
There's nothing there.
- Huh? - What?
Good. Now!
Oh, no!
Come on, tell me, what's there?
I must be lost. I'm going to the bathroom.
What's wrong with him?
Never mind, there's always a first time.
Stop making a fuss.
Huh?
Damn, I missed it!
- Sonoko? - Me?
Give it a rest
and tell the truth!
What?
Well..,
you don't need a sleeping Kogoro with this case.
Then I'll tell you how it went.
Huh? No way.
Hooray! Today your mother shows what she's made of!
First, the method of administering the poison to Juri-san.
This trick is really surprising,
so I'll start with it.
Well, it is the pressure equalization.
Pressure equalization?
The perpetrator knew that Juri-san
uses a certain method to equalize
Juri-san uses a certain method.
She holds her nose with her thumb and forefinger...
and blows out air.
And she does this with her right hand.
Surely one or the other knows,
that this method is taught when diving.
Advanced divers can probably do it without holding their nose.

But Juri-san was a beginner.
She certainly didn't know how to do it.
Don't you think so?
Huh? J... yes... Wait!
How do you know about that?
N... well, this kind of pressure equalization is,
just as Ayumi-chan was,
is a bit embarrassing for women when men are present.
Even more so, Juri-san was an actress and you were sitting next to her.
Even if you're a jerk, man is man.
A jerk?
That's why Juri-san
went to the bathroom to equalize the pressure.
Back again she took
with thumb and forefinger
of her right hand and ate it.
Then she licked the cocoa powder off her fingers,
without knowing that because of this habit
the poison could enter her body completely.
into her body.
What does that mean? Where did the poison come from?
Do you also find it difficult to breathe?
Yes, strange.
However, Juri-san had already been
Juri-san had been exposed to this poison steadily before.
Yes, her discomfort was based on the fact that the poison was absorbed
was absorbed through the skin.
Through the skin? Does that mean...?
Yes,
In the car in the parking lot of Haneda Airport...
the poison was applied to her nostrils with the makeup.
The one responsible for Yuri-san's death...
is you,
Natsuki Sakai-san!
What nonsense!
Although that's an interesting theory.
Conan-kun told me
that you...
you scolded the children for touching the primer.
If the kids had played with it,
...when the primer had already been prepared....
You couldn't risk that, could you?
Then let's see some real evidence!
All right,
if the fingers of Yuri-san's right hand...
on the fingers of Yuri-san's right hand,
that would be proof, but
since Juri-san licked her fingers, this evidence has disappeared.
But there is other evidence.
The poisoned primer itself and the sponge.
Clever as you are, I'm sure you don't have either with you.
But to dispose of them
...at the airport would be too risky.
Yes, I would send the things.
By mail to your own address.
Well, that will come up
when the post office checks the shipment.
Well? Aren't you going to tell us?
The address of your apartment?
That woman
destroyed my dream.
Dream?
I dreamed of working in Hollywood..,
to work in Hollywood as a make-up artist.
To make this dream come true,
I went to makeup school in L.A. and improved my
and improved my English.
Back in Japan
I worked for this woman,
but continued to apply for jobs in Hollywood.
Finally, a month ago
a Hollywood star came to Japan.
One of her agents, who liked my skills, asked me to work with them,
asked me if I would like to work with them.
For me it was
the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
But she...
But this woman
...intrigued and destroyed them.
She wouldn't let you go.
If she'd appreciated my makeup,
I would have forgiven her.
But she didn't.
She wanted me
as an assistant for the sake of convenience.
When I realized this,
I had to carry out my plan.
This woman has
my pride as a makeup artist...
Her pride as a makeup artist?
Don't make me laugh!
Then why did you choose makeup utensils as the murder weapon?
You have no right to use a word like pride!
I, uh... I...
You're still young.
Serve your debt and start over.
Why do I have such a bad feeling?
My nerves are all tense.
Oh, no!
Quick,
tell the pilots not to eat the pastries!
Quick! The pilots are in danger!
Are you stupid? The pastry is not poisoned.
Not the pastry!
There could be poison on the pilots' fingers, too!
What?
What makes you think that? Come on, tell me!
Yes. Right away.
I'm sorry, I...
I knew it!
Captain!
Captain! What's the matter?
Are you all right?
What's going on?
Nakaya-san, are you all right? Captain?
Darn! The autopilot has been turned off!
Captain, pull yourself together!
Straighten up and sit back!
Captain!
Good. Now the autopilot.
Shinjo-san!
Good job, kid!
All right! Quick, get a doctor!
Roger that.
A medical emergency has just occurred.
If there is a doctor among you,
please report immediately to...
Poisoning by a fast-acting poison.

Bring them both into the booth for initial action.
Good. Narusawa-san, Ban-san.
Help!
Yes!
The doctor's kit!
Yes!
Tell me, Conan-kun,
why the pilots?
Juri-san was in the cockpit before she died.
The captain and the co-pilot kissed
Juri-san a kiss on the hand.
I see. That's how they came in contact with the poison.
What a pity.
If they had shaken hands normally.
If they had shaken hands normally.
the poison wouldn't have gotten into their mouths.
Let's go, let's go.
Whoops.
How does it look, doctor?
Fortunately, it was only a tiny amount of the poison.
Their lives are in no danger.
But you are barely conscious
and in no condition to fly.
What? The captain and co-pilot are unconscious?
Excuse me, what is your name?
Shinjo, passenger.
Shinjo-san,
can you give me the flight status?
Current altitude 12,000 feet,
speed 280 knots.
Fortunately, the ILS is entered for landing.
I know a little about flaps and landing gear.
The only thing I would need help with is timing.
Roger.
Stop all takeoffs and landings
and we need a flight captain in the tower now!
HANDLING CONTROLS ARE FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.
Due to the unsettled weather over Hakodate
there will be some delays for arrivals
there will be some delays for arrivals as well as departures.
Please be patient.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Here's the deal.
I'm going to sit in the captain's seat.
In the copilot's seat, yes...
you're going to sit.
You handled the helm pretty well.
Hooray!
I used to fly a plane a lot in the Game Center.
H... hey!
Conan-kun, that's mean!
I want to sit there too!
So do I!
This isn't a game!
Besides, the plane doesn't need to be piloted.
However, even
a few maneuvers are necessary for an ILS landing.
He will help me with that.
But not such a rascal...
You can leave it to me!
Well, we'll be landing in 15 minutes.
Please take your seats.
Shinjo-kun said he had some experience, but...
I wonder if he has a Cessna license.
Dad...
Mom fell asleep.
What?
Please return to your seats...
and fasten your seat belts securely.
Dad, can you sit next to mom?
Great. You've got to be kidding me.
Hey, wake up!
Hey, wake up!
Really!
You're the Kid, aren't you?
What are you talking about?
Idiot! Don't play dumb!
Who's going to let
a little boy in the copilot's seat?
Good thinking.
The real Shinjo is surely being...
...as a fake kid in Juri-san's country house in Hakodate.
Right?
Oho.
When you came on board, Juri-san scolded you.
I'm sure she told him
to dress up as a Kid for the party.
Good point. But...
There's another guy who thinks the Kid won't give up...
and is waiting in Hakodate.
He's probably hunting the wrong Kid right now.
So when are you going to get the Jewel of Destiny?
I'm not.
What?
I'm sure you know.
A real star sapphire is cold when it's in your mouth.
It's not real.
That's why he kissed her hand.
They probably passed it off as real...
and advertised it as real to get an audience for "Josephine."
What are you going to do?
Are you going to arrest me? Young detective?
Yes.
As soon as we get this metal bird into the nest.
Sky J, flight 865,
we're transferring you to Hakodate Tower.
Please set frequency to 118.35.
118.35. Roger that.
This is Hakodate Tower.
Control Officer Uesugi.
Transmitting to Flight Captain Shimaoka.
Shimaoka here.
Are you familiar with the "MCP",
the Mode Control Panel?
Yes, I know it.
Then please press the button marked APP.
This will automatically glide the aircraft to the runway.
Roger that.
APP...
There it is!
Is pressed!
Who are you?
My name is Conan Edogawa. I'm assisting Shinjo-san.
Assist? Is there a child sitting next to you?
Kid!
Do not touch the steering wheel or the buttons under any circumstances!
Understand?
Yes.
Now we can breathe easy.
You know about flaps and landing gear?
Sure.
My old man taught me how to fly a Cessna in Hawaii.
I see. Then I picked the right guy.
However, that was only on the ground.
I've never actually flown one.
The weather is miserable.
- But we'll make it. - Yes.
What a downpour!
The wind is blowing hard, too.

We're not going to crash, are we?
The airport!
She's coming!
Flight 865, flaps on one.
Flaps to five.
Flaps to ten.
Landing gear down, flaps to 20.
We're coming in for a landing!
What?
Lightning! We've been hit by lightning!
This is flight 865.
We've been struck by lightning! All the gauges are gone!
Calm down. Turn the white knob next to the light panel.
They're on.
No!
The autopilot is not on!
What?
Abort approach!
Power up, pull the stick!
Good. Retract landing gear.
- It's up. - Good. Continue climb.
Oh no! The wind's pushing her off!
Turn right! Turn right!
They're going to crash into the terminal!
Nose up!
Oh... oh no!
Wow!
Wow!
The airport... I wonder if the tower's okay.
Flight 865. Can you hear me?
Yeah, we hear you.
Extent of damage?
The people in the tower are fine.
But the runway's been damaged. How about you?
We've lost engine number two.
Don't worry about it. You can land with three engines without any problems.
How's the stability?
The attitude is stable.
I've pulled back thrust lever number 3.
Good. What's altitude and speed?
Three thousand feet, 200 knots.
Flaps on five. Go into level flight.
Turn nose to 180 degrees
and climb to 4500.
Roger.
I guess we'll have to circle and wait.
Yes. When the autopilot is back on line
and the runway is established,
we'll be able to land with ILS again.
I told you, the fire trucks are not enough!
Put out the fire on the runway!
Conan-kun! It's terrible!
One of the engines is down!
I know. Don't worry.
We can land safely with the remaining three.
There's plenty of fuel...
What's the matter?
We're almost out of fuel!
What?
- What? - We're out of fuel?
There is no fuel?
Why is that?
Because an engine has fallen off?
No, each engine gets its
fuel from its own tank.
The crossfeed valve is open!
W... what's that supposed to be? This cross anyway?
Crossfeed valve.
If you open the valve,
the fuel tanks connect and you get one.
How did that happen?
Oops.
That old guy!
There's no time to lose!
Yes.
- Hakodate... - There should be maps.
Get them!
- Yes! - Emergency...
Tower, do you read me? Do you read me?
Flight 865, this is tower, we can't hear you very well.
Hey!
I can barely hear you.
What's happening?
Professor...
One of the engines fell off and we're running out of fuel!
I beg your pardon?
Maps... maps... Maps...
Must be the red one.
I've got it!
Damn it!
Autopilot, runway, fuel.
Now we've lost the radio.
The autopilot's not working?
Then you're flying manually?
Conan-kun, here are the maps.
Thank you.
We've got about 3,000 Ibs of fuel left.
We're using 300 a minute.
We only have ten minutes left!
We have to find a place to land.
What do you mean, "somewhere"?
In ten minutes, the airstrip won't be operational.
What about Chitose? The airport there...
Way too close.
We'll run out of fuel before then.
What about other airports?
There are no other airports?
No.
Maybe there are landing fields for agriculture or military.
But the runway lengths are too short.
Wouldn't it be better if we landed on a road?
Hokkaidô is vast and has straight roads.
Impossible.
Our wheelbase is 11 meters.
Roads wider than 12 meters,
are all equipped with a median strip.
Then there are the residents and telegraph poles.
And a meadow?
Can't.
The ground is too soft.
Shouldn't we rather ditch in the sea?
No, the waves could put the plane inverted.
Where? Where?
There must be a suitable place somewhere!
Long and straight,
a place where there's nothing else...
Tell me,
what happens if we can't land?
We'll crash. It's obvious.
What? I don't want to die!
You, Conan-kun, I know where!
Long and straight, a place where there's nothing else.
What?
The other day on "Watching Dolphins and Whales"...
they showed a place like that.
Dolphin and whale watching?
That must be Muroran.
A pier!
SHIN-NITTETSU-PIER
Shin-nittetsu-pier,
NAKAU PIER MOTOWANISHI PIER
Nakau pier, Motowanishi pier,

Muroran Pier, Nisseki Pier...
There!
SAKIMORI-PIER
Sakimori Pier!
The length is about 1400 meters.
I estimate the width to be 30 meters.
But the span...
Yes. It is almost 60 meters.
But if a hill sticks out over the sea, it should be fine.
Forget it! The length is not enough!
This airplane needs a distance
of over 2000 meters.
Ground stability is also a problem.
Fortune or misfortune, we are low on fuel
and hardly any passengers.
The lower the weight,
the shorter the landing distance needed.
With headwind, it shortens even more.
Ah!
According to the Haneda weather news
a strong westerly wind is supposed to blow all night!
- Really, Mitsuhiko? - Yes!
The pier stretches almost from east to west.
SAKIMORI-PIER
If we land against the wind from the east,
- we might make it. - No!
When we hit the tower, my left arm took a hit.
I fly almost exclusively with my right.
For a manual landing
you have to have both hands on the controls.
How is your eyesight?
100 percent in both eyes.
Diseases?
No, none.
What are your measurements?
Um, my chest circumference...
What are you doing?
Okay. You passed.
You sit here for me.
What, what are you talking about?
I can't fly a plane!
Don't worry. I'll tell you what to do.
All you have to do is hold the wheel.
I can't! No way!
The plane!
The plane's going down!
We're going to crash!
Ran-nêchan, quick, sit down!
Slowly pull the control horn towards you.
Easy does it.
Okay. Great. That was easy.
What?
Where's Muroran?
I'm looking.
Got it!
The flight route from Hakodate to Sapporo...
passes by Muroran.
Direction 023 degrees.
023, okay.
It goes over a mountain. Altitude more than 5000.
Roger. Excuse me.
Tell everyone our destination is Chitose.
Yes.
And put the upper deck passengers below.
If they see a student flying..,
they might panic.
You too!
Back to the cabin!
There's nothing
for you to do here.
It would be nice if you
make sure that the other children don't get too warm.
This is an important task.
Shall I assign someone else?
So? Can you do it?
- I understand. - We'll do it.
Leave it to us!
Good. I'm counting on you. I'm counting on you!
Roger!
I'm not going anywhere. If anything happens,
I'm the only one who can help Ran!
Alright.
I'll explain the other devices to you on the way.
We don't have time. Let's go!
Sky J Flight 865,
this is Hakodate Tower, do you read me?
Come in!
It's no use. No answer on the emergency line either.
Look.
865 is moving away.
Where are they going?
So this is the big Shiratori Bridge.
That's pretty impressive, Shiratori-kun.
I'm sorry, inspector,
but it's called Hakucho Bridge.
It was worth it to follow your advice...
...and come to Muroran.
It's really beautiful, Shiratori Bridge.
HAKUCHÔ BRIDGE
Someday I'll come here with Miwako-san....
This place is not worth it.
What a lot of police cars!
They must be chasing a violent criminal.
All right, let's take a look!
Dear passengers,
- after some problems... - I'm scared.
Will it be all right?
...we have set course
to Shin Chitose Airport.
We ask you to forgive this delay...
It's really Muroran.
We're approaching Muroran.
Descend to 2,000 feet.
Yes.
There it is! Lights!
The port of Muroran. The Sakimori pier is further to the left!
Behind the Hakuchô Bridge.
Darn!
It's so dark. I can't see a thing.
Hey, are we supposed to land down there?
What now? There's no turning back now.
Are you sure, Conan-kun?
What are you doing?
It's too risky for me. I'm getting out.
Good luck!
Wait a minute!
Hey, wait!
Ran-nêchan, get your nose down!
Hey! What are you doing?
Hold on to something!
What... what happened?
It's okay. Don't worry.
You stabilize the torso!
Ka... Ka...
Kaitô Kid!
Well, missy, I'm sure we'll meet again...
sometime in the pale moonlight.
Ah. Yes.
Excuse me.
Jumped off?
Yes! Shinjo-san was really the Kid!
I see. That's why he lowered the pressure.

He's afraid of crashing and just takes off.
And I was his fan! Idiot!
Sonoko-nêchan,
it's not certain that we're going to crash.
But Conan-kun,
what are we going to do?
From the looks of it, we'll have to land it, Ran-nêchan.
It'll be fine, Ran.
Three heads combined make the wisdom of one pearl.
It'll be fine!
Hey, hey, she must mean...
You mean the wisdom of Buddha Monju.
Is that what it was called?
Anyway
we should circle around and check things out.
Help!
Help me, please!
I'm not the Kid! You've mistaken me for someone else!
Then why did you run?
Because... Because I stole a watch.
Well, you are the Kid!
Detective Nakamori...
What?
What's that?
You can see it. It's the Kid!
Kid?!
And who are you?
I told you, it's a mix-up!
Sonoko-nêchan, how does it look?
Not good at all.
I see a light here and there,
but you can hardly see anything.
Damn it!
Are you okay, Ran-nêchan?
What's wrong, Ran?
I don't know. My body's suddenly so...
Conan-kun, I can't do this.
Don't say that. You can do it, Ran-neechan.
It's no good. It's too risky like this.
Sonoko-nêchan, will you switch with me?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Bathroom?
Go quickly.
But put on your headsets
in case the radio starts working again.
Hey, wait!
Seriously, how can he go to the bathroom in a situation like this?
in a situation like this?
That's why kids are so...
H... hello?
Hello?
Ran, can you hear me, Ran?
Shin'ichi...
I'm calling from Sapporo Control.
You seem to be in a bad situation.
But everything's going to be fine now. Calm down
and do as I say. The landing will be fine.
I'll protect you for sure. Don't worry.
Do you hear me? Ran?
Ran, answer me!
Answer what? You talk so big!
Don't you know?
The lives of all the passengers are in my hands!
So stop talking nonsense!
You're never around when it matters. Only phone calls!
And if you are, you'll be gone in a minute.
Always...
Always...
I don't want to hear that!
Shin'ichi-nichan said that.
Be patient, Ran.
Don't run away!
I'll be right back!
I'm always the one left behind.
He wants you to wait for him until then.
What do you take me for?
I... I...
I love you, Shin'ichi!
Ran...
Light... I see light!
Red lights moving like a ribbon.
What?
That's how it is.
Damn kid! You can't escape me!
H... hey! Kid's heading for the pier!
Yeah, I see it. Kid's heading for the pier!
A and B are heading to the other side.
Line up your cars at the edge of the pier!
Unit C, follow me.
We're gonna take the Kid down!
There are police cars, Grandpa.
Something must have happened.
They're coming from there, too.
Ran, we're going in for a landing!
The Kid was probably leading police cars here.
So the Kid jumped out...
...to make a runway with their lights!
That's my Kid-sama!
That's what I thought!
Ran, one more left turn.
Roger that.
Where's the Kid? Find him!
He must be around here! Be thorough!
- Did you find him? Did you find him? - No, we don't have him.
And with you?
The rest is up to you, Mr. Detective.
To all passengers! We will now
an emergency landing.
Fasten your seat belts securely
and follow the instructions.
Remove glasses and pens, put high heels in seat pocket.
Lean forward. Put head between legs.
All right, Ran.
Time for the landing.
Your altitude and speed?
Altitude 700 feet,
140 knots.
Good. Maintain a three-degree rate of descent.
- Huh?
Gear lever down, flap lever pull.
F... Gear lever? Flaps?
That's the landing gear lever. There the flaps!
Got it.
Lower the gear lever...
and pull flaps...
W... what?!
What's wrong?
Shin'ichi, we're out of fuel.
Understood.
We only have one chance. Let's take it!
Commissioner Megure!
That plane...
It seems to be heading this way.
Why?
Fifty.
Lift the nose and pull the thrust lever all the way!
Thirty.
Twenty
Take cover!
Ten.
Nose down!
Counter thrust!
Stop! Hold it right there!
Stop! Stop! Stay where you are! Don't move!
Shin'ichi! A crane!
We'll ram it!
Damn it!
The rudder! Pedal right!

We stand.
We are standing still!
Hooray!
Kudô-kun,
apparently your dictionary doesn't have
the word "impossible" doesn't exist either.
You did it, Ran-nêchan!
Ran-nêchan?
Ran!
Ran! Get a hold of yourself!
Sonoko?
They both just lost consciousness.
No wonder.
I put them through a lot.
You did a great job, Ran.
Eyes, I even forgot
Eyes mabataki sae
almost to blink.

Up close I saw

Blood pressure, pulse, both normal. Probably you are
okay, but to be on the safe side, we'll take you to the hospital.
Thank you.
What about Sonoko?
She doesn't have any major injuries either.
She's just unconscious from the shock.
I'm glad to hear that.
Then I'd like you to write your name
and address here.
Yes.
And then...
your body measurements.
That was a really cool landing!
Ka... Ka...
Well, I'm sure we'll meet again soon.
You can tell me your measurements then.
Ka... Ka... Ka...
Hello?
Ran, it's me.
Shin'ichi?
Yeah, you know...
You didn't call before, did you?
I did!
That was the Kid on the phone!
Huh?
It felt weird right away.
Almost as if you were watching!
Also, I heard Conan-kun's voice in between.
Shit.
Oops?
Didn't Sonoko say the Kid had bailed before?
Ah, you know, I was secretly...
Oh, I see. One of the Kid's assistants must have jumped off!
What do you mean?
The Kid stayed on the plane and disguised himself.
What luck! It wasn't you.
What do you mean, lucky?
It turned out all right.
What went well?
It's a secret between the Kid and me.
Come on, tell me.
No! Use your logic. You're a detective.
How can I be a detective?
Why don't you catch the Kid and ask him?
You're mean!
