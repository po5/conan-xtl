Ooka
Too long afflicted
The same favorite card as your master, eh?
It's all thanks to you,
Momiji Ooka.
Once today's shoot is over,
I'll have to thank you.
Well, already?
I wasn't expecting it so soon.
You? But what...
No, what are you...
But for the winter
Spring has come and now the flowers are blooming
Spring has come and now the flowers are blooming
This time I came empty-handed
The cards are flying far, my word.
Ah, don't bother.
I won't.
My apologies.
She's so cute!
Dad, keep it down!
- She is pretty! - She looks like an idol.
The kimono suits her.
But why are we here watching karuta, anyway?
Have you forgotten everything already?
Mikiko told us to wait for her in the dressing room,
but you insisted on following that pretty girl all the way here.
Who is she, Mikiko?
I just introduced her to you!
She's the girl with glasses who plays against the other pretty girl.
She's the president of the karuta club I'm a member of at my high school.
Are you in the club?
So you play karuta, Kazuha?
Yeah, didn't you know?
Apart from that, you took an hour in the toilet.
I'm sorry.
The studio door was locked, so I didn't know if I could get in.
Please...
We're in the middle of a rehearsal, can you keep it down?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
If I had given you my life, I wouldn't have cried
- Class! - Hey, Kudo...
Did he forget that he came to Osaka as a guest on a film set?
You have to forgive him.
As the teacher was busy, he replaced him
to take the children who wanted to visit Osaka at all costs.
What about the rich girl?
Ah, Sonoko?
She got a bad cold.
Anyway, I didn't know
you were in the karuta club, Kazuha.
I'm also in the aikido club.
The karuta club was going to disappear because of lack of members,
so I joined without participating too much.
But sometimes I help Mikiko to train,
I'm like, a zombie member!
A zombie member? Nonsense!
It looks like a lot of fun around here.
It's like a coffee shop.
Excuse me!
DETECTIVE CONAN THE SCARLET LOVE LETTER
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed
the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug,
and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name...
I invented Conan Edogawa.
In order to find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
This is Heiji Hattori,
the high school detective from western Japan.
He's inherited his father's talent as a police commissioner in Osaka,
and has already solved many cases.
He is one of the few people who know my real identity.
This is Kazuha Toyama.
She is Hattori's childhood friend.
She worries too much about Hattori, he says.
Will it be the case this time?
Finally, the enigmatic future "Queen" of karuta...
Who is she?
My body is younger, but not my mind!
I will solve all the mysteries!
There is always only one truth!
Nichiuri TV
What's the point of visiting a TV studio if you stay in the dressing room?
I wanted to see the set...
They won't let us, Mr. Kogoro was scolded already...
"The world of karuta of the Satsuki Association" Mr. Kogoro Mouri
Sorry, I was the one who was too loud.
I know,

when they're back, we'll go shopping for souvenirs.
- Really? - For real?
If you behave until the end of the shoot.
- Of course we will! - So cool!
We'll all go together!
By the way,
where did Conan go?
Ah, well...
he's watching Daddy for me.
Hey, bug!
I told you to go wait with the others.
But Ran told me to stay and see how the shoot was going.
- This one, then... - Watch out!
Make way, we're bringing the karuta cards!
Wow, the cards from the Satsuki Association!
Aren't they overdoing it just for the cards?
What are you talking about, Kazuha?
These are the traditional cards
used in the finals of the association's national tournament.
Right, it's your dream to play a match with these cards, right?
Not only mine.
A lot of people have been dreaming about it since the creation of the association 20 years ago.
I would love to play in the finals with these legendary cards!
Say...
Why are they only used for the finals?
The games are very intense, so they get pretty damaged.
So outside the finals, they're put under glass
and displayed in a museum.
Okay, but is the security guard really necessary?
Absolutely!
During last year's finals, a card was lost.
They found it quickly in the end,
but it showed the flaws in the security,
and the current master, Mr Yajima, convinced President Achiwa.
I see.
By the way... who are these people again?
What are you, stupid?
They're the two guests on the show!
Are they?
Always out of touch, the old man...
In this picture, that's President Kensuke Achiwa.
He made his fortune by founding his own real estate company.
They call him "the king of real estate" here.
And why does a guy like him play karuta?
It's his only hobby, I hear.
He's got quite a swing too.
But it says here that he preferred to become a reader rather than a player.
Who is this beautiful woman?
That's Satsuki, Mr. Achiwa's wife.
Damn, she's married.
She's the founder of the Satsuki association, she used to be a queen.
Her husband then took over as the president of the association.
Let's see what else they say about him...
Ah, that sounds interesting.
"Whenever his wife had an important game to play,
Mr. Achiwa would wash his car for good luck.
For him, having a clean car was the secret to good fortune."
So, for the show I'm doing,
will she be there with you two?
No.
Mrs. Satsuki
passed away from illness three years ago.
Only the president will be with us during the shooting.
Oh well...
Hey, who's that strong-looking man who's always
with Mr. Achiwa in the pictures?
Oh, him...
That's Togo Kaieda, Mr. Achiwa's private secretary.
I heard he was very good at business and was running a part of the company behind the scenes.
a part of the company,
but he resigned before disappearing.
Hey, Hattori!
Don't spread such baseless gossip.
The president doesn't do anything in the shadows.
Yeah, Heiji!
Calm down, it's just a rumor.
The president is coming!
Here comes President Achiwa, I'll go and greet him.
Mr. Achiwa, thank you for coming!
My pleasure. Thank you for seeing me.
Of course!
On the program, there will be a friendly match between Yajima and Momiji,
and then a discussion, right?
Yes, and for the live broadcast,
we'll be using the Satsuki Association cards
that you have generously agreed to lend us
to show the whole country the beauty of karuta!
The Satsuki Association cards have arrived, I see.
- Please take good care of them. - I will.
What a presence!
Yeah, he's not Osaka's real estate king for nothing.
Please, could someone call Mr. Yajima?
It's almost time for the shoot,
but we haven't heard anything.
That's strange.
He said he'd be here an hour before the start.

He is usually so serious!
Ask Sekine to come, just in case.
In the worst case, we'll make him play instead.
No, it's impossible...
We have some free time before the show.
So, yes.
Say Heiji, which okonomiyaki restaurant are we going to?
What a question! You know where the best is.
Yes, I thought you might want to...
Sorry, are you okay?
Ah, you were the one playing karuta...
This is fate.
I was hoping I'd run into you here...
my future husband!
Her future...
husband?
I'm free after the shoot, you know.
She's got quite a pair, this girl!
Hey, you!
- Wait, uh... - Miss Momiji!
Sorry, could you come back to your dressing room for a moment?
You're interrupting me at the best of times.
Actually, Mr. Yajima's running late.
He is?
However, he's the one who asked for this shoot.
He must be very busy.
See you later, Heiji.
Yes, see you later.
Who was that chick?
- She's the pretty girl on the set. - She's really beautiful!
He called her "Miss Momiji"...
But I'm telling you I don't know her!
Mytho, she called you by your first name!
Ran!
Let's wait outside.
They're in the middle of an argument.
Let's go!
Why is she getting so upset?
I don't know. I must have met her somewhere.
Ah, you finally admit it! You see that you know her.
No, I don't!
If I knew such a beauty, I'd remember her first.
Such a beauty?
Well, you're unforgettable too... for other reasons.
What the hell does that mean?
Hey, say.
You really don't know who that is, do you, Heiji?
"Momiji Ooka"?
"Champion of Satsuki High School Tournament two years in a row.
Currently a junior in Kyoto High School,
all indications are that she'll win the Queen's title one day."
Momiji Ooka?
The future Queen?
Is this the criminal's warning? Osaka Police Station
Is this the criminal's warning?
Yes, it just says there will be a bomb at Nichiuri TV studio.
What does this karuta card mean?
It was attached to the e-mail.
We still don't know what it means.
Does Nichiuri TV know about it?
We've notified them, but it's okay.
What do you think, Heizo?
Is it serious or just a bad joke?
It's hard to tell just from this e-mail,
but if it's not a joke, it'll make a lot of noise.
Osaka police just sent out an evacuation order.
- Everyone stop what you're doing... - What's going on?
And go down the nearest fire escape.
What's going on?
Is there an evacuation drill?
Is something starting?
She said something about the police.
Maybe it's for a movie...
Please evacuate through the nearest stairwell.
Hey, go see what's going on!
Yes !
What's the matter?
Kazuha, go down the fire escape!
Got it?
What about you?
I'll see what's going on.
You go down first!
Wait, Heiji!
Watch out!
Hey, kid!
Where are you going?
I forgot something in the studio.
You idiot, didn't you hear the announcement?
I'm sorry.
I've never had to deal with this...
And I've never had to evacuate in a kimono!
It's terrible, we have to leave quickly!
Calm down, what's the matter?
The studio received a bomb threat!
What is it?
Mr. Achiwa!
Maybe it's not true,
but we'd better get out of here until we're sure.
Yes, you're right.
All right, everybody, let's do what the announcement says!
Come on, out!
What are you waiting for, Mikiko?
Get out of here, it's dangerous.
You too, Mr. Achiwa.
What are you doing? Come on, let's go.
Move along quietly, please.
It's all right, there's no danger.
Children, stay close to me, okay?
What, are we going to have to wait again?
No answer...
We left Dad behind, I hope he's okay.
Ran!
Dad, Conan!
What's all this about?
Did they have a surprise evacuation drill?

No, they made an announcement that said
there was a bomb threat.
Wow, seriously?
By the way, where are Kazuha and Hattori?
Huh?
They're not with you?
No.
- I'm worried. I'll go get them... - No, I'll go.
You, you stay here,
do you understand?
We're busy, it's not the time for an exercise!
That's really too much...
Heiji!
Mikiko!
I told you to go ahead!
But I was worried about you two!
Sorry, Kazuha.
I can't leave the maps!
I have to be able to locate him with the GPS on his smartphone.
What, Hattori's still inside?
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Leave that and hurry out!
- What the... - Mikiko!
Kazuha!
Hattori!
Do you have any idea how dangerous it is...
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!
I swear...
I picked up three people in Studio 3.
Mikiko!
I've been worried sick!
I'm sorry, sir.
But if the bomb threat is true,
I couldn't leave them there...
It could explode at any time.
We'll stay on standby at a distance.
Okay, thanks.
We'll take care of evacuating the remaining three people.
- There's not going to be anyone left after that? - No.
All right.
Let's get that explosive.
- Start the operation! - Yes, sir!
They are entering... is there really a bomb?
No, of course not.
Come on, faster!
This way!
Really?
Get back!
Everybody back!
Move away from the building!
Hurry, President!
Watch out!
Kazuha!
- Wow... - Don't move, it's dangerous!
Damn it!
Where the hell are they?
Don't tell me you're still in there, Hattori!
Kazuha!
Don't go in!
It's too risky, let's go.
Ouch!
Are you alright? Can you run?
- Yes, I can. - Good, let's go then. This way! This way!
It's going to be hard to get in now...
Yes.
- People are coming out! - So there were still some left?
Just two, from what they said.
What's that?
Kazuha, this way!
Come on, move!
Heiji!
That was close...
Get back, back!
It's all over down there.
Kazuha, come on!
Let's go up.
What's wrong? Shouldn't we go down?
The exit is blocked, so let's get some air.
Hattori, don't tell me...
You're going upstairs?
It's no use, it's not getting any reception...
Go ahead, Kazuha.
Kazuha!
This way!
Isn't the roof made of concrete?
Keep going!
We have to get closer!
We can't, it's too dangerous!
Excuse me, make way!
This sucks...
I can't see anything with this smoke!
I can't make it alone, but with some help...
Kudo!
It's going to be tight.
But no choice.
Come on!
Here!
It's about time!
Hattori!
Heiji, where are you taking us?
Come on, it's the only way out.
Where do you see a way out?
We're going to go down, get ready!
Go down from here? You can't be serious!
Hey, we're all set!
I'm ready too.
There's no time, we'll have to go down at once.
- Kazuha! - Are you sure?
Wait, I can't see!
Don't do it, Heiji!
Close your eyes and hold on tight!
Hey, don't...
Wait! Wait!
Sorry, I'll wait for you downstairs.
Yeah, right.
Kudo!
Damn it!
No !
I can't believe...
There are people here, come quickly!
Let go of me!
- Yes, they're here! - Get a stretcher!
Kazuha!
Heiji...
Damn, that was my only way out!
Think about it, there's got to be another way out.
A helicopter?
No, that won't do.
With the flames and the smoke,
it won't even get close.
Wait, there's a river next to the studio.
If I jump in there...
Let's try it.
Damn, I don't have anywhere to accelerate from with my skateboard...
Oh no...
I barely breathe and my lungs feel like they're on fire.
I have to do something
...do something...
Ran!
I'm not giving up.
There's got to be
...where I can speed up with my skateboard...
There!
What are you waiting for to run away, Kudo?
This is...

Yes, it's him.
But what is he trying to do?
I see!
I see.
Again...
Faster!
I can't breathe.
Come on, just a little more!
It's falling apart!
It's now or never!
Damn, I didn't get enough momentum!
No, I can't reach it!
It's about time.
Hop on!
Are you alright, Kudo?
Yeah, kind of.
Here, you almost lost them.
Thanks for that.
But I'm surprised.
Why did you have your skateboard? You knew about the explosion in advance?
Don't be silly, how would I know?
I just took it just in case.
Didn't your "just in case" jinx us?
It looks like it did.
Kazuha!
Ran!
- Are you alright? - I'm fine.
I don't remember everything,
But I just inhaled a little smoke, it seems.
As long as you're okay...
If you're okay, that's the main thing.
Ran, I think I've lost my car keys.
- I'll go get them. - Okay.
By the way, where's Conan?
He was with us, but...
Oh, there he is.
- Oh, yeah. - Conan!
- Where have you been? - We've been worried.
Kazuha.
Hey, Heiji!
Where did you go again?
Well, not far.
And you, Conan! We were worried, you know?
Sorry about that.
Where else is Mikiko?
She hurt her wrist and was taken to the hospital.
Her wrist?
I hope it's not serious.
I asked for the name of the hospital. Shall we go there?
- Yes! - Let's go!
Heiji!
- Otaki! - Thank God you're all right!
Kazuha, can you go ahead?
- I'll be there soon! - You're pushing it!
- Let's go, Ran. - Right...
Come on, Conan.
Don't wander off, okay?
Yes...
See you later, Conan.
Is it true that the police received a warning?
Yes, this is the message we got at the station.
It had a picture of a card on it.
There must be a connection with today's karuta program.
But given the state of the Nichiuri studio...
The analysis of the crime scene will take a while.
That's for sure.
Why did the culprit do this?
Osaka Police Hospital
Thank you very much for everything.
Please take care of yourself.
So, what did they tell you?
It's okay, it's just a scratch.
What a relief.
And to think that this is all happening right before the tournament.
That's right. If I was expecting this...
This may be the first year we have to cancel the tournament.
No way!
We should do it now.
But the cards that were supposed to be used in the finals have burned up.
You don't need to worry about that,
they're still intact.
What? But how...
Miss Hiramoto took them before she left.
Mikiko took them?
They're perfectly safe, I assure you...
Is that true?
Are the association's cards really intact?
The museum took them away
to make sure there was no damage.
The cards are safe now, Mr. President.
Don't worry about them.
I'm glad to hear that, because I thought they were already lost.
So Mikiko saved them. How is she?
Her life is apparently not in danger, but...
They're still examining her.
I see.
It's taking Mikiko a long time.
For a simple first-aid treatment, yes...
Thank you for everything.
Mikiko! Your arm...
Yes, it's broken, apparently.
I deserved that.
But no...
I put you in danger to get the cards back.
Don't be silly!
Thank you, Mikiko.
You saved the cards, which are the very image of the Satsuki Association.
As its president, I'm very grateful to you.
But I can't participate in the tournament like this.
It is true that it is a shame for the Satsuki Association
that a player of your level doesn't participate,
but the most important thing is that your arm heals.
He is right.
You still have next year.
No, I won't.
If I don't do well in the tournament this year,
our high school club will be shut down.
I can't bear it if it's shut down because of me.
President.
The inspectors are waiting, it's time to go.
I'll be right there.

- Don't lose hope, Mikiko. - I can't help it.
It's true that apart from you and me,
we don't have any members who can play in a tournament.
That's right, Kazuha! You can participate!
You can represent Kaiho High School instead of me.
This is too sudden. I can't!
Have you ever played in a competition, Kazuha?
No, I haven't!
But you always train with me.
You have stamina and good reflexes.
And you have a competitive spirit, you don't back down from anyone!
Not to mention that you're not afraid of ridicule.
I don't think you're complimenting me.
When will this tournament take place?
Well, actually, it's the day after tomorrow.
Everything will be fine!
If we start practicing now, I know you'll be fine.
Do you think you'll win by sending a beginner?
Do you want us to play with simplified iroha-karuta cards?
Don't mess with us!
I always train with Kazuha, I know what she is capable of.
She has never played in a tournament, but she has the level of a rank A player.
Is this girl really that strong?
I saw you with Heiji, by the way.
What is your relationship with her?
We've been together since childhood, she's my...
My...
Your lover, right?
- It's obvious by looking at you. - Too obvious!
Shut up a little!
"My suffering in the end," then.
A one-sided love for a childhood friend.
This poem suits you perfectly.
How about this:
The winner of the tournament will be the first candidate to be his fiancée
and can declare her love first.
Would you like that?
What are you talking about?
If you're really serious, it shouldn't scare you.
Kazuha, don't do it!
I have to tell you...
that I'm serious.
Wait!
I'll accept the challenge!
- Kazuha! - No kidding!
I hope you'll still be motivated on the day of the tournament.
Same to you.
You'd better not lose first!
On that note, I'll leave you to it.
I have a manicure to attend to,
and I have to think about what to say to Heiji.
She's a little freaky.
It was quite a scene.
I'm definitely impressed with you!
You've knocked Momiji down a peg.
Help me...
What was I thinking promising that?
- My apologies. - No, I did.
Dad, did you find your keys?
No, actually...
I looked everywhere, but they're nowhere to be found.
I'll have to make a copy.
What is it, Conan?
The girl from earlier dropped this.
Let me see.
Oh, yeah, there's her name.
- I'll take it back to her, Dad. - What, you know her?
This is the horror... What am I going to do?
I don't know.
She was a little scary, but...
She was really too beautiful!
If she tells him how she feels, Heiji will be thrilled.
But Kazuha is the only one who really suits him.
For real?
For real!
I don't have time to procrastinate.
We start training tonight!
I've never been to the hospital before.
It's so big, you could get lost.
Ran, she's here!
Momiji!
Wait, wait, wait!
Momiji, wait!
There she goes.
What do we do now?
We know her name and school,
but it would be faster to look up her address in it.
Yeah, probably.
Can I have a look?
Yes.
Let's see... ah, a picture.
Who is this man?
There's another one.
It's a childhood picture.
That's Momiji, and...
Hattori!
They're making a promise.
What could they have promised each other?
To get married, maybe.
- When they're so young? - Yeah, it can't be!
Although, irresponsible as he is...
It could be.
That's Heiji's bike.
Don't talk about the picture!
Especially not to Kazuha.
Well then, are you expecting someone?
No, I'm not.
What's wrong with it?
Ran..,
Were you able to return the lost item?
Uh, yes.
Took you long enough.
Did you find out anything?
No, the Osaka Police don't know anything yet.
Otaki will let me know if there's any news.
President, this seems to be an emergency.
Can you answer the phone?

Yes, of course.
I swear...
- Yes, what is it? - Ran's got a mind of his own.
Kyoto Precinct?
So this is about Yajima?
What about him? Was he killed?
- Hattori! - Yeah, he was.
- Wait, you two! - Okay, I'll be right back.
Good work, gentlemen.
Hey, you two can't stay here.
We're with Kogoro Mouri.
And what else?
You can let them pass, it's okay.
All right, sir.
It's been a long time.
Detective Ayanokoji!
The victim is Mr Toshiya Yajima.
He was the heir of a liquor factory and lived alone in his mansion.
The death is estimated to have occurred around six o'clock in the morning
and the body was discovered at 2 p.m., eight hours later.
Be careful where you step, everything has been ransacked.
Got it.
A robbery, you say?
Given the state of the house, the killer had come to steal it, it's obvious.
Yes, that's what we think too.
He might have entered looking for valuables
but Mr. Yajima surprised him.
The killer knocked him out with a Japanese sword he was going to steal
before running off with the money.
But why?
As far as I can see, the victim was playing karuta.
It looks like it, yes.
What, are you in?
Inspector, would you allow me to inspect the crime scene?
Do as you please, we're done here.
Are you sure?
Nevertheless,
we're going to need to take the murder weapon with us.
Yeah, no problem.
Let these kids stay as long as they want.
All right.
I'll wait for you outside.
Let me know if you find anything.
I will.
What do you think?
I don't know if it's a clue,
but his right hand...
- Did you notice it, too? - Yeah, I did.
It looks like something bloody was forcibly removed from it.
All that was bloodstained here
is these cards.
He may have wanted to leave a clue for the killer,
but the killer saw it and mixed it in with the others.
It's going to be a pain to find it among all the others.
Don't worry about it.
I know a pro at this.
How about this?
The remote control is full of blood, it must have been close to the body.
I'm sorry, sir,
do you mind if I turn up the TV?
- No, go ahead. - Thank you, sir.
If he was using the remote just before he was killed,
he must have been watching TV.
This is Momiji Ooka.
So Mr. Yajima was watching this when he was attacked?
What's the matter?
It looks like an old game.
"Turns 15 to 20,
Satsuki Association High School Tournament."
Why was he watching that?
The matches in the finals are of a very high standard.
You can learn a lot from watching them,
in terms of strategy and card placement.
It doesn't seem to me to be related to the murder.
But...
No "but", you are starting to piss me off!
Come on, you too!
No more playing detective.
Goodbye, gentlemen, sorry for the inconvenience.
Let go of me, uncle!
We can walk ourselves!
Let's move on to the news.
- The Nichiuri TV studio in Osaka... - Are they still talking about it?
I am worried.
But why are you turning off the lights, Ai?
You are worried every time they replay the news.
I can't help it.
The children called you, though.
Yes, but Shinichi still hasn't answered me.
Conan Edogawa Call
Look, all you had to do was talk about it.
Put him on the phone later!
Yes, I will.
Can we know what you were doing, without even calling us?
The teacher was very worried.
I'm sorry, a lot has happened.
Well, what did you want?
I sent you some pictures on your computer.
Can you take a look at the cards on them?
First you get caught in an explosion,
and now bloody cards?
I'd like you to find out which card the victim was holding.
Fussy as you are, you should find out.
I'm picky?
There's a photo of a man in the mix.
Can you check him out, by the way?
Is he connected to the cards?
Maybe, it's a lead.
Well, give me some time, I'll see what I can do.
Thanks, I'm counting on you.
I'll see you later.

Wait, the teacher wanted to...
Not cool.
So, the members who run the Satsuki association would be targeted?
Yes, we need to watch two of them.
I'll take care of Mr. Achiwa.
He's staying at the same hotel as us, I think.
So I'll take care of Momiji Ooka.
Hey!
Who are you?
I'm from the Satsuki group, please let me pass.
Wait, let's ask.
Sekine!
Where have you been?
I've been calling you.
Sorry, president.
I drank a lot last night,
and fell asleep without checking my phone battery.
Oh, come on!
When I woke up
I saw on the news about the explosion at the studio.
I called the association and was told that you were looking for me to replace Yajima,
so I ran over, and saw all those people...
Why all the police? Is Yajima okay?
No, actually...
He was murdered.
It was a burglar who did it
with a sword found at the scene.
A sword? How horrible.
Mr. Achiwa, can you introduce us?
Excuse me, sir.
I'm a photographer and member of the Satsuki Association,
my name is Koji Sekine.
Sekine is Yajima's rival.
They have been playing against each other in the final of the tournament for the past two years.
I lost both times
and I thought I'd finally get my revenge this year.
It's impossible now.
By the way, are you still planning to cancel the tournament?
Well, I don't know...
Don't give up, president!
If we cancel our traditional tournament because of his death,
then Yajima will have taken that sword blow for nothing!
Sekine, please watch your words.
Sorry, I'm getting carried away.
I'm from the Kyoto Police.
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions,
do you have a moment to spare?
Of course, whatever you want.
- Well, this way please. - I'll be right with you.
Mr. Mouri,
-I was thinking of going back to Osaka... - Hey, Kudo, I think I have the culprit.
So do I.
He's probably the one who killed Mr Yajima.
But I still don't know if he's the one...
...who planted the bomb at the studio, probably meant for the Satsuki group.
Yes, the same.
We should do as we said and keep an eye
on Mr. Achiwa and Momiji.
Yes.
New Otani Hotel
- Dibs! - Deuz!
You cheated! Wait for me!
Wow, the size of the room!
Sonoko booked it for us.
She really wanted to come here in the first place,
so she booked us a hotel near the TV studio.
I'm not surprised about the Suzuki Group.
Yes, it is.
They'll be training all night, so we'll have to bring them food.
Here you go, thank you.
Pfft, why do I have to deal with all this?
I like to see you cheer your friends on with all your might.
I mean, if I have to...
Let the training begin!
We'll help you.
Let us know if you need anything.
We'll support you all the way!
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - You rock!
It's ringing.
- Who is it? - The professor.
I want to speak to him!
Let's all answer it.
Yes, good idea.
Good luck with the training!
We'll go over there so you don't get in the way.
Is this what they call...
supporting us to the hilt?
Ah, it shows.
Is everything okay, since earlier?
- Yeah, we're fine. - We're fine.
We're at the hotel now.
Okay, that's good!
Oh no!
And yes, it's the long-awaited...
teacher quiz!
Is that why you're calling?
Come on, let's go!
The particular style of competitive karuta
is similar to a traditional Japanese activity.
Which one is it?
One: tea harvesting.
Two: kite flying.
Three: making mochi.
Four: harvesting rice.
The stacked cards may remind the tea leaves.
The kite... Is the kite good?
Maybe the mochi, since you have to use your arms.
Is this your last word?
This is answer 4: rice harvest.
Ai!
The rice is "reaped", karu, in a "field", ta, so...
Karu-ta!
You mowed the rice under my foot...
And if not,
don't take advantage of the trip to gorge yourself on sweets.
Yes, yes, yes!
Well, I'm hanging up now.
All right, I'll hang up.
It's true that it's late.

- It was a long day... - Dad is still not here.
Do you think Heiji is still with him?
You should call him, if you're worried.
Yeah, I guess I should.
What's up, Kazuha?
Are you kidding me?
Where are you hanging out at this hour?
What? In Kyoto?
Why?
Sorry, I'll be a while, don't wait to get home.
What, are you serious?
I was hoping you'd help me practice karuta.
Practice?
I'm supposed to enter the tournament in Mikiko's place.
But you've never been to a tournament, have you?
That's why I'm training!
You were great at karuta when you were a kid, right?
Oh, that's right,
I entered a tournament in I don't know where, in elementary school.
And you won, that surprised everyone!
It was a long time ago, I don't remember anything.
I haven't forgotten.
When Mikiko took me into the club,
it was the first thing I thought of.
Well, are you done thinking about the good old days?
I'm hanging up now.
How do you talk to me!
Say it, if you're tired of me calling you.
I never said that!
Whatever, I don't need your help.
Are you offended?
Let it go, you moron!
What's his problem?
What is her problem?
Well, if she wants to...
It's me, could you do me a favor?
Ooka
Yes, here it is, please.
I'm exhausted.
Back at last, sir?
Even in Osaka, crimes follow me around...
But, sir...
Say, where is Conan?
He wanted to go back with me in the car,
but once he got to the hotel,
he followed Mr. Achiwa to talk to him about something.
That Conan, he's incorrigible.
If the killer is who I think he is,
it's unlikely he'll go after Mr. Achiwa tonight.
What's wrong, Ran?
- Are you almost done? - Uh, yes.
Come back soon, then.
With all these incidents, I'm worried.
Yeah, right.
I'll be right back.
There you go.
Even if he goes out, I can follow him.
But it's good...
What is she doing here?
Our wishes...
You're too strong, Kazuha!
You're too strong for me...
Are you crazy? A little more and I was...
That's me.
Conan!
There's someone who will help us.
- What's up? - Who is it?
Heiji's mother!
Heiji told me everything.
I came as soon as I could.
But why?
To help you, of course. Are you good at karuta?
Yes, but...
I will be your opponent.
As a former Queen, I should be up to the task.
You were a Queen ?
This is a request from Heiji.
I will teach you everything I know.
But we don't have enough time, so I will be very strict.
Are you ready anyway?
Yes, thank you for your help!
I knew you'd come,
Detective Ayanokoji.
We had the same idea, I see.
Yes.
Isn't the little detective here?
He's watching Mr. Achiwa.
I see, you make a good team.
But I would have swapped with him after all.
I didn't expect her to live in a house this big.
Thank you for your service.
I work for Miss Momiji,
my name is lori.
How about taking a break over a cup of tea?
Were you worried about me,
my dear future husband?
Whose color a thousand times passed By the waters does not fade?
Damn!
He didn't leave the hotel, it seems.
What a way even dreamed
You have worked well.
I didn't think you would last so long.
Let's get some rest.
I can go on!
Breaks are part of training.
I'll get you a bowl of porridge.
Kazuha!
Are you OK?
Let her sleep.
She's been training non-stop.
How is she doing?
Better than I thought, she'll probably make it to the semi-finals.
But advancing to the finals may be difficult.
Oh no...
Just let me finish.
I said it would be difficult, not impossible.
Competitive karuta requires mental strength and concentration.
Two qualities she possesses.
As long as she plays with peace of mind,

she is capable of winning.
If I show her this picture, she won't have peace of mind.
Meeting room
I won't be long,
listen to me calmly.
You are funny, I have to leave soon.
Well, what do you want from me?
It's about the murder of Mr. Yajima.
A thief did it, right?
Are you sure about that?
Me, I rather think...
it was a cold-blooded murder.
No way!
I admit he had a bad temper,
but nobody was angry enough to kill him!
- Not even you? - Don't talk nonsense!
Why me?
Mr. Sekine.
You lost two years in a row in the tournament
because Mr. Yajima defeated you both times.
If he were gone, you could...
Stop talking nonsense!
Sure, I'd like to win,
but killing my rival for that? That would be crazy!
The police think it was a robbery, so why not you?
For several reasons.
First of all, the hypothesis of a robbery doesn't fit.
The culprit did not touch a single object related to the karuta.
Perhaps he acted in panic after killing it.
This is possible.
But in my opinion,
the culprit loved the karuta too much
to damage these objects.
This is not a common reasoning for a detective.
Nevertheless, it remains a supposition on your part.
And above all,
- what does it concern me? - Damn!
In fact!
What?
The floorboards in her hallway were creaking.
They used to creak a lot, remember?
So what?
With all that noise,
he should have heard that someone was approaching.
But the autopsy revealed no signs of a struggle.
I see.
You're trying to say that Yajima knew the killer..,
but you're wrong.
Karuta requires concentration, even during training.
Once you concentrate hard, you don't pay attention to anything else.
That's why he was killed without noticing the intruder.
This is not possible.
The fatal blow was delivered in the middle of his forehead.
If he had continued playing without noticing the intruder,
the wound would have been on the back or even the side of his head.
This means that such an injury was impossible
unless Mr. Yajima knew the killer.
The killer knows about karuta,
was known to Mr. Yajima, and has no alibi at the time of the crime.
And finally, he is someone who would profit from his death.
It's strange, everything points to me.
Except that
it's all a complete coincidence.
If you want to accuse me, you'll need proof.
Mr. Sekine, it's time. We have to go.
Yes, I'm coming.
I'm sorry, your time is up.
Goodbye, Mr. Sekine.
Just one more thing, please.
What else?
You said something that bothered me,
I don't know if you remember.
If we cancel our traditional tournament because of his death,
then Yajima will have taken that sword blow for nothing!
Is that what you said?
Since the weapon was a sword, we'd expect him
that he was cut or pierced with it.
However, you mentioned a "blow".
The sword was used without being taken out of its sheath,
but only the killer would know that.
How did you know that he was struck to death with it?
Because I saw his corpse, that's how.
How's that?
The body had been covered just before you arrived.
You couldn't have seen it.
Well, I figured it out.
Seeing the blood or whatever, I got the impression he'd been beaten to death.
In any case, I didn't kill him!
No, but what a nerve.
We have disturbed him, let's see how he reacts.
Now we have to watch...
the place of the match, right?
Yes, I asked around,
and it won't be easy.
Anyway, it's very big.
What's that building on the cliff?
The Satsuki Hall.
Satsuki?
Yes.
Mr. Achiwa had it built as a tribute to his wife, Satsuki,
and named it after her.
I see.
The two finalists and Mr. Achiwa as the reader,

only go up once a year.
And all the details of the match
are recorded by cameras and microphones in the walls
to broadcast to a room on the other side for the spectators.
They have not skimped on the means.
The room is also equipped with a ventilation system
which preserves it from outside temperatures,
and is surrounded by an anti-noise wall that blocks all outside noise.
All the latest equipment.
They really built the perfect room to play karuta.
I'm getting hungry.
Shall we have an all-you-can-eat buffet?
I want to eat cakes!
Well, I'm going out for a while.
Have fun!
- Hurry, Ran! - We're bored!
See you later.
- See you. - Don't get lost.
I'm here now.
Hurry, before there's nothing left!
Madam! Shall we resume training?
Don't be in such a hurry.
Rest a little more or you'll collapse before the match.
No, I'll be fine.
Kazuha, don't tell me
you're training with Mrs. Shizuka, the old queen?
Yes, I am.
That's great, you could win thanks to her!
Let's go back to training quickly.
If you want to train so much,
would you like to fight me?
I'm not sure you'll make it to the final.
Repeat that, to see?
Kazuha, you rest.
Madam!
I will be your opponent.
If you like me, of course.
You are the former Queen, Shizuka Ikenami.
Why are you helping this girl?
So, will you play against me?
Well, if you insist, I will gladly accept.
Where are Mr. Achiwa and Sekine?
They are going to the Achiwa complex, where the competition rooms are,
to prepare for tomorrow's tournament.
They have a police escort so they should be fine,
but once they get there, it's not safe.
What about Momiji?
There's nothing to worry about.
She lives in Kyoto, so she'll come with the others.
Sorry, I'm being called.
I found the identity of the man on the photo
you sent me.
Is it true?
Yes, it's quite surprising actually.
I sent you everything by e-mail,
you can check it out.
Thank you.
By the way, what about the cards?
I just entered them into the software.
The professor's good.
We should be able to figure out which card it was within the hour, at the earliest.
Great, let me know as soon as the analysis is complete.
Yes.
What the hell!
From: Haibara Here's the info on Nagoro.
"Shikao Nagoro."
I haven't had this much fun in a long time.
Thank you.
Let's go home, lori.
Yes.
Anyway, you've got guts.
If you're surprised by a game of this level, what do you hope to accomplish?
Remember this: my name means maple.
But you, like your name, are just a leaf.
A leaf?
That's enough.
You may be a beginner, but I won't do you any favors.
I already made that mistake,
and I bit my fingers.
I will never forget that frustration.
Therefore, I'll take you on with everything I've got.
You better!
Come on, let's not talk about karuta anymore.
Shouldn't you go? The president must be worried.
Thank you for your concern, but I'm safe.
I have with me Heiji Hattori, the high school detective from the west.
What do you mean by that?
Come on, didn't he tell you?
Heiji is my bodyguard.
He spent all last night
standing guard outside my house.
On that note, I'll leave you to it.
I'll look forward to our match.
Well, Heiji's good at it.
Kazuha, are you all right?
Heiji!
I don't know what's going on with you and that girl,
but I'm going to knock her down.
You'll see!
Very well said!
What's the matter with you?
I don't know,
I just got a chill, all of a sudden...
Maybe you have a cold.
If that's all it was!
No, it was much more sinister...
Here they are.
President Achiwa,
Momiji Ooka,
and Sekine.
They're all here.
No !
Sekine's car!
Osaka Police Station
So, how is Mr. Sekine?

Doctors said he is still unconscious.
They don't know if they can save him.
The young Ooka was there too, was she hurt?
It seems that she was unharmed,
but her driver, lori, took her to the hospital just in case.
The situation has changed with this incident.
So you owe us an explanation,
Mr. Achiwa.
We are becoming more and more convinced
that the bomb at Nichiuri TV studio was intended for the Satsuki Association.
Tell us, sir,
who is Shikao Nagoro?
Where did you get this picture, kid?
I can tell from your reaction that you know him.
Is there something you should tell us,
Mr. Achiwa?
There was a karuta association in Kyoto called Nagoro.
They followed an elitist policy,
had fewer than 20 members and followed a rigorous training program.
Shikao Nagoro was the head of this association.
He was particularly gifted
and was expected to face the master soon,
but he was obsessed with winning
and in all honesty, his game was not pleasant to watch.
Hey, there!
I hit it first.
Give me that card!
What do you mean I made a mistake?
Are you blind or something?
And five years ago, Nagoro
challenged Satsuki, then president of the association.
The loser had to disband her association.
What, he wanted her to close her association?
But Mrs. Satsuki didn't have to accept his challenge, did she?
He made sure she couldn't refuse
by warning the media in advance.
He taunted the Satsuki Association, saying that we would be too afraid to accept.
I see.
Put like that, she was forced to accept.
So who won?
The match didn't happen.
Nagoro never showed up on the day of the match.
Satsuki was finally declared the winner by withdrawal,
and after making so much noise and running away on the day of the match,
Nagoro was seen as a disgrace to the karuta world.
He totally disappeared from the karuta scene.
What happened to him and his association?
In the absence of its president, the association closed,
and no one knows where Nagoro himself went.
Do you think that our case
is a revenge from Nagoro to your association ?
I don't know. But at the time,
the one who pushed hardest to close down the Nagoro Association
was Yajima, who was just killed.
Is that so?
We at the Satsuki Society
wanted to close the incident without making too much noise,
but we couldn't.
What about the other members of the Nagoro association?
Of course, we accepted those who wanted to join us.
Only two members joined us, though.
Wait, don't tell me it's about...
Yes, Momiji Ooka and Sekine.
The two victims of the last incident!
Yes.
The young Ooka in particular has totally absorbed
the techniques taught by Nagoro to improve herself.
They have the same favorite cards,
and the six cards with a poem about the Japanese maple tree, the momiji,
have never been stolen from them.
She was truly his best disciple.
Why are Nagoro's favorite cards the maple poems?
Because her first name is Shikao, which means deer.
- For the meat? - That's right.
Deer meat is also called momiji.
And so, his beloved disciple joined the Satsuki association.
Nagoro must not have liked it.
But why did he wait so long?
Besides, he had no interest in sending a warning note.
I don't know why he waited five years,
but wouldn't the warning e-mail be to announce his return?
In that case,
should we base our investigation on the motive of Nagoro's revenge?
Excuse me.
What?
We should cooperate with the Kyoto Police on this investigation.
Yes, we should.
How can we?
Commissioner!
While searching Sekin's smartphone
we found a strange e-mail he received just before the explosion.
Weird how?
The sender is unknown,

but there was a map of karuta attached.
Which card was it?
"This time I came empty-handed
In the mountain of offerings This carpet of colored leaves..."
That's one of Nagoro's cards!
What?
What is it, Heiji?
I have to check something.
Momiji is in danger!
Is that you, lori?
Is that Mr. Hattori?
Yes.
I need you to check if Momiji
if Momiji received an e-mail from an unknown sender.
E-mail?
What is it, Iori?
A call from Mr. Hattori.
Heiji?
Let me talk to him.
Is that Momiji? Can you check your e-mail quickly?
E-mail? Why on earth?
Anyway, I'm glad you called me!
What a strange e-mail.
There is only one picture.
Karuta cards?
Wow, how did you know?
Which poem is it? Can you read it?
"The wind of the storm blows on the mountains of Mimuro
And the purple leaves...
Momiji, listen to me!
Don't stay alone tonight!
Don't go home and come to the Osaka Police Station!
Understand?
Even if it's from you, I can't accept your request.
I have to get ready for the tournament tomorrow.
As if it's the right time!
You might be in danger!
I'm not in danger,
you are there for me, no?
You will protect me, won't you?
I haven't forgotten your promise.
My promise?
See you soon.
She hung up on me, that idiot!
I understand she got an e-mail too?
Yes.
Otaki, order Momiji Ooka's protection immediately.
Right away!
The only one who didn't get an e-mail was Mr. Yajima after all.
But at the crime scene..,
there must have been a message with the cards.
In short, our real killer, Nagoro, murdered Mr. Yajima,
then left behind one of his favorite cards,
but Sekine came after him and made up the crime scene even more.
I see.
Sekine saw the message left
and realized that Nagoro had done it,
but to protect his former master, he turned everything upside down
to make it look like a robbery.
Do you mean that Sekine arrived before the police?
Yes, that's very likely.
In fact, we had the crime scene photos analyzed.
Based on the blood spatter patterns on the cards,
we were able to reconstruct their position at the time of the murder.
Look at the screen.
The cards on the right were lying on the ground
so they were splattered.
On the left side, there are clean cards
and others that were slightly stained because they were added afterwards.
And then, from the angle of the marks
on the less stained cards,
we found out which card Mr. Yajima was holding.
The 32nd poem,
by Harumichi no Tsuraki!
"Yesterday's stormy wind
shook the maple branches.
See! A mass of leaves chokes the mountain stream.
So there was indeed a map of Nagoro there!
Look at this,
here are all the maps of the murders.
Starting from the top left, Nichiuri TV's,
Mr. Yajima's,
Mr. Sekine's,
and the one sent to Ms. Momiji.
These four poems are about red maple leaves.
So they are all Nagoro's favorite cards.
It seems pretty clear that the killer is this Shikao Nagoro.
I can't believe it.
Was it really Nagoro?
This is a bad sign.
The maple leaf cards he never lost in play
are six.
So what?
That means there are two left.
If Nagoro did use these cards
to announce his revenge,
I don't think he'll stop and leave two aside.
Won't Ooka be the last one?
It remains to be seen who his other two targets might be.
We have to hurry up.
It's going to be hard to stop Nagoro from doing any harm.
You amaze me!
I have a feeling you'll be able to stop Nagoro before the police do.
But for that, we need information.
Tell us what happened between you and Nagoro five years ago.
But what...
Something happened!
Don't try to deny it.
No, it's true.

I couldn't say it earlier, but to you I can confide.
Join me in my hotel room.
I'll tell you in detail what happened on that famous day.
Everyone wait for me here, okay?
I'm going to give this back to Momiji.
- OK, OK. - We'll wait for you.
Yes!
Miss, I got a call from the police.
They want to post an officer in front of your house.
I don't see why not.
Excuse me?
It's Momiji, right?
I'm Ran Mouri, I phoned.
That was you?
Thank you so much for coming on purpose.
It's okay.
Here you go.
Is this yours?
Thank you, thank you.
It's kind of my good luck charm.
I was worried about not having it for tomorrow's game,
I'm reassured.
But for you,
it must be like helping the enemy, right?
Not at all!
I hope this girl didn't ruin her nails from over-practicing.
I love your polish.
It's a special nail polish to protect your nails.
Nails are vital for playing karuta,
so I wear it all the time when I'm not practicing.
Oh, I see.
However, when I was trying to find out how to reach you,
I looked inside.
I saw a picture...
You mean this picture?
The boy in this picture...
It's Heiji.
I knew it!
It's from a karuta tournament in my childhood
in which Heiji beat me.
I was crying because I lost, and Heiji told me this...
Don't cry!
Next time we meet, I'll ask for your hand, be ready.
For real?
For real.
I promise.
Alright!
He really promised that!
That's why Heiji is my future husband.
Well, he was just a kid...
Age has nothing to do with it.
A man shouldn't go back on his words so easily,
don't you agree?
How can one read with certainty
the heart of the person you love?
Yes, it is true.
The rushing streams at the ford collide with the rocks
And divide but eventually reunite, I thought...
Our bodies may be far away,
but our hearts remain linked.
At least, I thought so.
You tell the little leaf...
The little leaf?
That I won't give anyone the cards I'm aiming for.
That's what my master taught me.
Momiji...
Ran!
Why are you in a fix?
You've been acting strange ever since you got back from visiting Osaka.
Sorry about that.
But how are you doing?
Well actually...
Heiji's mother told me that to win,
I have to choose my favorite card.
But I can't decide which one to pick.
It's not so difficult though.
Most of the Hundred Poems are about love.
If I were you, I would forget the game
and I would choose the poem that speaks to me the most.
A love poem...
For me, it would be...
this one.
So long to see it again
Murasaki Shikibu's?
The friend she finally found
finally leaves as quickly as he came.
He is the same, as soon as he arrived, he leaves again.
But there are many things I want to tell him!
Yes, I see. In that case...
For me, it would be...
My suffering at the end
Can be read on my face
I am asked, "Love?"
A poem about a love impossible to hide.
It looks great on you!
Even Momiji saw it right away.
Speaking of her, where does she get all this confidence from?
She talks like she's really his girlfriend.
Don't you think so?
I guess so.
I can't tell her
that Hattori proposed to her when they were kids.
What's that?
Nagoro came to fight Satsuki the day before their match?
He did?
Yes, I was out that day.
The article says he was scared to fight Satsuki and ran away,
but in truth the match took place the day before.
But why the day before?
You'd have to ask Nagoro directly.
But maybe
he wanted to beat her by playing with the cards of the Satsuki association.
That's what Satsuki thought.
Did they use these cards?
But the Satsuki association cards
are normally kept in a museum, right?

In those days, we weren't worried about them being stolen or anything,
so we kept them at home.
But they had to have a player, right?
See all those audio tapes?
In the old days, we used them to practice karuta.
So who won the game?
Satsuki, by a lot.
Nagoro apparently couldn't do anything.
On my way home that day,
I remember seeing Nagoro leaving with a pale face.
And I've never seen him since.
But why didn't you tell the police?
I don't want the story to leak to the press.
If it were to come out
that our heritage cards were used in a private match,
the other members of the association will be furious.
Yes, I can understand that, but...
It's not that I don't trust the police...
There's something that bothers me about this picture.
Is it because it's not Mr. Achiwa's actual car?
You must arrest Nagoro as soon as possible.
We will, don't worry.
Ran, two is not enough.
Can you add two more?
My brain needs sugar right now.
Okay.
Did she hear that noise?
Impressive.
Damn, this is not good.
I'm having trouble with cover or cross techniques,
and I don't have a good feel for the game.
If I don't improve,
that girl will steal Heiji from me!
Well then, Kazuha,
why are you making that face?
Heiji!
Did you have a fight with someone?
Shut up, you idiot!
You're that girl's bodyguard,
so go and join her!
You're not nice.
I came here on purpose to replace the old lady
and help you to train with karuta.
You never beat me, after all.
We haven't played since elementary school!
Now you wouldn't stand a chance.
Say, Hattori,
do you remember anything about that karuta tournament
you played in elementary school?
Or a little girl you beat?
Oh yes!
I remember, Kazuha! It was during that tournament.
The one where you crashed and won?
Yes!
I told you about that kid who was crying because she lost,
well, it was Momiji Ooka!
Oh really, was it her?
And so, do you remember?
Remember what?
Didn't you make a promise to her?
I must have told her something like "be brave for the next time".
Anyway, go back there.
You have to protect that girl, right?
- That's what the police are for. - Go, I said!
If she gets hurt before the game,
I can't face her.
Are you sure?
All right, then.
Mom.
I'm entrusting her to you.
My pain at the end
Can be read in my air
People ask me:
"Love?"
Master Nagoro.
Give me courage again this year.
Please watch over me,
Satsuki.
Kyoto
In Naniwa Bay Now the flowers are blooming
Achiwa Complex
But for the winter
Spring has arrived And now the flowers are blooming
Spring has come and now the flowers are blooming
On the mountains of Yoshino the wind
Kazuha got the card!
She is not dressed like the others so we can see her well.
Yes !
This is her aikido outfit!
There's nothing we can do about it,
he wanted to take Heiji somewhere.
I have an idea!
Let's send Conan the picture of Genta in front of the souvenir store!
The one where he is being scolded?
The cherry blossoms of Nara
The tournament has started.
Yes.
Well, with all those security guards,
Nagoro probably won't get in.
That's right.
And not only him.
Only personnel registered in advance
are allowed to enter.
Everything has been checked to perfection.
Nagoro won't make it.
Something wrong, Hattori?
No, it's nothing.
Who could it be?
Ah, a message from Mitsuhiko.
Nonsense, that Genta.
If he's holding turnip greens in his hands like that...
Of course!
So many wishes have been suspended
Enter the password
System disabled
Without surprise, Momiji has already won.
And Kazuha?
Not yet, it seems.
And here, look!
Yes, she won!
Great!
Congratulations, Kazuha!
And a match won.

She is playing very well so far.
Mr. Sekine, can you hear me?
Momiji Ooka Kazuha Toyama
Thank you very much.
So Ooka is going to play this girl in the final.
Where does this hidden talent come from?
Good job!
- Do you think she'll win? - Of course she will!
Well done, Kazuha!
Go on and win!
Does Kazuha realize
that if she wins against Momiji, she'll have to declare her feelings?
Kazuha gives it her all.
It's finally the final against Momiji.
Yes.
What?
Mr. Sekine has finally come to his senses?
So?
I see, it's just as we thought.
All right, I'll leave the Kyoto police in charge here and go home.
Sekine has woken up?
Yes,
and Heiji's deduction was correct, apparently.
But then, why did Sekine come to Yajima's house?
Lately, Yajima has been trying to find Nagoro.
Sekine realized this,
and he hoped to get a lead on his former master...
by keeping an eye on Yajima.
And that day, he noticed that something was wrong,
and so discovered the body?
I guess so.
I was thinking of going back to Osaka...
to find out more from Sekine.
We'll handle the situation here.
Thank you, sir.
Wait, I'll come with you!
That's it, it's over.
But what's the point of putting dynamite in a place like this?
- What is that smoke? - Is it fire?
No, the fire alarm would have gone off.
What if it was a bomb?
No, it wasn't!
There's a commotion outside.
What's in the forest on the west side?
Just an old shed.
What about the surveillance cameras?
That's outside the compound, there aren't any there.
What?
That smoke, do you think that's...
Let's check it out!
This is the Satsuki Room, that's where we're going.
I smell something funny.
We had the elevator inspected recently.
It's probably the smell of lubricating oil.
Does it bother you?
No, not especially.
My senses are all over the place, I think.
It's probably the nervousness.
How do you feel?
Of course, I didn't really think that I would make it this far,
so I'm kind of tense.
I guess you're okay.
I feel like my heart is going to come out of my chest.
I keep wondering
how Heiji will look after I say this.
That's all I can think about.
I can't lose.
I must win at any cost!
It's risky to come closer!
What's the matter?
Inspector!
- Was it an explosion? - Yes, it was.
There is a victim.
The body is in bad shape,
so we won't be able to identify him right away.
I see.
The question is when
and how the explosion occurred.
Actually, given the circumstances,
the victim may have been carrying the explosives.
What?
Nagoro blew himself up?
Ask for an autopsy quickly!
Yes, sir.
Yes, this is Ayanokoji.
What is it, Kudo?
Hattori, look at this.
What is it?
A ring?
Yes, probably the victim's.
Did you find anything?
Look at this ring, it must have flown in here.
It's pretty massive.
Yeah, that's unusual.
A big ring? Wait a minute...
Togo Kaieda!
Isn't Kaieda the former secretary of Mr. Achiwa?
Yes, and I'm sure of it:
this is the ring he wore on his thumb.
So he is the real culprit?
No.
If we had not found it,
we would surely have thought that the corpse over there was Nagoro.
Which means
that the explosion was staged to make people believe that Nagoro is dead.
Wait a minute,
if the culprit is trying to make us believe that now,
does that mean he already sent the two remaining cards?
There aren't two left.
I just got a call from Mr. Otaki.
Mr. Achiwa's secretary checked his e-mail again,
and saw that he received one of the cards this morning.
So there is only one card left?
Only one card left,
and we're in the finals...
I know!
A card was sent to Mr. Achiwa,
but there is still one card left.
Because the recipient of this last card

had not yet been designated!
Oh no...
Inspector, have Kazuha Toyama's cell phone checked!
Yes, sir.
But can you explain this to me?
The reason the last card wasn't sent right away,
...because we didn't know who would make it to the finals!
But then, the killer's targets
are the three in the Satsuki room!
Forgive me, both of you.
Both of you do your best
and show us a good match.
Thank you very much.
In Naniwa Bay
One, two... Cheer up!
Show them what you can do, Kazuha.
What's up?
Did you find an e-mail?
Yes, received 15 minutes ago,
with a favorite card from Nagoro.
So it was good for her...
- Stop the final immediately. - Damn it!
Got it?
- This way, Kudo! - Where are we going?
We'll go faster on the bike!
You want me to stop the finals?
Yes, sir.
I'll call the stadium.
What is it?
Probably an earthquake, but it doesn't sound very strong.
- What's the matter? - What's the matter?
Is it broken?
That's bad!
- A power failure? - No, the light works.
Oh no, it started!
Hold on tight!
Hattori, how will we get to the room?
Let me do it,
I have a plan.
Uh, don't tell me...
Under the empire of the gods
I wasn't dreaming!
The little leaf didn't move.
She decided to abandon my favorite cards?
Too long afflicted
But why are the flames so bright?
There seems to be a fuel.
Are the firemen coming soon?
The road is too narrow, they can't get through.
And the anti-fire system is out of order?
That's it.
We can't do anything...
Hattori, do you still think Nagoro is responsible?
No.
Kaieda had left the Satsuki association,
so a registered staff member had to give him the bomb.
It had to be that man!
President Kensuke Achiwa!
He's planning to kill himself by taking them with him!
I'll never let him do that!
She put it in the least accessible corner.
That means Momiji has realized
that this is my favorite card!
You want this card, right?
But I won't let you have it.
If I can protect it, I'll win.
I'll take it at any cost.
I must have it!
Quiet, be quiet!
I have to eliminate all unnecessary sounds!
Well then, Kazuha,
why are you making that face?
Did you have a fight with someone?
I'm sorry.
No, I don't have to argue with them.
Calm down!
The sound of the air conditioning,
the sleeves rubbing together,
the touching of cards,
my breathing,
and my heartbeat...
These are my allies!
I must accept them into myself.
Please excuse me.
I will capture the true sound!
The pine tree whispers "I am waiting" I will come back then
My...
Make it look like
look like Nagoro's revenge on the Satsuki Association
was a staged play written by Mr. Achiwa.
Five years ago, Nagoro was supposed to fight Satsuki,
but for some reason, he played the match the day before.
Mr. Achiwa said that Satsuki won,
but it doesn't add up.
Because of the article we read at the hotel.
Yes.
The article said that before each match of Satsuki's,
he washed his car to bring him luck.
In this picture, it was dirty!
If he didn't take care of it before such an important match,
it's because he knew that Nagoro wouldn't come!
The moon stayed in the sky in the daytime
I touched it first, I think.
No, I touched it first.
I think you know best
to know who it was.
There's only one card left, so it'll come down to fate.
If it was Nagoro who won the match five years ago,
it would be a good motive, right?
Yes, it would.
He wanted to protect Satsuki's honor
by silencing Nagoro.
But there was still one piece of evidence on the karuta cards
and Yajima found it and realized what he'd done!
But what kind of proof?
What if he had taken in his hands without thinking about it
the pile of cards stained with Nagoro's blood?
But yes, his fingerprints!
It was a certain photo that made me realize it.

There must be on these cards
Achiwa's fingerprints.
So Yajima
brought the cards from the Satsuki association to a TV studio,
to be filmed as evidence!
Yes.
That's why the explosion
and Yajima's murder took place at the same time.
That makes sense.
But why?
Why extend his crimes to the Achiwa complex and the finale?
Imagine that under the Satsuki Hall
is Nagoro's corpse.
It's true that it would be the ideal hiding place.
He had planned his whole crime from the beginning.
He had a perfect plan and found a scapegoat,
but it would be useless if Nagoro's body was found.
- I can see it! - I see it too.
An unknown destination
I don't know...
A ghost map!
The flames are already super high!
We have to hurry!
How do we get down there? And we have to put it out!
There's no time.
You, just think of a way to put out the fire.
Wait, you're not serious?
Hold on, Kudo!
Go for it!
What was that?
Go ahead, inflate!
Make sure I get there in time.
What, a fire?
Don't go out, stay inside!
Heiji!
What are you doing here?
- The waterfall's flowing stronger! - It's a miracle!
The fire is going out!
But what's happening, finally?
Looks like I made it in time.
Well done, Kudo.
Heiji, what happened here?
It's dangerous, I told you to stay inside.
Conan too?
Why are you both here?
That..,
you can ask Mr Achiwa directly.
What are you talking about?
Stay behind me, both of you.
Why do we have to do that?
Hey, Mr. Achiwa,
it wouldn't be good for you if we inspected those cards, would it?
Well, Heiji, when are you going to explain?
I'm going to ask this guy
if we got this case right.
It all started
when Momiji won the tournament here last year.
The pile of cards Momiji took
was very similar to the pile of cards taken by Nagoro
during one of his games.
It is true that I play offensively like my master
and I have the same favorite cards, but...
it would still be an incredible coincidence.
Nevertheless, the incredible happened.
And Mr. Yajima then noticed that five years ago
black spots had appeared on the edges of the association's cards.
What are these black spots?
The fingerprints of the person who touched them
while he had Mr. Nagoro's blood on his hands.
Mr. Nagoro's blood ?
We thought he disappeared five years ago,
but in truth he was killed.
No way!
So these are the fingerprints
of Mr. Nagoro's murderer!
I admit defeat, I'll confess everything.
In exchange,
will you give up presenting these cards as evidence ?
The association wants to...
Ah, I understand better.
There was something I didn't understand,
but now I understand.
The truth is that these are not your fingerprints, are they?
Yes, they are mine, I assure you!
That's right,
you and Kaieda are responsible for the recent incidents.
But the murder of Mr. Nagoro that caused it all,
it wasn't you!
It was Satsuki, wasn't it?
When I saw her, I immediately understood.
Nagoro had come to fight him and Satsuki had lost.
They had used one of the tapes from my collection to play.
Do you understand what that means?
Satsuki had listened to that tape many times.
Of course, all the tapes were different,
but she had, to some degree, memorized the order of the cards read.
She had everything on her side to win!
And yet, Satsuki lost.
Nagoro was infinitely more talented than we thought.
I can't imagine the terror she must have felt.
He was sure that she would suffer a humiliating defeat the next day.
It was this fear that drove her to commit the irreparable.
After that day, Satsuki had lost all spark of life.

She ceased to be involved in the association
and two years later, the disease took her away.
This is the truth.
I hope you will understand me.
Stop it!
Don't do that!
It's all Nagoro's fault.
If he hadn't deliberately tried to humiliate her
none of this...
He wasn't trying to humiliate her!
That's certainly why he had gone there the day before.
One day, I had asked him
why he hated the Satsuki Association so much.
Do you think I hate it?
I guess that's the impression I give.
But if I don't provoke her, I won't be able to play against her.
But I only want her to congratulate me when I win.
She is my first love, after all.
Her first love?
Absolutely.
It was even out of admiration for her that he took up karuta.
But because of an eye disease,
he wouldn't have been able to play one year later.
I think that's why
that's why he played so fiercely.
He didn't have much time left.
So he wanted to show him what he could do the day before,
and then hand over the victory the next day in public?
Since he couldn't take care of me
and his other disciples,
he wanted to create a reason for us to join your association.
But Satsuki didn't know anything about it,
and she killed Nagoro...
No !
That can't be!
What did I do?
What's going on?
Kazuha!
Kazuha!
Are you OK?
Yes.
But I can't get up!
Quick, get in the elevator!
Momiji, go!
Alright, alright!
Hurry, get up!
Leave me here, go away.
No way!
I won't let you die here!
Momiji!
Get in quickly!
Kazuha!
Climb up here!
Hurry! Hurry!
Come on, you're almost there!
I got you.
Got what?
Please,
hold on a little longer!
Goddamn it!
What? No way!
No, no way!
Are you all right?
We'll be right there!
That was close.
Hattori?
It's collapsing, we've got to go back!
What's going on?
Don't go!
Wait, don't leave us!
Heiji!
Kazuha, climb up!
Come here, slowly.
Hattori, Kazuha...
Let them get away!
Heiji, look!
Yeah, sure.
What's wrong?
Hold on tight, now.
Don't tell me you're going to jump to the other side!
Yes, you've got it all figured out.
Tell me you're joking!
You're not well, it's really far!
Are you listening, Heiji?
It would be less risky to dive into the water.
No way!
Diving from that height,
the surface of the water would be as hard as a rock.
Above all, hold on tight!
If you let go of me...
I will kill you.
I understand!
No way I'm going to die
in a place like this!
This is...
Hattori!
I have one more thing to say!
That bike...
Come on!
Are you okay, Kazuha?
I'm done with dramatic escapes.
They're unbelievable.
I really thought we were going to stay there.
But say, Heiji,
what's the thing you have to tell me?
What, what are you talking about?
What you said,
you can't die without telling me what?
- You imagined it, didn't you? - Oh no!
My ears are very sharp from my karuta training.
If you have something to tell me, say it!
What did you want to tell me?
What did you want to tell me?
Well, what I have to tell you is, uh...
Your image is superimposed on this couple embracing
My thoughts fly in the colorless wind
I can still feel the warmth of your hand
Stop, make time stop
The days may go by
I will never forget your words
I want to see you again, but in vain
I want to see you again, but in vain
It saddens me so much
On the Togetsukyo bridge tinted with scarlet
I hope to be guided to you
I address this prayer to the flow of the river
I thought of you
I thought of you
My heart never leaves you
This ancient landscape still unchanged
Is now reflected in your eyes
And takes on colors beyond the seasons
Stock, have you kept this in mind?
When will the day finally come
When we can meet again?
I want to see you again, but in vain

I want to see you again, but in vain
My heart burns for you
When the waters turn scarlet
Will our thoughts meet?
I address this prayer to the river's flow
I've been thinking of you
I've been thinking of you
I will never stop looking for you
With you all my fears
Always disappear
When can I finally
Feel your tender embrace?
Even the scarlet maple leaves
Announce the color of my burning feelings
They sing with me as they twirl
I've been thinking of you
I've been thinking of you
You never leave my thoughts
You never leave my thoughts
Thank you for walking us home.
It's my turn to thank you.
By the way, what about the karuta club?
Well, actually,
our school recognized that I made it to the finals,
and we get to keep the club.
Even though I lost the match at the end.
Kazuha.
Come here for a second.
What's up?
Where are they going?
What, are they keeping secrets?
- Are they? - But yeah, after all...
I was able to take "My suffering at the end".
It's still your favorite card, after all.
Yes, but not just for the poem!
It's the name of the person who wrote it.
Taira no Kanemori.
His name starts with the same Chinese character as Heiji.
To me, it had become the card of Heiji!
I thought of sending a picture of the card to Heiji afterwards,
saying, "This is how I feel."
Are you planning to declare your love to her by sending her the card?
Isn't that cheating?
Momiji.
Did you hear us whispering?
You're not the only one with good hearing.
Oh, it's Momiji.
What are you doing here?
As we agreed, I came to tell you my feelings.
Even though I've already known yours for a long time.
What are you talking about?
This picture is the proof.
They are holding hands.
They made a promise to each other, then.
They say if you break it, you have to swallow a thousand needles.
Wait a minute, what was the promise?
"Next time I'll ask for your hand, be ready!"
He erased that embarrassing memory from his mind.
Or are you going to
pretend none of this ever happened?
Ah, but I remember!
I had said that:
"Don't cry, we can have another game.
But next time, I'll ask that your hand be ready,
so practice to strengthen it."
I would...
ask...
have your hand ready?
She was a little girl, I was afraid to hurt her hand,
so I had to take it easy.
Iori,
let's go!
Right away, miss.
Well, I'll let you off the hook this time,
but I won't give anyone the cards I'm after.
Don't forget that, will you?
Kazuha.
What, she wants to play karuta with Kazuha again?
Sorry, were you asleep?
You, Sonoko, know the Hundred Poems well, don't you?
Yes, we play as a family on New Year's Eve.
I sent Shinichi a picture of my favorite karuta card,
and he replied with "Rushing streams at the ford",
but I forgot the meaning of this poem.
Even though my sweet love and I are separated,
- we will meet again. - Hello?
- A beautiful love poem. - Sonoko, are you still there? Hello!
You're selling me a dream!
Huh? Sonoko?
She had to forget.
