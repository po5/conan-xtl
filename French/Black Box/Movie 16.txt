Dad, it's ringing!
I know, I'm not deaf.
Mouri Detective Agency.
Are you Kogoro Mouri?
Yes. Who am I speaking to?
I planted a bomb somewhere.
What bomb? A bomb?
It will explode at 3:30.
If you want to stop it, then solve this riddle.
Is this a joke?
I'm warning you, I'll tell the police!
What's so funny?
Look out the window.
Through the window?
What am I supposed to see ?
- Oh, no, you don't! - No way!
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE ELEVENTH ATTACKER
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug,
and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name...
I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
In order to find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
He's taking a long time, the teacher...
He probably misplaced his license again.
For a change...
If we don't leave soon, we won't get Hide's autograph!
Just when we were lucky enough to win the lottery!
It's not every day you get to meet a J-League player!
This is Ayumi, Genta and Mitsuhiko.
They are my new classmates.
They have recently started to get into the J-League.
Here it is at last!
Sorry kids, I couldn't find my license.
I knew it!
It's always the same!
This is professor Hiroshi Agasa.
And this is Ai Haibara.
They are among the few people who know who I am.
What are you mumbling in your corner?
Come on, Sports Land is waiting for us!
If you hang around, we'll go without you!
Ah, here I come!
Aren't you forgetting something?
Your favorite line, let's see.
Oh yeah, damn.
My body is younger, but not my mind!
I'll solve all the mysteries!
There is only one truth!
Sports Land Beika
It's finally time for kick-off
J-League Football Class - 16th edition
The 16th J-League Football Class, sponsored by Nichiuri TV.
J-League players!
Here are Endo and Konno!
- There is Narasaki! - And Nakamura next to him!
Well, shall we start too?
Yes !
Ah, you, number 10!
What's wrong, Conan?
He told me to take a break.
They're going to play with four people to start with.
Excuse me, are you Kogoro Mouri?
Shinzo Yamamori (age 51) Sports director of Nichiuri TV
I am the sports director of Nichiuri TV,
my name is Yamamori.
Yes, that's me.
Oh my, what a pleasure to meet the famous detective Mouri!
Koda, take our picture!
Kaoru Koda (27) Nichiuri Sports Photographer
It's working. Are you ready?
Thank you!
This is Kaoru Koda, photographer for Nichiuri newspaper.
She was in the news before,
but just transferred to the sports section.
You don't have to tell my life story, Mr. Yamamori!
But if you get a good scoop here,
they'll send you back to the news, right?
Uh... yes.
Well, I wish you success.
Worry about yourself!
If the ratings on your soccer show don't go up,
you'll lose your job as director.
Yeah, that's right...
Do you have any ideas on how to help me, Mr. Mouri?
- You're asking him? - Well, I...
Oh, yes, I do!
- You do? - Yes, I do!
Invite me and Yoko to your set!
The ratings will go up, for sure!
Yoko, huh?
She's booked until December...
- Hey, look! - for her concert in Shiodome.
The little ones seem to have made a lot of progress already!
Oh, yes!
And in a short time!

- It's crazy! - I'm not surprised.
You improve quickly under the teaching of a pro.
By the way, you're not too interested in soccer, are you?
What's up? Yes, I do!
I watch the games on TV with Conan.
But you've never played.
No, that's true.
Except once, in junior high,
when I sent the ball back to Shinichi...
But in fact...
...that day, he had...
What are you talking about, Ran?
Nothing, forget it.
Oh? That man...
Yes, that's him!
That's Kazumasa Nakaoka, the genius center forward!
Kazumasa Nakaoka (21) Temporary motorcycle salesman
"The genius forward"?
Yes.
Three years ago,
he led Haido High School to a national victory.
He was supposed to join the Spirits
and had a bright future,
but a month after the finals, he got into a motorcycle accident
and has been out of the soccer world ever since.
But if he is here today...
Yes.
He probably hasn't lost his passion for soccer.
Well, you've made good progress!
- Let's change groups! - All right! All right!
Your turn, number 10!
Go for it Conan, he's calling your name.
Yes !
Finally to me, it's about time!
Not bad, kid!
Hello, Mr. Mouri!
Ryosuke Sakaki (32) Educator in a sports club
My name is Ryosuke Sakaki.
- I went to college in Beika... - Ah!
You're Sakaki the autogoal!
- "Autogoal"? - Yes!
He scored an own goal in the League Cup final.
Because of that, Beika College
gave up what could have been their first win in 5 years.
So you know about that...
A little bit, yes!
I watched the game from the stands!
How many years ago was that again?
Ten years now.
That mistake scarred me for life.
I still dream about it sometimes at night.
Daddy! Daddy!
You don't have to bring up that old story!
No, it's true...
What are you up to?
I am a sports educator in a club,
as well as a coach for a young team.
Oh, but that's good!
Anyway, there's someone I want to introduce you to.
He is one of your biggest fans.
Do you have some time?
Uh, yeah.
Thank you, thank you, thank you! This will be very quick!
I'll get it!
Well...
I lost, I surrender.
Too good!
I knew deep down he was just a kid with a soccer bug.
- You did great, Conan! - Thank you, man.
Hey!
Wow, the pretty boy!
All right! It's Higo, in the flesh!
Shinichi Kudo...
Do you know him?
Uh, well...
You mean Shinichi?
You know him?
Yes.
I went to one of his games
and we exchanged a few words.
You look like him, I think.
You have the same way of shooting.
It must be because he taught me to play soccer.
I see!
That's what I thought.
Keep practicing hard.
I will!
Lucky you!
Higo patted him on the head!
- I'm so jealous! - Yes!
You should never wash your head again!
Yeah, maybe...
Hey, stop it!
Wash up.
- I want to touch, too! - Yeah!
Your hair is all messed up, Conan!
But stop, oh!
Here I am again, Mr. Mouri.
Can we bother you?
Of course you can.
Let me introduce you.
In addition to being the owner of a factory in Haido,
he's the head of our sponsorship team:
Mr. Keiichiro Motoura.
Keiichiro Motoura (43) Factory owner
Hello, I am Motoura.
It's an honor to be here.
Thank you, I'm flattered.
Mr. Motoura is a fan of your work.
When I told him you were here, he insisted on meeting you.
He did?
I really wanted to show you these pictures.
To me?
Yes.
Here, please.
Uh, okay.
- We want to look, too! - Let me see!
No, but I swear...
Hmm? This man...
Conan, come and look too!
I'm coming!
What's this about?
That's my son, Tomofumi.
- Look at the other pictures. - Yeah, right.
He looks like he's having fun.
Did you come here with him?
No...
Actually, Tomofumi

unfortunately passed away from an illness last August.
He was in fourth grade.
I'm sorry.
Tomofumi was fragile since his birth.
Doctors had forbidden any intense activity.
But then, these pictures...
He was desperate to play soccer,
so I insisted Mr. Sakaki let him join his team.
These are photos from the one game where the coach allowed him to play
and he scored a goal.
This is the picture where he scores his goal.
Classy!
- He looked good at soccer. - Yes!
I got to the end.
But why did you want to show me these pictures?
Oh...
I just wanted you to see these pictures that prove he lived.
But it looks like I spoiled the mood. Please forgive me.
To all J-League players: for the rest of the program...
I'm feeling a little solemn.
- The same. - "Sole à nelle"?
I know! To take your mind off things...
- Oh, no, no, no... - Don't tell me...
here we go with one of my famous quizzes!
What do you say?
Let's go, all together!
They say soccer players have a hard time keeping
their car door open
because of a certain soccer term.
Of these four suggestions, what is that term?
Answer 1: "Offside".
Answer 2: "Hand".
Answer 3: "Corner".
Answer 4: "Yellow card".
So, is it too hard for you?
Did you find it, Conan?
- Yes, that's the answer... - two!
That's the "hand" of "hold", I think.
If their door closes,
it means they're having trouble holding it shut.
"Hand-hold"...
and "hold in the hand".
Good answer!
Wow! Way to go, Endo!
You're not only a great player, you're also a great thinker!
Hi there.
- Sorry I'm late. - Takahiro!
- It's about time! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- I didn't wake up... - Who is he?
That's Sanada.
He was in the Youth League before
and has been Higo's replacement since this year.
You think you can do anything, skipping the first half?
I just don't like kids...
Hey, you brats!
I'm not a "substitute",
Takahiro Sanada (18) J-League player of Big Osaka
but a "super substitute", got it?
That's enough, Sanada!
Hide.
I chose you as my rival, you know?
So let's see who's better in the next match.
You still have to play.
Oh, I'm counting on it.
A declaration of war... Interesting!
I like it!
We'll be broadcasting the game between the Spirits and the Bigs,
so we'll be building tension on our side
I wish you both success!
Hey! Don't look!
- Come on, just a little - No, later!
Don't be a cheapskate!
- You'll see it when it's ready! - "K. K." ?
- What's this? - Hide, aren't you leaving early?
Oh yes, damn it!
Sorry, Sanada.
We'll settle the score during the game at Tohto Stadium!
Hide is a class act when he runs too!
Me, running is my weakness.
Ditto.
- You'll never make it to the J-League. - You shouldn't say that.
There are lots of slow runners among the J-League players.
Is that true?
If you're a slow runner,
start running before the others.
But for that,
you have to be able to read the game
and make quick decisions.
Right. Basically, more than just being able to move fast,
you have to be able to think fast.
A lot of people make up for their lack of speed
by developing this ability.
What others see as a flaw,
if you find your own way to exploit it,
it can very well become your strength!
That's for sure...
Said by professionals, it's even more meaningful!
But no!
Is there anything else you want to ask us?
-Me! -Yes?
- Teach us how to take a free kick! - No, but oh!
Don't be so arrogant, microbe!
But no, we don't mind!
We've got a little time on our hands.
Do you want us to try?
- Seriously? - Yes!
You have to hit the ball from the front
and instead of just kicking it, lift it slightly in the air.
Goal!

Endo scores with an impeccable free kick! Tohto Stadium
Gamba Osaka is leading with 4 minutes left in the first half!
Too good! That's the shot he taught us!
Hey, Conan...
What team are you with?
If you're a true Tokyoite, don't cheer for Osaka!
I know, I know.
Here, put this on,
and cheer for the Spirits, too.
- But what about you? - Don't worry, I bought a new one.
Big Osaka?
- I'm not surprised. - Don't get me wrong.
I like the color, that's all.
Sure, if you say so!
- No, I don't. - No, you don't!
Well, let's move on...
I'll give you the riddle.
What is it?
A blue boy and a blue zebra.
Rain above.
Below, someone is pointing with his left hand, as it were, to a tree on the left.
Wait!
Someone is... what?
Points with his left hand, as it were, to a tree on the left.
- "Point with the left finger, as it were..." - Not finger, hand!
The hand, as in "hold"!
"Point with left hand, as it were, a tree to the left."
Good.
Let the game begin.
Rot!
If you lose the game,
there will be many victims.
What is your goal?
What do you want?
You will know soon.
I wish you success.
Wait, that's not enough!
A hint! Give me a hint!
Next stop: Beika.
Next: Beika.
Wait! Hello? Hello?
Dad...
Damn it... He hung up.
"A blue boy and a blue zebra.
"Rain above.
"Below, someone points with their left hand,
as it were, a tree on the left."
And the clue is:
"Next stop: Beika. Next: Beika."
No matter how much I read and reread, it doesn't make sense...
Inspector Megure ! We know more about the bomb.
It was a plastic explosive,
and the trigger was a telephone.
I see.
It's lucky that no one was hurt.
But will it be the same with the next explosion?
There's an hour and five minutes to go before the time runs out.
We have to solve the puzzle before then.
I know!
I've got it!
The next bomb is at Haido Park!
Haido Park?
It's all in the clue: "Next stop: Beika. Next: Beika."
Explain, Mouri.
This is the station before the Beika stop on the Kanjo line.
So there are two possibilities: Haido and Midoridai stations.
And in the Haido park, a few steps from the station
there is a big fountain.
- A fountain? - That would be "rain above"?
Yes.
At the bottom of the fountain there is a statue of a child and a zebra.
And for the rest of the message?
We'll understand on the spot.
- He did it! - What a beautiful counter!
Come on!
Too hard!
Over here!
Watch out!
Make way, please!
Excuse me, move over!
There!
- Indeed, there are statues. - Yes, but...
It's not a zebra, but rather a donkey, right?
The culprit confused, that's all!
They are not blue.
For him, they are!
- You will see! - Mr. Mouri, what...
I'm going to find that bomb!
Daddy! Daddy!
All right, let's close the park right now.
Evacuate all visitors!
Got it!
"A blue boy and a blue zebra.
"Rain above.
"Below, someone points with his left hand, as it were, to the tree on the left."
That's it!
The bomb is buried under the tree on the left!
Under the tree?
Okay, we'll take care of the rest.
You two, go quickly!
All right! All right!
The Spirits are one goal behind.
Uemura is closing in from the left!
The ball goes to the center! A nice lateral pass!
Akagi jumps, and it's a goal!
Goal! Goal!
The Spirits score thanks to a combo from Akagi and Uemura!
- Hooray! - Well done, you two!
The Hide and Naoki duo is always on top!
The bomb wasn't there?
Nothing under the left tree, I'm afraid.
What about under the other one? The tree on the right?
We dug there too, just in case,
but there is no trace of a bomb.
We will check the other trees anyway,
but maybe...
the coded message pointed to a completely different place.
It can't be!
Look at all the people!

The stores are packed during the half-time.
We've got to get a move on before the game starts again!
A call from Ran?
I'm going to the bathroom, I'll be right back!
Answer it, Shinichi, please...
Hello, this is Kudo.
I can't answer right now.
- Leave a message after the beep. - Why does he never answer?
Shinichi, we received bomb threats at Dad's agency!
But the riddle is too hard and there's no time!
Ran, I'm here!
Shinichi!
Tell me the riddle.
- Okay, listen carefully! - I'm here.
So the clue is "Next stop: Beika, next: Beika"...
He said the bomb would go off at 3:30.
We have only 40 minutes left, Shinichi!
Understand, give me some time!
"A blue boy and a blue zebra."
"Rain above."
"Below, someone is pointing with his left hand at the tree on the left."
That sounds vaguely familiar... But what?
Gee, I can't remember!
Kids, do you know
the Spirits and Gamba mascots?
Yes, the Spirits' is Zebra!
It's a zebra that's too good to shoot!
What about the Gamba mascot?
I know! He's blue!
His name is Gamba Boy!
Good for you. You know a lot!
His name means "the boy who makes efforts"...
A zebra? Gamba Boy?
Yes!
That's it!
The blue boy and the blue zebra,
they're the mascots of Gamba and Spirits!
It was right under my nose, why didn't I understand it before?
Don't tell me...
that the bomb is hidden somewhere in the stadium?
Just a second.
There was a clue too.
Yes, there was!
I got it.
"Rain above" is the key to the rain.
"Someone below" is the key to the man.
The key to the hand for the "left hand".
Then the Chinese character for "pointing", as it is,
and finally the key to the tree.
By forming characters with these four parts
and combining them...
it gives "digital panel"!
This is confirmed
by the clue: "Next stop: Beika, next: Beika."
This was referring to the digital signage in the subway!
No doubt, the bomb is well and truly hidden
near the scoreboard of the Tohto stadium !
It sucks to death, I have to go and check it quickly!
What's taking him so long, Conan?
Yes...
Do you think he got lost?
Professor!
Quick, lend me your car keys!
Conan!
- Where have you been? - The game is about to start again!
I don't have time, hurry!
Here you go.
Here's the second half commitment!
The Spirits had equalized during the first half.
They keep the same team composition.
Will they continue their offensive in this half?
No change for Gamba either!
Damn... I need a place to climb!
Found it!
Here we go!
There's a kid up there!
Come on, get him!
That was close...
Rafinha is up against Kihara!
Rafinha loses the ball, which is caught by Endo!
Takei makes a lateral pass!
They collide near the goal!
Damn, I can't find it.
If she's not there...
Endo aggressively attacks Akagi off the dribble!
Akagi sends the ball back from Kihara to Shimura!
They clash!
Nice one-two! Akagi dribbles!
He dashes past the defenders...
and kicks the ball into the air!
Right?
No...
It's Kudo!
Damn it!
What is it?
The Spirits are challenging the referee's decision.
That's a penalty!
They're the ones who went after him!
Totally!
Haibara?
Well, the ball is in place.
No surprise, the shooter is Yasuhito Endo!
He's in! 2 à 1 !
Gamba is back on top!
Good timing, Haibara.
What are you doing up there, Kudo?
Are you alone now?
Yes, you can talk.
A bomb?
Yes.
I haven't found it yet,
but there's a good chance that it's
near one of the scoreboards.
Excuse me, I'll call you back.
Wait, Kudo!
Kudo?
There are bombs.
And they're aimed at the pillar that supports the sign...

One minute.
That means...
that the culprit is trying to bring him down!
Hello? Is that you, Kudo?
Shinichi?
Hm. Yes.
What is it?
The bomb is on the digital sign at Tohto Stadium?
At Tohto stadium?
On the digital sign?
Yes.
You must get the Spirits' fans out of there as soon as possible!
Yes, sir!
These bombs are not difficult to disarm
but I don't have enough time!
What should I do?
Think about it. There must be a way.
Come on, damn it!
If I can't defuse them all...
Hey, you hung up on me!
I'm sorry, but I need you to listen to me right now.
There are bombs.
Whoever did this wants to drop
the digital sign on the bleachers on the Spirits' side at 3:30!
Oh no!
There's only 30 minutes left!
Yes... They'll be clearing the stands soon.
Can you watch the kids so they don't try anything?
Yes, I can.
And what are you going to do?
I'm going to try to stop the sign from falling down!
The Spirits go on the offensive again.
Shimura comes to the center...
They're fighting each other!
Itawa's volleyed pass! Uemura catches it!
He hits the bar!
Akagi goes for it again and scores!
- That's his second goal of the game! - Yeah!
It's an equalizer!
They did it, Mitsuhiko!
Genta, you're hurting me.
Oh? Something's going on.
- What? - Here, look!
Oh? What's going on?
A staff member is talking to the referee...
Is there a problem?
In the middle of the match?
Ah! Haibara!
Did you see Hide's great dive?
- Ai? - What's wrong with you?
Your attention please. We have an emergency.
What's the matter?
Is Shinichi involved in this?
There are bombs.
According to Kudo, they are behind the scoreboard.
What are you saying?
I repeat:
The fans on the Spirits' side
are asked to follow the guides quickly
- and come to the field. - That sounds serious...
It's not reassuring, anyway.
Are we going to investigate?
No way.
Stay here quietly until Edogawa comes back.
Let's let him take care of it.
I just hope he comes back unharmed...
There you go.
It's no good, it's taking me too long.
I have to at least prevent this pillar from being destroyed!
There's only ten minutes left!
I don't know if I can do it!
Everyone from this seat, this way!
Don't rush!
Step forward in line one at a time, please.
Move to the center of the field in an orderly and calm manner.
Don't rush!
Step forward in line...
What's going on?
I have no idea, but it looks pretty bad.
Please move to the center of the field right away, you too.
We can't go any faster, our equipment is heavy!
It's dangerous, leave your stuff here!
What's that?
Are you making fun of us?
We won't leave our equipment here!
What's going on, first of all?
Uh... Ah, wait!
Come back here!
Put this on the Internet, and let's blow it up!
Come on, I take full responsibility.
You do what I tell you, and that's it! Got it?
That's good!
Evacuation of areas D3 to D4 is complete.
- Zone E, check! - Area F, check!
- Area G, evacuated!
Hurry up!
- Move to the back! - Faster!
Move forward, please!
Don't stop, keep going!
Hold your children's hands!
Only 35 seconds left!
There's only one more, but I don't have time!
Please, make it stick!
Oh, man!
Kudo!
Oh, yeah!
I'm going to have one hell of a hearing!
Man, look at that!
The digital sign exploded!
I did it!
I finally got my story!
Stay calm!
Don't panic!
Back away in no hurry!
Stay calm!
Don't push, everything's fine!
The explosion is over!
To evacuate safely,
move in an orderly fashion towards the emergency exits
and calmly follow the instructions of the staff.
Is it over?

Come on... Hold on!
No... It will collapse!
Save yourself!
- What's going on? - Is it still going on?
An earthquake?
It's all right, stay calm!
- Hey, what's that? - It's coming down on us!
What is that?
The digital board!
That's a bad sign, they've got to run!
Impossible, the panic is paralyzing them!
Bad luck, we're too late!
Shinichi!
Hey, it stopped!
Unbelievable, it's a miracle!
Come on, just hold on a little longer!
Come on!
Live News - Miyane-ya
Hello to all.
Seiji Miyane
Hiromi Kawada
It is Monday, November 21, and you are watching Miyane-ya.
Yesterday, a disaster occurred during the J-League.
An explosion that was one step away from tragedy
happened in the middle of the match.
Let's see it in pictures.
The fans were targeted!       What happened during the match Gamba VS Spirits?!
During the match between Tokyo Spirits and Gamba Osaka
the explosion of a digital sign
caused the whole stadium to shake.
A hatred towards the J-League?       The match ended in a 2-2 tie
Fortunately, there were no casualties. 
But the detective Kogoro Mouri being linked to this incident,
Why this riddle?       A challenge to Detective Mouri?!
His agency is in the grip of the media.
Your turn, Ms. Tabeta!
Miyuki Tabeta
This is Tabeta. I'm in front of Detective Mouri's agency.
By solving the riddle given by the culprit,
Mr. Mouri saved the J-League.
The culprit had previously caused a car to explode
- right in front of the agency... - Hello, detective!
Thank you for coming all the way here.
Every time I step outside,
the media is all over me...
Everyone is convinced that you are the one who solved the mystery.
Kudo asked me not to mention his name again, so...
Don't just stand there, sit down, please.
- Yes, thank you. - OK, then.
- The kid! - By the way, Mouri...
I understand that you have discovered something?
To tell the truth, it's not me,
but the kid...
Oh, it's Conan?
He's been pestering me and Ran..,
About the phone call from the guy who did it.
That's because I wanted to tell Shinichi!
He seemed to really want to know.
So what did you find out?
It was something the culprit said to Uncle.
Not with his finger, with his hand!
The hand, as in "maintain"!
I'd heard that same phrase before.
Did you figure it out, Conan?
- Yes, that's the answer... - two!
It's the "hand" in "maintain".
It's true that it's peculiar!
It's not usually the first word that comes to mind.
Yeah, right?
The culprit was annoyed that uncle misunderstood
and it must have slipped out.
He repeated what he had just heard.
If that's the case, he made a mistake.
Yes !
And how many people could have heard Endo say that?
Not counting the J-League players and ourselves,
there were four of them.
Shinzo Yamamori,
Kaoru Koda,
Ryosuke Sakaki,
and Keiichiro Motoura.
These four
are the main suspects in my investigation!
Someone is missing.
There was someone else on a nearby bench.
It was Kazumasa Nakaoka.
Kazumasa Nakaoka?
The one from the snowy stadium?
- Do you know who that is, Takagi? - Yes, I do.
I went to his game with my nephew three years ago.
The game was supposed to start at 2:05pm but was delayed because of the snow.
I think it started at 3:40 in the end.
The game ended in a draw and went into overtime.
Then on a penalty kick with only 4 minutes to go,
Nakaoka scored the decisive goal.
The match lasted until 17:50!
With this Nakaoka, we arrive at five suspects.
There is always a possibility that it is just a coincidence,
but if the motive for the crime was to defy me,
the only people who have made an impression on me recently
are those people in the soccer class.
All right.
Let's find out about these five people right away.

We investigated the five people
Conan named.
- Shiratori. - Yes.
Let's start with Mr. Yamamori.
Thanks to the explosion,
his show's ratings went up
and he was able to keep his job as the director.
So the incident was good for him.
Then, Mrs. Koda.
She too, thanks to her photos of the drama,
she got closer to the position she wants to regain.
So, she also found her account there.
Then, Mr. Sakaki.
We haven't found anything that connects him to the stadium explosion.
But..,
if we assume that the perpetrator was targeting Mr. Mouri...
I understand that Mr. Mouri had given him a hard time
about the own goal at the university.
You're the one who did it, Sakaki!
I didn't mean it in a bad way.
And then he laughed about it, you know!
Maybe on the surface, but inside...
It's common to hide what you feel.
Let's move on to Mr. Motoura.
His only son, Tomofumi,
was watching the J-League All-Star game on TV
All-Star game at Tohto Stadium, when he suffered...
a cardiac arrest.
An ambulance took him to Tohto Hospital,
but he died despite the doctors' efforts.
Tohto Stadium...
and an ambulance?
What is it, Mouri?
I'm familiar with it...
Does it?
Or not...
It's vague, I'm not sure.
Well, it's probably nothing!
Don't act like that if you're not sure...
Finally, Mr. Nakaoka.
Three years ago, in February,
he had a motorcycle accident and had to be operated on.
He did 6 months of rehabilitation,
but his left leg was still damaged
and the Spirits cancelled his contract.
Was he supposed to join them?
Yes.
He stopped playing soccer and went to South America.
He came back to Japan last August,
returned to his home in Gunma,
and has been leading a disreputable life there ever since.
driving his motorcycle like a lunatic.
In short,
Mr. Yamamori and Ms. Koda
both had a motive for the explosion at the stadium
and could have easily planted the bombs,
but that seems a bit too extreme.
And the same for Mr. Sakaki, hard to believe that a simple bullying
on the own goal would have made him hate Mr. Mouri so much.
I wasn't making fun, I tell you!
And I'm wondering,
is that Mr. Motoura's son had a heart attack
happened just after
after he saw the game on TV at the stadium.
Yes.
I agree with you on that.
But it would be a bit of a stretch to blame the J-League for that.
It's not directly related to the death of his son.
That's true.
The problem is this Mr. Nakaoka.
According to Inspector Yamamura of the Gunma Police...
He was really driving like a maniac!
What can I say? He was...
like a wild wolf looking for a place to die.
Well, that's it!
He is the one responsible for the accident
that prevented him from joining the J-League.
But it's still very likely that he blames the Spirits
for withdrawing their offer after that.
For this reason,
we will focus on Kazumasa Nakaoka.
Police! Stop right there!
It's over, right?
Why are you following me around?
That wasn't our intention.
Yeah, right!
You were already outside the store this afternoon!
What are you accusing me of?
Come on, calm down.
We have to eliminate all possible suspects.
Don't fuck with me, you chicken!
I'll show you!
Kazumasa Nakaoka!
You're under arrest for attempted assault and obstruction
justice!
Huh? Did you arrest Mr. Nakaoka?
Uh, yes.
While we were following him last night,
he got mad and tried to hit me.
We talked to him again this morning in private, and...
We don't think he has any particular grudge against the Spirits.
What's wrong with the Spirits?
What do you mean, what?
Well, when we brought it up with him...
Then you're way off base.
I don't blame the Spirits at all,
in fact, it's the opposite.
Stop lying!
Explain yourself.
The media doesn't know everything.
The Spirits did not close their door to me.

I was the one who asked them
to withdraw their offer.
After my motorcycle accident,
the Spirits paid for my surgery and rehab.
And when I was told that my left leg was gone,
they still offered me a contract.
I could have been an asset to them,
even if I only played 15 minutes a game.
But then... why?
Out of pride, of course!
Someone who can't last 90 minutes on the field
doesn't deserve...
to play soccer!
Let alone a pro player in the J-League.
The Spirits have confirmed this.
In addition,
the manager of the motorcycle store where he works gave us this.
It's a photo sent from South America.
Inspector Yamamura had a very different image of him.
There's a message on the back.
You were right, boss.
I can't quit soccer!
I see.
Clothes don't make the man.
Maybe he's a nice guy who likes kids and soccer.
But if Mr. Nakaoka isn't the culprit,
who could it be?
But I think about it...
"Suginami Sports Park."
"6:00 AM, K. K."
Who the hell is K. K. ?
Well, then...
Here I am on time,
but where is this famous K. K. ?
But this is...
Hello.
You're up early.
Hello !
I see!
K. K., this is King Kazu!
Player Kazuyoshi Miura!
Uh, excuse me...
Can I help you?
Do you know Mrs. Kaoru Koda?
From Nichiuri Newspaper.
Kaoru Koda? Nichiuri?
I don't know how..,
...but she heard I sometimes train here..,
and asked to take my picture.
Oh, right.
But I told her no.
I'm a pro player.
I'd rather she take a picture of me
a picture of me in the middle of the game, instead.
If possible, when I score a goal!
In the end, it was not related to our case.
By the way...
- Do you like soccer, kid? - Yes!
In that case...
Shall we play?
Of course we do!
Not bad, kid.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Come on, let's run!
Now the shots.
Golazo! Good shot!
That was a good shot, kid.
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Cold...
Where did Conan go?
Who left this? It's still very early...
This isn't another challenge, is it?
Phew, it's just mail for Dad.
What the hell?
Hey, kid.
Yes ?
Thanks for helping me train this morning.
Oh, no, it was my pleasure.
And in return,
I give you this.
Your wristband?
Thank you so much!
You're the second one I've given it to.
The first one was a red one, I think.
That was 14 or 15 years ago.
He trained with me, just like you.
He also made a good shot.
Has he joined the J-League now?
I don't know.
I didn't ask his name.
But if he continued to play soccer,
then it's quite possible.
Come on, be careful going home!
All right!
- Have a good day. - Thank you.
Hey, be careful, you hurt me!
Mr. Yamamori!
Oh, it's you, Kaoru.
Sorry, I was in a hurry.
We're both very busy since the incident.
I bet you're even busier.
I can tell from your smile that you have a new scoop.
Well... who knows?
Well, I wish you success.
But don't take the wind out of my sails!
I won't... Well, I'm in a hurry!
Hey, wait!
What is she up to now?
Oh, that notebook...
"Detective Mouri,
"don't think you're off the hook.
"The next explosion will have even more spectators
"than the last one,
"and no doubt they will share in this moment of terror.
"You will know more in due course.
"I wish you success."
We had mail this morning
in the mailbox at the agency,
and it was when I picked it up that I saw the card.
I see.
Say...
Do you really think it's the culprit?
Maybe it's a bad joke.
No, I think it's him.
We made public the riddle from last time,
but not the sentence he said last time.
The last sentence?
I wish you success.
That's right...
His wish to succeed.
Yes.

It's written at the end of this card too.
God, what a jerk!
But this time he didn't give a riddle.
No,
but there is a clue.
Look at this part.
"The next explosion will have even more
"of spectators than the last one."
I think he means that the explosion will take place
in a place where a lot of people will be gathered.
There were 80,000 fans in the stands of Tohto Stadium.
So we are looking for a place with more than 80,000 people?
Is that really possible?
It is!
Where, Chiba?
Here, look at this poster!
In the Shiodome arena, on December 3rd,
many popular groups
will play in this "concert of a hundred thousand"!
December 3rd?
Wait a minute!
Yoko is also singing in this concert!
Yes, Yoko...
Well, Miss Yoko Okino will be there, too.
You can't let her go!
Well, it's not my decision.
So the explosion will take place in the room where Miss Okino is singing,
a good friend of Mr. Mouri's?
It can't be a coincidence.
So the culprit is definitely
someone with a grudge against Mouri?
But of the five suspects,
- none of them have any reason to hate him... - Wait a minute.
It's not exactly related to that,
but the organizers of the concert...
is Nichiuri TV, which Mr. Yamamori works for.
And on the night of the concert,
the newscast he is in charge of
is supposed to broadcast a part of the concert live.
But yes!
If the explosion happens during the news...
it's going to break ratings records.
Yamamori, huh?
Now that I think about it, that guy...
Well, I wish you success.
I wish you both well!
Damn it!
I see.
His speech impediment may have come out in spite of himself.
There's also Mrs. Koda.
If that's the case,
she has a personal grudge against Miss Okino.
What's that? She has a grudge against Yoko?
According to her colleagues,
she really wanted a scoop, but Miss Okino is so well protected
that she didn't get anything on her and was very frustrated.
Come to think of it, on her notepad...
Hey, say!
When we were at the soccer class,
I saw Kaoru's notebook.
It said, "Y. 0., December 3rd, Shiodome Arena."
What?
Isn't Y. 0. Yoko's initials?
My goodness.
- Couldn't you have said that earlier? - Stop it, Dad!
Calm down, Mr. Mouri.
We don't know yet whether Mrs. Koda is guilty.
But now..,
they become suspects again.
The other suspicious person...
By the way, Ran..,
That card you received..,
Do you know when it was put in the mail?
Anyway, when I checked last night,
there was nothing there.
So it was put in after that.
So Nakaoka is innocent.
Yes.
How about that? Why is that?
He's still in custody.
He's due to be released this afternoon.
And if not, Ran..,
you said there was mail in there?
Oh, yes.
The letter carrier came early this morning.
The sender is...
"Tokyo Spirits fans and others concerned."
There was a thank-you letter for my father
and a tie.
Ah, sorry.
It looks like some glue spilled over the edges of the envelope.
That's okay.
- Thank you. - It's all right.
Okay.
Anyway,
we're getting away from the idea of hating the J.League or the stadium.
We'll have to go back and interview
Shinzo Yamamori and Kaoru Koda!
You're on to something, aren't you?
Yes.
The concert in question will take place on December 3.
The day of the J-League final?
You think it's suspicious too?
And why did the culprit
gave us information that points to this place?
This will make us increase security
which will make it more difficult for him.
That's right.
How confident is the unsub
in his ability to plant a bomb with this level of security?
Maybe...
Or maybe there's another place besides the Shiodome arena
where so many people will be gathered.
Or maybe the perpetrator is simply lying to us.
No, in this specific kind of crime
the guilty ones do not lie.

I can say that.
At the limit...
To the limit?
He may have used words that are misleading
misleading.
Here's the sports news! And already, the J-League!
The last games of the season will be held on Saturday, December 3!
Because of the explosion at Tohto Stadium,
the matches were almost cancelled,
but the president of the J-League
has just announced that they will take place!
They will be held on December 3rd and will start at 3:30 pm!
The same day, also at 3:30 pm,
the "Power of the Music" concert will take place at the Shiodome arena!
Also called "the hundred thousand concert"...
Shiodome Arena
Announcement to all visitors:
Shiodome Arena
For security reasons, a check of personal belongings
will be done at the entrance...
Thank you very much.
Well, see you later, Yoko!
And good luck.
Excuse me.
Everything ready for the live feed?
Yes, everyone should be on stand-by.
There's no telling what might happen during the live show.
Tell them to stay focused.
I'll do that.
Hey, detective...
Is it really Shiodome arena that he's going to plant bombs in?
- After all... - What, you're still at it?
There's no other event with over 80,000 people,
so it has to be this!
That's why I told you to go to the movies with Ran.
So, Conan,
is something bothering you?
Today is the J-League final.
Don't you think it's strange that it's the same day?
It does seem strange.
That's just coincidence!
Don't start confusing us with your nonsense!
No.
We thought the same thing,
and we've increased security for both events.
It seems to me that the games are scheduled to start at 3:30.
It shouldn't be too much longer.
If the Spirits win this game, they win the cup!
National Olympic Stadium
As for the Big Osaka, defeat will drop them to the J-2 rank.
This is a crucial match for both teams!
It's 3:30 pm, here is the kick-off!
It started!
We're just in time
Hey, Sonoko,
why did you tell them we were going to the movies?
Oh, sorry about that.
If I'd told them where we were going,
your father would have stopped us.
But this is the last time this year
I get to see Higo play!
Come on!
Do your best, Higo!
J-League Hall
It sucks, they brought Higo in...
I'd like a bite to eat too...
Just a bit, then.
I'll go to the booth then!
What's wrong with Higo?
He's holding his leg... Oh, he fell down!
Do you think he's hurt?
Are they replacing him?
The better a player is, the more he is targeted...
I've changed my mind.
Sanada, get ready.
I've been ready for a while.
That's fine. Go score a goal!
Yes, sir!
Sorry, Takahiro.
I'll leave the rest to you.
I'll do it!
You can rest for a year if you want!
Don't be silly. Go on, get going!
Sanada is replacing Higo on the field.
What's up?
So how is it going?
- Anything unusual? - Nothing unusual.
I don't think there are 80,000 of us here.
What about the others?
Still,
we are so lucky to be able to see all ten games at once!
Yes !
We'll all get a thrill together like this!
It's so great!
So, did you hear them, Edogawa?
Thrills all together?
Don't tell me that the target area was...
Oh, Azusa!
I know her, she works at the cafe downstairs.
Sorry, but...
Someone called the cafe, with a strange voice...
What did he say?
He said he left you
a note for you at the District 2 phone booth.
What?
"Attention.
"In ten J-League stadiums
I have hidden bombs"!
What?
Damn, that's what I was afraid of.
"They will all explode simultaneously at the end of the games,
"without any delay.
"But a foregone conclusion would not be fun,
"so I'll give you a chance.
"If the home teams follow my instructions
"during the second half,

"the bombs will not explode.
"This will then be indicated
"by a double flashing of the scoreboard."
Again with the digital panel?
"However, you will only be able to inform
"only the coaches and the top striker on each team.
"Do not tell the other players.
"If you try anything during the game,
"like evacuating the fans or trying to find the bombs,
"then I will immediately detonate the bombs.
"You will make the players wear
"a red wristband on the left arm of the best strikers.
"As to the conduct to be followed to prevent the explosion..."
What is it?
"I have already indicated it
"in this letter."
What?
"Furthermore, even if you succeed in preventing the explosion..,
"I forbid you to search for the bombs until 35 minutes after the end of the match.
"If you do not, the fans will pay the price.
"Kogoro Mouri, if you want to stop me,
"become the eleventh striker and come find me!
"I wish you success."
Damn, that line again!
It's not true!
So he had
he had put us on the wrong track.
We were fooled.
All the games of the final start at the same time.
If we count all the fans,
they are well over 80,000.
It's true...
He never said they had to be in one place.
Takagi.
What time does it end?
Uh, 5:15, I think...
Just over an hour to go!
What is it, Sato?
The first sentence of the letter...
The word "attention" is the only one
that seems to have been written after stapling the sheets.
Look closely.
The red ink on one of the characters
is protruding from the top of the staple.
It does.
So, the question
is why he wrote that after he stapled it.
A staple...
Red ink purposely put in the middle...
Hey!
- What are you doing? - I see, so that was it!
I understood what the culprit wants from the players!
What is it, Conan?
Do you have a lead?
Say...
The black box around the message,
doesn't it remind you of a soccer field?
Don't you have anything more interesting to say?
If the frame represents the field,
then the clip must be the goal!
Well, yes! Don't you think that the clip
has the same shape as the goals?
Let me see!
And the vertical line of the character below
extends to the "goal", right?
- So that's... - a shooting path!
Maybe it requires a player to score in the center of the cage?
It doesn't add up, detective.
Scoring a goal
is the same as crossing the line.
If it was, the line should have been drawn before stapling
and it would have gone over.
But here,
the characters were written after,
and the line stops at the staple.
I see it!
The place where the red ink touches the clip
is the middle of the crossbar.
So the culprit is asking us to
a shot right down the middle of the bar!
Okay.
Go tell all the teams!
Yes, sir.
Megure here.
It's me, Shiratori.
I'm pretty sure I have our culprit!
What's the matter? Did you find out who it is?
Bombs?
- Are you serious? - Yeah, it's serious.
We just got a call from the police.
What do you think? Do you feel up to it?
Say it if it's too hard.
No one will blame you if you refuse.
- Someone else will... - Who will?
Who else could do it but me?
The bomber asked for the best striker, right?
I don't know who the best striker is now that Higo is out,
but I'm the only striker left, right?
Sanada...
That should do it, I think!
And if I stop the explosion,
I'll become a real celebrity!
I'll be popular with the girls after that.
Sanada.
Put this on your left arm.
Oh, uh... It's just a thrill!
We're counting on you, Sanada.
Yes, sir!
Do you think the Tokyo Spirits will win?
No, I bet on Kashiwa Reysol!
The players are coming back!
The second half is starting.
Well, it's about time!

I can't wait to see how it turns out.
Yes...
Hello?
Haibara, listen carefully.
Whoever did this was targeting the J-League.
A red wristband on the strikers?
I understand. I'll let you know if anything happens.
Thank you, sir.
I'm going to see the alleged perpetrator...
Sorry, I'll call you back!
Kudo!
Sorry for the wait.
- Do you know where to go? - Yes, we do.
Are you settled, Mouri?
What's up?
What are you doing here with us?
Never mind, just get started.
Uh, all right.
What do you say?
Keep it down, Professor!
Ah, sorry...
So, who are the best strikers on each team?
The ones with the red wristbands.
According to Kudo,
the explosion will take place
at 5:15 pm, after the matches are over.
Can't they evacuate the fans?
No...
If they try, he'll detonate the bombs remotely.
So we can only count on the players...
Yes.
The lives of all the fans depend on them.
On those ten strikers!
Yeah!
He hit it!
What?
Sanada hit the bar!
Are you sure, Conan?
Yes, the commentator said so too.
Great, the National Olympic Stadium is saved!
I'm not sure about that.
We asked to be notified the moment
they would see the digital panels blinking.
Hasn't it happened yet?
What? Did I miss it?
Hey, Sanada!
Come on, let's go back!
Damn it!
What are you doing, Sanada?
You're so bad!
Sit down, Sonoko!
Why did Higo have to get hurt?
I came to see him on purpose!
Sanada! You better score this time!
What's wrong?
In all the stadiums, all they do is hit the bar!
They didn't score, and yet...
Why do they look so happy?
They are not star strikers for nothing.
They hit the bar one after the other, despite the pressure.
Yes.
That's impressive.
Hey, Detective!
The bombs from the Cerezo and Jubilo games have been deactivated!
Roger that.
All right!
Only four more to go, right?
There he is!
You too, Mr. Mouri?
What is it about you that makes you come in such numbers?
We are running out of time, so I will get right to the point.
I thought it was suspicious that the hospital where your son, Tom, was taken
your son, Tomofumi, was taken and died,
is located near the Tohto stadium which was recently bombed.
So I investigated.
That day, at Tohto Stadium
the J-League All-Star game was taking place.
And when the ambulance carrying Tomofumi
tried to pass by the stadium,
it was blocked by excited fans
and could not move forward for a while.
The fans were banging on the ambulance and shouting with megaphones.
And these fans were led...
I remember!
Yes, by you, Mr. Mouri.
What do you mean, Mr. Mouri?
It's true, I...
I got drunk after winning big at the races that day.
Hell, I'd forgotten all about it until now.
I see...
So it was the ambulance
that was transporting your son...
How long was the ambulance held up?
About two minutes, I think.
So I wouldn't go so far as to say that's what caused his death,
but...
But if it wasn't for their nonsense,
maybe he could have been saved!
I too, like my son, love soccer.
And the J-League, of course.
But...
Mr. Mouri and those fans,
I cannot forgive them!
Which club did those fans belong to?
I don't know.
I couldn't see outside.
All I know is...
that the ambulance was blocked by Kogoro Mouri and some supporters.
I see.
Since you don't know where these supporters came from,
you placed bombs in all the stadiums.
Mr. Motoura.
We solved your riddle earlier,
and talking to Coach Sakaki confirmed my suspicions.
You're the guilty one.
Guilty? Of what?
The goal your son scored,
how did he score it?
Uh...
He hit the middle of the bar and the ball fell into the cage.
This is also the answer to the riddle.

A shot right off the crossbar.
What do you have to say, Mr. Motoura?
But... answer what?
What is this story of a culprit and a riddle?
Mr. Motoura.
About what happened to the ambulance,
you don't know everything.
The truth is that Mr. Mouri and the others stopped the ambulance
because they were trying to save a life.
That's right.
I had called the emergency room about an old man who had fainted
and while I was waiting for the ambulance,
I was giving him first aid.
Here it is at last!
Quick, get out of the way!
The ambulance is here.
No way!
She's definitely going the wrong way.
Hey, we're here!
The ambulance I called arrived shortly afterwards,
and the old man was saved.
Oh well...
It was a misunderstanding, of course,
but I'm terribly sorry I stopped your ambulance!
You have every right to be angry with me.
However, it's not right
it is not right to involve innocent people in this!
Mr. Motoura.
Deactivate the bombs immediately.
As Mr. Mouri said, there is nothing right about your actions!
But wait, please!
What are you talking about?
What, it wasn't you
who put bombs in the stadiums?
What's up?
I've got a funny feeling...
Inspector, Shiratori, come here a moment.
Yes, sir.
We're not getting anywhere.
Don't we have more concrete evidence?
We've got less than ten minutes before the explosion!
I know what's bothering me!
As I thought, this man...
That's enough, detectives.
I understand why you came to interrogate me.
But I am innocent!
I too believe that Mr. Motoura is not guilty.
The guilty party should be concerned about the time of the end of the match.
But Mr. Motoura
never once looked at his watch.
Not even when you weren't looking at it.
Are you sure, Conan?
I didn't take my eyes off him.
That's ridiculous!
The fact remains...
the way to stop the bombs is to make the same shot as Tomofumi.
It can't be a coincidence.
What am I missing?
Damn it, in the end we're back to where we started!
Inspector!
- Only one more to go! - What's missing?
All that's left are the bombs from the Big and Spirits game
and that's it
So they did it!
Mr. Motoura, do you mind if we turn on the TV?
No, go ahead.
There's only five minutes left.
The Big's forward is Sanada, I believe?
What, it's not Higo? Damn it!
With so much time left,
Sanada is our only hope.
All I can do is
is to find the real culprit as soon as possible.
These are...
the same photos as on Mr. Motoura's phone.
What's this?
Tomofumi...
don't look at the lens!
Who is he waving at?
Tell me...
That man we see filming in the background,
it's you, isn't it?
Yes, I was filming the scene
and my wife was taking pictures from across the street.
It was with this camera, right?
Can I watch?
Yes, if you want.
Thank you, sir.
If my deduction is correct,
then on this film
we should see...
There!
This person...
- That's a mistake, right? - Yes, it is.
This is the ideal position.
Mr. Motoura,
please turn it up!
Yes, I will.
Foul!
Sanada has been pushed to the ground!
Big Osaka wins a free kick!
With two minutes left,
- it's a huge opportunity for them. - Sanada! Stay calm!
- Take a breath! - It's Sanada's shot!
Sanada missed several scoring opportunities today,
but will he finally
save his team from defeat?
He's in!
Goal for the Big Osaka!
They scored in the last minute!
How did it go?
Did he hit the bar?
Hard to tell from here...
Let go, I have to...
The Spirits are not in good shape!
The clock is going to show 45 minutes!
No...
Did I fail?
The time is up.
Why isn't anything happening?
A mistake of the culprit?
No.
The bombs were deactivated
when he hit the bar with his first shot.

It was the digital panel that didn't work.
In any case, it's a chance for us.
Yes.
Now all we have to do
to find the culprit...
But I repeat that it is not me!
If the culprit is this person,
then this child must be...
Hey, mister...
Did you tell anyone
what happened to Tomofumi?
Yes, my wife said she told someone...
But I don't know who.
The culprit is who I think it is.
But this person...
This is a model of Tomofumi.
The label has come off...
It looks like glue has spilled over the edges of the envelope.
Oh, no!
What's wrong with you?
Now I'm sure that's the culprit!
And also...
that the bombs are not deactivated!
This one, then...
Hello?
Kogoro Mouri?
It's you!
Bastard!
Where are you hiding?
It seems that you didn't manage to reach me.
What's the matter?
You are not worthy
to be the eleventh striker.
Here's the whistle for the end of the game!
This year's big winners...
are Kashiwa Reysol!
This sucks!
I'll never make it in time!
Hey, are you okay?
Yes... but what are you doing here?
The teacher told us everything.
It's not nice to go without us.
Yeah, stop showing off!
Guys...
And we guessed right away
where you were going!
Right, Ai?
Oh my...
To Tohto Stadium, teacher, hurry!
It's moving!
Speed up, teacher!
- We're running out of... - I know, I know.
But why do you want to go back to Tohto Stadium?
It's still being repaired.
That's where it all began...
and that's also the final goal.
That's Ran and Sonoko!
What's that?
I was just watching the ending ceremony..,
and there...
They were in the stands.
So they went to the National Olympic Stadium!
No, they're not in danger there, normally.
The priority is to arrest the culprit.
You stay here and make sure no one suspicious comes near.
I'll go get the bombs.
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. - Got it!
If you wait for uncle Kogoro, he won't come!
I came alone.
By the way, I freed the guards who were knocked out,
so the police should arrive soon.
I understood the trick of the card in the mailbox.
You mailed it
on the day of the Tohto Stadium explosion.
Before you called uncle Kogoro,
you put it on the bottom
by wedging the edges at the top and bottom.
The mailbox is made so that
that you can't see the bottom unless you look carefully.
If other letters arrived,
you would only see them and not the card at the bottom.
And then, later that same day,
you mailed an envelope signed "Spirits supporters."
I'm talking about an envelope big enough
to barely fit inside,
and you had previously coated the edges with glue.
Sound familiar?
The mailman was of course forced
to push it to the bottom of the mailbox
to make sure it wouldn't fall out later.
As a result, the card stuck to the bottom
stuck to the envelope,
and when I took it out...
the card fell to the front of the mailbox,
as if it had just been mailed.
Thus, the card
appeared to have been dropped off in the morning, despite being checked the night before,
and your alibi was established.
But it also means that
that the person with the perfect alibi for that day is the culprit.
Am I right?
Since you were in police custody at the time of the crime,
you had an airtight alibi,
former Haido high school star forward...
Kazumasa Nakaoka.
Pretty impressive for a kid.
What's your name again?
Conan Edogawa.
Detective.
No one seems to come through here.
Yes...
In that case,
shouldn't we go help him look for the bombs?
That's a good point.
The dome is huge, too.
We'll go faster if we search together.
Don't think about it, it's dangerous inside.
Wait for Edogawa to come back...

- Hey, wait! - Come back here, kids!
Junior Detectives, let's go!
Yeah!
Oh no, we've got to catch up with them fast!
Wait here, Professor!
I'll get them back.
You, keep the engine running
to chase the criminal if you have to!
Uh, all right.
So...
When did you meet Tomofumi?
How do you know that?
I saw you in the video taken by Mr Motoura.
You can be seen waving to him.
I guess you knew him when you were a senior.
On the high school sports field,
during a solo practice?
How do you know that?
The dormitory of Haido High School where you study
was very close to Haido Park.
You are originally from Gunma,
so you probably lived in the dormitory.
Mr. Nakaoka...
You approached him one day while he was watching you play, right?
Just like...
Kazu spoke to you years ago.
Do you like soccer, kid?
Yes !
Yes, I do.
I met Tomofumi at the beginning of
of my senior year.
You're right,
it was at Haido Park when I was training.
Great.
Tomofumi was born sickly
and couldn't do hard sports.
Gradually, he became my training partner.
Our training sessions together continued until winter.
continued until winter.
I won the high school soccer championship
and I celebrated with Tomofumi my decisive goal in the national final.
By the way,
here, Tomofumi, a good luck charm.
So that you can play a game and score a goal one day.
Thank you, Tomofumi!
But in February, you caused a motorcycle accident
which put an end to your friendship with Tomofumi.
Indeed.
The six months of rehabilitation after my operation didn't work
and I fled to South America.
And in June of this year,
when I returned to Haido Park after all that time...
Tomofumi!
Tomofumi was then in the fourth grade
and had joined the neighborhood team.
Because of his health,
he was always on the sidelines during the games,
but the coach promised him that he would play a bit in the next game.
We made a promise to each other
that if he scored a goal in the game
we would celebrate together.
And, as promised,
Tomofumi scored a goal during his game!
Seeing him work hard
made me want to play soccer again.
But...
That's why
you wanted to take revenge
against uncle Kogoro and the fans.
Yes.
How did you get the bombs?
A friend I met in South America
was a pro in this field.
You placed bombs in nine stadiums, didn't you?
And the tenth stadium was not the National Olympic Stadium,
but this one, Tohto Stadium.
You placed a fake sensor in the national stadium.
That's why it didn't react to Sanada's shots.
You spared this stadium
because it is a sacred place for you.
In return,
you placed a bomb in the Tohto Stadium where you dreamed
to stand one day as a player of the J-League.
And you set the bombs to explode at 5:50 pm.
You were counting on uncle to solve the riddle and come here
to die with him!
It was also at 5:50 pm
that Haido high school became national champion that snowy day!
That's why instead of marking "5:50 pm",
you wrote "at the end of the matches".
That's right.
Since my soccer career
ended with this game,
it's an appropriate time for my death.
Mr. Nakaoka.
You said that those who can't
90 minutes on a field don't deserve to play.
But that's not true.
What?
You think Tomofumi,
who was sick and could only play for a limited time...
didn't deserve to play soccer?
If you can only play for 15 minutes,
then let's try to make the most of it!
What do you know, kid?
Maybe nothing.
But I'm sure a real J-League player
would tell you that you don't know what real soccer is!
If you find your own way to exploit it,
it may very well become your strength!
Not to mention, Mr. Nakaoka,

that there are still things you don't know.
The truth is...
Well done, guys!
Any problems at Shiodome Arena?
No results.
No battery...
You're lying!
You're saying Kogoro Mouri and the fans
wanted to save someone?
I refuse to believe it!
It's true!
I only told the truth, Mr. Nakaoka.
Do you really expect me to believe that?
Stop it!
Tomofumi would be sad if he saw you doing that!
I'm sorry, but I can't go back.
No !
Something's going on!
Let's split up!
OK!
Hey... Genta, Ayumi!
Wait!
Oh no...
I have to get them out of there fast!
There's only one way to stop the explosion now.
Look at the digital panel.
It doesn't make sense now,
but I designed this event for an attacker
and made it so that bombs explode every minute.
Once the countdown is over,
all the other bombs will explode from a distance,
and that will be the end of it.
That detective assassin and the other supporters will die.
Kogoro and the fans?
Kid,
you made a big mistake in your deduction.
No... It wasn't here?
No, it wasn't.
This stadium was not one of the
of those mentioned in my letter.
I did not place bombs at Tohto Stadium until afterwards.
So this is not the tenth stadium,
but the eleventh!
So the tenth stadium is...
the national Olympic stadium !
That's why...
you forbade us to look for the bombs for 35 minutes!
It was so that we wouldn't find the bombs hidden there!
Right
The bombs at the national stadium are synchronized
with the ones in my bag.
That is 4 minutes before the end of the game when I scored a goal at the national stadium.
It was this sacred stadium that I had staked everything on,
so I decided to take it to the grave with me!
Are you sure this is it, Mouri?
Yes.
Whoever did this wants to finish me off right here!
All right. I'll check the surveillance cameras.
I'll check the surveillance cameras.
You stay here!
Got it!
You're so handsome, Higo!
Higo! I love you!
Who the hell was that?
Damn it! Why did it get cut?
Come on, Ran, answer it!
You've reached the voice mailbox of...
Why, Ran?
Run away quickly, kid.
I've got nothing on you.
Only the eleventh attacker could prevent the explosion..,
but he missed my challenge and isn't here.
In two minutes I will have my revenge.
Tomofumi should be able to rest in peace now.
Nonsense!
You gave up your dreams,
and now you use his death
as an excuse to unleash your anger!
What's wrong with you?
You're just a coward who decided himself
that he can't fulfill his dreams!
Will you hold your tongue, you little brat?
You're the kid here!
You blame others
and try to destroy everything rather than face the truth!
You can't get more selfish and immature than that!
Don't you see?
You're rejecting
the soccer that Tomofumi loved so much!
That's Tomofumi's memory you're trying to destroy!
When are you going to understand?
He's right, Kazumasa!
Tomofumi...
Where did you get that wristband?
This...
the one I gave him... No... impossible!
It can't be!
It's nobody's fault.
So stop all this, now!
No...
You mean I was wrong, Tomofumi?
I just wanted to avenge you...
and then join you!
So why, Tomofumi?
Are you rejecting me too?
Mr. Nakaoka?
There's no time...
Tomofumi...
Run!
Damn it!
Stop!
No way!
I'll never give up!
It's impossible for a child!
I'll do it!
I'll stop these bombs at any cost!
Come on!
I'll get it!
You've got to be kidding me...
That was my only ball!
No.
Even if I had more, I couldn't...
What to do?
That was the third explosion, so...
less than 2 minutes left!
What to do?

This debris will prevent me from reaching the goal directly.
What can I do?
And I don't have a ball anymore...
What can I do?
Conan!
This is...
Ayumi!
We came to help you!
Don't stay here, it will explode!
Conan!
Mitsuhiko !
Genta !
Conan!
Are you crazy or what? Hurry up and run!
I don't have the balloon
to prevent the explosion!
I have one!
The one signed by Hide?
I don't know what's going on,
but if this balloon can stop the bombs...
Are you ready, Mitsuhiko?
Are you sure? This balloon is...
Don't miss, right?
I got it!
It's your turn, Ayumi!
Pass it to Conan!
Yes !
I'm sending!
Here we go!
He is coming!
Wait, stay here!
Yeah, well done Ayumi !
Send it to Conan quickly !
Yes !
But how?
I can't send it that far!
You just have to go through the debris.
Remember the soccer class!
Guys...
Come on, I'm sending it, Conan!
Oh, no, you don't!
Oh, boy.
You're really making my life difficult.
Haibara!
Yes!
Please, Ai!
Pass the ball to Conan!
OK.
Kudo, I entrust you
all our hopes to you!
You'd better catch them!
That was perfect, well done!
Seriously?
They are not clean!
They really think they can stop the bombs in this situation?
Quick, we're running out of time...
No...
It's over.
There's less than a minute left.
I can't hit the target because of the debris,
but with this shot...
Remember that.
You learned it in soccer class.
Endo's free kick...
It can work!
Hit the ball from the front...
and instead of just kicking it,
lift it up slightly...
and shoot!
Go for it!
No !
With this angle, he won't be able to...
What?
Come on, bend over!
Did I get it?
- Yeah! Way to go, Conan! - You did it!
Conan!
You're quite a kid.
The eleventh attacker,
...was you...
Conan Edogawa.
I want to pass them on to you, to send them to you
To you from that distant day
And to be able to lock up in my heart
the idea that one day we will have to part
Squinting at the blue sky
You put my hand in front of your face
The wind informs you with its sweet scent
Of the new season that is beginning
Suddenly the whistle blows
And it's as if the wind was turning
You let out a few tears
"The future scares me a little"
While, in profile, you whisper these words
I only see you
I want to transmit them to you, to send them to you
To you of this distant day
And to be able to lock up in my heart
the idea that one day we will have to separate
One day we will become adults
And we will meet again
I swear to you, here and now
So let's part with a smile
Let's part with a smile
As I tried to grab your hand
Here it goes with a rustle
This future that knows no respite
Disappears in the distant sky
Walking in the darkness
Trying to find my way
I see a ray of light
If I had to describe us all in one word
It is certainly the word "hope"
That I would choose
What is always there, but unattainable
It's that blue sky that constantly watches us
That day we painted
The dreams we had left
So I pray, here and now
For you to always keep smiling
If I have to count all the things
That you've said or given me
I might as well count the stars in the night
If I want to pour out to you
My intangible feelings
I must lead us to the place of our promise
I want to pass them on to you, to send them to you
To the you of this distant day
And be able to lock up in my heart
the idea that one day we will have to separate
One day we will become adults
And we will meet again
I swear to you, here and now
So let's part with a smile
Let's part with a smile
Just the same,
I still can't believe there were bombs at the stadium where we were!
Yes, it feels strange.
By the way, what was that about?
What was what about?

You know, you said something about a time in junior high school when you threw
the ball to Shinichi or something.
Here comes Hide's free kick!
Watch out, Ran!
It's white.
You're pushing it, Conan!
I'm surprised at you!
That kid, then!
What are you talking about?
Little pervert.
Uh, no, that's not...
Conan!
I'm sorry!
I mean...
It's soccer, you could have sent it back with your head!
