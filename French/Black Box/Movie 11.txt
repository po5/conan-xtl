Urgent ! Urgent! Agent 503 to the police station!
Urgent! Agent 503, come in.
I have two suspects on the run, possible armed robbers.
They're leaving Sotobori for Miyuki Avenue.
Roger that. Please send car license plate
and description of suspects. Over.
Agent 503, roger!
Black van, license plate Shinjuku 500 SA-3255.
The suspects are, uh...
They're Lupin and Fujiko!
Stop joking around, agent 503!
But I'm not joking!
Agent 503 to the police station!
Lupin turned left toward Chuo Avenue!
Officer 503, that's enough now. Your turn.
This is not a joke!
Miss Sato, please!
Drive more carefully!
Don't you call them anymore?
Yes, I did!
Agent 503 to the station!
The suspects are heading...
This thief dared to wear a Lupin mask!
He'll see!
That'll be 1237 yen, please.
Police! Stop right there!
You think they're criminals?
Too good!
You, the car in front! Stop!
I repeat: you will not be able to flee!
Pull over to the side!
They are looking for me!
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!
Miss Sato,
they're running away!
Hold on.
What are you going to do?
You'll bite your tongue.
- Uh, Ms. Sato? - Shh!
Uh, but... Ms. Sato!
Call the police station, Takagi!
Got it!
Honestly...
Ms. Sato!
Backup and ambulance are on the way.
Serves him right.
He shouldn't have worn a mask of my first love.
He was your first love?
Go see about Fujiko.
Right away.
We won't die on our hands!
The ambulance is on its way.
Miss Sato!
Our Fujiko just passed out too.
Nothing serious at first.
Okay, then.
Why did you do that?
To go and commit a theft, and with a mask like that...
The Koumi Islands...
The Koumi Islands?
What, did you want money for fun there?
No...
You didn't?
Is there anything there?
Jolly...
Jolly... Roger...
Jolly Roger?
Does it speak to you?
No, it doesn't...
Koumi Islands
Come on mom, hurry up!
- Come on, let's go there. - Wait for me!
How do you put the mask on?
Give it to me.
Mister, what kind of fish will there be?
Hello.
Whose name is on the reservation?
Kogoro Mouri.
I'm a detective.
Two adults, two students,
and five children.
One moment, please.
See the puzzles in the Nichiuri newspaper?
Those really hard puzzles there.
Every week without a winner, the reward increases.
And the last one went up to 300,000 yen!
Guess who solved it and won the prize money.
I don't know.
Ah, would it be...
Bingo!
I am a detective, after all.
Puzzles are a piece of cake for me.
Yeah, well, I solved it myself...
With 300,000, there's enough for a nice trip to Paris.
Right?
I belong in Paris the most.
But I said to myself,
it wouldn't be fair for me to be the only one to enjoy it.
I might as well take the whole world with me!
So, there you go. I'm nice, right?
Uh, yeah, you are...
Anyway, what rooms do we have?
I'm really confused.
We don't have any reservations in your name.
Really?
Hey, oh...
Wait a minute!
I did make a reservation!
I'm sorry, your name is not on the list.
Do we have to sleep outside?
This is a subtropical island.
There are probably poisonous insects...
We shouldn't have come.
We'll figure something out.
It's not like we're in a foreign country.
You're so mature, Haibara.
She sure doesn't look like a kid.
They said at the front desk that they were calling the tourist office,
so that should take care of it.
I'm sorry, but...
But I'm telling you the truth!
They told me on the phone that my reservation was validated!
Even so...
Hello, sorry to have been so long!
It's Mr. Mouri, isn't it?
The great detective...
Excuse me, sir. I'm Iwanaga from the tourism office.
We suddenly have a spike in visitors, you see.

JÃ´ji Iwanaga Tourism Manager of Koumi Islands
All our hotels are full, it's nice to see.
But I managed to find you an accommodation!
It's the minimum for a famous detective like you!
Come on, follow me.
I'll take you there.
Who are these guys?
Maybe they're treasure hunters.
Treasure hunters?
How can they hunt?
Like they shoot at treasure chests?
No, Genta.
They're people who travel in search of hidden treasure.
Wow.
But how did you know who they were?
Well, you just have to look at them.
All three of them are well tanned,
but mostly on their hands and faces.
That's because they're wearing diving suits.
Their hair is also lighter because of the sea water.
But they might as well be divers!
Yes, they could.
But considering this poster,
it's more plausible.
Come and look for ancient treasures under the sea bed! A palace is sleeping...
Treasures?
Yes.
It makes you dream, right?
Treasures buried under the ocean.
DETECTIVE CONAN JOLLY ROGER AND THE AZURE COFFIN
My name is Shinichi Kudo, high school detective.
What's up? Don't I look like a high school student?
This is my childhood friend, Ran Mouri.
One day, we were at an amusement park...
...and I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
He was totally engrossed in the transaction..,
I didn't hear his accomplice coming up behind me.
He made me swallow a drug, and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
In order to find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
That old man is Ran's father, Detective Kogoro Mouri.
People call him Sleeping Kogoro.
Do you know why?
Because of me!
That's Sonoko Suzuki.
She's in Ran's class,
and her temperament almost makes you forget that her family is rich.
That's Professor Agasa.
He's been helping me since I got younger
by making a lot of original inventions.
And this is Ai Haibara.
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She used to work with the Men in Black,
but to escape from the organization,
she swallowed the same drug as me
and also became younger.
I haven't found out who the men in black are yet,
but on my honor as a detective, I will soon!
My body has become younger, but not my mind!
I will solve all the mysteries!
There is only one truth!
It's funny, though.
Why all these treasure hunters all of a sudden?
Oh, that... It's since we found a treasure.
About two weeks ago.
We did? A treasure?
The silver plate we found in the underwater palace,
was it real, then?
Yes, apparently.
The underwater palace?
Look, look, look,
you see that uninhabited island over there?
That's Yorioya Island.
Yorioya Island
About 220 meters to the east, under the depths,
there is a building made of gigantic stones.
It's been ten years
that we started to be interested in these ruins buried under water
around the Koumi islands.
Many scientists came to study them,
Underwater palace
but they do not manage yet to determine
if it was built by the Man or not.
Yorioya Island used to rise more to the surface,
but it sank after an earthquake 300 years ago,
and it looks like this today.
Why did it sink?
Because of a landslide?
Yes.
In the seabed around here,
there are what are called methane hydrates.
The shock of the earthquake destroyed them,
which would have caused the landslides.
Hey, Conan?

What are "metal zidrates"?
Methane hydrates.
Methane hydrate
In cold and high pressure areas,
water molecules can form a "cage" that traps gas inside.
This is also known as "burning ice."
Burning ice?
A cage?
That's Chinese to me.
To make it simpler,
have you ever built a house of cards?
Imagine that the water molecules do the same thing,
and that methane gas gets trapped in each square.
When the temperature rises
or the pressure drops, it becomes unstable,
and when it collapses, all the methane is released.
Ah, right!
So the island was just above,
it lost its support and it made a landslide!
That's the simplified version, but yes.
I saw a documentary about it on TV!
You did?
What an idiot.
Excuse me, Mr. Mima?
This is Iwanaga, from the tourist office.
Mr. Mima!
Mr. Mima, are you there?
Nothing to do with the hotel earlier.
Yes...
I'm sorry,
he doesn't seem to be here.
I did call.
What's all the racket?
Mr. Mima!
These are the guests I told you about.
Kazuo Mima - Manager of Koumi Guest House
One night and two meals is 5000 yen.
Take it or leave it.
Wait, Mr. Mima!
He doesn't take himself for granted!
Sorry, he's not a bad guy,
but he's a bit special.
Anyway...
Who wants to participate in the treasure hunt?
We do!
We do!
You said you wanted to go diving?
Yes.
If you go now, I'll give you a ride.
That's nice, thank you!
And you, gentlemen?
Our scavenger hunt is really great!
Thank you, but I think I'll stay and relax.
How about you, Mr. Mouri?
- Should I sign you up? - No, I don't think so.
But I do want you to point me in the direction of
to a bar with a nice bartender.
Well, let's see...
Ms. Ran Mouri and Ms. Sonoko Suzuki, right?
Chika Mabuchi Owner of the "Grotto" store
Is this for renting a full set of equipment?
Yes !
Kimiko?
Coming!
Kimiko Yamaguchi Diving Instructor
Are these wetsuits okay?
I've got M, will that do?
Yes, it's perfect.
Phew, that's good!
We don't have a wide variety of models...
Oh, but that's okay.
I think they're great!
You do?
It's good, we have everything.
Hey, you two!
Don't forget to put everything away!
We'll come back.
These men are treasure hunters, right?
Are they going to dive with us?
Oh, no, they're not.
We're just renting them air tanks.
We've been getting a lot of those guys lately.
Because of the silver plate?
Yes.
And then there's the rumor that when she got out of prison,
Anne hid some treasure on these islands.
Anne? Who is she?
She is.
270 years ago, in the 18th century,
it is said that the sunken palace emerged from the sea bed.
The origin of this story
is the discovery of two objects in the palace:
A boarding sword and a pistol.
From the initials engraved on them,
it is assumed that they belonged, in the 1730s,
to two female pirates:
Anne Bonny and Mary Read.
Their captain was Jack Rackham...
Huh? Women pirates?
That's right!
Anne Bonny and Mary Read.
They were in the crew of the pirate Jack Rackham.
But during an attack by English troops,
while the men of the crew were in hiding,
they fought back to back
with the utmost bravery.
Oh... Back to back, you say?
Yes.
As each covered the other's back,
they could focus on the enemies in front.
They must have really trusted each other!
Wow!
Ran, you know,
I decided that you'd be the only one
...to whom I'd trust my back!
Sonoko?
I'm just kidding.
You've already got Shinichi for that.
That jerk? You've got to be kidding.
Are you?
Yes, I'm telling you!
Anne, having escaped from her prison in the Bahamas,

is said to have resumed piracy in the Pacific
and was waiting for Mary to escape.
If this hypothesis is true,
then their treasures may be hidden on the Koumi Islands.
Let's go! Let's all look for Anne and Mary's treasures together!
Yeah!
Do you think they're real?
I don't know.
But if they are, it's going to be a big deal.
What if they're fakes to promote the islands?
It will also make noise, but for another reason.
In any case, we'll hear about it.
Sorry, kids!
I kept you waiting!
Oh, dear...
Here you go.
It's your treasure map.
You're all out of here.
Find the 5 hidden stamps using your cards
to solve the mystery.
The first one is right here.
Stamp your cards with it,
and most importantly, get the clue
in the treasure chest next to it!
This is really childish.
Don't say that...
Look at them, they're all over the place.
Ten and twelve?
Is this the key to the treasure?
The next place...
"Even at sunset, the pirates shine through."
What is this gibberish?
Come on, good luck!
If you find where the treasure is, you'll get a special gift!
What's the special gift?
Something to eat?
You'll have to succeed to find it.
I'll give it my best shot!
It may not be food, you know...
Say, sir...
Yes ? Do you have a question?
Are you the one who prepared all the riddles?
Didn't you?
Well, yes...
Oh, by the way!
Please stop by the building next door and borrow some bikes.
It would be too difficult to walk.
Alright!
You're looking pretty good yourself, Kudo.
There, everything's ready.
Okay, well...
Follow Kimiko's instructions and be careful.
Be especially careful on the south side of the palace.
There are a lot of cracks.
You're scaring me!
No, everything will be fine.
I will be with you.
Yes, you will.
We count on you!
Already back?
Is there a problem?
Sharks!
The clue said sunset,
so we went to the westernmost part of the island...
But where can the next chest be?
But yes, I got it!
The clue said:
"Even at sunset, the pirates shine there."
Right?
So this must be
the surface of the water!
Ah, but yes!
So what?
What?
Do you think the stamp is in the open sea?
Oh, uh...
No, it can't be, indeed.
Darn...
Oh, look over there!
What are those?
It's fish.
Maybe it's eels!
But no, there is none here!
I understood everything!
Hey, Conan!
Well what, you understood what?
Did you find out where it was?
You know why these fish have gathered?
Why did they do that? Well...
To play all together?
They were hungry, so they eat something there?
That's right!
And what do they eat?
Plankton, right?
Yes, that's it.
Too much!
Is there anything here?
Look at this.
Sea fireflies!
Yes, they are!
The place where pirates shine even at dusk,
it was here!
I found it.
Skinny pirates laughing
It says, "Skinny pirates are laughing."
Why shouldn't fat pirates laugh?
What's wrong, Haibara?
I just saw
someone in a wetsuit, covered in blood.
What?
I couldn't tell if it was Ran or not.
Conan!
Edogawa and I are coming back,
You go on hunting without us!
You too, Haibara?
Nothing to worry about!
I'm here!
We'll find the treasure without them!
Yes, you're right.
Ran!
Conan!
What about Ai?
Are you alright?
We're fine, but...
Officer Uehira Island's resident policeman
How is he, Mr. Uehira?
Oh, is that you, Kimi?
Were you at sea with them?
No.
I was diving in the area with some clients.
But I was really surprised
to see sharks attacking a man!
Besides, they were only attacking one when there were three of them.
What do you mean by that?
Nothing special.

But what a story!
We hadn't had a shark attack in years.
Already, I had never seen a shark in the area !
What's the matter?
This is what Kimiko said.
There were three of them, but only one was attacked.
It's not a coincidence?
If they were pros,
they should know how to deal with sharks.
Did you see something?
A vinyl bag.
Fish blood?
That's what must have caused this.
Yes.
Someone put fish blood in this thin vinyl bag,
then sealed it up tight and stuffed it in his jacket.
The pressure increases by 1 bar every 10 meters of water,
knowing that it is already 1 bar underwater.
At a depth of 10 meters, the pressure is 2 bar,
at 30 meters, we are at 4 bar...
With so much pressure,
a thin bag like this
will inevitably end up opening.
Sharks can hear a noise from miles away,
and their sense of smell makes them smell a million times more
the smell of blood.
- So it's a murder? - Yes.
An attempt, at least.
Hey, squinty!
What are you two doing here?
There's been a crime, Uncle!
What's the matter?
And why didn't anyone tell me, huh?
You should have called the great detective Kogoro Mouri.
They've got some serious jaws.
But then again,
a shark attack isn't so much a crime,
but rather an accident.
Well, what is it?
What's that?
How is he, Doctor?
We tried everything,
but he lost too much blood.
I'm so sorry.
Damn it!
What a terrible accident, how awful...
No, it wasn't an accident.
You're the famous detective!
Yes, it's me, Kogoro Mouri.
- Daddy! Daddy! - Mr. Mouri!
Hey!
What do you mean it wasn't an accident?
Someone lured the sharks
to attack you.
And that's by hiding in his vest
a plastic bag filled with fish blood.
By the way,
you are treasure hunters, right ?
I can see where this is going.
Say, Ran...
Where do you normally keep your diving jackets?
That's a good question.
We can't really take them back to the hotel.
They probably leave them at the local dive store,
so they can take the air tanks with them.
Oh...
Equipment room
His stabilizing vest must have been rigged here.
It would have been too risky to take it out.
Come here, Kudo.
What's the matter?
Here, look.
They always have to wash the equipment here,
and it made the floor muddy.
Would you mind
taking some pictures for me?
I've got some other things to check on.
Hey, since when did I become your assistant?
My assistant? No, you're not.
You're my partner.
You're a smooth talker.
Come on, I'm counting on you.
Yes, yes.
Say, lady?
Yes, what is it?
Somebody staying in the store at night?
Oh, you're playing detective?
I have a house just around the corner,
and Kimiko lives in her apartment by the harbor,
so there's no one there at night.
Oh well...
Besides, there are no thieves on the island.
We don't even lock our doors.
Ah, Kimiko.
Did you lock up last night?
Yes.
Why did you do that?
This little detective is asking me a lot of questions.
Oh, right!
You're investigating the vest that was tampered with.
Yes.
I did indeed close last night,
and I also opened this morning,
but since we don't lock, anyone could have gotten in.
So, what do you think?
Did you find anything?
No...
Nothing interesting yet.
I hope you find something.
What's up?
What do you think, genius?
What the hell are you doing, Conan?
How are we supposed to find the pirate treasure without you?
You're on your own for a change!
It's too hard without you!
Okay, where are you guys?
We're headed for the suspension bridge.
What bridge?
It's on the treasure map!
On the map...
Oh yeah, I see it.
Then hurry up!
Yes, yes.
I swear to God...
Are you coming, Haibara?
No thanks, I'm fine.

I figured as much.
What, seriously?
Which way am I supposed to go?
What a pain in the ass.
Oh?
- Are you by yourself? - Yes, I am.
Your friends are up on the bridge.
Yes, I want to join them,
but the road is closed.
Oh yes, sorry!
An earthquake caused a landslide last week.
Go on a little further,
there is a path that goes to the left.
Will you be able to find it?
Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Iwanaga.
Be careful, huh?
Yes !
It's ruined, we'll never find it!
Yes we will, with Conan!
We can do it even without him!
Come on, let's go.
Oh?
There's something on the other side of the bridge!
What is it?
- Let's go and see. - Yes, let's.
I am so hungry...
Hey, wait for me!
Wait, stop!
Don't move!
Why?
Misery...
Attention! Passage forbidden over 40 kg.
What's the problem?
How much do you weigh, Genta?
- 39 kilos! - Mytho!
Yeah, well, I might have put on a little weight... 100 pounds?
No way!
The bridge can't support more than 40 kilos!
What, are you serious?
Yeah, I got it!
"The skinny pirates are laughing about it",
it must be about this bridge!
Oh, good point!
The skinny pirates will laugh,
and the fat ones will cry!
Help me, Mom!
- Found it! - Yes!
The pirate who doesn't sing
"The pirate who doesn't sing"? What does that mean?
It's already 4:00.
- We'll continue tomorrow. - Yes, we will.
But how will we get back?
Good question.
With Genta sitting on it,
the bridge will collapse if we go over it, too.
Hey! What are you guys doing?
Conan! We found it!
Wow, congratulations!
The next clue is: "The non-singing pirate."
But the bridge will collapse if anyone over 100 pounds walks by!
Is that what it says?
Uh, no.
It just says, "No one over 40 kg may pass."
Ah, I see.
That's why the skinny pirates laugh about it.
No problem then, come on!
This sign is just a hint!
Under 40 kilos,
that's limited to women and children!
They won't build a bridge that others
can't cross!
Thank you for coming, Inspector!
But you didn't need to come in person.
There is something that intrigues me.
Inspector!
Thank you for coming!
We'll interview the people first.
Well, yes, sir!
You treat us like suspects!
TarÃ´ Izuyama Treasure Hunter
We are the victims, right?
Then behave like one,
and answer our questions!
Have you ever seen
seen these two people before?
No, I don't know.
Last night, these two men
robbed the cash register of a supermarket in Shinbashi.
They said the order came from you.
It was a test to join your group.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Mitsushi Matsumoto Treasure hunter
They must have lied to get away with it.
You son of a...
Do you have any proof of this?
It's their word against mine.
Come on, calm down.
Let's not get carried away.
Here, have a cold drink.
It's not all that,
but if you don't have any more questions,
I'd like to go back to my room and rest.
You really have no idea
who might be after you, Mr. Matsumoto?
No, I don't.
Goodbye, Mr. Matsumoto.
Uh, excuse me...
Can I steal a match?
I forgot my lighter.
Here you are.
Thank you!
Thank you, you've saved me.
What a waste of time!
Uh, say,
can I drink these?
I'm a little thirsty, actually.
Knock yourself out.
They didn't even touch it.
I wish I had their fingerprints.
Yeah, you do.
But even if we had,
on this island, we wouldn't have gotten a quick result.
We'd have to send them to the lab, or get a team out here.
Yes.
But by the way, Takagi,
since when do you smoke?
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have any instant glue?
We're in the middle of lunch, but how about...
a quiz?
Right on!
Here we go.
It's about time.
We were wondering when you were going to do it.
In the fish kingdom near the underwater ruins,

the misdeeds of the former king having been discovered,
a new king took his place.
Question: Among these proposals,
which one was the old king?
1: a squid, 2: an octopus, or 3: a crab?
So, what is the answer?
Ah, I found it!
It's 3, a crab!
And why is that?
It used to cut with its claws the heads of its enemies !
What? That's so mean!
No but oh!
That would be very cruel!
Well, sorry...
It's the octopus!
Oh? Why?
The octopus king has kept
all the riches of the kingdom for himself!
Visualize the head of an octopus...
Are you saying that monks are usually rich?
Yes, that's it!
That's too far-fetched.
Then it's 1, the squid!
And why?
Let me answer!
This time, I'll find out.
A king in Japanese is "ou-sama".
And squid is "ika".
Ika......sama...
Ikasama... "Cheating"?
That's right, he cheated!
But... that's right!
That's not right!
Conan!
So, for the time being...
...he's the cheater!
The moon is beautiful tonight.
Yes.
If you don't mind my asking, why do you rent rooms?
It's true that fishing is enough to earn my bread.
The city council asked me to do it,
to make tourism work.
I see...
But we probably disturb the islands more than anything else.
It's nothing compared to the treasure hunters.
Since we are talking about it,
do you think there really is a treasure?
Hyenas don't go where there is no prey.
Even if their booty is not always what they hoped for.
I don't get it!
What is "the non-singing pirate"?
Think harder, Genta!
Hey, kid!
The non-singing pirate, that's your clue?
Yes, it is.
If it was the singing pirate, I'd have a place in mind.
Does the singing pirate mean anything to you?
Maybe we'll find a clue there.
We'll go there now, if you like.
What's up? At this hour?
It's already dark, wait until tomorrow.
We don't know what the weather will be like tomorrow.
You think it will be bad?
When the south wind is strong, I don't go fishing.
The sea would be too rough.
We can see that you have experience!
Well, let's all go, then.
It'll be a nice digestive walk.
Yeah!
What are you going to do, Takagi?
Well, it's a method using cyanoacrylate.
Cyanoacrylate, which is what super glue is made of,
will evaporate and react with the moisture in the print,
which will allow us to lift it.
All we have to do is wait and the print will appear on its own.
When did you learn how to do this?
I saw it in a movie a long time ago,
and I asked Mr. Tome if it was true.
It remains to be seen if it will work as well as in the movies.
Is this where we'll find our clue?
I can only say that the singing pirate is here.
Singing...
It's because of the wind, right?
It sounds like singing.
Oh yes, here.
But you could hear it just as well from the road.
I know that, thank you!
The sand has a high concentration of quartz, here.
The grains are very fine.
I got it.
Conan?
Do you have an idea?
Listen up!
It's singing sand!
I see, that's what he meant!
It's up to you to think of the rest.
We're counting on it.
Okay, now we have to find the non-singing pirate.
Is that it?
Come on! He doesn't sing, here!
This is where the pirate doesn't sing?
It's more obvious than that.
The pirate's soul goes to heaven
The next clue is: "The pirate's soul goes to heaven."
More gibberish.
He's been doing a lot of thinking, this tourism director.
I'm talking about Mr. Iwanaga.
He did say that he made the riddles himself.
It's his job after all, isn't it?
There's really nothing wrong with you.
Something wrong?
What's the matter, Conan?
This is interesting.
Conan?
Sorry, I have to be somewhere.
Go home without me!
- Wait, Conan! - He's doing it again!

He always wants to go it alone!
Conan?
Here they are!
Just send them by e-mail and we'll get the results right away!
Bravo, Takagi!
Oh, it's nothing.
Just say so if you want to transfer to the science department.
I can write you a letter of recommendation.
Not for me...
Well, send this to the station.
Yes !
What are you doing here?
I was walking around and got lost.
Which way is the Koumi House?
Over there.
Thanks, enjoy your evening!
Well, Takagi? Still no answer?
No, nothing yet.
So...
What is it?
It's the tourist office alarm!
Is something going on there?
Actually, the alarm is malfunctioning.
Let's go and see, you can't be too careful.
Where is it?
Next to the town hall.
- I'll borrow your car. - Uh, fine.
Let us know if the police station answers!
At your orders!
It's not possible, all these incidents in a row!
The answer!
So, uh...
My ancestors!
Come on, get in!
I had already specified
that I wanted a bar with a pretty barmaid!
You can't drink in peace here!
I hate tourist areas for that!
I'll teach them how to live!
Hey oh, be quiet!
Huh?
Hey, wait!
What's wrong with you?
Is this your bar run by a beautiful woman? Huh?
What, it's not so bad!
She's very beautiful when you turn off the light.
You should have said so!
- I'm busy now! - With what?
There's a thief at the tourist office!
What's up?
A thief?
Get out of the way !
What the hell!
Are you coming up or what?
I'll leave you here, otherwise!
- No, wait! - Hold on tight!
We're taking off!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! What about the bill?
Sir!
Is there a problem, ma'am?
He made out without paying!
Arrest him!
What, another incident?
The display case was broken with a bat.
That's bold.
Yes, Sato? Are you holding something?
Yes.
There were definitely gunshots, just like Conan said.
There are still traces of blood.
I got it.
Can you secure the scene?
That's going to be difficult.
Yeah, I figured.
All right, take pictures and get back here.
Roger that.
The sword and gun!
Were they valuable?
They are treasures found in the marine palace,
Anne Bonny's sword and Mary Read's pistol!
But since I'm here, we'll find them without any problems!
Your face is quite red, Mouri.
No, it's just...
I'm a little embarrassed in front of all these people.
- Kogoro Mouri! - Can you believe it?
You're under arrest!
For skimming, stealing a bicycle and driving under the influence!
I don't believe this...
- What, it's true? - Yes, it's true.
The bar manager told me
that he had been drinking on the sly before running away and stealing Mr. Iwanaga's bike!
I didn't steal it!
I had Mr. Iwanaga ride on the seat behind me! Didn't I?
Uh, yes.
Ah, before I forget, Detective,
the results of the fingerprint are in!
Tell me I'm dreaming!
Mitsushi Matsumoto.
Wanted in several countries
for stealing museum pieces, looting ruins and murder...
That's it!
So these guys are wanted by Interpol...
I knew it, they want to find the treasure of Anne and Mary!
Find it?
You mean there's more to it than the sword and gun?
Yes.
Anne Bonny and Mary Read were female pirates.
They lived 300 years ago,
and legend has it they hid their treasure on these islands.
Their treasure? For real?
Yes.
The stolen sword and pistol are the proof!
Hey, Uncle,
didn't you go to a bar with a pretty barmaid?
She wasn't a pretty bartender!
She was just a granny!
- What a phony, that guy! - I knew it.
This smell, it is indeed...
You have a stain there, uncle.
What's that? What's that thing?
It all makes sense.
What are the ways to leave the island?
There is only one boat that leaves in the afternoon,

and if not, the fishing boats.
Good.
Warn the fishermen to prevent a boat from being stolen.
Yes, sir!
Hey, what about my handcuffs? Come back here!
Say, detective...
That Mr. Matsumoto there,
I saw him giving the lady at the dive store some money.
- What? - Inspector Megure!
We're back.
Nice work.
Sorry to jump in,
but the manager of the dive store was said to have talked to Matsumoto.
Please go there.
We'll go see if he's at the hotel.
- Yes, sir! - Inspector, what about my handcuffs?
How is he doing?
The wind is a bit strong...
but it's sunny, so that should do it!
Let's try to zoom in.
The tire tracks are different.
So no, it wasn't this bike.
Conan?
Coming through!
Conan, we're eating!
Just a second!
What's the problem?
It's got a GPS on it.
A GPS? Really?
On a bike?
What the hell is Conan doing?
He said he was on his way, so be patient.
- Look, there he is. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You're out of time, I'm starving!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Oh?
Where is uncle?
He went to the town hall this morning, for a meeting of investigation.
Well here we are, we're all here !
Bon appÃ©tit!
Enjoy your meal!
- It served us well, didn't it? - Yes!
More!
By the way, when you went to the bridge,
did you run into Mr. Iwanaga?
Mr. Iwanaga?
Ah, from the tourist office?
Yes.
No, we didn't see him, did we?
I confirm.
It was us who decided to go there.
Ah well.
You do not miss anything?
No, we have everything we need.
Thank you, sir.
Are you going diving again today?
Oh no, we are too afraid since yesterday's incident.
But since we might not have much time tomorrow,
we thought we'd take a boat trip.
I don't advise you to go to sea this afternoon.
The sea will be rough.
Ah, that's what I was afraid of.
We have to find the treasure quickly, then!
Yes !
There's only one place left to find!
Are you ready to give it all up, Conan?
I've got to be somewhere,
...look for it without me!
Oh, well.
Since someone here wants to go it alone,
let's find the treasure ourselves and share it among ourselves.
I agree!
There's none on any bike...
Sir, here's the weather report!
Damn, it looks like a typhoon is coming.
Well, contact the hotels and the fishing committee.
Yes, sir.
Bummer!
Matsumoto and Izuyama weren't at the hotel.
But there's no sign that they left the island,
so I think they're hiding.
One thing is for sure,
at least one of them was shot.
So he needs treatment.
I checked the clinic, but no sign of them.
About Mabuchi, the store owner...
According to her, what Conan saw last night..,
...was Matsumoto asking her for a boat to get away.
I assure you,
I have no idea where they are hiding!
I don't make much money from the store, you know.
I just did what he asked me to do.
Finally, it's coming back to me!
I see.
As for the cartridges Takagi picked up,
they're very old.
They must have been in storage for a long time.
The Ryoyu Hunting Association agreed to look into the gun.
Please come in.
Sorry to disturb you.
I just received a call.
Apparently, Mr. Mineo's rifle from the Ryoyu Hunting Association is missing.
How about that!
Tell us about this Mr. Mineo.
Well, he's an old man..,
he is an old man who lives alone,
and his niece, Chika Mabuchi, who runs a diving store,
helps him to cover his needs.
Go and interview this Mr. Mineo without further delay!
And ask Mrs. Mabuchi to come to the station.
Yes, sir!
Retrieve the weapons that were stolen from us,
I beg you!
We'll do everything we can.
Still, it's strange that they stole them now,
knowing that we're all here.
That's right.
Usually only Mr. Uehira is on duty,
and leaving the island would have been much easier.
They were probably afraid

of being discovered if they lingered on the island.
Excuse me.
Are reinforcements coming?
The helicopters and boats are blocked because of the weather.
We'll have to do this on our own.
Whether it's finding these men,
or whoever is trying to kill them,
it's up to us to find them!
Found!
There it is!
Yippee!
- That last one was easy! - Yes!
"The soul of the pirates goes up to heaven",
it had to be the lookout!
"The symbols on the stamps are a clue.
"Come on, let's go find our treasure!"
The boss has gone to see what the sea is like.
- Wait a minute. - All right!
I'm back!
I'm sorry.
As I feared, we can't go out to sea.
The waves are too strong.
It's a shame!
There is nothing we can do about it.
We can always find a quiet place on the beach.
Hello, Mr. Uehira.
Ah, hello...
You're making a face!
Is something wrong?
Chika, can you come with me?
Inspector Megure has some questions for you.
Sir, please.
Yes ? What is it you want?
Why did those hunters
stole the pistol and sword from the tourist office?
The purpose of a treasure hunter is to find treasure.
So if they stole these weapons,
maybe we need them to find the treasure?
If so, these men
are probably looking for the treasure!
You wouldn't happen to know where it is?
Why are you asking me?
Because I think
that you were a treasure hunter.
Assuming I was a treasure hunter in the past,
what makes you think I know where the treasure is?
Well, that's what you said yesterday.
Since we're talking about it,
do you think there really is a treasure?
Hyenas do not go where there is no prey.
Even if their booty is not always what they hoped for.
"Their booty is not always what they hoped for",
you say that because you know something, right?
Come with me.
I wonder why there are blue numbers and red ones.
- Scissors. - Right? Uh, okay.
There are two problems to solve:
Why the numbers are divided by color,
and what the numbers mean.
Maybe it's an address, right? Somewhere on the island...
I know!
Let's ask Mr. Mima!
Sir!
What does the inspector want with Mrs. Mabuchi?
Is it about the investigation?
It must be a mistake.
- Get in, I'm coming. - Yes, sir!
Can you load this in?
Hey! You!
Get in, you two!
You wouldn't want your friend to get hurt, would you?
You were a treasure hunter before, sir?
Yes, in my youth.
I came to these islands in search of Anne and Mary's treasure,
but I ended up settling here.
I fell in love and got married..,
and then I became a fisherman.
This map is from 300 years ago.
Yes, that's where it came from.
It's all from this map.
The tourism director, Iwanaga,
based it on an old map like the one I have.
No one has ever been able to decipher it before.
It's a 300-year-old code.
And it was thought up by Anne Bonny.
Yes.
But then, that means
that if we solve it, we'll find a real treasure?
Yes, it does.
If it's from three centuries ago,
it can't be an address.
The most common method would be the alphabet.
- If that's it, then five... - Five...
- A, B, C, D, E... - That's E!
Seven is G!
And the twelve... A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K...
The twelfth letter is L.
It is L!
Here, we have everything.
On top are the red numbers, and on the bottom the blue ones, changed into letters.
Now we just have to put them in the right order.
Maybe it's a name.
In red the last name, and in blue the first name!
Well seen!
It must be a name related to piracy.
Yes, probably.
Look! There, that looks like a name!
"Jolly"?
Jolly?
Quick, run!
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

Ran!
You're pretty good at karate, girl!
You'll have to calm down, or your girlfriend will get it!
That's one of our boats!
How did it get there?
I asked your boss to give it to me,
in exchange for a few bucks.
No, I don't believe it!
This is the end of the line for you.
Sorry, we don't have enough oxygen.
- Kimiko! - Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Hurry and get on board!
I'm no good at this stuff.
What do you think of this?
How does that read?
Well, "Grroe" ? What about it?
Jolly Grroe?
No.
"Roger."
Jolly Roger.
Jolly Roger?
Who's that one?
Is he a famous pirate?
Literally, it would mean the "jolly Roger."
The Jolly Roger,
that's the thing 18th century sailors hated to see most.
The origin of the name could be "pretty red", which means a flag,
or Old Roger, the Devil.
- A flag? - The Devil?
Yes, the Jolly Roger is precisely what we see here:
the pirate flag!
You're too good, Conan!
You've solved the riddle.
What is it?
Three centuries ago, a sailor who passed near here on a Spanish ship
made this drawing.
But since then, this island has sunk into the depths.
It would be because of a gas, methane something.
Yorioya Island used to rise to the surface more,
but it sank after an earthquake 300 years ago,
and it looks like this today.
Yorioya Island?
Is the treasure there?
Yes, probably.
But we're missing something.
There's got to be a clue to the exact location.
What, Conan?
Can you think of anything?
The Jolly Roger on this old map...
Look at the skeleton's teeth.
They look like words!
Oh, yes!
They look like letters!
The upper teeth form "DOS",
and the bottom ones, "DIOSAS".
What does that mean?
Dos diosas.
It's Spanish, it means "two goddesses".
You rule!
This is our Haibara!
It's all we have.
We'll have to go to the island for the rest.
The treasure hunters were searching the ocean though.
So the treasure is underwater?
No, if it was, a clue would point to the ocean.
And then Poseidon, the god of the ocean, is a man.
My guess is that these guys were looking for another entrance.
The entrance of the two goddesses collapsed three centuries ago,
and an adult can no longer pass through it.
So they had found the entrance!
That explains why they took the risk of stealing the weapons
even with the police around.
The diving lady!
What happened?
Where is... Monsieur Mouri?
He must be at the town hall.
Ran and Sonoko were kidnapped.
On a boat...
By whom? Who took them away?
Matsumoto.
The treasure hunter.
They're heading for Yorioya Island!
Hurry to the town hall and tell the old man!
- It's working! - Yes, it's working!
- Be careful. - Yes, sir.
Sir.
Can you go out to sea?
I'd like you to take me to the island.
What's that?
I don't care about the treasure.
I just want to save Ran and Sonoko.
Shinichi!
Conan.
They told me about Ran and Sonoko.
Yes...
No use trying to stop you, I guess.
Wait a second, I have something to give you.
I'm going to go ahead and get the boat ready.
Okay, I'll do that.
Here, take these with you.
They're compact air tanks.
You shoot here,
and you can breathe with them for ten minutes.
Unfortunately I only have two,
so keep them as a last resort.
Thanks, Professor.
You'll share a bottle.
We've gone far enough, you don't need us anymore!
Don't dream, you'll still be working for us for a while!
Hurry up with the train!
Don't tell me that...
Sonoko!
Get to work, my pretty!
What do you want from us?
Don't worry, your turn will come soon.
What's that?
The girls were taken by Matsumoto?
Where did they go?
To the island!
Yorioya Island!

They've found where the treasure is, and they're going after it!
Get a boat ready!
We're going to rescue them.
Yes, right away!
I don't understand why they needed hostages!
They'll get in the way of looking for the treasure, right?
No, they'll be useful!
Useful in what way?
They were shot at yesterday, they are wounded.
They intend to dive back to the place
where the sharks attacked them!
What? They are going to use them as bait?
I'm afraid so.
Over there!
That was it.
What do we do now? We have to hurry!
Let's go to Yorioya Island.
What's up?
I should be able to go through the goddess entrance, right?
We're running out of time.
If I expected that!
Well done for surviving that.
Grab that torch and follow us.
You'll get lost, otherwise.
It's either that or rotting here until you die.
Come on, move!
Hey, don't push me!
Where are we?
We've been here many times before.
And today,
we're finally going to get the treasure of Anne Bonny and Mary Read!
Stay here and behave!
Go up a little and you'll see a small shrine,
with two statues of goddesses.
The entrance is just behind it.
Got it!
I'll only wait half an hour, otherwise I won't be able to leave!
Okay, thanks.
I'll bring Ran and Sonoko back, don't worry.
Anne Bonny and Mary Read, huh?
It's weird,
An adult should come by too.
An earthquake caused a landslide last week.
I see.
The earthquake must have widened the entrance.
Do you think they are...
No, they wouldn't have brought them here to kill them.
But, uh...
They were shot at last night.
Once they were underwater,
the smell of blood would have attracted the sharks.
So what?
They probably wanted to
to use them as bait.
Wait, Mr. Mouri! What the hell are you doing?
Let go of me! I'm not leaving them!
This is crazy!
The weather is only going to get worse!
I don't care, let me go!
Sorry in advance.
What are we going to do?
We'll have to go back,
I'm afraid...
Get inside, now.
This is dangerous.
But it's even more dangerous...
...for Conan, Ran and Sonoko.
- Yes, it is. - It's clear.
The water's coming up here...
It must be low tide.
- Do we have to go through here? - You got it.
It's a secret passage to the treasure.
Come on.
Grab those air tanks, let's go.
So it was true,
there were pirates here.
It looks like it, yes.
Go ahead, without the bottles.
- But... - Don't argue!
Skeletons!
You seem to be doing okay today.
I'm talking about gas.
Gas?
Depending on which way the wind blows, gas sometimes spills here.
Is that why we were out front?
You think we brought you here to look pretty?
Come on, let's move.
What the hell?
That's it, that's it!
I found it!
You poor bastard.
You deserved your fate, if you thought this branch would be enough.
Here it is...
Go open it!
Me?
I'll do it.
Ran!
That would've been too good!
It's over, give up!
Yes, that was it!
Did you get the point?
Anne and Mary were always fighting back to back.
So we have to
put them like that!
Finally! We did it!
Give me the torch!
Beautiful.
And the treasure? Where's the treasure?
It's okay, don't be in a hurry!
What do we do, Ran?
We could run away now,
...but then we'd be out in the open sea in a storm.
That's right...
We'll have to stay here and wait for help.
You're right.
A breath of air... It leads somewhere!
Damn it!
I can't find it! Where's the damn treasure?
There's not even a coin lying around!
I don't know who,
but someone got there before us and took it all away!
Hey, that's not what you told me!
I followed you because you promised me mountains of gold!
Shut up!
Forget it.
Let's just get out of here.
Yeah, right.
It's time to get rid of the unnecessary weight.
Don't blame us,

it was your destiny, that's all.
Don't come any closer!
Ran, cover my back!
Be careful, Sonoko!
You little...
Oh my...
Damn it!
This chick's too strong!
Yeah, you have to admit it.
But she may be strong,
she doesn't have a chance.
Not against this !
No chance, I still had an advantage.
Get down, girls!
It's all right,
Ran? Sonoko?
Now you're showing off, kid.
How did you find this place?
It was connected to Yorioya Island.
So the legend was right,
about the pirate treasure.
No, there was no more treasure.
They were mad that someone had found it first.
Did you hear that?
It's a shame, huh?
It's okay, show yourself now.
I know you're sneaking up on me.
Detective, can we go back now?
The wind has died down!
Mr. Mouri.
According to the weather forecast, the storm will rage on
until dawn tomorrow.
But no, look!
It's starting to calm down!
Keep your cool, Mr. Mouri.
How can I be calm?
Ran's been kidnapped!
And the only one who's going to rescue her is a kid with glasses!
While the rest of us adults sit around twiddling our thumbs!
Mouri!
I agree with your sentiment,
but there's no way we can go out in a boat in this weather!
We'll go to their rescue as soon as the wind calms down.
Take it easy.
Damn it!
It's okay, show yourself now.
I know you're sneaking up on me,
Mr. Iwanaga.
Don't say that,
you're making me out to be a bad guy!
I came to save them, that's all.
Then why do you have a gun?
Against wanted criminals, it's better to be careful.
But this gun,
isn't it the one stolen from Mr. Mineo?
No, it's not.
You wanted to prevent them from taking the treasure, admit it.
No, that's not it!
Mr. Iwanaga.
The code to your treasure map,
you did say you'd invented it?
Yes, that's right.
However,
I saw the same code at Mr. Mima's house.
On a treasure map left behind
by Anne Bonny three centuries ago.
So that means
that you had seen this map somewhere before.
Basically, since you couldn't decipher the code,
you were relying on the tourists to do it for you.
When you think about it,
it's true that he asked Dad to participate too!
It makes sense.
A great detective had a better chance of success than children.
And in order not to lose track of the participants of the treasure hunt,
you glued GPS devices to the bikes you lent out.
No, that was for your safety!
By changing the numbers on the treasure map into letters,
you get Jolly Roger,
which is a pirate flag.
Yorioya Island used to look like
a skull and crossbones in the past.
So this was a clue left by Anne Bonny.
Maybe even the name of the island, Yorioya,
is a distortion of Jolly Roger.
I think you solved this without help,
but the Jolly Roger had another meaning.
What?
The real map had a pirate flag,
a Jolly Roger, drawn on it.
The second clue was written in the teeth of the skull.
Dos diosas.
The other clue was "two goddesses."
Conan?
That's right.
You must have seen it when you followed me,
that little shrine with two goddess statues.
It was there to indicate the entrance.
Ah, I see...
How did I miss that?
Damn it... I was wrong all along!
The one who rigged the diving vest,
and shot the treasure hunters with a rifle,
it was you, wasn't it?
Behind the Grotto,
and where we found the shells,
there were tire tracks left by your ATV.
I must really suck if even a kid figured it out.
Not a child, no.
It's uncle Kogoro who understood!
I just repeated what he said.
He said that Mr. Iwanaga smelled of gunpowder!
And that it was probably
residues expelled by an old rifle.

Oh, right.
I was thinking, too.
This Kogoro Mouri lives up to his reputation.
An earthquake?
It's calmed down.
Oh no, we've got to get out of here fast!
Yeah, and we can't leave these guys.
Yeah!
- Come help me, Mr. Iwanaga! - Uh, all right!
Damn it!
Oh no, the exit is blocked!
Gas!
Quickly, onto the boat!
- Yes! - Faster!
Damn, this doesn't look good.
What are we going to do, Conan?
First, we'll lock them in a cabin,
put on the oxygen masks just in case.
They won't inhale any gas that way.
And you two, use these things.
What are these?
Air tanks invented by the professor.
What about you, Conan?
I've got one too, don't worry!
Okay.
What do I do now?
At this rate, the gas will...
Gas?
That gas must be methane,
which means it's gonna be concentrated in the ceiling!
Maybe I can use it.
Isn't there anything here I can use?
Yes, that!
Ran, Sonoko..,
listen carefully.
If the sea water is seeping in..,
then the rock must be pretty thin.
Then..,
If we destroy the ceiling with a gas explosion..,
the ship will...
What?
You don't want us to escape with the boat, do you?
Isn't that risky?
I don't know.
But at this rate, either we let the gas choke us,
or we wait until we drown.
We might as well try everything.
We have no other alternative.
Tell us what to do, Conan.
I'll make it my business
to send these pieces of chain flying to the ceiling.
That should make sparks...
that will explode the gas around it.
You two go into the cabin and breathe in the air from the bottles.
After the explosion, there probably won't be any oxygen at all.
What about you, Conan?
I'll be all right.
As soon as I hit the chain,
I'll come and join you, don't worry!
Okay, okay, okay.
- Inspector. - Yes.
Get a boat ready!
We're going to the rescue!
Yes !
We're ready, Conan!
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Conan.
Conan!
Hang on, Conan.
Ran.
Hurry up! Faster, faster!
Put your foot down!
A... pirate ship?
Ran!
Are you okay, Ran?
I'm fine!
We're saved!
Run for your lives!
Watch out!
Jump into the water!
Sonoko!
- Faster! - Yes!
So, did you find the treasure?
No.
There was only this dilapidated pirate ship.
Maybe that was the treasure.
As a matter of fact, even the map..,
even the map Anne Bonny left behind..,
it may not have been a treasure map,
but a message for Mary Read
who was still in prison.
A message?
"I'll be here!
"I'll wait for you here forever if I have to...
"Shinichi!"
Something like that!
Sonoko!
Don't act like you've got it all figured out, bug!
No, he may have a point.
In my opinion..,
Anne built this boat to go back with Mary
and sail the seas with her again,
once she'd escaped from prison,
But Mary eventually died of illness in prison,
leaving Anne alone to await Mary's return until she died.
And the ship left behind
was also waiting to set sail,
in this coffin-like cave under the water.
And three centuries later,
it finally made its first and last voyage
by bringing you to the surface.
Then it finally disappeared, like its owners.
This is not like me.
Forget what I said.
Anyway, it's been 300 years.
We'll never know if it was true or not.
We will.
Anne was waiting for Mary, no doubt about it, Uncle.
The proof: they were on the Jolly Roger of the ship!
Anne and Mary's pistol and sword.
These countless promises
When will they come true?
Will they ever come true?
I only think of leaving
And never take the first step
I give myself too many excuses
Without looking back for a second
Nor foresee the future for a second
Only in your heart do I believe here
Like the wind across the seven seas
Let's paint this blue future of our dreams
Until our hearts overflow

You are always behind me
With your warmth
The lapping of the waves hides wonders
See how the world holds mysteries
the orange melts on the horizon
But in real life, the line
between ideals and limits crumbles
Next time I won't give up
Like a bud that grows
By the sun's rays
Your smile lights me up and makes me stronger
Like the wind across the seven seas
Let's make tomorrow's red flowers bloom
Until we exhaust the oasis of our hearts
I need to feel your presence
Even if the world turns sadly
I want to live with you
Let's spread our wings now
Like the wind across the seven seas
Let's paint that blue future of our dreams
Until our hearts overflow
You are always behind me
With your warmth
I need to feel your presence
Like the wind across the seven seas
Hey!
Say, Ran...
How did you know I don't have
...an air tank?
It's because you look just like him!
It was when I was 12, I think.
It was falling down from the ropes when I got out of class.
What a bummer...
Here, take mine.
You have to get home soon, don't you?
Yes... Thank you, sir.
But what about you, Shinichi?
Stupid, I'm a detective!
I knew this would happen,
and I planned a second one!
You have?
You save me, I have something planned with my mother.
I'll borrow it, then!
- I'll return it tomorrow! - Yes, I will!
But Shinichi
didn't have another umbrella, really.
He came home all wet and caught a cold!
And you,
you had the same face as him at that moment!
The same forced smile as that idiot obsessed with investigations!
Sorry for being silly!
