We are in Minato in front of the Tohto tower.
The Tanabata festival opened its doors and many
are the visitors this evening.
I know, we meet at 4 o'clock at the teacher's house.
Genta,
you have to be on time too! See you later!
All I need is a lamp.
If I remember correctly,
there's one in one of these drawers.
Ah, here it is.
Who's that? Is that you, Ran?
It's not Uncle Kogoro because he's playing mahjong.
I must have been dreaming.
It's been a long time, Shinichi Kudo.
Or rather, Conan Edogawa.
I didn't expect you to get younger and live.
You're right, this is a real surprise, boss.
How did they find out who I am?
Conan?
I heard a loud noise,
Are you all right?
Conan?
Take a good look.
This is what happens
for those around you.
Are you all right, Conan?
Conan?
Are you in there?
I'm coming in.
Conan?
Ran!
God, what a horrible dream.
DETECTIVE CONAN THE JET-BLACK HUNTER
I'm Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug, and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
In order to find out who these thugs are, I arranged to live with Ran,
whose father is a detective.
The mysterious Men in Black organization.
Gin,
vodka,
Vermouth,
Chianti, Korn,
and then Sherry.
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
Her parents, whom she lost at a young age, were scientists of this organization.
She continued their work under the code name Sherry
and developed the famous Apotoxin 4869.
Her only sister, Akemi Miyano, having been murdered by these men,
she decided to oppose them.
Even if it means dying,
she swallowed the same drug as me...
and became younger.
To escape the organization, she changed her name to Ai Haibara
and now lives the life of an elementary school student, like me.
I found myself confronted with Vermouth
and managed to get a clue.
Stop it.
If I remove this thing,
it will be sent to my classmates.
By that I mean,
the number of your boss.
"The seven little ones?"
Yes, from what I heard, The Boss's number is related
to that children's rhyme.
Don't tell me you wrote to him?
Of course not.
I'll send a message when Takagi finds the owner of this line.
They will eliminate Officer Takagi,
as soon as he starts his search.
The same fate will befall the person who gave him the address, namely you.
If you're smart, you'd better leave it alone.
This number...
is a Pandora's box that must not be opened under any circumstances.
I've gotten younger, but my mind is still intact.
The puzzle-breaking detective.
There is always only one truth!
Beika Forest
Oh, here's one.
I found a lucanus!
Good job!
I knew it, lucanus are high up.
Come on, I'm climbing too!
No way, Genta.
You better give up.
No, I don't,
only monkeys and Conan can climb that high.
Thanks for the monkey.
Why don't you use the suspense device?
The jockstrap?
Oh, that thing you gave me at your house earlier?
That's right, I made some improvements to it.
Press the button and it stretches to 100 meters.
It stretches as long as you keep pressing it
and it shortens quickly when you press it again.
Sorry...
Be careful, damn it.
I found a lucanus!
I'm happy for you, Genta.
A rhinoceros beetle!
There!
There's two of them!
A male and a female!
How about that?

There is tape on the wings of the female.
Take a look.
You are right. How cruel!
There is something written.
Uh...
It's written open.
We often see bento closed with this scotch.
My fried chicken yesterday had one...
Fried chicken?
Are you still sneaking food?
Give it to me, I'll take it off.
Here you go.
Who could have done this?
Since there is a male and a female,
then..,
maybe they are lovers.
I'll give them names then!
Let's see...
Hikoboshi for the male and Orihime for the female !
It's well thought !
By the way, it's soon Tanabata.
Speaking about Tanabata...
That's it, I could take it off.
It's time for the long awaited quiz.
Nobody was waiting for it...
One night in Tanabata,
it rained so hard that Orihime and Hikoboshi couldn't see each other.
Bored and after a long reflection,
they created "The day spent between lovers" shortened in "Lovers' day".
Day spent between lovers
Day of lovers
and spent it together.
Which of the following is the day?
1: January 1, New Year's Day.
2: February 2, the last day of winter.
3: March 3, doll festival.
4: May 5, boys' festival.
I know, it is the 3rd of March!
Because, the dolls of the emperor and his wife are lovers!
No, it is the festival of the boys!
Because, the lovers share a passionate tango!
Me, I say the 1!
Because, they share the meal of the new year!
You have a vivid imagination.
What is the right answer?
Number 4: May 5.
You got it!
Only for the reasoning...
May 5 is Children's Day.
Children's day
If we separate the key from the kanji "child", we get the word "love",
which becomes "lovers' day".
Lovers' day
- I see. - I see it.
That's why you abbreviated "lovers' day", right?
"Lover's Day"...
It would be nice if
Hikoboshi and Orihime could stay together forever.
That said, these names aren't appropriate for beetles.
Not so much.
In fact, they're perfect.
Orihime's star is Vega.
Orihime = Vega
The scotch tape that was on the female made a sort of V, right?
You are right ! You chose well!
Yes !
You're too good, Ayumi!
How do I get down now?
What the hell?
Stop, stop!
What the hell!
Are you OK?
- Call an ambulance! - Yes, sir!
Tanabata... Kyo...
Huh?
Hey, hang on!
The ambulance will be here soon!
No no, hang on, sir!
I'm bringing you here as an exception,
so wait here quietly.
I'll do that.
Ah, look at your tie, it's not right.
Mr. Mouri!
Thank you for coming so early.
Good morning Ran, Conan.
- Good morning, Ran. - Good morning, Conan.
I hear there are serial murders.
That's right,
At the Odawara tollbooth where the crime took place the day before yesterday..,
...a mahjong tile was found.
We were able to link this crime with 5 cases involving tiles
that took place in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Shizuoka and Nagano.
I see.
You will have more details at the meeting.
Yes, sir.
Please come in.
If it isn't Mr. Mouri! It's been a while!
You're always talking so loud, Yokomizo.
Jûgo Yokomizo Nakagawa Police
Sango Yokomizo Shizuoka Police
Call me Sango, please.
Here is Jûgo, my young brother.
I know him, we often met.
Sango and Jûgo?
Shh!
Ah!
And who is this young lady?
Oh, forgive me,
she's inspector Ogino from Saitama.
I'm Ayami Ogino.  Your reputation precedes you.
Ayami Ogino Saitama Police
To think there are such beautiful young women in Saitama.
She was my subordinate when I was there.
Wait, the Saitama station?
Since the murder victim in Tokyo lived in Tokorozawa,
I was invited to the meeting.
And you, Mr. Mouri, what are you doing here?
He was assigned as a special consultant by Superintendent Matsumoto.
It's pathetic that we have to ask for help from detectives.

I agree.
Uh,
you are Detective Kansuke Yamato of Nagano.
Kansuke Yamato of Nagano Police
and you're the detective in training from Gunma.
I have a name you know, Mr. Mouri, it's Misao Yamamura.
Misao Yamamura Gunma Police
Look!
The assassination took place in Nagano prefecture,
so why Gunma, here?
Because, the crime scene is located at the border between Nagano and Gunma.
The victim's lower limbs were on the Gunma side, that's why!
All right, put it away, I got your name.
Detective?
You've become a detective?
Ah, you noticed?
I did get promoted to inspector.
You, an inspector?
Do they have all their wits about them at Gunma station?
By the way, isn't the kid with glasses with you today?
The kid with glasses?
You mean Conan?
That's right, Conan Edogawa.
My business is solved when he's around.
Come to think of it, so do mine.
So do mine.
Oh, is that right?
In fact, so do we.
You pass out at one point
and the case is already closed when we wake up.
Shit!
You pass out?
Really?
That doesn't happen to me.
Unbelievable.
What, I'm the only one?
You're the only detective I can put to sleep.
Strange...
I'd like to start the meeting.
Ah, excuse me!
Mr. Mouri? Hey, Mr. Mouri?
Huh?
Who is that inconvenient-looking guy?
Kiyonaga Matsumoto Police Superintendent
Triple buzzard!
That's Superintendent Kiyonaga Matsumoto!
What's up? With that face?
He'd tear you apart for that.
Except for the 6th case, the first 5 cases all have something in common:
the murder weapon is a large knife.
From the shape of the cuts,
we think that it is a big blow from top to bottom.
In addition, it appears that each victim was tased
and moved before being killed where their body was found.
A question then arises.
Why did the killer
move his victims when they were immobilized before murdering them?
Then, on each of the bodies of the 6 cases,
we found a mahjong tile with a red dot on the front
and a crossed-out letter on the back.
This is certainly a message from the suspect.
On each tile 7, a circle has been colored red
except for the ones at the top right and bottom left of the square
which are missing.
For the letters, there are two A's, one E, one H, one Z
as well as an upside down L.
In addition, an object that the victims always kept with them
was stolen from all of them.
A necklace, a pouch, a lucky charm...
A motorcycle key chain, a pocket mirror and a small stuffed animal.
Could they have fallen off when the victims were moved?
No, since only one object is missing from each of them,
it's logical to assume it's the work of the unsub.
The problem is the meaning of the message.
We have another message.
Mr. Ryuzaki, the 6th victim, left these words before he died:
"Tanabata, Kyo".
Maybe he saw the suspect at the rest house on Mt. Daikan
where his brake fluid was drained.
Excuse me but,
aren't you looking too far?
The tiles simply indicate the game of mahjong.
The motive for the murders is related to game stories.
The tiles 1 and 7 left indicate that there were 8 players.
Then, the two tiles that were not painted red are missing.
One of them indicates the suspect,
and the other is the last victim.
Will there be more murders?
Yes, certainly.
Then why didn't he leave the 8 tile
to indicate that there were 8 of them?
There is another meaning behind tiles 1 and 7.
In short, with only one of these two tiles, the suspect won the game.
And with a very big hand!
I get it!
But, someone beat him with a smaller hand!
That's what must have upset our suspect.
Exactly!

The others certainly had to play it as sneaky.
The suspect couldn't handle it.
So that's the motive for the murders.
So,
what do the letters mean?
Why did he move his victims before killing them?
And then,
what about Mr. Ryuzaki's posthumous message?
Well...
Well...
I'll find out...
Superintendent Matsumoto.
The locations of the murders may have special significance to the killer.
If so, finding out which one might lead us to him.
As for the victims...
All 6 of them,
all have some connection to their killer.
Finding out what they have in common
would be the fastest way to catch him.
As Mr. Mouri pointed out, that connection may be mahjong.
As for the significance of the crossed-out letters on the back of the tiles
and Mr. Ryuzaki's posthumous message, we also need to look into that.
Listen to me carefully, the chances of the killer reoffending are high.
It's our duty to prevent that from happening!
Forget all your jurisdictions and personal interests
and share any information!
We must quickly put an end to this series of murders
and put the suspect behind bars!
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!
Quickly to the toilet!
The meeting is obviously over.
Looks like it.
Ah, Mr. Matsumoto!
Hello, it's been a while. Is Sayuri okay?
Oh, young Ran Mouri.
My daughter is fine, just as she was.
Mr. Mouri,
I'm counting on you.
I, Kogoro Mouri, will do my best to meet your expectations!
Good day to you!
Hey, Mr. Chiba, you haven't become thinner by any chance?
Oh, have you noticed?
I've been on a diet recently.
It's the one on TV in the morning.
Have you lost weight?
You haven't put on weight, have you, Shiratori?
Don't joke around like that, Mr. Mouri,
I go to the gym twice a week.
It's unusual to see you drinking black coffee.
My doctor advised me to have less sugar.
You drink sugar? You didn't like it.
I've had 3 murders in a row,
if I don't get my sugar fix, I won't last.
Excuse me, Mr. Yokomizo.
- What's that? - Yes?
Sorry, I was talking to your brother.
I see.
Tell me,
is this the young Conan Edogawa you spoke of?
Yes, he is.
He may be influenced by Mr. Mouri..,
but sometimes he comes up with great clues.
He often notices interesting things that we pros haven't seen.
Oh, really?
Raven,
why are you crying?
Raven in the mountain...
Watch out!
Mr. Yamamura, that song!
Kid, you don't know this because you weren't there but...
Why did you sing that song, detective Yamamura?
Why did you do that?
I just heard it outside the bathroom.
It was the sound of keys.
When I came out,
a policeman with glasses was on the phone. Huh?
Where are you going, Conan?
No !
Don't tell me that they...
No !
There!
Conan,
what's wrong?
Damn it!
I'm going to the bathroom!
Conan?
It was right here.
It was a Porsche 356 A...
Gin's.
Why were these guys at the meeting?
What for?
What was what?
Were they at the meeting?
Shh, you're too loud!
I wonder if Haibara heard us.
No, she's in the lab in the basement.
One of those policemen was definitely Vermouth in disguise.
She must have passed on the outcome of the meeting to the boss while waiting for the elevator.
I see, that's when Inspector Yamamura heard
"the seven little ones" played by the keys while dialing the boss.
For what purpose?
You're unbelievable, I knew you were plotting.
Haibara!
Why do you think it was Vermouth?
Because of the keys?
There was Gin's Porsche.
It was too risky for them to show their faces.
If they had to disguise themselves, it's a safe bet that Vermouth did it.
In any case,
there is no doubt that they are connected with this series of murders.
I'd like to investigate these cases too.
Would you like to help me?

I don't mind but...
Even if I told you to give up, you wouldn't.
But, you have to be careful.
I don't need to remind you what will happen to you if they find out who you are.
Yes, I know that.

What is it? They didn't play mahjong?
No.
According to the information gathered, none of the 6 victims were playing mahjong.
We can see that your deductions were wrong.
We have reached a dead end.
If only Kudo were here.
When you say Kudo,
you mean this high school detective you regularly call upon?
Yes, indeed.
We don't hear much about him lately.
I guess he got tired of playing detective.
No, not at all.
Not long ago, he solved a case
at the Teitan High School Festival.
Takagi!
What was that? Ah!
I missed it.
What's the problem?
He wanted his involvement in this case to be kept secret.
I see.
He's a very modest young man, obviously.
His behavior has changed recently.
Not so long ago,
he liked to be in the limelight.
Missing two days of school will have been for nothing.
Yes,
I suppose.
What about the significance of the letters?
It's at a standstill.
The same goes for the message "Tanabata, Kyo".
You're very good, Mitsuhiko!
Is this a rhinoceros beetle?
Yes, I'm doing pretty good.
It was really cruel to stick tape on its wings!
Oh, you mean Orihime.
I wonder who did that.
You're right.
Oh?
By the way, Genta, what are you making?
A snake?
Can't you tell?
It's an eel! An an-eel!
What's that? Another eel?
You really like them.
The other time,
you also wrote it on your Tanabata talisman.
"I would like to fill my belly with eels." Genta
Now that I think about it, tomorrow is Tanabata.
Tanabata... Kyo...
What does that mean?
- A call in the middle of a meeting? - Excuse me, sir.
Yes, it's me.
Yes... Well...
So?
What?
Very good, thank you!
I have news!
The alleged murderer might show up in Beika.
What's that?
Minoru Fukase. He's 27 years old,
A year ago he allegedly stabbed Jinno Shuhei,
the victim who was found at the Usui Pass observation point.
I asked my men to keep an eye on his girlfriend
and I have just been informed
that she has left Nagano and has just arrived in Beika.
Her name is Risa Yoshii, 21 years old.
She works in a snack bar.
Why did Fukase stab that Jinno?
While he was in a line at Tropical Land,
he didn't take kindly to Jinno asking him
to stop smoking.
Tropical Land?
Ah!
Takagi?
Do you have anything?
It could be...
It could be that all the victims were waiting in the same line.
What is it?
Bring details.
I will.
Two types of tiles were found near the victims.
Jinno,
had the first type and all the others had the seventh type.
If we place the individuals on each of their respective red painted circles...
Would it be possible to imagine
that the victims were lined up like this?
I see.
What about Fukase?
Megure, take your men and go with Yamato.
Why the hell are you coming too?
I've always wanted to run across the city!
What about you, Yamato?
Come on, let's go.
Yes !
Alright, everyone in position, let's surround it as planned.
A suspect?
Or is she...
Minoru!
Fukase is here.
Stay in position and don't get spotted.
Hurry up!
The games are on the sixth floor, right?
Yes. Let's get some ice cream on the way.
I'll have a double choco-vanilla.
There are kids in front of Fukase.
Don't worry, we'll get it when the kids are gone.
Okay.
- Is it here? - No, the next one.
He's going to the 5th floor.

- The next one is the sixth. - Yes.
Good, pick it!
Yes, sir.
- Aye... - Yes, sir!
Not so fast!
What an idiot!
Freeze, Fukase, it's the police!
We have you surrounded!
Damn it!
Don't do it!
Don't come any closer!
Take one step and I'll kill her!
Damn it!
Don't move or this will end badly!
No matter what you do, you can't escape!
Shut up!
Don't come any closer!
Stay back! Ouch!
You too, get back!
All right, stand still!
It was not easy.
He lost consciousness.
But how can...
Get away...
Get away from Minoru.
Get away from him
Calm down, Risa.
Put the knife down.
No !
It won't do you any good to do that.
Throw the knife away.
No! No!
Leave Minoru alone!
That's enough, Risa.
There's no need to make it worse for yourself.
I'm sorry!
Are you alright?
Don't worry,
I'm very well padded in the stomach area.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault, I was careless.
Come on, I couldn't let detectives from other jurisdictions get hurt.
What's that?
What?
Well, what happened to the woman who was taken hostage?
Huh?
Are you sure you want to go?
Weren't you dealing with that man,
Vermouth?
I have no choice.
Whose fault is that, huh?
Anyway, I doubt he did it.
No, you don't.
Take it easy!
My right shoulder is hurt!
You hurt yourself?
That reminds me, earlier...
Stay there! Ouch!
He can't lift his right arm, so killing with a knife...
Unless he hurt himself after the murders.
That said, I'm surprised you figured me out.
Your leg.
My leg?
You have a lump on your ankle.
You're hiding a gun, aren't you?
Besides..,
he stabbed you in the left cheek with his knife,
but you're not bleeding.
I don't believe it.
I'll have to think of a mask that bleeds.
I'm sure you were taken hostage on purpose,
that you planned to use the gun after the police intervened.
And aimed to turn the tables.
I mean, even without the gun, you had plenty of time to kill him.
I didn't expect to get any praise from you.
Why is the organization sticking its nose into this series of murders?
You get right to the point, tell me.
You tell me.
NOC.
Right, NOC?
No Official Cover.
A member disguised as an anonymous person is one of the victims?
Right
Maybe it was a form of insurance,
but he always carried a memory card with the list of NOCs in the organization.
The organization was planning to get rid of him soon, but now...
Someone else killed him first.
That's right.
And whoever did it took the memory card with them,
probably not knowing what was on it.
I see.
Big deal if that data got into the hands of the police, so...
If you're here, that means there's an NOC on the case.
No it's not, one of you disguised yourself and took part!
That's why you were at the meeting!
You were making sure he was undercover!
Otherwise you would have gone on yourself!
Who is he?
Who does he look like?
Is the real one alive?
I won't say anything more.
You'll have to find out the rest for yourself.
His code name is Irish.
Irish?
That's right, a very light whiskey.
Excuse me, officer?
This child seems lost.
A lost child?
No, I just...
Good luck! Good luck with the rest.
Shit!
This is Megure. Oh, Mr. Superintendent.
I just received a call
from an artist named Sumire Shindo who thinks she knows the identity of our killer.
She lives in Hachioji.
Yes.
Well, I see.
Sato, Takagi!
Leave immediately for Hachioji.
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir.
I got it. Sumire Shindo, right?
It's risky, chief.
From here,
even if we get there first, we'll come face to face with them.
We will not cross the police.
Yes, it's me.
We're just in time!

Me on the right.
OK, I'll have the one on the left then.
Charming little one.
Lovely young lady.
What's going on?
Stay calm and pull over!
All right!
Damn, the tire's flat.
This side too.
Takagi, contact Shiratori.
Right away!
Shit, we're too late.
No need to wait.
Let's go.
What's wrong? Isn't she at home?
- Is she? - What?
She didn't just walk away?
No, there's evidence of a struggle.
We believe the suspect drove her away.
Start a search,
and get forensics in here.
Will do.
Thank you, sir.
Takagi . . .
What's wrong?
Sato?
What's up? In the police?
Yes.
His code name is Irish.
You know him?
No, never heard of him.
I see.
If we knew what he looked like, we could find him out.
Never mind.
If this Irishman was dressed as a police officer,
then he must suspect you after seeing you running when you noticed Vermouth at the meeting.
Probably, but...
Don't you get it?
The more cases you solve,
the more you prove to them that you are Shinichi Kudo!
Ai!
I know that you are worried,
but I have to solve this case.
The life of the policeman with the false identity is at stake, after all.
So far,
we know without a doubt that Irish was at the meeting.
I need to find out who he is,
find the killer before the organization does
and get the memory card he took.
That single card could help us wipe them all out.
Can we take Vermouth's word for it?
She knows that Haibara is really Sherry.
She must know about me too.
But, she didn't tell the organization.
For now, let's trust her.
Says the suspicious guy we join at a shrine.
It's Irish who is on guard.
Anyway, until this matter is settled,
it's best to avoid seeing each other outside of school.
This is just a precaution.

What do you want, Gin?
Where were you for two hours?
Apparently somewhere where you had to turn off your phone.
Do you care?
No, not really.
Just focus on the mission at hand.
While I think about it,
you're the one who killed the high school detective by administering the drug.
What are you talking about?
Shinichi Kudo.
Have you forgotten?
What's the matter?
I'm sorry I dropped your bowl.
It's nothing,
But it's surprising coming from you, Ran.
You're right, I didn't see it coming.
Ayase - Koryo Park
There's no doubt that the victim is Sumire Shindo.
Mouri Detective Agency
All right, 3:00.
See you later.
Was it Officer Takagi?
Yes.
There's another meeting at 3:00.
Anything new?
Sumire Shindo's body has apparently been found.
Where is it?
In Ayase, Kanagawa prefecture.
Was there a 7 tile?
Yes.
The circle of the square on the top right was painted
and a triangle was on the back, not a letter.
Right?
- Hey! Go to school right now! - Yes!
That's right...
Weird, indeed.
Hello.
Ah, Conan!
It's terrible, your dolphin has lost its fin!
The fin?
Ah yes, indeed.
These are glove marks.
A mysterious case is coming up!
You're exaggerating.
Someone must have broken it while sweeping.
We looked for it though.
It's okay, I'll make him another one.
You think that...
No, don't worry about it.
No doubt, it's them.
To think that we could have had a terrible accident,
it sends shivers down my spine.
Doesn't that shock you?
Doesn't it?
Two flat tires at the same time, that's impossible.
So someone tampered with them?
Snipers?
Right?
Maybe someone shot out the tires.
From that bridge.
I think there was a car.
You think?
I may be imagining things, but I think that in this case,
there are other suspicious individuals at work here besides our killer.
Suspicious individuals?

In Sumire's workshop,
a tube of paint was trampled twice.
The first one made the content come out,
the second one stepped on the dry paint.
This would mean that someone else came by
after the culprit removed Sumire.
Really, you think so?
Maybe the culprit was still there when it dried.
More than that,
this woman who was taken hostage and disappeared, intrigues me.
Maybe she was one of their accomplices
and she would have faked her capture.
What? But, with what purpose?
You think too much...
You're right, I'm getting carried away.
But, if it were true,
it would mean that a spy has infiltrated the police.
Moreover, among the participants of the meeting.
What? The mask of the black knight?
It was broken.
The drama club members are furious.
The bowl...
What about it?
Last night I broke Conan's bowl.
And today, it's Shinichi's mask.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I think you're overthinking it.
Shinichi and the brat are not related.
That's true, but...
I'll tell him anyway.
The mask of the Black Knight you were wearing was broken.
The mask of the black knight?
Bummer!
On that mask,
it's got my fingerprints on it!
Damn it!
If the fin and now the mask are their doing...
What can I do?
I have to find out quickly...
...where Ran and his father could...
The memory card!
If I can get my hands on it, I'll have an advantage.
I have to be quick.
Ah, is that a message from Shinichi?
Yes.
He asks me not to contact him because he is on a delicate matter.
That's all he said.
What kind of delicate matter?
You could have told me in person, Shinichi.
It's for the best.
What I'm curious about is the message "Tanabata, Kyo".
What does it mean... Oh?
Cicada song - Kyoto
Tanabata, Kyo?
Kyoto?
Hi Kudo, long time no see!
What did you want to ask me?
- It'll probably be at the checkpoint. - Yes, it will.
I see.
I see.
Who are you calling?
You scared me, silly!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - That was close.
I almost died.
You were surprised because you were sneaking around talking to someone.
Don't be stupid, it's Kudo.
It's about the serial murders.
He's asking me if "Tanabata Kyoto" rings a bell.
Sorry, Kudo,
- Did he say Tanabata Kyoto? - Kazuha played dumb again.
If you say Tanabata Kyoto...
Isn't it the Mitarashi festival? The one of Tenmangu!
The Tanabata of the Jiju shrine is very famous too!
Ah, why don't we go together?
If you want to go, go alone.
Did you hear her?
Yes.
But, there's nothing that appeals to me.
You're right, I don't.
I can rack my brains...
Come on, let's go!
We can go to Kyoto without having to stay in a hotel!
You're not well, no! I wouldn't have gone anyway!
Did you forget the fire two years ago?
Buzz kill!
Say, Hattori?
Yes ?
What fire?
Well, two years ago, there was a huge fire in Kyoto.
Oh, now that I think of it, it was Tanabata Day.
Tell me more.
I think it was the Vega Hotel.
And it seems to me that there were two deaths.
Do you want to know more about this fire? It's urgent!
It's working!
Wait, Heiji! What are you doing?
Classes are about to start!
Will you tell the teacher?
Tell him that I went to see Orihime, the Vega star, because it's Tanabata.
What did you say ?
Wait, who is Orihime?
A fire?
Do the red circles and letters on the tiles mean fire?
Beika's library
Cause of fire: a customer's cigarette on the 4th floor.
Fire escape, out of order...
A customer on the 5th floor died from smoke inhalation.
Nanako Honjou, from Jindai district, in Mitaka.
Ko-suke Mizutani Nanako Honjou
Mr. Mizutani?
Mr. Mizutani?
He is not here at the moment.
Do you know where he went?
Oh, you're the assistant of the famous detective Mouri?
My name is Shun Sawamura.

I'm in the legal department of Jônan.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you, sir.
Please don't tell anyone.
The investigation is kept secret apparently.
That's why he sent you.
What was the relationship between Koosuke Mizutani and Nanako Honjou?
They were dating.
They ran away from Chiba because their parents were against it.
An elopement?
In Tanabata 2 years ago,
they went to Kyoto and stayed in this hotel.
Only, he went to see a friend who lived in Kyoto.
That day, the hotel caught fire.
"If I hadn't gone to see my friend, Nana wouldn't have died."
He blamed himself and cried.
What does he work at?
He didn't have a steady job,
but since his girlfriend left, he's been letting himself go.
He hasn't been home for a while.
Where could he be right now?
I don't know.
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe he is in Chiba.
It's the anniversary of his death.
Will he be at the temple?
Probably.
If we ask Nanako's brother, we'll find out.
Wait a moment.
He came to see her several times before she passed away
He told me to contact him if his sister was in trouble.
Oh, I've got it!
His business card and this is a picture of Mizutani.
Can I take the number?
Please do.
Can I have yours too?
Sure.
Hello, yes, Hattori?
Hey Kudo. I won the jackpot!
The names of the victims you gave me
match the customers on the 5th floor when the fire broke out.
And there were two other people.
Nanako Honjou and Koosuke Mizutani.
Did you know that already?
How about this?
Apparently, this Ko-suke came to investigate the same thing last year.
Apparently, this murder case has a link with the fire of two years ago.
Even so, how?
Let's say Mizutani is the killer, he has no motive.
Honjou's death was an accident.
Hattori?
How many elevators does this hotel have?
Elevators?
Only one, I think.
What about its capacity?
Just a minute!
It's designed for 7 people maximum.
What does that have to do with it, Kudo?
Wait, I'll come down!
I understand everything.
Yes, on the day of the fire, Nanako Honjou was certainly...
Pushed out of the elevator,
by the 8th customer who did everything to get a seat.
This person, symbolized by tile 1, is Jinno.
6 of the 7 circles represent the position of the other people present.
The last one represents the position of Nanako.
Most certainly.
The shape of the tile reminds of an elevator,
and the bar on the back indicates the closed doors.
No doubt about it!
Jinno was the last to enter, the alarm went off
and he forced someone out.
And it fell on Nanako.
The others must have had their heads in the sand,
or helped Jinno, for fear of being thrown out.
Because they couldn't get on the elevator, Nanako couldn't get out in time.
What? Are my deductions wrong?
No, I was wondering about the meaning of the letters.
Indeed, it's strange to see a triangle instead of a letter on the 7th tile found.
Anyway, if the missing tile is indeed Nanako,
the murders should stop.
Let's hope so.
Anyway, I'll go look for Mizutani.
Thank you, Hattori.
I mean it.
Kudo.
By the way, I found a great okonomiyaki restaurant.
We'll go there next time you come.
Oh... Okay, then.
You promise me.
I'll be waiting for you.
I got it.
See you.
Kudo...
You'd better...
What's that? July 7, two years ago?
All the victims were in Kyoto?
That's what the neighborhood survey said.
In that case...
The message that the witness reported...
Referred to "Tanabata Kyoto".
At the moment,
we are investigating what happened on that day in Kyoto.
The problem is,
is the message of the culprit behind these tiles.
It is still missing
the tile with the red circle at the bottom left.
A new murder is certainly to be expected.
Also,
it's no coincidence that today is July 7.
So today, the last victim will...

Where and who will be involved?
It could be that
that one of them...
Ah!
I have found it!
The places where each body was found, form an animal pattern!
An animal?
Look closely!
If we connect
each place
in this way...
Oh!
Now do you see?
This long line is the neck.
This is the torso and this is the front legs.
The back and finally the back legs.
In short, it is not the monster of Loch Ness,
but Ashy, the monster of the lake Ashino!
Couak couak !
Ashy?
Does this thing exist?
No, I've never heard of it.
I don't know either.
And if I do that, is it clearer?
Now that you mention it...
I can see Ashy very well!
But why Ashy?
There is also Yashy from the lake Yamanaka.
Take a look at the shape of the lakes.
The one of Yamanaka is a whale.
And the one of Ashino?
I got it, Mr. Mouri!
The location of the next murder will be at the level of his nose!
How naive, Yokomizo.
That's what you'd think...
In reality, it's here!
But yes, the eye! Annaka in Gunma Prefecture!
I know the area very well!
I'm going to the place, guide me!
Good!
Me too!
What are you doing?
Forget it.
They won't be enough for that killer!
Sure they will.
That was fun.
Yes.
Too bad Conan didn't show up.
Say, don't you think he's been acting funny lately?
He came home alone again today.
Maybe his cold hasn't gone away yet.
He didn't come to class for two days.
Ah, the bus is here!
A beetle!
This bus is coming from the Beika forest.
I see.
It must have landed on the gentleman when he was walking around and stayed on him.
Again the same scotch!
Again?
Others have been brutalized. Poor things.
I can't do it, it's stuck on tight.
Let's ask the teacher to remove it.
While we're at it,
let's ask him for a snack.
Kazuki?
There was only one anonymous bouquet of flowers today.
Yes, there was.
Hello.
Are you really detective Mouri's assistant?
Yes.
I'm looking for Mr. Mizutani about a case,
but he wasn't at the ceremony.
No, he came by early this morning to drop off some flowers, then he left.
Just flowers?
Yes.
My parents are still angry at him for running away with my sister.
And then...
Are the flowers that your mother was talking about from him?
If there was only one today,
does that mean that there were others?
Yes, from other people.
When? And do you know from where?
Yes, I do know.
Let's see...
4 bouquets 2 years ago, sent from Matsumoto, Kawasaki,
Numazu and Kamakura.
3 bouquets last year.
This time from Tokorozawa, Odawara and Hachioji.
The address of the 7 victims of the case.
In fact, when I met Koosuke this morning,
he said something strange.
What was that?
"There are 8 unforgivable people."
"There is only one left."
Well...
It was the same person who did this.
The scotch was forming a V again.
I know! Maybe it's a message.
- Huh? - A message?
Do you know what he wanted to tell us?
Well, I...
The answer is: Help! Help !
- Oh... - How do you know?
In English, beetle is called "beetle".
Since the shape of my car is reminiscent of the insect, it is called Beetle.
Another thing that was named after the same "beat" sound...
the very famous Beatles!
The Beatles?
Their first album was called "Please Please Me".
Their second "With the Beatles".
Their third "A Hard Day's Night".
The fourth "Beatles for Sale".
And their fifth "Help !" !
So, do you understand ?
What is the Beatles?
A foreign band, obviously.
You don't know them?
- Don't know them. - No, I haven't.
My sister used to listen to them once in a while.
She liked old music.
Old music?
I would have preferred a snack instead of a quiz.
If that's the word "help," it means someone needs help.
I guess so.

It's up to the Junior Detectives!
- Yes! - Huh?
I understood the meaning behind "Tanabata, Kyoto".
All 7 of them were in the hotel?
The person who died in the fire was a woman: Nanako Honjou.
Apparently, her boyfriend, Koosuke Mizutani, came to investigate the fire last year.
And 2 hours ago, Heiji Hattori came by for the same reason.
Indeed, I was intrigued by the case.
I'll tell you one good thing, detective,
the tiles represent an elevator.
An elevator?
There were 9 guests on the 5th floor of the hotel.
Excluding Nanako who died and Ko-suke himself,
the 7 others are all dead.
Who is the last person?
- Oh, I know. - What's that?
It's to wash your hands.
Indeed, what knowledge!
But, I don't know how to do it.
You don't?
I'll show you, watch.
What is it?
The position of the stars?
Yes.
The locations of the seven murders point to the position of the stars
Polaris and the Big Dipper.
Wait a second.
Indeed, it's more than just a resemblance,
by overlaying an image of the stars, it's almost identical.
This killer is really picky.
It's the same with the letters on the tiles,
they all point to the same stars.
Tiles 1 and 7 for the shape of the Polar and Big Dipper stars.
The letters are the Greek ones given to each.
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta.
Tell me, Haibara?
The position of the star Merak in the Big Dipper.
I'll give it to you.
Thank you, sir.
Here it is.
Shiba Park in Minato district.
Beika Forest Whoever sent the distress call must be in these woods.
We must help him!
Yes !
Junior Detectives...
- Let's go! - Let's go!
If this is about Mizutani and Nanako,
a kid with glasses came in two hours ago.
- What about him? - Huh?
A kid with glasses?
Yes, he said he was Detective Mouri's assistant.
Is that what Mr. Mizutani said?
"There are 8 unforgivable people."
"There's only one left."
Yes.
What's wrong?
Did Mizutani...
No, not really.
What's the matter?
Is he going to kill another person?
Yes, he certainly is.
Apparently, Conan got here before us.
Conan?
No,
I would never ask a kid to do something like that.
Who was it then?
Maybe Kudo!
Sir, is Koosuke Mizutani our culprit?
Indeed, there is a great chance.
But, who is this last person?
And where is he planning to kill him?
Nana...
Ko-suke!
Damn!
I still try!
I can't wait!
It's the first time we're going on a trip!
Koosuke!
Nana! Nana!
Let me go, Nana's inside!
Nana! Nana!
Nana...
Okay.
I may have an idea, I'll look for it.
Good evening.
He's not back yet either?
It's already 7pm. Where can those three be?
They don't pick up their badges when I call them.
Professor, they are probably...
Hello?
Ah, Mr. Sawamura?
Yes ?
What is it? What did Mizutani and Nanako like?
It wouldn't be looking at the stars, would it?
That's right.
They came to live here because they were near the observatory.
I knew that.
Both of them liked the Pole Star and the Big Dipper very much.
The magnificent shape of the Big Dipper
and the brightness of the North Star in the far north.
I think they were affirming their love for each other by observing these stars.
I doubt that a child of your age
could understand.
Thank you.
The best stargazing spot near here...
Good evening!
I am currently at Tohto Tower where the Tanabata festival is in full swing!
The weather is overcast for this last day of Tanabata Fair.
But, festival-goers in yukata
are still coming in.
Here is the weather forecast for tonight.
It will start to rain in the Tokyo area, around 10 pm.
Thunderstorms are expected.
Miss?
What's the matter, kid?
Could you hold this for me?
Can you?
Sure, but are you alone?

My dad and brother went ahead while I was in the bathroom.
That's not nice.
Your yukata is very nice, Fukami.
Yours too, Moeri.
Why don't the four of us take a picture?
We'll take lots of them!
Let's do it!
Cheese!
Have we been here before?
Yes.
We went the wrong way, didn't we?
I'm so hungry, let's go back...
No, we must find it!
Exactly!
Don't you want to solve a case without Conan for once?
Yes, I do.
But we can't find the Japanese oak.
I know we can't!
He'll show us the way!
The beetle usually goes to trees
that produce the same sap.
That way!
What's that?
Do we have to run?
We know the identity of the culprit
and we know that he intends to make a new victim.
However, we don't know where he is or where he plans to do it.
Does anyone have any idea?
Damn it! While we're here...
Someone might be getting killed.
We're in! It's the oak tree!
What's this?
There's another one!
Maybe it has tape on its wings too.
I'm almost there!
It has tape stuck on it.
It must be there.
The person who needs help must be here.
Yes.
It looks spooky.
Yes, it does look haunted.
Don't say that.
Oh, the stars are really beautiful from here.
There's the North Star and over there is the Big Dipper, right?
Yes.
See? That shape...
Where have I seen it before...
What?
The North Star and the Big Dipper?
You say that the position of the stars
indicate that of the murders?
Without a doubt!
Oh, it's you again?
Yes.
You say the couple's hobby
was stargazing?
Thank you, Mr. Matsumoto.
Mr. Matsumoto,
the location of the missing star is in Shiba Park.
Yes, sir.
Megure, put out an APB on Koosuke Mizutani!
Everyone else, to the park without further delay!
- I understand. - Yes, we hear you!
- Damn it... - Damn it...
Don't scare us like that.
Is that all you have to say?
You shouldn't be running around here at this hour.
We weren't fooling around.
We're here to help someone.
To the person who sent the SOS.
We're going home, your parents are worried sick...
- It's too soon. - Is it?
We can go home after we answer the message, right?
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you.
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.
I will answer.
Thanks, here.
Takagi's phone, go ahead.
Oh, it's you teacher.
He's got his hands full.
You must be busy, but please listen to me.
It's a rather strange story.
The Beatles?
You think...
All right, we'll be right over.
Hide with the children in a safe place.
Head for the Beika forest.
I will, but...
It's okay, I'll take full responsibility.
I understand, but I take responsibility for it too.
- Huh? - Where are they going?
I don't know!
To the left?
Yes.
Was Conan on TV?
I saw him enter the Tohto tower alone.
Around 8 pm, I think.
I see.
Don't worry, he'll probably be back soon.
But, I can't reach him.
Without result, none of them picks up.
Never mind, let's leave them out.
Well, let's leave them alone,
Mizutani should be around here somewhere.
Spread out and apprehend him!
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!
You can't see them with the clouds.
Can't you?
The North Star and the Big Dipper
that you and Nanako loved so much.
Little...
Oh, that person?
Did you see him?
Yes.
I remember because he insisted on closing time.
I think he went up to the observatory alone at about 7:00.
Oh, so you're Detective Mouri's assistant?
Sort of.
It's a shame, isn't it?
Being so close to the sky and not being able to see the stars.
No, I can see them.
No matter where I am,
I always see them.
The observatory?
Yes !
She identified it formally.
Did you see him leave?
No, I didn't see it.

Good,
the suspect is probably still at the observatory.
He must have called his victim and is about to act out.
We're going to go in, grab the killer and get the victim to safety.
The suspect is most likely armed, so be careful.
Leave the lights on, please.
All right.
Let's go !
-Yes! - Yes!
Say, Mr. Mizutani?
You're planning to die after that glass of wine, right?
"There are 8 unforgivable people."
"There's only one left."
That last person...
It's you, isn't it?
What?
I can only imagine the surprise and anger
you must have felt when you heard how she died.
So you went back to that hotel and investigated the seven individuals.
You are absolutely right.
If only that day I had not gone to my friend,
Nana wouldn't have died.
When I think about it, it's impossible for me to forgive myself.
Suicide is not the answer!
- People will think that you are the one who... - I know that!
I know that, but...
I can't stand living in a world where she's gone!
In any case,
I'll get the death penalty.
You won't go to prison!
After all, you didn't commit any murder.
Someone offered to kill those seven people in exchange for what,
you had to take the blame and die to atone for your sins, right?
You felt responsible for Nanako's death,
you didn't object.
But you know,
the person that this individual hates and wants to see dead at all costs,
is you, Mr. Mizutani.
Because,
you're the one who took away his beloved little sister.
Didn't you?
Mr. Nanako's older brother,
Kazuki Honjou?
What are you doing here, brother-in-law?
Don't you dare call me that!
What's that?
Hey, kid?
How did you know it was me?
No matter how hard I thought, I couldn't figure it out.
If Mr. Mizutani was the culprit,
why did he use the position of the stars
to indicate the location of the murders?
Because by doing so, he would have soiled his precious stars.
I wondered if this was not the work of a third party
trying to pin the blame on this star lover.
When I realized this, I understood.
Moreover, the culprit has perfectly reproduced the position of the stars
To stick to the map so well, he must have been very meticulous.
However, on Mr. Mizutani's front door
the sign was slanted and the writing was not very careful.
In comparison, the number on your business card was
well written and straight thanks to the lines you drew with a fine pencil.
Even in your memo,
the names and addresses of the senders were perfectly noted.
All of this is evidence of a lot of thoroughness.
Who the hell are you?
Conan Edogawa, detective.
Thank you for coming.
Mr. Agasa, where are the other children?
Their parents have come for them.
I'll take you there.
Thank you, sir.
Wait in the car, Ai.
You have informed Mr. Mizutani about the circumstances of Nanako's death, right?
Yes.
He told me that Sumire Shindo, a painter,
had stayed on the same floor of their hotel.
Sumire Shindo Exhibition
I wanted to talk to her so I went to her exhibition.
There, I stumbled upon a conversation
she was having with Ryuzaki.
You told it to Mr. Mizutani and included some lies.
On the first anniversary of her death,
all the guests who stayed on the 5th floor sent flowers.
If one or two had done so, it would have seemed like a case of conscience.
But let them all do it,
it can only be a show of appreciation.
They thanked her for sacrificing herself for them.
So she would not have been thrown away but would have gone down of her own accord?
It is true, Nanako was a girl who had a heart on her hand.
Even if she chose to go down,
she still died because of them!
Mr. Mizutani?
In the end, Nanako did die sacrificing herself for these 7 people.
But, although sacrifice too,

the one asked by Mr. Honjou to endorse his crimes and to commit suicide,
there is a huge gap!
As gigantic as the one that separates the stars of the sky from the stones of the earth.
Nana...
- I give up. - What?
I'm sorry, but I give up death.
That kid opened my eyes.
Mizutani!
I'm sure that from where she is,
Nana wouldn't want
to see me die like this.
I'll give this back to you.
I don't need it anymore.
Turn yourself in to the police, brother-in-law.
Damn it!
Mr. Honjou,
these are the items taken from the victims, right?
"That will be the proof of your guilt."
That's what you told him, right?
It's a good thing I came...
When I heard Mr. Mouri was investigating,
I rushed over for fear of being found out.
I lied to you because I hoped you would avenge his death.
But you didn't have the courage.
So I did!
That's not courage, that's self-satisfaction!
Shut your mouth!
I don't see Mr. Mouri, which means you're alone!
You'll pay for this!
Just in time!
Superintendent Matsumoto.
What is it? The police?
You're not hurt?
Uh... no.
I'll take you to the station.
Shit!
You bastard!
You can't fool me!
I knew you wouldn't...
You're Irish, aren't you?
- Police! - Don't move!
I knew it! Superintendent!
Superintendent?
Hold on!
What is the superintendent doing here?
The other one is an impostor!
He took his place!
Huh?
He's from the Beatles' generation, but I never thought it could be Nui...
Contact Megure !
Right!
It's me, what's going on?
He's been found out. They know he's an impostor.
I understand.
Vermouth!
What's up? So he did come here?
Yes.
He left his skateboard,
and I thought it was strange that he didn't come back for it.
You think he's still on it?
It's not possible.
It would be dramatic, he would run into the killer.
A killer?
The police are investigating.
Sonoko, stay here!
Wait, Ran!
Come back here!
What did you do with the superintendent?
Did you...?
No, he's still alive.
He's got to play the role of killer for me, after all.
Is this the card with the list of NOCs in the organization?
Yes, if you will.
When did you know I was an impostor?
I already had a vague intuition...
So that Vermouth,
the queen of disguise would give up her seat,
is that the difference in size was too great.
According to this hypothesis, you were the best placed.
I see.
Well done, Shinichi Kudo.
Before this fingerprint comparison, I was quite skeptical.
Have you reported it to your boss?
No, not yet.
I haven't told anyone yet.
Not even Gin?
No.
Shinichi Kudo. Have you forgotten?
I can't remember the names of all the people I killed.
So what's wrong with him?
No, nothing.
Concentrate on your mission.
Why should I?
A long time ago,
in addition to killing a member who had blundered,
he left the body to burn in the flames
of the Haido City Hotel's inferno.
I considered the member he executed as a real father.
Haido City Hotel?
Pisco?
You seem to know a lot about us.
He made the mistake of his life
when he almost killed Shinichi Kudo and found out your identity.
I will take you to him myself...
To witness the fall of this cold-blooded bastard.
He's the only one who knows my identity.
I just have to beat him.
But, I don't have any darts left.
I still have...
Don't worry, I won't kill you,
just render you unconscious.
If I don't get you back to this person alive,
she will never believe that you are Shinichi Kudo.
What the...
Officer Chiba?
Officer Chiba, are you all right?
He just passed out.
Everyone else did, too.
Conan!
Hold it!
Hold it right there!
Conan!
What happened to you, Conan?
Ran...
- Are you okay? - Everyone's okay?
Superintendent Matsumoto!

It's bad, all the cops downstairs are...
They were attacked by the suspect.
What's the matter?
Don't just stand there... run away...
What's the matter?
Go away... this guy isn't...
You are not Superintendent Matsumoto.
Don't do that!
It's okay.
I can't dodge bullets from a rifle,
But a gun...
Hey Ran, did you know that?
The speed of a rifle bullet is about 1000m/s.
A revolver bullet is almost three times slower.
Their speed is only 350m/s.
What are you laughing at?
You think you can dodge the bullet?
Precisely.
That's interesting. Try it for size.
That's impressive.
You're doing pretty good.
I had forgotten that you were
A karate champion!
Ran!
You gave me a hard time.
Ran, stay down!
I'll take it from here, you stay still!
Damn it!
Run, run!
Keep me entertained!
Shit!
Almost, that was close.
What? Is it over already?
Now that's what I like to see.
Let's end this wolf game, shall we?
The wheel has turned.
Damn it!
Give me the memory card!
There they are.
The wheel turns, right?
Hello.
What's up?
Did you get the memory card back?
Yes.
I can't see it well,
move it forward a little more.
That's it, a little more.
Go for it!
Bingo!
I wanted to shoot too.
Boss!
Look down.
What's up?
But it's...
He can't run anymore.
Nice work, Irish.
There's somebody else!
Hey, hold on, get up!
It's all right, the vitals are unaffected.
Let's get you out of here
and get you some medical attention!
Now I understand...
why Vermouth has fallen under your spell.
Don't talk!
Be ready, because once you're cured, I'll get the identity of your boss from you!
Irish?
Shinichi Kudo...
don't stop chasing them.
Irish!
Irish has played the shields!
It's hard to land now, so go for the big one.
Got it.
Damn it!
Oh no, Ran's under it!
There he goes! Keep going!
What do we do, boss?
Chianti, gas him!
OKAY!
Shit! What do we do now?
Tear gas?
It moved.
Let's get him back to the top.
He's like a rat!
Let's get on top and shoot!
We won't have a blind spot!
Got it!
Damn it!
What do we do? I'll be trapped!
What the hell to do!
Show us your face.
He jumped!
He knew he was a goner!
Come on, let's go!
We're hit!
What the hell is going on?
I can't control it anymore!
Drop and pick up!
Got it!
Who was that?
Who was that guy?
Very nice work, Silver Bullet, you've got it going on.
It suddenly exploded!
I really sucked at that one...
No one is seriously hurt.
I apologize!
Alright Ran,
We'll go over the details later, if you don't mind.
Will you help us?
Of course I will.
Wait here, I'll get a car to take you home.
That's nice, thank you.
Are you sure you're all right?
Yes.
Here, why don't I get you a drink?
No, don't bother.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Ran.
Everything's fine now, Shinichi said the case is closed.
Right, where is he?
Ah... well...
He had another case...
What's the matter? He left without saying anything again?
Yes, and also...
He doesn't want us to know he was there, right?
Ah, and he's allowing you to contact him again.
He allows me?
Ah... uh...
Maybe he said it more politely...
I'll settle for having heard his voice.
After all,
others don't have the chance to talk to each other and only see each other once a year.
Yeah, alive and nobody knows me
I like to see your eyes chase in the highway speed
Can't touch me now, run. lt's my soul Rewind!
I left the room again last night.
The television left alone doesn't laugh at anything anymore.
It's nobody's fault,
I look away as if I am fine without you.
On the background of the laptop I dropped again

our two laughing faces are displayed.
The address with our exchanged first names that connects our two hearts,
I can't bring myself to erase it.
We have always done our best to move forward,
but our hearts are unfinished puzzles.
You were always by my side as if it was a given.
That's all that mattered.
I would like to find the very last missing piece
Of this real puzzle.
I may not beat the night, but I want to keep believing
The light from the tower that shines on me seems to keep my tears from flowing as I look out into the night.
I left the room again last night.
Your message marked as read at over 2am.
Your words left on the answering machine
Can't be changed anymore.
I want to be alone, but I don't like being alone.
I'm too used to there being two of us.
Why couldn't I say it, why did I hesitate
to say that I loved you to death?
I saw through your interlocking lies,
I won't let myself get caught up in them like in a puzzle.
If you are determined to break these sweet feelings,
I'll dry the tears I've been shedding behind closed doors.
It's a real puzzle.
Relax girl you're rollin' with a star
Big rims when you're ridin' in my car
Tell your boyfriend he ain't gotta call
Can't reach ya' cause we way too far
Miss smile way too fly, took the day off
No problems girl, I get it paid, oh
65 with the fly ultra frenzy
Does anyone kiss, does anyone dance?
I'd like to find what I wished for the distant star deep in my heart.
Surely you are not the missing piece to my inner emptiness.
Those incessant kisses, those fingers caressing my hair
and the strength of your embrace are unfinished puzzles.
I turned toward your voice without being caught.
Can I finally be honest? Can I be honest? Give it a whirl!
It's a real puzzle.
When the lights glow we shine like a Hollywood night show
Benz on rims ride with nitro tell your boyfriend you gonna live life, so, hey!
No body was found in the wreckage of the helicopter.
No.
They must have left the aircraft before the explosion.
Finally, we still don't know the identity of Irish.
I don't suppose the police have anything on him.
And I can't tell them anything either.
And to think they kept him in a place like this for 10 days...
The superintendent apparently did not see the face of his kidnapper.
In any case, it's thanks to these three that he could be rescued.
Yes.
Fortunately, because Irish died before he could reveal this place.
Irish...
Shinichi Kudo...
don't stop chasing them.
You bet!
Until they all fall!
