Another one who double-crosses us!
You could have rented a better car...
Yes, really.
We should have taken the train.
- Yes, we should have. - Sure!
Shut up!
It's because the client asked me to take you
that I had to rent one big enough for all of you!
Five more seconds.
If you don't turn the wheel,
we'll hit the wall in five seconds.
What?
So good!
It looks like a castle!
Do you think there's a king in there?
You're an idiot.
Of course not, it's a hotel I remind you.
That said, it's right across from Miracle Land.
We're bound to find some pretentious rich people
who think they are kings after a long stay in the park.
Besides, this hotel
will apparently soon have reached 100,000 residents!
Business is good for them.
It looks like it, yes.
Excuse me, sir.
Are you Detective Mouri?
Uh, yes.
We've been expecting you.
I'm your client's secretary.
My name is Takada.
If you'll follow me...
Go park their car.
Yes.
Come in, this way.
- Wow! - So cool!
You can see the whole park from here!
Ah, sorry!
Could you please wait and sit down?
Come on, don't make a fuss and sit down!
- Alright, alright... - Pff!
Well, this won't take long.
Wow, this is all very strange!
What's wrong, Conan?
These chairs don't quite match the room.
Yeah, they do.
Maybe they had more budget!
Don't be ridiculous!
This is a luxury hotel!
Thank you for waiting.
This is the reason
why the kids had to come too.
What's this?
These are free passes to Miracle Land.
While you're investigating,
the little ones can have fun in Miracle Land, like this.
Does the client own the hotel or something?
Oh, no.
He just rents this suite year-round.
Well, that alone...
Well, put them on your wrists, please.
Tighten them so you don't lose them.
If you lose them, there won't be any more.
You too, Mr. Mouri.
Oh no, it's okay, I'm not going to the park.
Come on, don't say that.
If you finish faster,
you can have fun with the children.
If you insist...
This pass is good for the whole day,
until 10:00 p.m., when the park closes.
The cost of meals and drinks is included,
so go ahead and enjoy!
Great!
Thank you so much!
Shall we go, Conan?
Yes.
You'll have to stay.
My apologies.
Why?
Did he win a prize for being the 100,000th customer?
Yeah, something like that.
- For real? - Lucky...
Well, let's go ahead and get in line.
I hear there's a 2-hour line for the Super Snake.
Yeah, let's do that.
See you later then, Conan.
What do you think he won?
Not a bowl of eel rice, that's for sure!
Well, you're in luck!
The 100,000th customer,
that deserves a great prize!
It's not to be disturbed.
Disturbed?
I'm not the 100,000th customer, am I?
I saw confetti on the floor at the entrance to the hotel.
Oh, did you?
Yes, I did.
That title goes to a guest who arrived about an hour ago.
So why did you want him to stay?
Client's orders.
What?
Hey, what are you doing?
Explain yourself!
Thank you for coming.
It was me who hired you.
Please forgive my rudeness, there is a reason for me to hide my face.
I made you come
to solve a certain case.
What kind of case?
Understanding it is also part of your job.
I will give you several clues.
Use them to deduce and solve the case.
But...
why me in particular?
You're the fifth detective I've hired.
What about the first four?
One of them is still investigating,
I fired two of them,
and the last one didn't make it
and is here.
Ryu!
Do you know him?
He's a detective I've worked with before.
I gave you my investigation report!

How long are you going to keep me locked up here?
Get me out of here!
Detective Ryu.
You didn't solve the case.
What's that?
An incompetent detective doesn't deserve to live.
What's going on?
- That's the same bracelet we have. - Yes, it is.
What the hell...
What's all this about?
Don't worry, you won't suffer.
It'll be over in no time.
Don't tell me...
If Mogi and Soda are missing, it's...
Goodbye, Detective Ryu.
Hey, wait... Wait, please!
Damn it!
Composition C-4.
This is a type of plastic explosive.
The Miracle Land pass that Detective Ryu was carrying contained it.
Hey! The ones he was talking about, Mogi and Soda, are they...
Yes.
They're both known for their detective skills.
They too were fools who wasted my precious time.
You have until 10:00 tonight to solve the case.
Find out the truth about a certain incident by then.
If you don't get there in time,
your passwords will also explode
and you'll end up like Detective Ryu.
What?
I wouldn't recommend it.
These bracelets won't come off so easily,
and even if you manage to remove them by yourself,
they would explode immediately.
You bastard!
Ran.
That's right.
What about Ran and the kids?
The passes they wear...
Their passes are more or less the same as yours.
More or less?
More or less?
Their passes have an extra function.
This is a map of Miracle Land.
There are sensors all around the park.
When they enter the area,
the sensors react and activate their bombs.
If they try to leave the park and pass the sensors again,
the bombs will explode immediately.
It would be complicated to monitor them individually,
so I set this up.
Ran!
Haibara!
Can you hear me, Haibara?
Damn it!
Haibara!
Haibara!
What the hell?!
Haibara! Don't go into the park!
What's wrong with you?
Stop the others!
Don't go in there!
It's just that...
we're all already inside.
- Oh, you're VIPs? - What?
These passes are only given to a few people!
They are?
Enjoy the park!
Thank you!
Is there a problem?
I'll call you back.
Ran?
Damn it!
If you can solve the case by 10 p.m...
and find the real culprit..,
I'll pay you any amount you want.
However..,
if you don't solve it in the time allotted, your passwords will explode.
Take me to this guy, now!
I can't do that.
I don't even know where he is.
What?
Mr. Mouri.
I will be monitoring your every move.
Your bracelets are GPS-enabled.
You don't have to go to the police.
Or you'll blow us up, right?
You bastard!
We've wasted enough time talking.
This is the first clue.
I'll only say it once, so listen carefully
T, A, K, A, 3 minus 8.
What is this gibberish? Say it again!
I said I wouldn't repeat myself.
Only 12 hours to go before the time runs out.
So, are you going to solve this mystery?
For my sake,
and the children, of course.
For God's sake...
Mr. Mouri.
Here you are.
It's a direct line to the client.
That said,
you cannot contact him,
but only receive his orders.
If you solve the case,
call me at the number registered on this phone,
and come back here.
I will listen carefully to your deductions.
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE DETECTIVE'S REQUIEM
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug, and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On the advice of Professor Agasa, I decided to hide my identity,

and when Ran asked me my name, I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
To find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
The only people who know my identity
are Professor Agasa, my parents,
Heiji Hattori, the high school detective from the west,
and my classmate, Ai Haibara.
The teacher has been helping me since I got younger
by creating a lot of inventions.
Haibara used to work with the Men in Black,
but to escape from the organization,
she took the same drug I did...
and got younger too.
There's another person.
Kaito Kid!
Things are never quiet when he gets involved.
My body got younger, but not my mind!
I'll solve all the mysteries!
There is always only one truth!
Are they serious with their traffic jams?
My daughter's life is at stake!
- Get moving! - Listen,
don't go out of Miracle Land!
If you leave the area, your passes will explode!
Of course, avoid the Super Snake too!
This roller coaster
follows a path that leads out of the park into the ocean!
Hey, are you listening, Haibara?
Yeah, I got it.
If you don't solve the case by 10 pm,
you and I will end up in the dust.
It's kind of fun.
Fun? Are you serious?
Hey, Haibara!
What are you waiting for? Come on, let's go!
Well, our lives are in your hands,
Mr. Great Detective.
Really, I don't understand!
What does TAKA mean, 3 minus 8?
It can be 3 - 8, as in an address.
So TAKA is a city name?
Yes.
And then, 3 minus 8 is -5.
If you remove the space sign, it's 3 - 8 - 5.
Found it, it's Takashima!
So it's in Takashima, district 3!
Hey, where is the district 3?
- There is no district 3. - No?
There is no 3rd district in Takashima.
What's that? Let me see!
Damn it!
We're back to where we started.
Not necessarily.
This area,
didn't it change its name because of a restructuring?
Takashima 3 - 8 - 5?
Wouldn't the districts have changed with the restructuring around here?
Yes, it became Minato-Mirai here.
There was a district 3.
Can I see your map?
Here you go.
It's strange...
Is this building really connected to a case?
We're here for a reason.
But still,
why did he want an elementary school kid like you to come too?
He must have thought you were unreliable on your own.
It's true that it's suspicious.
Why am I the only one who has to go with Uncle?
What's the meaning of this?
What's that?
Who goes there?
You can't move in here.
It will be destroyed in seven days.
It must be hard for you, with the kid and all...
Oh no, that's not it!
I'm glad.
Do you live here all the time, sir?
Yes.
Ever since this hotel went bankrupt two years ago.
Has anything changed lately?
Not a thing.
Hm, let me think...
Ah, that's right.
A huge white bird flew by once.
A huge bird?
It flew past in front of the sun, like this!
When did it happen?
On my birthday, on April 4th.
That day, a strange car was parked since the morning.
And a real estate agent came to close the basement.
A strange car?
Yes, because cars don't often park around here.
This morning on the way out,
I saw a new car parked in the yard over there.
And when I came back in the evening, there was an old car in its place.
And during the night,
some people stole its parts and only the body was left.
And why was the basement closed?
That's where they kept the machines.
I guess they wanted to sell them.
What time was this?
Evening.
What the hell was that?
Hey, kid! What's going on?
Oh, you were there?
Don't scare me like that!
Ow!
What the...
What the hell?
I found this.
What's this bag?
It's a...
A balaclava and gloves!
And a Colt Government!
A receipt?

April 4 in Yokohama Shindo...
Uncle, on April 4,
is that the day he saw a car parked there?
Yes, and the car was changed after...
Changed?
I got it!
A culprit on the run changed cars here!
He used this hood and the Colt
to commit a crime!
Now we just need to find out what crimes took place on April 4th.
When we find that,
the rest will be a piece of cake.
Who are these?
Guns!
They are not civilians, at least that's clear.
Maybe they came back for that bag.
Maybe, yes...
Well, I have a plan!
You go out and lure them in!
While I go to the car,
I'll save you, and we'll escape!
I'll be fine, don't worry!
They won't shoot a child!
What's the matter with you?
Don't you trust me?
No, I don't.
Don't argue and go!
Wait a minute!
Stop!
Climb up!
There you go.
Damn it, right on cue!
Damn piece of junk!
You're under arrest!
Under arrest? But you...
The police?
That's the big bird from before.
What is it?
It is him!
White wings flying over the darkness.
It's Kaito Kid!
Kid?
Inspector, we've spotted Kid!
He's on the roof of the Miyama building,
on top of the demon statue!
Roger that!
Miyama Chairman.
Kid's shown up.
Alright, let's go see him.
That said, our new security system is foolproof,
even for Kid.
Kid!
Damn it.
This is Yokomizo.
Kid has left the building and is heading for the Landmark Tower.
I repeat: Kid is heading for the Landmark Tower!
Everyone after him!
Obviously, the help of the police wasn't necessary.
Luckily we have our system.
Inspector!
We've arrested a possible accomplice of Kid.
We're taking him to the station!
Got it! I'll be back as soon as I can.
I'm telling you I'm not with Kid!
My name is Kogoro Mouri!
It doesn't look good.
If we do nothing...
I'll watch everything you do.
Your bracelets are equipped with GPS.
No need to go to the police.
ID#1 and ID#2
approaching Kanagawa Police Station.
Just hearing their screams gives me the chills!
Yeah, but I'm tired of waiting in line.
Do you think we'll be there soon?
Let's see...
If we count one meter for 3 people,
since there is about 150 m of queue, that's 450 people.
Twenty-two people can ride the Super Snake at a time.
Rounding up, that's 450 divided by 20.
Time to get on and all,
each ride lasts 10 minutes, which adds up to 200 minutes.
That's about 3.5 hours!
Impressive, Mitsuhiko!
Do we have to wait that long?
I'm starving...
If the teacher were here, he'd give us a quiz!
He certainly would.
In that case, I'll take one this time!
You, Miss Ran?
Don't you want to?
Yes, go ahead.
Okay then, let's hear it.
Let's go then!
Tadam, the Miracle Land quiz!
You all want to ride the Super Snake at least once.
But among you all, the Junior Detectives,
who is this ride really perfect for?
I've got it!
Ai is the answer!
Why?
I can see her loving snakes.
No, I hate them.
Bzzzt!
Then it must be me!
Just like the Super Snake, I'm always kept waiting!
What do you mean by that?
In the morning when you go to school,
you always take a long time when I'm waiting for you in front of your house!
Wrong answer.
What do you say, Genta?
Me, maybe?
The snake looks like the eel,
and I love rice bowls with eel!
That's close!
What's wrong with Genta who loves eel?
What happens to him?
He'll be hungry, I think, but...
I see.
Super Snake means "Super Snake."
So a very big snake.
And Kojima weighs a lot, so it's him.
Bingo!
And there it is...
I thought it would be different with her.
But in the end it's still a pun!
Kanagawa Police Station
Oh, Conan! Is everything okay?

Inspector Megure!
What happened to Mouri?
I hear an accomplice of Kid's has been arrested?
Oh, Nakamori.
Megure, you old fox!
What are you doing here?
Mouri was wrongly arrested, so I came.
So Kid's accomplice,
is it Kogoro the Sleeping One?
I have a duty to protect my client's identity.
If it's Kid, that makes you his accomplice!
And why exactly was this building under surveillance?
Kid sent us a theft announcement card.
This is the main office of the Miyama Company.
On the top floor, President Miyama
is holding an exhibition of his private jewel collection.
But unlike before, nothing was stolen this time.
Had he been in there before?
Yes.
On April 4 of this year, he stole a huge diamond.
I heard they've improved their security system since then,
so Mr. Miyama must be over the moon right now.
April 4th?
But...
Yokomizo is from the 1st division, right?
Kid is in the 2nd division.
It's just that lately some shady guy has been trying to kill Kid.
Some people got hurt in their fight,
so 1 st Division is helping them.
Somebody wants to kill Kid?
Shoot, I'm getting a call.
I'll be right back.
Detective Mouri...
No, is that you, Kudo?
So it is you.
The high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.
I was surprised to see you arrive with Detective Mouri.
I was going to send a request to you too.
But I didn't know how to contact you.
It was too hard, so you ran to the police?
No, we didn't go voluntarily.
Detective Mouri was mistakenly arrested in front of the hotel...
How honest you are.
This guy...
He was aware
that the police would be there?
Well, whatever.
So, what was at the hotel?
Evidence of a possible crime,
a ski mask and a gun.
Well done, Kudo.
Here's the second clue.
Go to the sidewalk café at night.
The cafe terrace at night?
You should know where that is, knowing you.
I'll solve this case!
Then undo Ran's and the others' passes!
Hello? Are you listening?
Damn it...
Loved ones.
Do you know how painful their loss is?
Do your best not to find out,
Kudo.
How did he know?
How did he know who I was?
That guy...
Who is he?
The line is not moving and my stomach is getting emptier and emptier.
That's for sure.
It's true that it's past noon.
In that case, I'll stand in line for you.
Go and eat something.
Are you sure, Haibara?
We can't leave her alone, poor thing!
Oh yeah...
I'll stay with her, then!
Me too!
Me too, then!
You're stupid, that won't get us anywhere.
Let's do it like this:
we replace each other every 30 minutes,
starting with Ai, okay?
Yes, okay!
See you in 30 minutes, then.
- Yes! - Come on, hurry!
Sorry, guys.
You can go ahead.
How much time can I spare?
Yokohama Port, Osanbashi
I might understand something if I took it apart,
but it might explode.
I can't do anything here.
Okay...
Ah, here.
I increased its power.
Thank you !
By the way, did you find
where this café terrace is?
Yes.
Where is it, then?
Terrace of the café at night,
is an 1888 painting by Vincent van Gogh.
It shows a terrace in the dim light of a lantern,
and a cart arriving in the distance.
A lantern and a cart, or basha,
it is inevitably in Bashamichi, where the first lantern of Japan is!
You improved it too much, Professor!
Haibara!
Here you go!
Thank you, Professor.
We're back!
Didn't it go any further than that?
I must have made a mistake in my calculations.
We replace you!
Thank you, sir.
What's up, Ran?
Are you going back to childhood?
Sonoko!
What are you doing here?
See that hotel, Red Castle, over there?
They passed 100,000 guests today,

so they're having a party tonight.
My dad practically built this hotel, you know.
So I'm spending the time in the park until tonight.
Hey, where did you pick that up?
I didn't pick it up!
Dad's client gave them to us!
Must be some VIP, that customer.
Actually, I lost my pass,
I had to drop it.
Ah, I know!
I'm inviting you to the party with me,
so why don't you and I go to Red Castle?
The kids have their passes, so they can stay alone.
Especially her, right now. She has a good head on her shoulders.
But...
They have a cake buffet at their restaurant right now!
And with your pass, you can go back into the park anytime you want.
What's there to see here?
Don't go anywhere.
Hattori!
Did I scare you?
Shut up!
You're just in time.
Give me a hand, Kudo!
Oh, but you too?
You too?
Yes.
He took Kazuha hostage.
Finally, she doesn't suspect anything and is having a good time at the park.
The number you called is out of range,
or the phone is switched off and can't be reached.
What the hell is he doing?
He said he'd be done soon so he could come to the park with me!
I understand how Ran feels while waiting for Kudo.
But is that you, Kazuha?
Oh, Ran!
It's been a long time!
I've been waiting for this!
What about Hattori?
He's working on a case.
I see. Bad luck.
Oh, Kazuha!
Sonoko!
Say..,
We're going to a cake buffet.
Want to come?
I love cake!
- Let's go, then! - Yes!
Are you coming, Ran?
Ah, wait!
I see...
Bashamichi
She's being held hostage, too.
Yes.
And not just Ran, but the four kids too.
Also..,
the client seems to think
I'm Shinichi Kudo.
Does he know your real identity?
Maybe, I don't know.
Hey...
They wouldn't have found out that their drug made you younger!
The people in black, I mean.
Hey!
What's the matter?
A ski mask,
a gun, and a getaway car!
I see! An attack on a money transporter!
Yes.
Is this what the client was talking about?
Probably.
Excuse me, I...
What's the matter, kid?
That car carrying the money, was it ever hit?
Yes, it was.
It was April 4th, I believe.
Since you work here,
the police must have already asked you some questions.
Can you tell us about it too?
Uh, yes.
It happened around that time.
Nobody move!
It all happened so fast.
I couldn't believe it was real.
So they moved quickly.
Thank you, ma'am!
Ah, wait!
My poor boys,
this is the worst day of your lives!
You should go home and get some rest!
Okay, we'll do that.
But first we're going to turn it into our best day ever.
Bye.
What's wrong with wandering off? I've been looking all over for you!
You were looking for me?
Come on, this is no time to fight.
What's that tanned kid from Osaka doing here?
The same thing you are.
Mouri.
Give me the client's phone back!
Isn't it time you told us the truth?
I don't know what you're talking about...
Detective work has its limits.
You should let us handle the rest.
This is Mouri.
Is that you this time, Detective Mouri?
You're in Bashamichi, aren't you?
Yes.
It's not good to be friends with the police.
Are you watching us?
Right now?
Are you going to break your promise, Mr. Mouri?
No, I'm not!
I had nothing to do with this!
Who are you talking to, Mouri?
You idiots!
Get out of here, you useless cops!
What?
What's with the damn dummy?
Hey, he shouldn't go in there!
Watch out, get away from that thing!
- It's gonna explode! - What's gonna explode?
It's gonna blow in ten seconds!
Nine! Eight!
Seven! Six!
Five! Four!
Damn it!
Mommy!
Yokomizo!
We need an ambulance!
Bastard!
Next time, it'll be the kids,
Mr. Mouri.
Is something wrong?

My pass has been blinking weirdly since earlier.
Mine too.
Do you know why?
No, mine never did.
We only have to ask the staff at the exit.
Oh, dear...
Not being able to avoid such an explosion...
The police have gone soft nowadays!
What's that?
It's your fault, what's happening!
Let me go, you have no proof!
I'll be frank: you're embarrassing me!
Stay out of my business, please!
What's wrong?
I was right to leave the police.
I want to live a long life !
Come on, let's move!
Yes...
Inspector, you let him go?
Yes, let him go.
Ran and the children are being held hostage in Miracle Land.
Their bracelet will blow them up if they get out.
Please help them in absolute secrecy. Mouri.
I've asked the detectives to save the others.
Well,
whether it ends well or badly,
it depends on our brains.
So what?
- Did you find a lead? - Yes, we did.
On April 4th, here in Bashamichi,
a money transport van was attacked.
And on that same day,
Kaito Kid stole a diamond from the Miyama Gallery, according to the police.
I see.
Well, I'll look into it on my own.
Don't do anything rash, kids!
What's on your mind?
We probably won't find any more clues here.
What can we solve with so little?
Oh, but we still have one more clue to solve.
What's that?
Here are the clues I was given:
The café terrace at night and You cry.
You didn't have that one.
Did he give you another clue than us?
That's right.
You cry.
Letter by letter, it gives Y, 0, U, C, R, Y.
"YOU" is maybe...
Yes.
It's the acronym of a university just outside Yokohama.
The Yokohama Ocean University.
We still have to find "CRY".
I haven't found it yet either.
We just have to go there,
to this "YOU".
Yeah, right.
Hurry, Ran!
Excuse me!
Can I help you?
Why is my pass flashing red like that?
Uh, good question...
- I've never seen that before. - Miss Ran Mouri from Beika...
and Miss Kazuha Toyama are expected.
Please come to the park infirmary.
What's the matter?
Something may have happened to the kids.
Let's go and see!
Sorry, Sonoko.
Can you go alone?
Yes, don't worry.
Go quickly, I'm worried about them too.
Sorry, huh?
Well, I'll just have to eat.
What's the matter?
She fainted.
It's probably just a heat stroke.
Oh well...
I'm sorry.
No, don't worry!
But why did you call Kazuha too?
I never talked to him before.
That's because...
Well, it's obvious!
It's more reassuring to have two people by your side!
Yes !
Stay here and rest a while.
Can you stay near her?
Of course!
Don't go away, eh?
I thought she was arrogant,
but she can be cute!
It's tiring to act.
Cry, cry, cry...
Maybe it's short for a class.
- Maybe a club ? - Yes, not stupid.
Other possibilities are...
The crime research group.
"Crime Research of Yokohama."
That's the best thing about the acronym, if you ask me.
Who are you?
My name is Saguru Hakuba.
I'm in the same position as you.
And in more ways than one.
The same position?
You're the son of a policeman and a high school detective, right?
It's not as impressive as a child detective, but still.
I see.
You're in the same situation as me, with my father being the chief of the Osaka police.
That's not all.
What, you too?
Someone I care about is also in Miracle Land.
Anyway, let's talk while walking.
If we waste too much time, we'll end up crying.
I mean, we'll end up crying.
Sure...
Hey, is anybody home?
Hello!
Let's go in, huh?
They have a lot of documents.
Hey,
look at these pictures.
Probably shots of the band members.
We better take a picture.
Yeah.
Is this the client?
Yes.
Yeah. What?

You exceed my expectations, Heiji Hattori.
To go so far with only "You cry" as a clue...
You never cease to amaze me.
Say!
I don't mind, but if you want to solve the case,
you could give us some simple clues.
It wouldn't be interesting for me if it was too easy.
Besides,
I need to test you.
To make sure of your detective skills,
and see if you are worthy of solving my case.
What?
You won't get another clue.
I'm counting on you, my young detectives.
Hey, wait a minute!
Damn it, he hung up.
No more clues, huh?
What do we do now?
The targets are at the YOU.
Eliminate them.
Oh, who are you?
Can I help you?
Uh, we're...
We'd like to study here next year,
so we're visiting.
Oh!
If you're busy, feel free to join our club!
Yeah, we'll definitely join.
Say, Miss,
what are those pictures up there?
Those are the past presidents of the club, the first one on the left.
So why did you remove the one of the third?
Well yes, look!
There are brackets next to the last picture on the right.
And from the third photo, behind the frames,
you can slightly see lighter areas of the wall.
It looks like the photo of the 3rd president has been removed
and the following photos have been realigned.
No ?
The third president, Mr. Ito, has been removed from the archives.
It was Jiro Ito, wasn't it?
No.
It was Suehiko his first name, but you know him?
Yes, if you like.
Let's see...
It was him, wasn't it?
No, it was this man.
Oh, right!
What an actor.
My mistake.
That wasn't the Mr. Ito I know, was it?
Osaka Police Station
Suehiko Ito?
Who is this guy, Heiji?
If I knew, I wouldn't ask you, Mr. Ohtaki!
Does the chief know?
No, it's a secret.
A secret? But, Heiji...
Come on, I'll wait for your call.
Hey! Heiji!
Well, I'm going to have a smoke...
Hey!
Why don't we go to the cafeteria for a bit?
We need to recharge our brains with glucose.
Dumbass, we don't have time!
I'm waiting for a phone call now!
A true warrior ignores hunger.
They also say you can't work on an empty stomach.
Besides, I've already figured out what you're trying to find.
I must say that we are closer to the police station of Yokohama
than the one in Osaka.
He's annoying me!
Yes. Yes, that's it.
I'll invite you when we get back, I promise.
Yes.
Come on, I count on you, Ao.
Quickly, huh?
What are you doing, Ohtaki?
Hey, boss.
On the phone,
was that your cousin Aoki, from the Kanagawa Police Department?
Uh, yeah, I haven't talked to him in a while, so...
No point in hiding it.
Heizo's son asked you for a favor, didn't he?
He called me too.
Oh well, you too!
You've been had, Ohtaki.
What's wrong with my son?
Boss!
Why don't you tell me all about it in my office?
Well, yes...
I'd be frank if I were you.
Uh, well...
This situation is not easy...
Well, thank you.
Inspector Megure!
I'm going to say hello to him!
I'll go with you! He often helps Heiji.
Well, I'm going to take a ride on the Super Snake.
I'll let you watch her!
Wait a minute!
Don't get up yet!
Stop him, please!
- Okay, okay, okay. - Got it!
Detective Megure!
Oh, Ran and Kazuha!
What are you two doing here?
Are you on a case?
Oh no!
I'm off duty!
And so is Shiratori.
Just the two of you, in Miracle Land?
Wow...
Oh, Ran!
The kids!
Detective.
What, are you serious?
The Super Snake is on technical hold. Please excuse us.
It's karma for wanting to get there before us.
Come on, back to the infirmary.
Our apologies!
It's for your own safety, so thank you for understanding!
We'll give out tickets!
Thief!
To the thief! To the thief !

- Ayumi ! - Ran !
It's Detective Megure !
Why is he here?
Hey, Takagi.
What are you doing?
Oh, uh...
Were you checking out a pretty girl in the middle of our date?
No! I wouldn't do that!
What's with the gibberish?
You lost me there.
Oh, sorry...
I'll pretend I didn't see it.
This curry looks good!
- Come on, I attack! - Enjoy your meal.
It's really good! What kind of curry is this?
Yuck! What kind of curry is this?
It's all floury!
So what?
Who's this Suehiko Ito?
Ito is wanted by the police
as the culprit in the attack on a money truck
...on April 4 in Bashamichi.
I see.
That's why they took down his picture at the club.
That's not the only interesting detail.
After finishing college,
he set up a business as a financial advisor.
And that business,
called the Far East Office, was also the site of a murder.
What?
What about it? Intriguing, no?
All right, then.
Shall we go there right away?
To that company, Far East Office?
Finally, you finished your plate.
I'm back.
Good evening, Master.
Excuse me, Miss Kuriyama.
May I ask you for a cold drink?
Yes.
Yes, this is Kisaki.
Is that you? What's the matter?
Aren't you in Miracle Land with Ran today?
Wait a minute!
Any news on a case?
What's going on?
Ah, it would take a long time to explain.
I'm kind of stuck.
All right.
The theft of a van on April 4th, right?
I'll look into it right away and call you back.
Thanks, you're a lifesaver.
Kogoro?
Say, Eri...
Do you think I can solve this case?
An investigation is solved on the field.
Wasn't it you who said that, Mr. Former policeman?
Yes, it's true, you're right.
I count on you!
Yes, I understand.
Come here!
Come in.
I'm sorry.
What's up?
Weren't you on the phone?
Yes, I was.
With a really hateful man !
Right, Goro ?
It was her husband, right ?
No entry for unauthorized people
If it's forbidden...
It makes you want to enter.
That's the credo of the detectives.
The victim is Masaharu Nishio,
their general sales manager.
He was allegedly shot with a rifle.
He was in the same class as Ito at the university.
So...
He was in the research group, too?
That's right.
Follow me.
Follow you? Wait, that's my phone!
- When did this... - Look at this.
In the front row of the picture.
In the middle is Suehiko Ito, who was the club president.
The man on the right is Nishio, the one who was killed.
Hey...
Who is the woman on the left of Mr. Ito?
Her name is Reiko Shimizu.
She used to work at that company too,
but she killed herself last May 15.
Suicide?
During her voluntary interrogation by the police.
About Nishio's death?
Apparently, they went at her very hard.
This is where the shooting took place.
It's pretty dusty.
Like they haven't touched anything since.
That said, at the time of the shooting,
the blinds and the window were open.
The killer shot Nishio from the bathroom in this building.
He used a Charter Arms AR-7.
With a sight and silencer.
They found on the floor of the toilet
eight shells.
The perpetrator fired all eight bullets from the rifle.
One of them hit Nishio in the back of the head.
Death was immediate.
After that, in Nishio's office,
they found the plan for the van attack written by Ito,
and he's been wanted by the police ever since.
But why was Reiko Shimizu questioned?
That I don't know.
Look, Hattori.
She was shot in the head,
but there's not enough blood.
That's true.
However, here,
there's a huge bloodstain.
What does that mean?
The blood on the back of the seat ran straight down.
And look!
One of the wheels took a hit and came off.
I see, so that was it.

It looks like it, yes.
This is Hattori.
So you've reached the next stage, Hattori.
Yes, it wasn't easy.
Did you understand what case I wanted you to solve?
The Masaharu Nishio murder?
Yes...
Hey, you..,
...you wouldn't be...
Damn it.
What's that?
Motorcycles?
One thing's for sure: this is not good.
What's wrong with them?
Maybe they're here to make the game more interesting,
like the customer said.
He's overdoing it!
We won't get away with it, let's split up!
- Let's roll! - Got it.
Come on, it's going to be one on one now!
You can attack whenever you want!
Nature hasn't spoiled you!
Did I offend you?
Damn it!
Fight with your bare hands, you coward!
Did Kudo manage to get away?
Damn it.
I got paint on my shirt, it's ruined.
Stop!
Didn't he have a jacket and a baseball cap?
Yeah, but he could have taken them off.
That's right...
What's the matter?
Don't you think he's suspicious?
Oh, the guy in the yellow shirt?
Look, his hair is not shaped the same everywhere.
Because he was wearing a cap, right?
He must have gotten rid of it with his jacket and the stolen bag.
You're Shinichi Kudo's girlfriend,
the high school detective from the east!
I'm not his girlfriend...
Cola splashed on the thief's shoe, huh?
Yeah.
I did it on purpose, to leave evidence!
My purse!
Oops!
You're great, Genta!
But no, Ayumi...
It's not good to lie, Genta.
Thief!
I saw everything!
Oh, I must have misremembered...
It's him!
It was just a granny.
Here!
Wait, Ayumi!
Is that him, Ayumi?
Yes.
I saw a cola stain on his left shoe.
And he's cross-eyed, looking left and right!
- No doubt about it. - Yes!
Let's follow him!
I don't like this...
Where did they all go?
- Thief! - Come back!
We got you this time !
Get out of the way! Out of my way!
Get out of the way!
You're in the way, get out!
We're borrowing this!
Stop right there!
Damn it!
Surrender!
The police are on their way.
Stay out of my business!
Damn it!
Oh no!
Ayumi !
Nobody move!
Stay still if you don't want anything to happen to her!
Number 5 is approaching the gate.
Who is it?
Number 5: Ayumi Yoshida.
Oh, right...
Stay back!
Come any closer and she dies!
Let the child go!
Take me as a hostage instead!
Don't mess around, old man!
Then me!
No, I'll be his hostage.
It's my fault if he caught her.
No, not you!
Well...
We can't let civilians...
Stop fighting!
I won't trade my hostage, period!
All of you!
Don't move until I get through the gate.
The girl's life is at stake!
No! If she leaves the park...
Oh, my God!
That's the entrance, the exit is next door!
Shut up and move!
No way!
That's the rule, oh!
At your age, really!
Not following the rules...
Seize him!
Get out of here!
There's no shortage of hostages!
Don't come any closer! Otherwise, this chick will...
She'll what?
Well, uh...
I'll what?
Can you tell me ?
Excuse me!
Let me through, please...
Excuse me!
I brought the ice cream!
Miss... Sato?
Detective Megure?
Uh, what are you doing here?
I'll ask you again.
Ah, well... That is...
Kudo...
Kudo! Kudo!
Hey, Kudo!
Kudo!
At last you've woken up!
Where are we?
In grandpa Agasa's car.
Teacher?
Don't force it.
I've put a splint on you in the meantime,
but the bone may be broken.
Hattori, did you save me?
No, it was Hakuba.
He called Grandpa Agasa to come,
and when he came he found you all beaten up.
Then Agasa called me, and I joined you.
Hakuba did that?
Yeah, he did.
He said he wanted to check something,

and he left before I got to the car.
What time is it?
How long have I been sleeping?
Since 2 a.m., it's 8:30 now.
Only one hour and a half left...
We're heading to the Red Castle Hotel now.
Did you find out who killed Mr. Nishio?
No, we're just heading there.
We didn't need to stay there.
Right.
Mr. Ohtaki called while you were sleeping.
We found out a lot of things.
Details of Nishio's murder.
The night he was shot..,
a car missed a turn in a container park
and was badly damaged.
The driver was Suehiko Ito.
It's a miracle that he survived, as he was so injured,
and he stayed in intensive care for a whole month.
When the police examined the wrecked car,
they discovered that the oil line had been tampered with,
and they found a rifle with a silencer in the trunk.
The prints had been wiped off,
but it was the gun that had been used to kill Nishio.
So, was Ito arrested?
No.
Two months after the accident, when the officers were finally allowed
to go and question him...
We're going in!
Ito was nowhere to be found.
After that,
he totally disappeared from the scene,
and we put out an APB on him.
They had discovered in the meantime that he committed the theft of the van.
So Ito is the culprit?
Yes.
He shot Nishio, no doubt about it.
We found his footprints where the shot was fired,
with traces of gunpowder.
The number of shells found
also matches the magazine capacity of the rifle.
Same for the make and the rest, but...
Criminal Identification
Mascara?
On the scope.
It's barely visible, but it's definitely mascara.
It's right there.
It stuck when someone looked through the scope,
is that correct?
That's right.
And this type of mascara is rare.
I looked among the women in their circle,
and there's only one who uses this mascara.
It's Reiko Shimizu!
The one who committed suicide after the crime?
She was a bit of a madonna of the Yokohama research group.
She was particularly close to Nishio and Ito, the victim and the missing person.
After college, she joined lto's company with Nishio,
as the head of the secretariat.
The culprits of the attack on the money carrier,
were Ito and Nishio?
Ito may have had reason to want to kill Nishio,
but not Reiko Shimizu, right?
According to one of their colleagues,
Nishio was hitting on her insistently and she couldn't stand it.
But the police had questioned her
about the mascara and her unclear alibi during the murder,
she kept silent until the end.
And then, on May 15...
Hey!
She jumped!
Reiko Shimizu's body was never found,
but the police concluded that she couldn't have survived
with such a strong current.
Ito disappeared from the hospital 20 days after that.
In the end, the two suspects of Nishio's murder disappeared,
the case was closed without knowing the culprit.
Of course, without its president, lto's company closed.
And it was bought by the Miyama company.
Is there any connection with the Miyama gallery?
That's where Kid stole a jewel.
Bingo.
Its president, Soichiro Miyama, was in lto's research group.
He was their oldest child by 4 years.
Ito often asked Miyama for help.
About Kid, Mr. Ohtaki
found an interesting piece of information in passing.
When Kid infiltrated Miyama's gallery on April 4,
he came face to face with the culprits of the van robbery, who were on the run,
and there was a gunfight.
A shootout?
Well, Kid doesn't use a gun,
so I guess they just shot him.
But if they shot...
Then Kid must have seen their faces, right?
Yeah.
And at the scene, we found
Colt Government and Charter Arms rounds!
And since then,
every time Kid shows up, someone tries to kill him.

So, interesting, right?
Yes.
But it's not enough for us to find out who killed Nishio.
Yeah, I know.
We're missing one key piece of information.
Oh, by the way, Mouri called earlier
to say he found a material witness.
Apparently, on the day Nishio was killed,
the guard heard metal rattling coming from the bathroom,
and he saw Ito running out of the toilet with a golf bag.
The rattling was probably
the sound of cartridges falling to the floor.
And in the golf bag
was the Charter Arms AR-7.
It's all good, Grandpa!
And where is Uncle?
He said he was going to see the client, since he solved the case.
He didn't!
If he's wrong, we're finished!
What do you mean? Are you?
Step on it, papi! Full throttle!
Right on!
I knew you'd come, Kaito Kid.
You've been fiddling with the ceiling all afternoon
to finally get in, it seems.
I won't let you steal my gems.
I don't steal anything without leaving a card first.
What?
Tonight I came to say goodbye.
I'm a little tired of people trying to kill me.
You live up to your reputation.
So you guessed.
Yes.
At least in part.
But there was one thing I didn't understand.
I did send you your diamond back,
so why this obstinacy to want to kill me ?
I finally understood it today.
You're the kind of person who takes care of your cadets.
It's all your fault,
you shouldn't have witnessed the game of my adorable protégés.
You call this a game? A security guard died.
Accidents happen in games.
You saw it for yourself.
If my charges are going to ask me for help,
I have to do something.
Are you planning a magic trick?
What, you really think I naively came in
without preparing anything?
Shoot him! Shoot him!
What's that?
Don't be afraid.
It's just a simple soporific gas.
Didn't you know that?
After my intrusion on April 4,
I came back here several times.
What?
And earlier this afternoon..,
I left visible marks on the ceiling
to let you know that I would be back tonight.
All this to lure you and your killers.
No way!
Save your arguments for the police, I called them.
That also goes for your protégé, who sleeps behind that curtain.
The younger one was cooler than the older one.
Well, I'm sure those two will have plenty to say.
About that gallery full of stolen goods, too!
It's Kid! Kid has appeared!
Your little game is over!
And in the worst way: by scoring against his team.
Open up, police!
Open the door!
Just a little more patience, Ran!
Thank you for your efforts, Detective Mouri.
The client's waiting for you.
Please come in.
Mr. Mouri has returned.
I'm sure you're tired, but time is short.
Please make your report.
The cases you wanted to solve
are the attack committed on April 4th in Bashamichi
of a money transport van,
and the murder case of Masaharu Nishio
which is related to the first one.
I'm going to join the kids at Miracle Land.
Okay, I'll do that.
- I'll leave Kazuha in your hands. - I understand.
The people responsible for the Bashamichi van attack
were Suehiko Ito and Masaharu Nishio.
However
Nishio inadvertently killed a guard who resisted.
Four days later,
it was Nishio who was murdered this time.
The police suspected Reiko Shimizu,
who worked with Nishio and whom he harassed,
but I don't think so.
The motive for the crime
was a grudge against Nishio for defiling his perfect plan.
Yes.
The person who killed Masaharu Nishio
- was Suehi... - Wait a minute!
You two!
Wait, detective Mouri is doing his...
Oops!
Hey, what's wrong?
Are you all right?
Detective Mouri, please hurry up and continue.
I was getting to that!
The person who killed Mr. Nishio...
Ow!
Sorry, old man.
Damn, the screen went blank!
Damn it!
Damn, none of the buttons are working!
What the hell is that?
Maybe the customer's over there.
What's wrong?

Earlier, when I called this Takada guy,
I heard a noise in the background.
The same crackling sound you hear behind the customer.
I see.
- The clock is ticking, let's go! - Yes, let's.
It's dark in here...
No time to hesitate, let's go.
Welcome, Shinichi Kudo.
And Heiji Hattori.
Yeah, we finally meet.
Mr. President of Far East Office.
Suehiko Ito.
I'm amazed at you.
Putting you together was the right decision.
I knew it.
Sorry to see you like this.
I'm a cripple, you see.
Because of your accident?
Yes.
I came here when I knew my body wouldn't heal.
I invested funds in the shadows with the help of an acquaintance.
Including Miracle Land.
You mean Soichiro Miyama?
Splendid!
Even that, you got it?
Can we report back? We're running out of time.
Have you discovered the truth?
Yes.
I don't have much time left.
So I needed detectives who could reveal everything.
And not just clever ones,
but real detectives with guts.
Come on, speak up!
Tell me what truth you found!
On April 4th,
while Masaharu Nishio was at the Far East Office...
The name of the person who shot him from the building across the street is...
Reiko Shimizu.
She blamed you for Nishio's murder...
Then she tried to kill you by making it look like an accident.
That's not true!
I shot Nishio in the toilet!
Are you like the police?
Are you incompetent?
It's true you fired a gun from the toilet.
But after Shimizu shot herself!
What's that?
You missed.
None of your seven bullets hit the target.
Seven bullets?
This gun had a capacity of eight bullets!
Yes, but having rushed out of the bathroom
without even picking up your shells,
you probably didn't count the bullets fired.
By that time, Mr. Nishio
had already been murdered.
That's impossible!
I saw it! One of my bullets
knocked Nishio to the ground!
It's just that one of your bullets hit
a wheel on the chair that came off.
One of my bullets could have hit him by accident too!
Are you stupid?
Do you think he would have stayed seated without running away after all those shots?
Then one of the first bullets must have...
The blood on Mr. Nishio's chair
dried after flowing in straight lines downward.
That's how we figured it out.
A sniper killed him with a single bullet to the back of the head...
And after his blood dried,
a second culprit, an amateur this time, shot him too.
Of course it wasn't enough to know which of you was the sniper,
but the testimony that old Mouri got
clarified everything.
After hearing metal clanking
coming from the bathroom,
a witness saw you rush out with a golf bag.
It was the sound of shell casings falling to the floor.
Since he heard several,
we deduced that you were the amateur sniper.
So the sniper was Reiko Shimizu.
And you, you broke the wheel of his chair
and mistakenly thought you had killed him.
The golf bag contained a Charter Arms AR-7.
It was Reiko who gave you the bag before the crime,
am I right?
That's true, but...
How does that pertain to Reiko?
She left traces of the rare mascara
traces of the rare mascara she was using.
That's not possible!
She gave you the bag and you shot from the toilet.
Then you drove away and got rid of the gun.
It was certainly Reiko who tampered with your car too.
As for the motive,
it was probably to keep all the stolen money for herself.
Wasn't she there, too?
In the car, during the attack on the van.
And during your escape, you ran into Kaito Kid.
Since Kid saw your faces,
you tried to shut him up.
But he lured you to a small winding road
where you panicked and shot.

And on this road they found
Colt and rifle cartridges.
Even for a professional driver,
driving one-handed on a winding road
while shooting Kid in the air with a pistol and a rifle, that's not feasible!
Which means you had two accomplices.
One shooting with the Colt, the other with a rifle.
I deduce that Masaharu Nishio and Reiko Shimizu were on board.
Anyway,
most of the evidence came from the police.
And the witness that old Mouri found
was also quickly found by the police.
In my opinion, it was all this information that led them to Reiko Shimizu.
Yes.
You didn't need anyone to solve the case.
Not a great detective,
nor a great detective.
Anyway, we solved your mystery.
Take away Ran's and the others' passes.
You're lying.
Reiko wouldn't do that.
She wouldn't...
That's not true, that's not true!
No, it's the truth.
I knew you survived.
Reiko?
Is that you, Reiko?
You weren't reliable enough
as a partner.
Same with Nishio.
He only thought with his brawn.
I would have been the one in danger with you.
You, Ito, were too shy.
And you didn't know how to talk without bragging.
I was bored with you!
You hired detectives,
and you seemed to want to cover up my crime so I was going to spare you...
But that's over!
I made sure that the money
that Mr. Miyama helped you invest will be returned to me!
Mr. Miyama?
It's over.
Kaito Kid took care of him.
There'll be only one person left,
and that will be me!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Kudo! Don't move.
This is a Walther PPK.
It contains 8 bullets.
As soon as she shoots them all, I'll take care of her!
Six.
Seven.
Eight!
Now!
Hattori!
Sorry, but I'm ambidextrous!
Use that, Kudo!
You don't need both legs in the air!
Yes, you do!
Reiko?
What's the matter?
What's the matter, Reiko? Reiko!
Undo our passes, please.
Shall I click on "deactivate"?
Yes,
send an ambulance.
What's that?
What?
"Error"?
She didn't do us any favors!
Do you understand, Kudo?
Not everything is out of order.
I must find a solution!
I'm nearing the end, Kudo.
Your voice sounds like a child's.
Hattori! Is it still showing "Error"?
Yes, it hasn't changed.
As I feared, it's set to explode on time!
What?
Ten o'clock sharp.
Holy crap!
What am I supposed to click on?
I really wanted to take Super Snake for a spin.
It's been out of commission the whole time.
I'm still waiting for my dessert!
Don't complain.
It's the inspector who invites us.
You have a big heart, Inspector!
- And a big belly! - That's true!
Say, Inspector Megure.
Is something going on?
What do you mean, anything?
Well, I...
You've come in great numbers.
Oh, no...
Detective.
I'm coming, Shiratori!
Excuse me, Ran.
What's up?
I cleared out all the customers and kitchen staff.
Only the children are left...
and ourselves.
Right, then.
What are you doing, Shinichi?
What the hell are you doing?
Sharing a secret between two people
strengthens the bonds in a couple.
There is no greater secret
than committing a crime with the woman you love.
That's why
attacking that van with Reiko
was an expression of my love for her.
But because of Nishio killing a security guard,
my perfect plan was ruined!
Nothing is perfect.
A gear will always end up deteriorating.
Some people will push until they break everything,
while others will start over
and redouble their efforts to make up for lost time.
You were just afraid.
Scared to start over.
Yes, maybe so.
Does it work?
What is it?
As long as the timer is active,
the passes cannot be removed!
Damn it!
Are you all right?
Are you still feeling bad?
No, I'm fine.
All right, then.
If you feel bad, let me know!
Yeah, okay.
Conan didn't join us after all.

He had to follow Mr. Mouri, I expected it!
It's not fair that he goes without us!
He's got a knack for taking the wind out of our sails!
Have you heard from Mouri?
No.
Oh, I see.
As soon as there's a minute left, I'll go in.
I don't want to leave the children alone.
Yes, you are.
21h56...
There's no time, Kudo!
I know!
He's using a wireless network!
Uh, yes!
If the WLAN doesn't work anymore
it can work by plugging it in directly!
Almost!
It's okay, it's in range!
Yes, it works!
We did it!
I'm stopping the timer!
Please enter the password.
Hey, what's the...
Hey, Kudo, he's...
Don't worry, he's just passed out.
Forgotten password HERE
Probably because of his accident.
What is the name of the person you love the most?
21h59.
Everybody stay here.
All right...
That was a scary ride, huh?
I was fine!
So, did you have a good time ?
I'm disappointed I didn't get on the Super Snake.
But that rocket thing was fun!
Yes, I'd love to go on that ride again!
Ito loved Reiko Shimizu!
Wrong password.
What?
Wasn't she the one he liked?
Wrong password.
- There's only one more attempt. - There's no time, Kudo!
Who could it be?
Who did ito love more than anything else?
And you didn't know how to talk without bragging.
But because of Nishio killing a security guard..,
my perfect plan was ruined!
I've got it!
Suehiko Ito
What are you doing?
The timer was stopped.
Is it over?
Yes, with this, it's all over!
Well done, Shinichi!
I stopped the timer,
but not the area restriction.
Then take away everyone's pass, Professor!
Yes, I'll do it right away.
Kudo...
And Hattori...
You really are the best
...detectives.
And you, you're...
...the worst person on earth.
Hey! Everything okay here?
Come on.
Take off your pass and put it in there.
Do I have to?
Yeah, time's up.
That's a shame.
Let's see, my handkerchiefs...
What?
I thought I lost it!
What's that?
Looks like paint.
Where did it come from?
Come on, this way.
Ah, that's...
We apologize for the inconvenience.
The overhaul of the Super Snake is complete.
It's closing time,
but it will make one last trip.
Anyone wishing to ride is asked to come along.
Hurrah!
Are you okay, Hattori?
Don't worry about it.
It's just a scratch.
Oh, and if not,
what made him think you were Shinichi Kudo?
That.
What? Your fingerprints?
Do you remember the chairs in the room?
Yes...
It stuck out to me because they didn't match the rest of the furniture.
The end of the armrests intrigued me.
I think that on the edges
there was a fingerprint reading system.
These fingerprints belong to Shinichi Kudo.
Since the customer was blind,
he logically thought that I was Shinichi Kudo.
I see!
Oh no, it's past 10:00!
It's going to explode!
You can undo the buckle!
From my belt?
No, of this!
That's right! Whew!
Recovered.
Hey, wait a minute!
Ah, really...
With this, it really feels like the case is over.
If not, are you going to shoot me?
Don't act tough, your leg hurts, doesn't it?
Yes, it does!
Being carried by Ran is the best medicine for him!
- Nonsense! - Ah, lucky you!
What a kid.
Inspector.
We've collected all the passes.
That's the count.
Hand them over to the bomb squad, unnoticed.
Yes.
Let's go!
Let's get on that Super Snake or whatever it is!
Let's do it!
What luck!
We've got it all to ourselves!
You're lucky, Heiji! They sell underwear here.
Stupid, I'm not going to wet myself!
Come on, everybody raise their hands!
They've got it going on.
You don't have to let go if you're scared.
Who's scared?

I can raise my arms, or even remove these bars...
Oh no, no, no!
You're so funny, Heiji!
Hey, you!
Take it off, Genta! Genta!
What are you doing, man? Take it off!
Take it off quick before we get out of the area!
Genta!
What the hell are you doing?
If you move, you're dead!
I've got it!
Kudo!
Behind me!
Damn it!
Go for it!
No, stop him!
No !
The safety bars are in sync, if you break one...
They'll all break?
It was awesome!
There were even fireworks!
That must be a bonus!
I didn't find it funny...
Why was he there?
He was with us since the beginning of the investigation.
Right?
We parted with a smile
Without saying a word about our grief
In front of you I always say
the exact opposite of what I feel
The day ends without beginning
The crows return to the forest singing
I hate myself so much I can't sleep
Why do I always do this again?
I want to embrace something concrete
Even if I'm mocked for it
I'll pass on my burning feelings
So I'll prove I'm alive
I'll sing my life away
I guess the gods
Are not looking for much
Our desires won't make us free
No matter how hard I try, I'm still unhappy
I only follow the others
All alone I feel totally lost
I stop to think
And ask myself what I really want
I want to embrace something concrete
Even if no one sees it
I'll live straight and true
And like a light I'll cross the darkness
I'll sing my life away
I wish I wouldn't run or hide anymore
Strengthen yourself, my soul!
I want to embrace something real
Even if I'm laughed at for it
I'll look for what's in the depths of despair
So I'll prove I'm alive
I want to hug you with all my might
Through the pouring rain
I'll sing my life
My one and only life
No but that Ryu, I swear!
He was paid to pretend to die!
And the two detectives' names
he said at the time were just a bluff!
He wanted to make money that badly?
It's pathetic!
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.
An advertisement?
What kind of ad?
For a sleeping pill?
It'll be easy because I sleep all the time?
Don't play games with me!
Who do you think I am? Even for money, I...
That much?
Oh yes, with pleasure!
Yes !
Too predictable.
I recognize Kogoro the Sleeping one.
With great pleasure !
