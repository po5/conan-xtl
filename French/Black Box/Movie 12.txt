Explosion at Domoto Music Academy
Soko Kawabe
Soko Kawabe...
You can only blame yourself
and your talent.
All I do is to make the night quiet.
DETECTIVE CONAN THE MELODY OF FEAR
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug, and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name, I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
To find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
Are you ready, Mitsuhiko?
Yes, send!
Let's do it!
I got it!
Mitsuhiko!
Your turn, Conan!
Oops.
It's for you, Ayumi !
What, me?
I got it !
Hooray!
Let me introduce my current classmates:
Genta, Ayumi and Mitsuhiko.
They formed the Junior Detectives
and made me join them against my will.
And this is the last member.
Her name is Ai Haibara,
real name, Shiho Miyano.
She lost her parents when she was young,
she followed their tracks by working for the men in black
as a scientist, under the code name Sherry.
She was the one who created the drug Apotoxin 4869 that I was made to drink.
But when the organization killed her older sister,
Akemi Miyano, Shiho rebelled against them.
Thinking of committing suicide,
she swallowed the same drug as me but became younger instead.
That's when I met her.
And while living our lives as elementary school children,
we try to discover the identity of our enemies.
But our dear little detective
quickly forgets the situation,
and he uses his logical mind and Professor Agasa's inventions
to solve any case he finds.
He always gets me into the worst situations.
However, in music class,
he gives me the creeps for other reasons.
Come on, we're waiting for your favorite line.
My body is younger, but my mind is not!
I'll solve all the mysteries!
There's only one truth!
Kazuki Domoto?
- Do you know who he is, Shinichi? - Yes, I do.
He is the founder of the academy that was bombed last week.
To tell the truth,
I'm there right now.
He is a famous pianist,
but he suddenly took up the organ.
And for his new hall,
he had an organ brought in from an old church in Germany.
Yes, I know.
I heard that Bach himself played it.
We were invited to the opening concert
of the new Domoto Hall!
Plus,
we'll even see the rehearsal, all thanks to Sonoko!
It's true that the Suzuki construction company built it.
A piano key?
Did the explosion make it fly so far?
You should come with us, Shinichi!
We can hear a Stradivarius!
As a violinist yourself,
you said you always wanted to hear the real thing!
What is he doing?
Hey Shinichi, are you listening to me?
Yes, excuse me!
I'd like to come but I'm busy with a case.
Can't you spare some time?
They're rehearsing the day after tomorrow...
I'm sorry, I'm not coming.
The concert will be the following Tuesday.
I can't make it.
I told you, my case...
Maybe you'll have it solved by then!
I got you a ticket in case...
You don't have to do this, I'm telling you! Mind your own business!
Damn it.
Mind my own business?
No, I mean...
No, it's okay, I get it!
I'm just a stupid, meddling idiot, just good at karate!
I never said that!
Forget it.
Anyway, don't get your hopes up,
listening to a Stradivarius won't put you on the same level as Holmes!
I beg your pardon?

Yes, did you forget?
You don't have a musical ear!
Ran... Damn it...
Bye, do your best!
Mr. Fake Singing Detective!
He pisses me off!
He can only dream of getting me to invite him back, that detective freak!
She's abusing me!
Hello?
Conan?
What do you want to eat tonight?
Well...
How about some curry? Or do you have an idea?
Uh, no, curry's fine.
Great, then.
At least you're always honest!
Well, be careful and get home before it gets dark!
I will!
I'll see you later!
Only as Conan can I be honest.
Kazuki Domoto Organist and Composer
Splendid, it was perfect!
Great performance, Mr. Domoto.
The organ has a very different charm from the piano.
Well, this Kazuki Domoto deserves his fame, it was superb!
I've seen this man on TV before!
There, the one with the glasses.
Ah, that's Takumi Fuwa.
He was Mr. Domoto's only piano tuner for 35 years.
Takumi Fuwa Hall Director
And now he's the director of Domoto Hall.
But that's...
The German man facing us is Hans Müller.
He is an organ tuner.
Hans Müller Organ tuner
He's all smiles there,
but he didn't get along with Mr. Domoto at first.
And the one who translates for him
is Kazuki Domoto's son: the pianist Genya Domoto.
Genya Domoto Pianist - son of Kazuki
He's the one who organizes this concert.
And you see those two women over there?
They are Mr. Domoto's students.
The one on the right is from the 9th class of the Domoto Academy:
Lala Chigusa, soprano singer
soprano Lala Chigusa.
And this serious looking girl is from the 8th class:
Shion Yamane Violinist
Violinist Shion Yamane.
Oh yes, she is the one who replaced Soko Kawabe after her accident.
Yes, that's right.
At the time of the incident, Ms. Kawabe's Stradivarius
was being tuned,
so Shion will be able to borrow it for the concert.
And the woman in front of us, in the audience, is...
Reiko Akiba, right? The soprano singer?
Ah, you recognized her?
Well, it's normal, she's famous.
Reiko Akiba Soprano Singer
Go get ready, Shion.
Yes, I will.
- Let's start with Ave Maria. - Got it!
She's clearly not ready to play with me!
Sorry, we'll have to wait a little.
Excuse me.
We can finally hear a real Stradivarius, Ms. Sato!
I, for one, prefer the sound of the Amati...
Quiet!
No, it's not right!
It's not good at all!
You haven't improved all week!
My apologies.
Did she make a mistake?
To me it sounded perfect...
No, for a Stradivarius, the sound was too weak.
- Let's start from the beginning. - Good!
How about that? What happened?
A string broke.
Sorry, I'll change it right away!
Did you find the sound balanced?
Yes, no worries on that point.
It's really annoying!
I won't be able to sing today.
Miss Akiba, do you have a moment?
Can I go to the bathroom in peace?
Mouri.
Did you find the bomber?
No, not yet.
It was a plastic explosive, I presume?
Yes. We also found the timer.
It was set for the time of their rehearsal.
But then it was really...
I'm sorry, Mouri.
I can't give you the details of the investigation yet.
Especially in front of a child.
A child?
Go play with the other kids over there!
Yeah, yeah.
Wow, he's huge!
And he's gorgeous, as well as being tall!
Not bad, huh?
How do organs make sound?
It's the same principle
as the flutes you play at school.
See all those pipes?
The sound is produced by the air blown into each pipe,
like a flute.
By air?
But the pipes don't have holes like the flutes!
Good point.
A flute produces different sounds when you plug the holes with your finger,
but for an organ...
Each key on the keyboard is connected to a different pipe.

And each pipe can only make one sound.
And what are these buttons?
You mean these?
They're called game pulls.
Each lever makes a different sound when you pull it.
So, for example,
if I pull this one...
Ah! Trumpet!
A flute!
Organists combine these sounds
to enrich their performance.
Oh, right! I had no idea!
Well, on that note...
Here's your long-awaited quiz!
We didn't expect it.
An opera singer was scheduled to have a short surgery on his throat.
But he canceled the surgery and got better thanks to his grandfather's pills.
Which of these choices is our singer?
One: a soprano.
Two: an alto.
Three: a tenor.
Four: a bass.
That's a tough one.
Can we get a clue?
What is a surgery?
An operation.
It's short, so "op".
And the other thing,
it's the grandfather's pills.
What? Did you find it, Conan?
Yes, it's easy!
- First of all... - That's answer number one.
This is the first one, a soprano singer.
The opera singer cancelled his "opera",
so "opera" without "opera" leaves "ra".
The fees are small round things,
and "grandpa" in Japanese is called sofu.
You add that to the "ra", and there you go.
Ra.
- Sofu... - with a little round thing.
That's so-pu-ra, from soprano!
It's stupid.
Good answer, but it's not very nice...
Excuse me, Miss Akiba.
Can we talk?
Well, now... But make it quick!
Yes...
Tell us more about the message Soko Kawabe sent you.
just before the explosion.
"I don't want to stay with amateurs who don't know
"the difference between the sounds."
What is the meaning of this sentence?
What, it's very clear, right?
I've already told you everything.
I met Ms. Kawabe...
At the press conference for the upcoming concert, right?
Yes.
She went to hear the two deceased people play,
then she gave me her opinion by message.
In short,
the sound they were making didn't match her own.
And since they were unable to tell the difference between these sounds,
she couldn't play with them?
That's what I think, yes.
But why ask me?
She came to, didn't she?
She is conscious, of course...
But the trauma has made her lose all memory of the incident.
Has she?
One more thing.
We found this at the crime scene.
The body of a flute!
Yes.
This is one of the three parts that make up a flute:
the mouthpiece, the body and the foot.
At first we thought that a student had forgotten it, but...
It would be weird to forget just one piece!
Does anything come to mind?
Miss Akiba?
No, nothing special.
Are you done?
Wait, Miss Akiba!
What's in there?
What are you drinking?
- Tea. - Can I have some?
No.
Radine!
Is it a special herbal tea good for the throat?
What do you care?
Maybe if we drink it, we'll win the singing contest!
- Singing contest? - Yes!
All the classes in the school will compete.
Oh, yes!
Could you teach us to sing?
Could you?
At 2 pm the day after tomorrow,
We're going to practice in the school music room.
Ran will play the piano for us.
But our instructor is a disaster.
Hey, you brats!
I'm the disaster?
No, I mean...
- How am I a disaster, huh? - Sorry, don't mind me.
You won't play the Ninth Symphony, will you?
I really hate it.
We're not going to sing nine songs!
Just the Teitan school anthem!
The Ninth Symphony,
it's Beethoven's Symphony No. 9.
Is it?
Okay, I'll be your instructor.
I also went to Teitan Elementary School.
Oh, you did?
But leave me alone for now, you're bothering me.
Okay, well...
I'm glad she said yes, but...
She's too much of a snob, that old woman!
A little bit, yes...

She really thinks she is a queen.
Yes...
She looks like you, a little bit.
Well, I mean...
Because she is pretty...
I can't tell if she's nice or not.
That's for sure...
But maybe...
she made us go out so we wouldn't bother Shion.
Right? No, you're looking too far...
You think so?
0-15 !
You're exaggerating... I'm just starting out, take it easy!
A lion puts all his strength even to chase a rabbit.
Yes, I know,
I'm just a little rabbit next to you!
Oh, we should do a double up sometime!
Against Makoto and Shinichi!
Shinichi?
That detective freak...
No way!
Oh, I see, you two had a falling out.
Couples fight all the time.
It's not that!
It's a roller coaster with you!
You fight, you make up...
Except for one time when it lasted a long time!
You didn't talk to her for a week.
Didn't you? When was that?
You know, when we were twelve...
Oh yes, I remember!
We were fighting...
Hm? What was it about?
Do you remember how you made peace?
You've forgotten everything, actually!
No, wait...
Wait, pause!
You were angry but you were going home together?
Well, we lived in the same direction.
Never mind, continue.
Then there was a song.
We heard a song coming from the river.
And it made me forget my anger.
So you made peace.
What was the song?
I don't remember...
Strange, it was a well-known song.
Well then?
But, how can I say?
His song had touched my heart.
Beyond the green hills
Until the echo of the mountains
We sing with a smile
Under a shining sun
Music room
Let's engrave it in our hearts
And seize our future
Teitan
Teitan
Teitan Elementary School!
So, what do you think of their song?
Well...
Already, you there!
You sing too loud.
Adjust your voice to the others.
And you, to the freckles.
You may sing well,
you sometimes have the spirit elsewhere.
Is it the girl on the diagonal in front that occupies your thoughts?
The girl on the diagonal...
It's Haibara, right?
By the way, kid.
You sing very well,
but sing more like a child!
I'm not a child, so no.
Hello...
You just sing
and with energy, that's very good!
You're trying too hard to imitate others.
- Be more confident. - She is strong.
She didn't look it, but she listened to all of us.
Yes, she really has a musical ear.
The problem is...
is you!
Uh... what?
You sang out of tune from beginning to end!
You wouldn't do it on purpose?
Uh, no...
He's not doing it on purpose!
Conan just sucks at singing!
You're pushing me too far...
It's awful.
The same goes for the piano.
The sound is way too low.
It must be out of tune.
- It isn't? - Yes, it is.
I hadn't noticed...
I thought the same thing.
That woman...
Miss Akiba, you have an absolute ear for it?
Yes, I do.
What is the absolute ear?
It is the ability to recognize, hearing a sound,
to which note it corresponds.
For example...
E5, E.
B3 and F5, B and F.
That's correct.
Wow!
That's why you sing so well!
Go figure.
I'm not sure it's absolutely necessary for a musician.
I was born with it,
but some get it through practice.
That's the case for Mr. Fuwa, the former piano tuner, I think.
Anyway, I gave you my advice.
Practice on your own now.
If you improve, I will come back to listen to you.
Are you leaving already?
We would have liked to hear an example first.
Yes !
How much are you offering me?
Professionals
don't sing without being paid.
See you later.
Found it, it's for me!
Hey, that's my tea!
Cheers!
Oh, but oh...
What's wrong, Genta?
My throat... It hurts!
Genta!
You okay, Genta?
Somebody...
must have poured something down it.
You think so?
No...

It can't be...
- Let's take him to the hospital. - Let's do that.
You think Genta's gonna be okay?
He looked like he was having trouble breathing.
Yes, and his eyes were red...
When was the last time you drank tea?
Before noon, I think.
Where did you drink it?
At Domoto Academy.
I reserved a room to practice my singing.
I went to the bathroom when I left,
and I left the thermos with my things
in the room, unattended.
If someone put something in it, it must have been at that time.
But who could have done that?
Thank you for everything.
Genta!
You doing okay?
No, not so much.
What did the doctors say?
His throat is very inflamed,
but in four or five days he'll be better.
- So he will get better! - Phew!
But on the other hand,
he won't be able to use his voice during that time.
Yeah.
The concert at Domoto Hall will take place in three days.
If it was Miss Reiko who drank it,
she wouldn't have been able to sing.
We should call the inspector
to have the contents of the thermos examined.
I'll take it to him.
But first...
Don't worry, we'll take him home!
- I'll go too. - And me.
I have two words to say to his parents.
He drank my tea without asking. Nice education, that!
Excuse me...
Genta...
Don't be sad, Genta!
Four days will pass quickly!
I wish... some grandpa...
to have some pills... for me.
It's true, it's like the teacher's quiz.
Step aside.
No... Run!
Faster!
Damn, I can't see his head!
Quick, turn right!
What's wrong?
Are you all right?
Damn it!
- Are you okay? - No, I'm fine.
He's not fine, this one!
He was going the wrong way!
Hey, lady!
Your leg is bleeding.
It's nothing.
Did he choose to brake when he saw the cab?
Unless...
Well, I'm sorry, but I'll let you drive them home.
I'll take this cab home.
You can tell the police everything.
Are you leaving?
Obviously you bring me bad luck!
I am not!
She's not nice.
Inspector!
- Any information on the cause? - Yeah, we do.
Looks like there was a propane leak,
and a match set it off.
And there is evidence
that the gas detector was destroyed.
So this is not an accident, but a murder.
The deceased is the owner of the store:
Osamu Shida, 36 years old.
Mr. Shida was a violinist
and was a member of the first class at Domoto Academy.
First class?
Same as the two victims in the first incident...
It can't be a coincidence.
No, it's not.
Officer Sato!
We found this inside.
What is it?
A flute leg.
No doubt about it.
This is a serial killer.
And the culprit
is leaving us a message.
The body and the foot of a flute...
The mouthpiece is still missing.
The killer
will strike again.
This is about the man who fell from a paraglider
and drowned at sea yesterday, Mr. Hisao Sone...
I heard, yes, he was playing the viola I think.
He was also a graduate of the first class.
- So that means... - Just about.
Mizumi and Renjo, last week's victims,
and Shida who passed away the day before yesterday were all in his class.
And apparently,
they were a piano quartet until two years ago.
So is this the work of the same killer?
Everything seems to point to it.
The prefectural police discovered traces
of small knife cuts on the fabric of the wing and the canopy.
But above all,
under the seat of Mr. Some's car...
You found a part of a flute,
the mouthpiece, right?
Uh... yeah.
The good thing is that if we found all three parts,
there shouldn't be any more murders, right?
That's what we're hoping.
- About your case, Ran... - What about it?
Regarding the contents of the thermos you gave us...
The test results are clear.
A powerful drug was mixed in with the drink.
This is more than just a prank.
What about the truck that hit us ?

It is a stolen vehicle nearby.
In short, the culprit wanted to use a drug
to hurt Ms. Akiba, but he missed.
Then he made another attempt by stealing a truck
to chase her this time.
All this in order to prevent Miss Akiba from singing at the concert
at the Domoto Hall.
Tell me,
if Miss Reiko can't sing at the concert,
who will take her place?
It would probably be Lala Chigusa.
She was the first candidate for soprano,
since she is a student of Mr. Domoto
s pupil, as well as being in the 9th class of his academy.
But in the end,
Soko Kawabe, who had already been selected,
recommended Miss Akiba
with whom she wanted to play, although she had never met her.
And that's how the roles were decided.
Now, our other problem,
is to find the link with the 4 victims.
So far, we haven't found anything
we haven't found anything that connects Ms. Akiba to the other four.
All we have,
is a connection between Ms. Kawabe and the first two victims.
They were rehearsing together, right?
The bomb under the floor was placed close to
to where the two victims were.
You mean to say
that Ms. Kawabe was only involved by chance?
We can't be sure of that.
Ms. Kawabe had reason to be targeted.
Are you thinking of Lala Chigusa who was not selected?
Yes, but not only that.
There's also Shion Yamane who's going to replace her at the concert.
What, her too?
Yes.
She could borrow Ms. Kawabe's Stradivarius
to play a concert with a world famous musician.
If her performance is successful,
she will make a name for herself internationally.
But there is still a suspect!
Shion is Mr. Domoto's favorite.
What if he chose Miss Kawabe
not for her talent, but for her Stradivarius,
and he really wanted to select Shion?
Then he would have made sure that Ms. Kawabe was injured
so that Shion could replace her by playing his Stradivarius.
That's one possibility.
I'm confused about all this relationship stuff.
Basically...
Lala Chigusa had reasons to pick on Ms. Kawabe and Reiko.
Mr. Domoto and Shion, on the other hand, have a just motive for Ms. Kawabe.
But none of the three had a reason to kill the other four.
Is that right?
Well, yes, that's right.
Right!
The piano that was in the room where the explosion took place,
was there anything special about it?
No, not that I know of.
Why do you ask?
Well, the other day I went there,
and I saw Mr. Fuwa collecting all the pieces carefully,
so I wondered if it was valuable, or what.
No but oh!
You're done hanging around, right?
I'm sorry.
Actually, this piano
was the one Mr. Domoto played at home for 30 years.
And when he stopped playing piano,
he brought it to the academy for the students to use.
And the whole time he was at Mr. Domoto's house
but also afterwards, at the academy,
it was Mr. Fuwa who took care of the piano.
It must be like a child to him.
Do you understand, microbe?
Here, but by the way,
Mr. Fuwa was apparently upset with the quartet.
He didn't approve of their way of life, I think.
Yes, but that's not
a good enough reason to want to kill them!
No, that's for sure.
Even if he did kill them
because their lifestyle made him angry,
this time it's with Ms. Akiba that he has no connection.
Oh yes...
Inspector.
The murders and Ms. Akiba's case may not be connected.
But so many incidents around Mr. Domoto at the same time,
it can't be a coincidence!
No, it's not.
Anyway.
I wanted that at least until the concert
someone to protect Miss Akiba,
and I sent Takagi, but...
Well, it's just that...
She told me to leave because I was getting her drunk...
Pff!
Seriously, Takagi?
If Miss Reiko gets attacked again,
you're going to take the fall!

But she said she would stay home today and tomorrow!
Imbecile!
You shouldn't have given in so easily!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
See you later.
Conan!
Hello, Conan.
Hello !
What are you doing here so early?
We are going to see Kamen Yaiba.
Kamen Yaiba?
We got a confidential tip that
they're going to shoot at Ryokuchi Park by the Teimusu River.
That should cheer up Genta.
He doesn't seem to be that depressed.
So we came to ask you to come...
Are you going somewhere?
Yes, I have a thing to do.
What thing?
I do what I want, right?
Is that more important to you than your friendship with Genta?
OK, I'll tell you.
I'm going to Miss Reiko's.
Miss Reiko's? That's a bad idea!
She'll get angry again.
Yes, I suspect so, but hey.
I have to protect her from that other creep!
The creep? The one in the truck the other day ?
Why is it your job to protect her ?
That's right, here.
I don't really know why either,
but I don't feel like doing nothing.
He says it must be love.
It's true that you like older women.
But no, nonsense!
Anyway, I'll let you take care of Genta!
Thank you!
Conan!
Does this mean he's counting on us?
Yes, I think so.
Yes ?
Hello, Miss Reiko!
I'm going in!
Hey, wait!
Your place is cool!
And the neighborhood looks quiet.
Hey, you!
What kind of manners are you using? You don't enter people's homes like that.
What do you want?
I came to ask you to give me a singing lesson!
Oh, that's right, it's you...
the little one who sang out of tune.
I can't, today.
Yes I know!
The day before a concert or an important recording,
I heard that you were going to take some fresh air in the forest.
So why did you come, if you know?
Can I come with you?
What nerve! Have you forgotten what I said?
Nothing but trouble has happened to me since I've been hanging out with you!
You say that, but in fact,
it's us you want to protect.
Because you are sure that the culprit is after you alone.
And the other time, if you wanted to come to Genta's,
it wasn't to complain to his parents,
but to make sure he was okay.
Are you done talking nonsense?
Oh yeah, can I have a soda before I go?
I'm thirsty!
You're unbelievable!
I only have 100% pure orange juice,
so don't complain.
Okay, I'm good.
A flute...
And this man...
Hey!
You're too young to be poking around in women's things.
Do you play the flute too, Miss Reiko?
Mind your own business!
Drink this and go home!
I won't give you a lesson,
and I won't take you to the forest!
Alright then.
Don't mind me, I'm going there too!
You, then...
If you get lost, it won't be my fault!
I won't get lost!
Inspector Megure!
I found the link between Miss Akiba and the other four.
What is it?
In January, three years ago..,
the four victims were in a lodge at the academy, in Izu,
and a flutist who was with them
got drunk and fell off a cliff.
He didn't survive.
Hikaru Soma, died at 28 years old.
He was the 6th class at Domoto Academy.
You think they have him...
No.
They forced him to drink alcohol, and he didn't normally drink...
But they had nothing to do with his fall,
and the case was closed as an accident.
I see.
And what does this have to do with Miss Akiba?
Well, this Mr. Soma
was Ms. Akiba's fiancé.
What's that?
Inspector.
It's indeed likely that she was angry with them,
but then why was she attacked so?
Kamen Yaiba, Yaiba!
Just call her name
Kamen Yaiba, Yaiba!
And he runs to save us
Hello !
Hello.
Morning.
Do you think this is his mother?
They don't look alike!
Why are they walking away from each other?
She must have scolded him!
Dirty brats!
Say...
You know why I always go

walking in the forest before a concert?
I want to soak up nature.
Western music
was born in a green environment.
Do you understand?
Yes...
I do.
Are you alright, Miss Reiko?
Yes.
Come on, let's go!
Go ahead!
My doubts are confirmed!
Damn it!
He's going to shoot!
Miss Reiko, this way!
Why did he do that?
Why didn't he shoot?
What does he want, anyway?
Hey...
Are you sure you don't want to go to the police?
Yes.
I told you, if I go to the police...
It'll take a long time and it could interfere with your concert tomorrow.
I understand, but...
If you understand, don't say any more.
I'll go to them as soon as the concert is over.
Do you understand?
Yes...
Detective Takagi?
Miss Akiba... and Conan?
Miss Akiba, where have you been?
You weren't supposed to go out!
I was on a date with that kid.
What?
Miss Akiba.
- We have some questions for... - Some other time.
It's about Hikaru Soma.
You were engaged, weren't you?
Detective.
I'll tell you everything I know.
But please wait until the concert is over.
Say, Inspector...
This Mr. Soma, does he have a mole here?
Yes... But how do you know?
I saw a picture of him in Miss Reiko's room.
Didn't you?
You went into her room?
I have an idea, take me home.
I'll tell you everything.
And so we walked him home...
But in the end, all he knew
was that Miss Akiba had a picture of him next to a flute.
This one, then...
That said, Inspector,
even if she had a motive for killing the four victims,
it doesn't mean she killed them.
Besides, she was chased by a truck herself.
Say, this Mr. Soma,
didn't he have any family or relatives who would want to avenge him too?
No, no one...
Here, I made some tea.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Ran.
Here you go.
I was saying...
His mother wasn't married, and she died five years ago.
No siblings.
What about the father?
We know nothing about him,
not even if he is still alive or not.
Hikaru Soma (28 years old) Mother deceased, father unknown
But this is...
The four victims
had a tendency to cause trouble.
Once, they played drunk at a concert,
and Mr Domoto gave them a hard time.
What? What? What? When did this happen?
Uh, I'm looking!
Here it is!
That was a year ago,
they were playing a piano quartet by Beethoven.
I got it all figured out, Detective.
I know who killed them,
who injured Miss Kawabe
and attacked Miss Akiba.
As well as his motive!
Is that true, Mouri?
Yes.
The culprit...
It was you, Genya Domoto!
Why do you ask?
Because you're a Beethoven fan.
And not just a fan!
You're a real maniac!
Wow...
What are you talking about?
You killed those four people
because they played Beethoven while drunk.
That's a real insult to the great composer.
And you hurt Ms. Kawabe's feelings
because you played a piece with her in the past
you quarreled violently over her performance.
Ms. Kawabe wrote about it in detail in an essay.
And finally, you attacked Ms. Akiba
because during the rehearsal...
You won't play the Ninth Symphony, right?
I really hate her.
She criticized Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
Wait a minute!
I admit I love Beethoven,
and I respect him, yes,
but to call me a maniac!
No, I'm sure you don't!
The fact that you have the same haircut
is proof of that!
Err... Mouri?
Are you kidding me?
I was born with this haircut!
I got it from my dead mother!
If you don't believe me...
Look at this!
Oh, it's true.
It's the same cup.
What do you think?
For the four victims and Miss Akiba,
I don't have any motive since I'm not a raving fan!
As for Miss Kawabe, she's a fellow musician.
We each have our own vision of things,

so yes, we do debate it sometimes!
But it only concerns our art,
we are not going to hate each other for so little!
It's more than ridiculous!
But, uh... It's just that...
Inspector!
It's to make us listen to this nonsense
that you came to disturb us in the middle of the night?
And we have a very important concert tomorrow!
Yes, I am aware of that.
I'm going to ask you to leave!
You can question us as much as you like
once the concert is over!
I was so sure of myself...
One wonders where he got his confidence from...
Say, Detective Takagi...
Miss Kawabe still doesn't remember anything?
No, not yet.
She's better and can hold a conversation now, but...
She says the air conditioner is making a weird noise that's keeping her awake,
and other crazy stuff like that.
A weird noise?
Maybe...
They'll play the same thing they played tonight,
and we can sit wherever we want in the empty room,
so it's worth going to the dress rehearsal.
Tonight we'll be sitting upstairs.
I insisted on it with Dad!
Wow, balcony seating?
There are exactly ten seats,
so it's perfect for us!
What do you mean?
I invited Professor Agasa and the kids, too.
And don't forget Shinichi!
You tell him, okay?
I'll give his ticket to the reception.
Don't bother about him...
Yes, come on! We won't waste his place.
Well, okay...
But I don't think he'll come.
Forgive me, Ran.
It seems like you didn't tell the police about yesterday.
Thank you for that.
It's okay, but...
- Is your leg okay? - It's fine.
It will not bother me to sing.
Say...
Soko Kawabe had an absolute ear too?
Yes.
I discovered it when we met,
that's why we hit it off.
Why did you do that?
No, nothing.
All right, I'll go.
Well, I'm off.
Good luck for the concert.
Miss Reiko and Kawabe both had absolute pitch.
Did you...
He didn't answer the phone so I texted him.
Okay. I hope he can come.
I hope he can come.
I don't care if he comes or not!
It would just be a waste.
- I just said that! - I'm sorry, I can't find him...
He can't?
Well, too bad!
We'll start without him.
Is there a problem?
Ah, Mr. Mouri...
Mr. Müller didn't come.
What's the matter? The organ tuner?
He was supposed to come and tune it before the general rehearsal.
That doesn't suit us!
He doesn't answer his cell phone,
and they haven't seen him at the hotel since last night.
Since last night?
Well, he just had to finish up.
It's not a big deal if he doesn't show up either.
But it means he's missing!
Have you notified the police?
No.
We don't have time to waste answering their questions.
We have to concentrate on the concert now!
Shion looks like a completely different person.
Yes.
That voice...
That was something, Shion's violin!
Yes, nothing like the first rehearsal!
She's really taken on the sound of the Stradivarius.
Don't be a smart ass!
And Miss Reiko too, what a voice!
Conan!
You're so early.
We can't get in if we're even a minute late!
We asked the teacher to bring us in early.
What do you have there?
Is that a flute?
Are you stupid or what?
It's not right to bring that to a classical music concert!
Don't get mad.
Genta can't talk,
but he wants to be able to make some noise.
That's no reason.
He's not going to blow in the concert, of course.
Right, Genta?
That's a yes.
All right, but hide it inside!
And no cell phones either!
They know that.
I even made them leave their detective badges.
Hey, we're hungry.
Well, we could go for a snack.
Good idea.
The concert's at 5:00,
and we don't want our tummies growling!
He says he wants a bowl of rice with eel!

It would be nice to find a way to talk to each other like that.
Oh, but it's doable,
if we change the notes to letters.
- Change the notes... - into letters?
But you have to know every note,
it would be too hard for Kojima.
Something's bothering me about this sound...
Ran, I just remembered that I have something to do.
Don't worry, I'll be back before the concert!
Wait, Conan!
He's got a mind of his own, this one!
That sound!
It's weird, isn't it?
Yes, I agree.
I felt it when I was singing.
I found the key that is the problem,
but not the drawstring,
because there were several of them pulled out.
Yes, it is slightly too low,
I'm sure it is.
It was coming from that area there.
I think it's one of the little pipes at the bottom.
There's only one that's wrong.
We have to fix it before the concert.
But nobody knows where Mr. Müller is, right?
No... I'll tell Mr. Domoto.
He doesn't seem to be here.
No...
Maybe he went for a cup of tea.
Or maybe he's over there...
But I'm surprised you heard that sound.
I have good ears!
It takes more than good hearing!
Maybe you have absolute pitch, too.
If only!
Mr. Domoto is nowhere to be found...
Do you have any other idea where to find him?
Let's see...
Maybe you were right about the tea...
Miss Akiba is still not here?
No...
And she doesn't answer her cell phone.
I asked the staff to look for her, but...
She hasn't disappeared, I hope!
I don't know.
First Mr. Müller, and now her!
What's the meaning of this?
The concert starts in 15 minutes.
If she doesn't show up...
Let me replace her.
With what happened to Miss Kawabe,
I was afraid a similar thing would happen again,
so I've been practicing all this time.
Well, but...
Please, Teacher!
I'll sing better than Ms. Akiba, I assure you!
There's no need to try to outdo her.
Music is a gift from the gods.
Your singing must be a prayer.
Finally, Shinichi didn't come.
But I am especially worried about Conan!
It will start soon...
I really wonder where he could have gone.
But it's Conan, there is nothing to worry about!
I believe in him!
You're right.
He trusts us, so it's our turn to believe in him.
It's okay, he'll come, that's for sure.
Your attention, please.
Due to an unforeseen event,
Reiko Akiba's performance must unfortunately be cancelled.
She will be replaced by Lala Chigusa, from the 9th class of Domoto Academy.
We apologize and count on your understanding.
But why?
She sang so well at the dress rehearsal!
I hope nothing happened to her and Shinichi...
A tarp?
What is it?
Miss Reiko! Miss Reiko!
What? What is it?
Where are we?
We must've followed the canal.
The person who attacked us
must have dropped us from the lake behind Domoto Hall.
Who could have done this?
I don't know.
And why bother putting us in a boat?
Anyway, we have to hurry up before the concert starts!
But...
Even if we swim over,
that wall is too high for us to climb.
Hey!
Hey!
Looks like nobody's home.
But look, isn't that a phone over there?
If we could reach it, we could call for help.
Wait!
Even if we can't reach it,
we can call if we pick up the phone!
How do you want to do that?
When you call with a landline phone,
the keys make noise, right?
This is called the DTMF code.
Each key emits a pair of frequencies
to determine the number to call.
So if we reproduce this sound...
We can call, right?
The police is 110.
For the number 1, it's 697 Hz and 1 209 Hz.
And to make 0, you need a combination of 941 Hz and 1336 Hz.
That will do,
I remember from memory the sound of each key.
But you have to pick up the handset first.

I'll take care of that!
The problem is,
if you wait too long after you take it off,
we won't be able to call.
In short, we only have one shot.
If we miss,
we have to wait for someone to find us.
I don't have time to waste.
We'll have to try!
Let's go for an express rehearsal, then!
What was that?
An explosion?
Did something explode?
It's coming from the Domoto Room!
No...
We are in West Tama, at the Music Forest.
We have just witnessed
two explosions at Domoto Hall!
At the far left of the hall,
and towards the artists' box, center right.
The concert started five minutes ago.
We still don't know...
One more...
Quick, the zero now!
That'll do it.
Let's get closer.
There, that's fine! Stop moving!
Now how are you going to pick up the receiver?
You'll see.
Oh, my God!
Now!
This is the 110, police department.
What's up? Miss Akiba and Conan?
Yes.
They were knocked out and put in a boat
and released them into the canal.
They're at the West Tama water tank.
There they are!
I see them, there they are!
Did it come from the hall?
Yes.
There are already more than ten explosions.
The outer pillars have been hit,
but we don't know the cause.
Somebody planted bombs.
I don't know if they're detonators or timers,
but it's definitely the work of the killer of the four victims.
Yes, I think so.
He killed the first victims with bombs.
Yeah, but...
why did he only get away without killing us?
Is this...
Here we go again.
Hey, hey, hey!
Can't we call the ward?
Ran and Uncle are inside!
Our calls aren't getting through.
Whoever did this must have cut the lines.
- What about the cell phones? - We can't.
People turn off their phones in the room,
and there's no service inside.
And then I think
people inside have nothing.
The concert hall is completely isolated from noise.
They may not even have heard the explosions.
So it's possible that the concert will go on?
In my opinion, yes.
But there is no guarantee that the interior will be spared.
After a while...
No.
This may be happening already!
Ran...
Good evening, everyone.
Thank you for joining us tonight.
I'm Kazuki Domoto.
As you know..,
...we're inaugurating this organ tonight...
Hurry, this way! Hurry up!
Let's get busy! Bring the fire hose!
It's terrible.
But the central hall is not affected.
The public is surely safe!
It is too early to rejoice.
All the outside entrances are blocked!
We can't go and rescue them!
Oh no!
And we don't know which pillar will explode next.
There are 23 outer pillars in total.
Maybe they'll all blow up.
What the hell can we do?
We're going to have to go in through the roof.
Can we do that?
For now, yes.
But there's no helipad.
I don't know if the roof will hold the weight of the chopper.
Understood.
Get us as close as you can.
We'll jump.
I'll guide you.
It's not easy to get to the third floor from the roof.
So, there you go.
But it's too...
We don't have time to argue about it!
We have to hurry before there are more explosions!
Further down!
A little more!
A little more!
A little more!
I can't go any lower!
The air current is too strong,
the chopper's not stable!
If you're going to jump, do it quickly!
Come on, Miss Akiba.
All right, Conan.
Stay in the chopper and...
Conan.
No, I'm going, too.
I'm staying until Ran and the others are safe.
Conan!
Besides, I saw the killer's face!
I don't know if he's the bomber..,
but I saw who knocked us out!
Maybe he's inside, so I'm coming in!
Hurry up, I can't hold on!
No choice, we'll take him.

- Hurry, Takagi! - Yes!
This is the 3rd floor hallway.
But we just went straight down!
You wouldn't have let me come if it weren't for that.
And the same for him!
Did you really see the culprit's face?
I can't believe it.
You warned us,
but it's crazy that they didn't hear anything!
Yes.
Let's start looking for the bombs.
We can't evacuate all these people at once.
And if the objective is to blow up the whole building,
there's bound to be bombs in there, too.
Got it.
Conan.
You and Miss Akiba stay here.
Right, sir.
-Let's get going. -Yes, sir.
Ran...
Hold on.
What about inside?
What's the situation inside?
The culprit...
must know the room well...
and know where to plant the bombs.
I'm sure it's a staff member.
This sound is really not normal!
I'm sure Mr. Domoto would have realized that if it were a piano,
but two years of practice,
it's not enough for him to know the difference.
The difference?
"...amateurs who can't tell the difference between sounds."
So that was it!
Miss Kawabe had made the difference
with her absolute ear.
But...
Then why did that person...
No, if that's the case...
But if that's the case,
why her?
Her mother was not married...
I see, everything is explained!
But what does the difference in sound have to do with bombs?
Say, I just thought of something.
The moment when the explosions stopped
is the same time as when Mr. Domoto was supposed to appear.
Maybe it was so that the audience wouldn't hear anything...
No, that's not it!
There are no explosions when he's not playing.
I see!
Hence the difference in sound!
Again with the sound.
How many times is that?
Since the beginning of the concert,
how many times has there been that false sound?
Uh, let's see...
Twice during the Ave Maria at the beginning.
Then during the cantata...
Ten times.
And in this piece, eight times.
That's twenty times altogether.
So it has to stay four times.
The sound is connected to the explosions.
That's why
there were no explosions during his speech!
There are 23 pillars outside the room.
So...
For all the pillars and the inside,
it takes 24 explosions in all!
But then...
Yes.
If we don't stop the concert before the 24th time,
the bomb inside the hall will explode!
Again with the sound!
Damn it!
It's definitely connected to that sound!
Whoever did it must be watching from the audience!
Again!
I've got you.
That's our culprit!
- Okay, I'm going to go stop him! - Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
If you stop him,
he will activate his detonator.
I saw it, the culprit is holding a remote control!
But...
What can we do?
How can we stop the concert without attracting his attention?
Isn't there any way to stop the explosion?
Three minutes.
Would that be enough time?
Well, yes, but...
Then I'm counting on you, little detective.
It's Miss Reiko!
That song...
It's Amazing Grace.
You're too late!
So it was Miss Reiko
I heard that day!
I should have eliminated her too.
You couldn't.
Everything but that voice that touches people's hearts.
That's why you hesitated.
Besides, that song,
it was your son Hikaru Soma's favorite.
And then,
the one who sings it is the woman he loved.
The key to this mystery was the difference in sound.
At first I thought it was due to a bad tuning,
but it wasn't.
Inside one of the pipes of the organ
was hidden a small sensor that perceived the air coming out of it.
That's why the sound that came out of it was strange.
When the sensor perceives a current of air in the pipe
it sends to the bombs
signals in a certain order.
And when the last bomb explodes,
the whole room will collapse.
If nothing exploded during the rehearsal,
it's because the device wasn't activated.
Am I wrong?

Mr. Director of the hall
and former piano tuner,
Takumi Fuwa.
Nothing here either.
We're really in trouble...
At this rate it'll blow up before we get it...
Quiet!
What's that noise?
Don't move!
Police!
Mr. Müller!
How did you...
...did you know it was me?
The absolute ear.
You're supposed to have it,
but you didn't say anything during the rehearsal.
I found that suspicious.
I see.
And how did you know I was Hikaru's father?
From your license plate.
52-83.
That's your son's birth date.
You wanted to keep in touch with the son you loved,
but in all discretion.
And also,
in the photo of you, as a young man, that I saw at Mr. Domoto's,
you were the spitting image of him.
You killed the four musicians
to avenge your son who died in an accident.
And the pieces of flute left behind
were to make the police believe that there were three crimes.
You also made sure to hurt Soko Kawabe
for fear that with her absolute ear
she would hear the difference in sound.
You wouldn't be afraid of someone with this gift
if you didn't have it too.
Therefore, you were the only possible culprit.
And for the last one...
Reiko Akiba also has absolute hearing.
But...
Since she was engaged to your dead son,
you couldn't bring yourself
to use a dangerous method, like with Soko.
Therefore,
you used a drug,
then the truck, and an air gun.
To prevent her from going on stage,
depriving her of her voice
or wound her in the leg was enough.
An improv?
What?
Why?
Why?
Oh, it's not going to explode.
Before I came here,
I removed the sensor from inside the pipe.
Three minutes...
Even two was enough!
I'm impressed with you, boy.
What was your name again?
Conan Edogawa.
Detective.
Well done! Bravo!
There he is!
He has a detonator.
Then it's him!
What should we do?
- Should we go before he activates it? -No!
He'll set off the bomb as soon as he sees us coming!
What can we do, then?
There...
From this place, we should be able to do it.
Get to what?
Shoot him.
Before he pulls the trigger.
Sorry, little detective.
I can detonate the bomb with this remote.
You lose.
You sure about this?
It's not a done deal yet.
Are you kidding me?
I don't know how you got in here,
but since the police haven't arrived yet,
I'm assuming the outside is on fire as predicted
and they are blocked.
I didn't expect the sensor to be removed,
but what does it matter?
I'll be able to choose the moment of the explosion, just like that.
This will be my parting gift to you:
you will join the other world while listening to them play.
Damn, that broke it!
You'll die playing that organ you love so much,
Kazuki Domoto!
Conan!
I can't shoot with him in front!
That's it, then.
Hurry up and play again, Domoto!
What should I do?
If I can't anesthetize him...
Find another way!
Move, Conan!
Please!
Lend it to me.
My flute!
Hey, I'm talking!
That's it, go ahead...
No !
This is the end, little detective!
In your dreams!
E, A, A, F?
"Shoot"... A shot!
What was that sound?
The end of the game whistle!
What?
Police, freeze!
I admit defeat.
Mr. Fuwa.
Where is the last bomb?
In the ceiling above the stage.
Takagi, call the inspector.
Yes, sir.
If it's not too much trouble,
could you let me listen to the concert until the end?
I promise to tell you all about it afterwards.
I understand.
The fire is finally starting to die down here,
- so we're gonna be able to... - Inspector!
A passageway has been cleared on the east side.
Good, let's go.
I'll call you back.
Hey...
Why did you put a bomb in the room?

For 35 years, I have been...
Kazuki Domoto's only piano tuner.
We went through life together.
But two years ago,
he suddenly decided to stop playing piano.
And he asked me
to become the director of the hall he would take 2 years to build.
Of course, I could have refused.
I was free to continue tuning pianos.
But after 35 years of service
with Kazuki Domoto,
a world-renowned pianist, I simply could not be interested in
interested in other pianists.
My pride forbade me to do so.
Nevertheless, I am only a craftsman.
I am not made for the job of a director.
I was torn by despair.
During these two years,
my wife died of an illness.
And a year later, I lost my son in an accident.
When I also lost my job as a tuner,
I lost my last reason to live.
There was nothing left for me now.
Even the music I loved so much,
had become an unbearable noise for my ears.
Yes...
I woke up one night
after hearing this despicable sound in my dreams,
and I made my decision.
I had to make it all go away.
All to get my nights back to normal!
Of course I was going to eliminate my son's murderers,
that selfish Domoto,
his room and his organ that stole his interest in the piano,
as well as those who would come to listen to his organ:
the audience and the musicians who came from all over the world.
I accepted the position of director of Domoto Hall.
It was the ideal position
to tamper with the organ
and place bombs in the hall.
On the other hand,
I still felt sorry for the piano
abandoned like me by Domoto.
But then...
If you blew it up in the rehearsal hall,
was it because you loved that piano?
My story is now over.
It's about time...
Get Domoto in here!
Mr. Fuwa, please stay calm!
Don't worry.
I'm trying to kill myself.
I have no intention of hurting you.
Conan,
leave the room.
I will not!
I will not let you die without repenting for your crimes!
That would be unfair!
Conan!
Mr. Fuwa, don't do anything foolish!
Be quiet!
Send for Domoto, I said!
Fuwa.
I'm here, sir.
Mr. Domoto!
Fuwa, I owe you an apology.
I didn't know that it tormented you so much.
Do you finally realize that?
- Because of your selfishness, I... - It's not what you think.
The reason I stopped playing piano
it's because your tuning wasn't what it used to be.
I didn't want to hurt your pride,
so I never told you.
But after all these years,
I couldn't see myself looking for another tuner either.
That's why I stopped playing it.
Nonsense! I have an absolute ear for it!
Yes, that's true indeed.
But age has not spared your hearing.
Without realizing it,
you sometimes misadjusted certain sounds.
No...
It's not true... You are lying!
If I had known what you would do,
I would have told you the truth.
For that, I am sorry.
It's too late to apologize!
It's all your fault!
It's not true!
If my best friend did something like that to me
I'd think she must have a good reason for doing it.
And I'd think that maybe she's not doing it for herself,
but for my sake!
That's what I would think.
Because in the end,
she is my friend and I trust her.
It's the same for me!
There were really explosions outside!
We didn't notice anything at all.
I heard Conan helped the rescue workers.
I knew it!
That's what I said, right?
I'm surprised that Shinichi understood your message on the flute.
Musical notes converted into letters,
it happens in detective stories.
According to the German appellation, the note "si" corresponds to H,
but he knows that my mother was English.
In English, the "si" corresponds to the B, and so on.
He must have instantly deduced that I was using English.
And for the rest, I relied on his absolute ear.
Oh, I see.

And I also trusted him.
We are partners.
I was sure that Beethoven was the culprit!
Are you still stuck on that?
Apart from that, he never showed up,
this madman of investigations.
What, Shinichi?
Who cares about him?
Shall we go back, Conan?
Strange, he was here a minute ago!
What's up?
Can you hear that?
Ah, violin!
It's Amazing Grace, yes!
Not that, that way of playing...
What's that?
Shinichi?
Wait, Ran!
Shinichi?
Shinichi?
If you're looking for Shinichi, he's gone.
Conan!
He had a case.
Then he was well there!
Yes.
He heard Miss Reiko singing,
and it reminded him of three years ago.
So he took this violin backstage
to play this piece.
He said he wanted to
to play for you and for himself.
Shinichi said he wasn't nice to you.
Did you have a fight?
No, we didn't!
It's nothing, don't worry.
You may have come, but I don't forgive you!
What an idiot!
The things lost during the summer
The days spent by your side
Your bright smile like a clean shirt
I can't forget them
In the middle of the night I wanted to hear your voice
I typed your number mechanically
But I didn't have the courage to talk to you
And I embraced my sadness
Spreading my wings, I leave to join you
Sighing softly
It was for you and no one else
That I loved you
The sun setting over us on the bay
A half a can of soda in hand
Shoulder to shoulder we told each other our dreams
I thought back to that day
Friday night we would rush to your room
I wasn't the same then
People jostled each other on a narrow road
The blues permeated the city
Spreading my wings, I'm off to join you
Sighing softly
It was for you and nobody else
That I loved you
Spreading my wings I'm going to join you
Sighing softly
It was for you and no one else
That I loved you
I used to come here with him.
This was kind of our meeting place.
Oh, right.
The spring I lost him,
I came here to sing
his favorite song.
It was Amazing Grace, right?
Yes.
In the beginning..,
I was really mad at those four people.
I hated them so much I wanted to kill them.
But I decided to forgive them.
After all, Amazing Grace is a song
about forgiveness.
Well, I'm going to go.
Shall we harmonize again, Conan?
All right, then.
Bye, now.
Goodbye, Conan.
By the way, Ran?
How did you know it was Shinichi playing the other day?
Because he's got a strange habit when he plays!
I recognized it right away!
I see.
What strange habit?
