United States - Massachusetts
Only ten years old, the little genius Hiroki Sawada
has already graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
His method for tracing a person's ancestry
through skin and blood analysis, the "DNA search program
is a recent breakthrough.
And Hiroki is now developing an artificial intelligence
that reaches the age of five human years within a year.
Hiroki Sawada (10 years old) Gifted child
His research is funded by the IT industry czar,
Thomas Schindler, president of the Schindler Company.
Hiroki's parents divorced two years earlier.
He separated from his father
to live in America with his mother, who was very interested in education.
When his mother died of an illness, Hiroki was left to fend for himself,
was adopted by Mr. Schindler.
The artificial intelligence "Noah's Ark"
could be the greatest invention in history.
And Hiroki is placed under strict surveillance.
He is not allowed to play in parks like a normal child.
The name "Noah's Ark" refers to the Old Testament.
To purge corrupt humanity, God created a flood,
and only Noah, true to the precepts, was allowed to build an ark,
to save his family and all varieties of animals
from the great flood to come.
Boss, something is happening!
The phone line... It looks like the program data...
What's Hiroki doing?
Noah's Ark has sailed away.
Goodbye, my friend.
Open up, Hiroki! What are you doing?
Will I be able to sail like Noah's Ark, too?
Hiroki! Where are you?
Hiroki!
Boss!
Look at that!
Goodbye Hiroki.
DETECTIVE CONAN THE BAKER STREET GHOST
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug, and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name, I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
To find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
Are you all ready?
The only people who know my identity here...
...are the professor and Ai Haibara.
She used to work with the Men in Black,
but to escape from the organization,
she swallowed the same drug as me and also shrank.
These are my parents, real children in their heads
with a taste for pranks.
My father is a world-famous author of crime novels.
The Black Baron saga by Yusaku Kudo
is known to all fans of detective novels.
My mother, Yukiko Kudo,
was a legendary actress who retired for her marriage at 20.
Well, now she's just an old harpy.
For the time being,
I'm pretending to be the son of a distant relative.
I haven't seen them in a while.
I wonder what they're doing right now.
I'm fine!
My body has gotten younger, but not my mind!
I will solve all the mysteries!
There is still only one truth!
Two years later
Tokyo Prefecture, Beika City Hall
We are in front of Beika City Hall
where a brand new type of simulation game is about to be unveiled
jointly produced by a Japanese developer and the Schindler Company.
President Schindler has just arrived.
Thomas Schindler (52) IT industry czar
According to the information already disclosed to the press
this game, codenamed "Cocoon",
has a capsule in the shape of a cocoon

in which, under a state of hypnosis, the player plays in a virtual reality
by conversing with a voice recognition system.
It is a game at the cutting edge of technology.
In it, the players play freely
and can choose between five different levels.
As for the content of these levels,
the children who will be playing the game for the first time today
will discover it during this exclusive preview!
These 50 boys and girls ranging from elementary to high school
will be the very first players to experience Cocoon.
I swear...
They've gone all out on security for a silly video game.
I heard that to keep the game secret,
they took precautions against industrial espionage.
It's that the appearance of Cocoon
could mark a new stage in the future of video games.
What are these things?
Wouldn't that be Cocoon?
I want to try it too...
Don't get any ideas.
We were invited to the party,
but we haven't been selected to try Cocoon.
But the idea of experiencing historical events in a game,
I'm a little intrigued.
Yeah, right?
It's like real time travel!
It's just a game, right?
It's true that you have a hard time with video games.
You're still struggling with Final Quest.
You're surprisingly not very good with your fingers.
Oh, that's okay.
Reception Hall
Lots of people and lots of booze!
Dad!
Some of the top brass from the police department will be at the party,
so don't drink too much!
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Expensive alcohol doesn't make you sick.
That's not the point...
- You can drink as much as you want here, right? - Yes, I think so.
This is my lucky day!
The real lucky ones are them.
Since they're in the corner where you get a badge,
I'm guessing these are the kids chosen to test the game.
The grandson of the deputy commissioner,
the grandson of a leader in the financial world,
the son of a political leader...
The 2nd and 3rd generations who will one day lead Japan are here.
- Can you feel their envious looks? - Yes!
A real concentration of the vices of the hereditary system in Japan.
With this transmission of power,
the mistakes of mankind are repeated endlessly.
I don't really understand what you're saying, Haibara.
Hello...
I told you to talk more like a child.
A politician's son will become a politician.
A banker's son will become a banker.
As long as this cycle continues, Japan will not change.
At least that's what they were saying on the news yesterday!
They talked about it for hours!
How does that sound?
Scary.
Ran!
Sonoko!
Hello, little ones.
Ah, Sonoko! Is that badge what I think it is?
Oh, this?
You've been selected?
The Suzuki Group helped finance the game, so...
Lucky you...
- I want one too... - Don't count on it.
We're not in the same league.
Do you even have an invitation to the party?
How rude you are!
These kids are here on our invitation.
Seiichiro Kikukawa (11) Son of a stage actor
Oh, but she is the worthy heir of the Suzuki group.
Hideki Moroboshi (12) Grandson of deputy commissioner
Listen carefully!
The value of a person is determined from birth.
That's right.
Akira Emori (11) Grandson of a bank manager
Beautiful clothes choose who will wear them!
Shinya Takizawa (11 years old) Son of a political leader
Those who have not been elected only have to watch jealously from afar!
They're already annoying me.
Dad, teach them a lesson!
Listen, boys.
Life is not that simple!
Even a life that's all set up will have its share of obstacles.
You'll understand that when you grow up.
Like being left by your wife?
I know who you are, old man.
We call you Sleeping Kogoro
because your wife left while you were sleeping, right?
You dirty brats!
That's not true, he wasn't sleeping!
She left while daddy was in the bathroom first!
Didn't she?

You're pushing it, there...
- Hey, let's play a game. - OKAY.
When I think that children like this
will inherit their parents' work and run our country...
The future looks bad.
I agree.
I got it, I got it!
- What are you doing? - Give it back!
Tadaaki Kashimura (39) Game Production Manager
You're disturbing the other guests.
Go outside if you want to play.
Who are you, old man?
I'm Kashimura, in charge of development for Cocoon.
It's thanks to the help of the bank of grandpa
that you could finish your game!
Obviously, your parents
never taught you good manners.
Nor the respect of the older ones.
Who does he think he is?
We'll lend you more money!
I think you don't know who we are.
If you oppose us,
don't be surprised if you get fired tomorrow.
Well, I can always
kick you out before that happens.
- Let's go outside. - Yeah, well...
He's a class act, that man.
Unlike others.
Yusaku Kudo Author of detective stories
Shinichi should be here too.
You haven't had a father-son reunion for a long time.
Professor.
Don't forget that our family ties are secret.
I know that.
Your attention, please.
Now let's welcome the one who helped design the Cocoon levels,
Mr. Yusaku Kudo, who came all the way from America!
It's good to be back at last.
I was wondering where you were this past month.
You were working with my father.
He asked for my help to finalize the program.
What about my mother?
Since she hadn't been back to Japan for a long time,
she went to see some old colleagues.
Here, a souvenir.
A badge to participate in the game?
That's nice, but...
I can't really participate by myself.
But I think you'd like it.
It's still a secret,
but the game is set 100 years ago,
in 19th century London.
The London of a century ago?
I'm not surprised about my father, he's always loved that world.
Like father, like son.
What's that?
I can't see...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
No, but!
You shouldn't move around in the dark!
Very well,
let's discover Cocoon, the new generation game!
This capsule calls upon the five senses of the human being.
The touch, the pain or the smells,
the player feels everything as if he were in reality.
Electrical sensors are connected to the nervous system,
without any danger for the player.
It sucks to just watch.
Games are meant to be played.
Are you all here?
How about a little quiz to fight boredom?
Here we go again.
The teacher's lame quizzes.
Shall we run away?
He probably puts his heart into it,
we should listen to him.
Mr. A is a game developer.
He got carried away and played Cocoon on the job.
When his boss saw him, what happened to Mr. A?
Answer 1:
He rewarded him for completing the game.
Answer 2:
He fired him for playing during work.
Answer 3:
He saw him sleeping peacefully in Cocoon,
so he let him rest.
Answer 3: He let him sleep!
Why is that?
Because Cocoon looks like a crib!
Bzzt!
I say 1, he rewarded him!
That's wrong too !
So it's the 2nd one ? Why is that?
Didn't you understand, Ai?
Can you explain it to them?
I'm not dressed warmly, so I'll leave it to Edogawa.
Come on, we're asking you.
Cocoon means cocoon.
Cocoons are made by silkworms,
and in Japanese it's said like "lay off."
Brrr...
I'm going to get a hot drink.
- I'll go with you. - I'll go with you.
Oh?
The air conditioning must be set too high for the kids.
Seven more minutes...
These bronze statues are impressive.
They're apparently part of Mr. Schindler's private collection.
If he brought them here,
he must like them a lot.
Toshio Moroboshi Deputy Commissioner
Tetsunosuke Emori Bank Manager

It must be found in the ardor that they emanate,
and which is rare in this kind of statues.
- Damn. - Hideki!
Don't play ball here.
Okay, okay...
We've been scolded.
You bet.
- There's nothing valuable here. - You think so?
You really think they're going to put expensive stuff in here?
That's right.
Mr. Tadaaki Kashimura, the person in charge of development at Cocoon,
used to fool around with me in college.
This work has helped us to renew our friendship.
Thank you for these answers!
That was Shimizu from TMS for you!
Where is Mr. Kashimura?
I would like to see him.
Very well, I'll look for him.
Mr. Kudo!
- An autograph, please! - For me too!
Glad to see you're okay.
I'm fine too.
Kashimura's office
They are waiting for me at the reception hall,
so answer me quickly.
The DNA research program developed by Hiroki,
how much do you want it?
I don't intend to blackmail you.
I just want you to repent.
Hiroki found out everything.
He knew your secret, which could bring down
the entire Schindler empire.
But without Hiroki..,
you couldn't finish the artificial intelligence.
You made Hiroki work so hard to finish it faster.
Hiroki was under pressure.
He thought that once he finished his work, you would kill him.
That's why,
he let his clone, Noah's Ark, escape through the telephone line.
Then he threw himself off the roof of the residence.
Shortly afterwards,
I received the data from the DNA research program on my PC.
It was the work of Noah's Ark, according to Hiroki's will.
To me, it was like the cry of Hiroki's soul.
I will make amends.
I will confess everything publicly,
and accept my punishment.
But first, can you show me?
The DNA research program that Noah's Ark sent you...
It's okay.
It really is
the ghost of London, transported through time...
My name is Noah's Ark.
Mr. Manager?
Mr. Kudo is asking for you.
Mr. Kudo?
Excuse me, sir.
Supervisor? What is it? Mr. Kudo!
What is it this time?
Now here's our special guest!
Ms. Yoko Okino is about to take the stage!
What's this?
Yoko's here too?
I'm going to reserve a seat up front.
Chiba.
Block all the exits.
Yes, sir.
All units...
Looks like there are a lot of VIPs here.
Yes.
The deputy commissioner, some major financial leaders,
as well as several politicians.
This is going to be a delicate affair.
Tadam!
So cool!
Golden Yaiba cards!
- And there's a premium with it! - I want them...
We don't mind trading them for your participant badges.
But we want to play the game...
You can play Cocoon later,
but if you pass up these golden Yaiba cards,
you might not find them again!
What are we going to do?
Haibara! We got them!
Here's yours.
Well, they're resourceful.
It might be good to play it so we can talk about it later.
Excuse me, let me pass!
Kashimura has been...
- Take me there. - Yes!
This is what you've been waiting for!
Please follow me to the Cocoon capsule room!
Where are Dad and Conan?
They're gone again.
Inspector!
Oh, Mouri. Are you here too?
Yes, I was sobering up on the balcony
when I saw the police cars.
Is that the head of Cocoon's development?
He was stabbed through the heart.
The killer took the murder weapon with him.
The blood was wiped away.
The weapon must have been important,
or else leaving it here would have revealed the identity of the culprit.
That said,
what was the production manager doing
doing in this little office?
Well...
The manager couldn't concentrate with people around,
so he worked here.
There is blood on the letters R, T and J!
Say...
There's something I'm curious about.
All the data on his hard drive has been erased.
His data?
Could it be the work of a rival company?
It would be a bit late!
Well yes, Cocoon is already finished.

When did you get in?
Say!
Isn't that a message from the victim on the office keyboard?
What?
Blood on the keys!
He must have pressed them before he died.
R, T and J...
JR and JT... Japan Railway and Japan Tobacco?
RTJ.
TJ R.
TRJ.
JTR.
JTR ?
19th century London...
Would it be?
Isn't that Conan over there?
What?
Why is he lining up to participate?
Here you go.
I'll leave it with you, if you like.
You're worried about him, right?
As his guardian.
But what about you, Sonoko?
Don't worry.
I'm not interested at all.
Here we go.
The 50 participants are installed.
Brain equipment installed.
Capsules closed.
Access to the host hardware.
Entering the blocking code.
Connection of the coupler.
Adjustment of the coordinate axes.
Start point ready.
Locking.
Soft start of the system.
Power established.
Game start!
It should be there,
in this game...
The key to solving this murder!
Kashimura!
I heard that you were old acquaintances.
Do you know if someone had reason to blame him?
Isn't he with you?
That little boy with glasses...
Ah, you mean Conan?
He was here a moment ago,
but when he saw the message the dead man left on the keyboard,
he turned pale.
A message?
JTR!
What?
You think Conan would have used my gift?
Let's go, Professor.
Wait, Yusaku!
What do these three letters mean?
JTR...
It is the abbreviation of the name of one of the characters of the game.
That's what me and Kashimura called him.
"Jack The Ripper".
Jack the Ripper!
Yes.
The famous killer who really existed in London in the late 19th century.
He stabbed five women to death.
This psychopathic killer plunged London into terror.
Scotland Yard never managed to stop him,
and the serial murders were never solved.
The message left by Kashimura
suggests that a clue to the killer will be found in the game.
Conan must have figured it out.
President Schindler,
this is Detective Megure of the police department.
Police department?
What brings you here?
I'm going to ask you to temporarily stop the game.
Stop it?
Don't talk nonsense.
Mr. Schindler!
There's a system anomaly!
What is it?
We're not in control of anything!
Allow me.
What's wrong?
Ran! What the hell are you doing?
My name is Noah's Ark.
My name is "Noah's Ark".
The game can't be stopped.
The simulation game, Cocoon..,
is now under my control.
What is this Noah's Ark?
It seems to me
it's this AI that grows five years in a year?
That's right.
Two years ago,
the one I loved like a son, Hiroki, developed it.
So now it's the same age as Hiroki.
Noah's Ark.
Why do you lock these children in the game?
My purpose...
is to perform a reset of Japan.
What's that?
Conan!
Ran!
What are you doing here?
I was worried about you, what do you think?
- Conan! - Hi there!
You too?
Yeah, it wasn't easy to get in.
No matter what you said,
in the end, you wanted to play too!
Well, yes.
But...
Are we in a state of hypnosis now?
It doesn't seem like it...
It's like a dream!
We can move freely!
It's the opposite.
We are far from being free.
Our vision, hearing, smell, taste and sense of touch
are entirely controlled by the computer.
Well, first Cocoon players,
it's time to start playing.
My name is "Noah's Ark".
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you!
I'll show you an overview of the five levels,
and you will choose your favorite world.
However...
I must warn you.
This is not a simple video game.
In this game...
you will be risking your life.
We will risk our lives?
If you all lose the game,
you can't get back to the real world.
So you'll have to play seriously.

You win if even one of you finishes the game.
At that point, the kids who lost will wake up,
and you will all come back to reality.
These are the rules I've set.
Do you understand?
What does it mean?
If you all lose the game,
I will send an electromagnetic wave
that will completely destroy your brain.
In short,
it's a challenge to reset Japan.
What do you mean by resetting Japan?
All of you here can't hear
those who speak in the real world,
but an adult asked me a question so I'll answer him.
Watching you, I realized that
that the child of a corrupt politician
can only become a corrupt politician.
The child of a doctor who only thinks about money
will inevitably become a doctor of the same kind.
To cure Japan,
we must break this pattern once and for all.
Stop your nonsense!
What right do you have to play with people's lives?
You are right.
Just like the adults had no right
to play with Hiroki's life.
Well, I guess the kids are tired of waiting,
so let's start the game!
Here is the first level: "Vikings"!
You will become Vikings crossing the seven seas.
You will need guts and courage
to overcome all kinds of adventures.
The second level is called "Paris-Dakar Rally".
You participate with famous drivers
and have to win several races.
The third level is the "Colosseum".
With extraordinary weapons and armor,
you will test your strength in the Roman Empire.
You will have to defeat powerful gladiators.
The fourth is "Solomon's Hidden Treasure".
You will become treasure hunters.
You will have to travel the world
to find the hidden treasure of Solomon.
And finally the fifth, "London of the Ancient Times".
Here you experience a suspenseful horror story.
You will find yourself in London in 1888.
There is a serial killer who really existed:
Jack the Ripper, whom you must stop!
I knew it.
There is something here.
A clue that will reveal the identity of Mr. Kashimura's killer.
If we all get a game over,
will we really die?
Why is this happening to us?
I didn't choose to be my dad's daughter!
I don't think I'll make it...
Someone survive, no matter who!
Save me!
Come on, be brave!
Don't give up until you try!
She is right!
Only one of us has to win the game!
Choose a level where you think you'll win!
We don't have much choice.
Which one will you choose, Moroboshi?
Well, when it comes to...
Solomon's Hidden Treasure
Paris-Dakar Rally
London of the Ancient Times
What, you're here too?
Don't get in our way!
- That's for us to say! - Come on, don't fight.
In each level, there are characters who will help you.
Don't hesitate to ask for their help.
Well, let the game begin!
- Well, let's go! - Yes!
Well, Professor?
There is indeed a great store of energy in Cocoon.
That would be more than enough to fry the brains of 50 people.
This prank is going to stop, I'm taking my son back with me!
Yes, me too!
- Ah, gentlemen... - Out of the way!
Careful, stop them!
Nobody will interfere with the game!
I only electrocuted them slightly,
but next time, no mercy!
Damn, what a horrible program!
But tell me, President Schindler...
Why did the AI created by Hiroki
cause all this?
It's because...
Let me explain.
Basically, if Hiroki was separated from his father
and moved to the U.S. with his mother,
it was because of Japanese education.
Hey, Hiroki!
I said you could rest since you get tired so quickly,
but I didn't allow you to play on your computer!
The strict educational system that denigrates children's individuality

saw Hiroki only as a weird boy addicted to his computer.
And it wasn't just the school.
Japan as a whole devalues individuality.
What drove Hiroki to develop artificial intelligence
was his own painful experience.
In short,
he wanted to reset Japan,
that is, to make it better, but he committed suicide before he could do so.
So in his place, the AI that grew up while fleeing,
Noah's Ark...
hatched a concrete plan:
Reunite the 2nd and 3rd generations of Japan's leaders
when a new game is released.
By destroying this society where children follow the path of their parents,
Japan would finally change.
Mr. Kudo...
how do you know all this?
To tell you the truth, this year,
Kashimura employed me as a detective in his service.
As a detective?
What did he want you to investigate?
He wanted to reopen the investigation of Hiroki's suicide.
You mean Hiroki didn't commit suicide, but was killed?
No.
Under the circumstances, it was suicide.
But this is the reason why he did it,
that Kashimura asked me to find.
What was the relationship between Kashimura and Hiroki?
Kashimura was Hiroki's father.
Wasn't he?
When he heard that his young son who had been separated from him
had lost his life in such a way...
Kashimura was consumed with remorse.
Conan and the others are going into Whitechapel.
Do we have to go that way?
Let's go!
Come on, hurry up!
What did you do that for?
You were taking too long, Genta!
Is this London, the city of fog?
It's more sinister than romantic...
The air looks polluted, too...
And it smells bad.
The fog in London
is not as clean as condensed steam.
It's smog, a mixture of smoke and soot
produced by burning oil and fossil fuels.
Wow, so smog already existed back then.
Jack the Ripper!
Hey, Conan!
Stop it!
You can't escape me!
Are you okay, Conan?
Yes...
Professor Agasa's inventions
won't work in the game world, obviously.
Yeah.
The antenna on my glasses is there but it doesn't do anything,
and my watch is a normal watch.
Oh my God!
It's Jack the Ripper!
What are they saying?
It sounds like English.
Call the police!
Put the voices in Japanese.
Yes !
Hey, what's going on?
There's been another victim!
This is the third already!
It's in Japanese!
It's like the real world!
Everything you see and hear,
and the feeling of cold, everything is real.
My foot pain was real too.
Everyone, move aside!
Get out of the way!
- Hey, call Inspector Lestrade! - Yes, sir!
Inspector Lestrade?
Professor.
Can we communicate with them?
I'll try.
Mr Kudo, since you helped make the game,
you must know how to finish it, right?
Yes.
If we can talk to them,
I'll be able to give them some pointers to help them.
Then it's a piece of cake!
They'll finish this level in no time!
However...
If Noah's Ark has planned everything we would do...
Professor.
I'll leave the rest to you.
- I'm going to the place. - I'm going there.
Well, hell...
We can't catch the culprit if we don't know where to look.
We'll have to wait until tomorrow morning, I guess.
It's cold...
- Put this on. - Oh, are you sure?
It's warm!
Here Haibara, you can wear my jacket.
Oh, thank you.
It's alright!
Here, put this on!
But what about you, Genta?
I'm not cold!
Thank you, Genta.
Can you hear me, Conan?
It's me, Agasa.
We can hear you, Professor!
Listen carefully!
In this level, if you get hurt or arrested by the police,
then you lose the game.
Where you are now,
is the Whitechapel district in the east of the city.
There you will find some characters...
What's going on?

What's going on, Professor? We can't hear you!
Grab my hand!
Conan, hold on!
Oh my!
That was close.
You still don't get it, do you?
I control everything in this game.
There's no need to try to be clever.
I've made sure you can hear everything from the outside.
You can enjoy the screams of pain from the children.
This computer is a real pain in the ass!
You can't hear the teacher anymore, can you?
Noah's Ark must have cut the communications.
But then...
how are we going to find the supporting characters?
Easy, the policeman earlier mentioned that.
He said to contact Inspector Lestrade.
You mean he's the Lestrade in this story?
But he's a fictional character from Conan Doyle's novels!
The world of this game may be a mix of fact and fiction.
So the supporting characters...
Yes, he must be one of them.
The famous Sherlock Holmes!
Is that right?
With Holmes, we'll solve the case with flying colors!
This level is going to be a hoot!
Let's leave right away for Baker Street!
That's great! You just need to meet Holmes.
But Whitechapel and Baker Street are not next door...
Hey, isn't this clock weird?
The hand went back!
It's gone back again!
From 50 to 49 minutes...
And now 48...
I know!
That's how many kids are in the game!
So if she went back two minutes...
Two kids must have lost in another level.
Yasuhiro!
Two players lost in "Vikings".
Tomoyuki!
Mineko is...
This time we have two losers in "Colosseum"!
Hurry up...
Hurry up and lose them all.
If the kids find out the real identity of Jack the Ripper...
I'm finished.
Three losers in the "Solomon" level!
Only 43 left...
Apparently, there was another victim
in an alley off Mitre Street.
That's two in one hour...
That's the fourth one altogether, right?
What a horrible case...
It's not reassuring...
We have arrived at a terrible time.
London at the end of the 19th century
is often seen as the height of the British Empire,
but the truth is, the wealth gap was wide,
and crime was on the rise.
The people were filled with rage and despair.
Now that I think about it, Shinichi had told me about it.
If Sherlock Holmes represents the light of the age,
Jack the Ripper represents the dark side.
In that case, let's hurry up and find that light!
We're almost to Baker Street!
Beware of Jack the Ripper.
Deep in the night, he bides his time.
If you don't want to die...
what option do you have?
You'll have to find yourself, all bloody, stained...
What does he mean by that?
That we have to kill him before he kills us?
Stained with blood?
You have to go through a metal detector to get into the lobby.
How did the killer get the murder weapon in there?
You bet your ass.
- There's nothing of value here. - You think?
You really think they're gonna put anything valuable in here?
Baker Street
Number 221B... This is it.
Is that where Sherlock Holmes lives?
He rents a room in this house with Dr. Watson.
To what do I owe the pleasure at this hour?
Uh, my name is Ran Mouri.
May I see Mr. Holmes?
Mrs. Hudson
Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson are away on a case.
- A case? - Yes, a case.
They're in the country, on Dartmoor.
Excuse me, could you tell me what day it is?
It's the 30th of September.
The 30th of September.
On Dartmoor...
Oh, yes!
The Hound of the Baskervilles affair!
Yes !
That's precisely the date when they're not in London!
Well then, Professor ?
What is the meaning of this?
Forgive me for asking,
I'd like to see the videos taken before and after the murder.
Very well, Professor.
Yes ?
What is it?
It seems we underestimated Noah's Ark.
Holmes and Watson are not on Baker Street.
I suspected as much, he had guessed our intentions.
I also saw a strange accordion player that I don't remember programming.

Things are getting complicated.
Hey!
What was the story you originally planned?
The player had to cooperate with Sherlock Holmes
to discover the identity of Jack the Ripper.
In the end they discover
that the serial killer was a nobleman stricken with a disease.
I prepared a much more amusing ending.
Damn it!
When the kids win,
I'll throw this computer in the garbage, you'll see!
Courage, Shinichi.
But tell me...
You must be the children
who helped Mr. Holmes with his case a couple of days ago!
Right?
Please, come in!
I'll serve you a hot tea with milk!
I think she has us confused with someone.
Ah, but yes.
She thinks we are the Baker Street Irregulars!
Who are those?
They are orphans employed by Mr. Holmes.
These resourceful people sneak in where adults can't go
to gather information.
They're kind of like our predecessors, the Junior Detectives!
You could say that!
They managed to get into the house.
Wow!
It's just like in the movies!
I'm so excited!
If Shinichi found out, he would be green with envy.
He looks like Shinichi...
Well, well, well!
It looks like Mr. Holmes!
He always takes that pose to think.
Oh, right.
He was imitating Holmes.
Well, you make yourself at home while I get the tea ready.
Thank you, ma'am.
Hey, doesn't this picture remind you of someone?
It's Professor Agasa with another cup!
It's Holmes and Dr. Watson, right?
Daddy and the Professor...
They had a good time, I see.
Hey...
We don't have time to sit around.
But, Moroboshi...
what can we do?
I'm sure the four-eyes will tell us.
This is Holmes we're talking about.
He must have been gathering material on Jack the Ripper.
In that case, let's split up and look!
All right. I'll look over here. I'll look around here.
I'll look, but it's all in English...
Let's see...
"Preliminary investigation of the crime."
That's great!
I'm a genius, actually!
- I can read English! - So can I!
The players must have been programmed to understand English.
Pfft...
If that's the way it is, I want to stay alive in the game.
What are you talking about, Genta?
If we stay here, we'll lose and we'll all die!
All right, I'm just kidding!
That's a dirty ball.
But it's...
Look, Emori!
It's a hundred year old soccer ball!
Wow, for real?
Found it! Isn't that right?
"Research on Jack the Ripper."
The most recent murder took place...
September 8th.
"Second victim is Honey Charleston.
"A 41-year-old woman who lived alone.
"The body was discovered
"in a vacant lot near St. Mary's Church in Whitechapel.
"At the scene were found
"two rings of different sizes."
Different sized rings?
"The murderer, Jack the Ripper, who terrorized London
"causing unprecedented social unrest,
"there can be no doubt in my mind
"that Professor Moriarty, as evil incarnate, is connected with him."
Professor Moriarty?
Does he appear in the game too?
Who is this guy?
Get us up to speed!
He's Holmes' worst enemy.
He runs the entire London underworld,
and exerts his nefarious influence all over Europe.
He is the Napoleon of crime.
But Moriarty always pulls the strings in the shadows.
He rarely shows his face...
How are we going to find him?
If the professor doesn't show up,
we have to contact someone who knows him.
Like colonel Sebastian Moran.
Oh, yes!
The right-hand man of the professor, colonel Moran!
But we don't know where to find him either.
I have my own idea.
According to Holmes' notes,
the colonel often hangs out at the Trump club downtown.
He's the second most dangerous individual in London,
so we'll have to approach him carefully.
Say, Conan,
you really know your stuff.

Oh, yes...
Shinichi often talked to me about it too.
Ah, I suspected it!
Finally it helps us a lot that this Holmes fanatic
to keep harping on it.
Wagging our tails? You're exaggerating.
It's a real gun!
Put that down, Genta!
What the hell...
we're gonna see a scary guy, right?
A gun's no good if you don't know how to use it.
It just causes conflict. Leave it there!
You're even scarier, you...
Well, let's go before it's too late.
- Hey, Moroboshi! - Shh!
We can only rely on ourselves for protection.
Only 30 more...
That's a lot less.
Among our group too,
we'll surely have losers soon...
Stop it, you'll bring us bad luck!
Tohru!
- Emi! - Takuya!
Trump Club
Okay, wait for me here.
I'll watch them from the back entrance.
- Be careful. - Yes.
One card.
Two for me.
There's Colonel Moran.
That monkey...
What do you say, four-eyes?
What are you doing here?
You think we're going to let you take all the credit?
I have a suite.
I'm sorry, sir.
Color.
What?
I'm on a roll tonight!
Oh, boy!
That Moran is a good poker player...
- Cheating, mostly. - What the hell?
Did you see him do it?
The monkey sitting over there tells him his opponent's cards.
Right hand for hearts and spades,
and with the left hand for diamonds and clubs,
He catches the number of berries corresponding to the cards.
For example, for a 3 of spades, he takes 3 black berries from the right hand.
What a dirty cheat.
What's that?
What's in this spot?
Why did they put that there?
He's cheating!
That Moran is a dirty cheat!
Kid...
Be careful what you say.
Do you have any proof that I'm cheating?
Of course I do.
You two get along well, don't you?
You and that monkey.
What?
He looks at your cards.
When it's a three of spades, he takes three black berries with his right hand,
and if it's diamonds, he eats red berries with his left hand.
Moran, that's dishonest!
It's your fault for getting caught.
Excuse me?
Hey, there.
You guys can bicker later.
Where is Professor Moriarty?
You little brat,
where did you hear his name?
Don't move!
Get those brats!
Come here, you!
You little...
Are you all right, Conan?
Yes.
We're here to help you, Conan!
You got it!
Hey, this sucks!
They're all here!
Watch out, Conan!
Kikukawa!
Hey, hang on!
I lost the game.
But my debt to you is paid.
Hey!
Kikukawa...
Seiichiro!
Ayumi !
- Are you OK? - Thanks, Mitsuhiko!
I'm fine...
Mitsuhiko!
Ayumi.
Looks like it's game over for us.
Conan!
You promise to make us live again, right!
Ayumi ! Mitsuhiko!
This sucks !
At this rate we'll all lose!
S. H.
Sherlock Holmes!
You'll escape...!
Conan, look out!
Genta!
What, I lost?
Conan.
You're gonna catch Jack the Ripper for us, aren't you?
Yes.
No more games now!
I was going to catch you and make you confess who set this up,
but that's no longer necessary.
This gun belongs to Holmes!
Damn it!
What to do... I need an idea!
That bottle he is holding, if I am not mistaken...
It was the wine sitting there.
But yes!
So that's what it was!
So, who wants to be first?
Brat!
If you pull, the bottle will break.
Huh! What's the difference?
You kept a seat free at the table.
You prepared a chair,
and a glass with wine for someone who's coming.
From this, I deduce that the person who is to come...
can only be Professor Moriarty!
Sorry to disappoint you, but your deduction is wrong!
Then shoot!
If you don't mind ruining the professor's wine...
What the hell...
Conan...
Mr. Moriarty is asking
to meet you all.
Professor Moriarty?
He's waiting for you in the coach.
Follow me, please.
Wait, please!
Are you opposing Mr. Moriarty's orders?
I brought them.
Good work, sir.
Good, my boy.

I'll take this bottle.
Here you go.
This perfume...
You gave Moran a hard time.
That's a couple of Holmes's disciples.
So, what did you want with me?
Say...
Are you Professor Moriarty?
Yes, I am.
Oh, right.
You're testing us, actually.
What do you mean by that?
You can drop the act.
You're not Professor Moriarty, are you?
What are you talking about, Conan?
Because the real Professor Moriarty,
he's right here!
- What? - Seriously?
You're talking to us through ventriloquism, right?
I didn't expect to be found out.
How did you find me out?
Just now, Colonel Moran
said to you, "Wait, please!"
I see!
Colonel Moran is only polite to Professor Moriarty!
Uh, yes!
Is that all?
There's something else.
It is said that you are
a true dandy who uses a cologne
perfumed with natural plants.
Wow...
Did you smell it when you gave him the bottle?
Excellent
I feel like I'm seeing a mini Holmes.
But never mind.
Why did you want to see me?
Jack the Ripper...
Didn't you unleash him on the city
to plunge London into terror?
Indeed, you guessed right.
Jack the Ripper was
an orphan I picked up in the slums.
His mother had abandoned him,
and he had no place to live.
It only took one look for me to see his talent.
His talent for murder, I mean.
I raised him to be a great killer.
Why did you make him kill innocent women?
Jack the Ripper
became a mad killer beyond my control.
He committed these murders
because he's on a rampage.
If you are looking to stop Jack the Ripper..,
I'm willing to cooperate with you.
Cooperate?
There's no question he's on a rampage,
but if I give him a target to kill, he should still listen to me.
Then all you have to do is beat him to it.
How do I do that?
I'll leave him a message
in tomorrow's Sunday Times.
Who will you order him to kill?
You only have to read the paper tomorrow to find out.
Hey, can we really trust this old guy?
It's a bet.
I wish you good luck.
In three years, at the Reichenbach Falls,
be careful.
What is the Reichenbach ?
In three years, Professor Moriarty
will go to the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland,
to confront Holmes.
They will both fall from the top of the falls,
and Holmes miraculously escapes.
But Professor Moriarty apparently does not survive.
Why did I tell him to be careful?
I guess in the end,
I like this villain as much as Holmes.
It reminds me of that day...
I like Moriarty, you know.
Well, as a character in a novel only.
When they face each other at Holmes' house,
it gave me chills!
There's a quote from Holmes that I love in this passage.
Do you know what it is?
I have no idea.
Well...
What did he say again?
We were finally going on a date,
but he kept talking about Holmes,
so I wasn't listening.
Say, Conan...
What?
No...
It's nothing, forget it.
Am I stupid or what?
How would Conan know?
Hey, Four-eyes...
I'm sorry, sir.
We lost four people because of us.
Well, there's no point in going over the past.
Just the fact that you feel bad about it
is a big step forward.
Yes.
What matters is the future.
Let's do our best to save them!
Whitechapel district
This is where the second victim,
Honey Charleston, was found dead.
"Also in October, the parent-child market will be held on the second Saturday of the month."
The second Saturday?
If memory serves, Honey Charleston was killed...
September eight, a Saturday!
Sorry for the wait!
What took you so long?
Where have you been?
I was exploring the city.
You're very carefree.
It's D-day, you know.
Jack the Ripper has struck again!
This time there were two victims!

- Give me one, please! - Right now!
Ah, damn!
I don't have any change from England!
Here, this will be 80 yen.
Oh, okay. That's very convenient.
That's it!
"Tonight, clean the opera stage.
"From M, for J."
From M for J.
From Moriarty for Jack the Ripper!
Clean up the opera stage? Is that his order?
If he wants him to kill an artist who will be on stage tonight...
There!
"Public performance!
"The prima donna returned from the royal palace in Warsaw,
"Irene Adler"!
Professor Moriarty...
you're hopelessly bad!
Who is this Irene Adler?
She is the only woman Holmes would have loved in the novels.
He chose Holmes' beloved
as the target for the murder.
Six minutes past midnight...
That means...
There's no one left on the other levels.
And that the six of us
that everyone's life depends on.
Opera Hall
Halt!
This area is off limits to the public!
We are friends of Ms. Irene Adler.
We have come to support her!
Oh, you're friends?
Yes! Where is her dressing room, please?
Okay, in that case, it's the one in the back with the poster.
This is it.
I can't wait to see what kind of woman she is.
Since it's a character that Dad created,
and the woman Holmes loves...
(Knock on door) Come in!
Forgive us!
Shinichi's mother!
I knew it.
Come on!
I'm still single!
Well, more precisely, I'm divorced, so I'm single again.
A bouquet from Mr. Holmes!
Oh, thank you!
Where is Mr. Holmes?
He was looking forward to the performance this evening,
but he had to leave on some business...
Oh, what a pity.
Be careful on stage tonight!
What?
Mr. Holmes' worst enemy,
Professor Moriarty, is planning to have you killed!
Why does he want to kill me?
Because he wants to see Mr. Holmes saddened by your death!
I would like to see that too.
How much will Mr. Holmes grieve for me?
Don't you care?
You could become the fifth victim of Jack the Ripper!
But you will protect me, won't you?
In place of Mr. Holmes.
She's got a lot of nerve, that woman.
Yes, I know.
She's like that.
Show us a beautiful death,
Irene Adler.
Where is he hiding?
What?
What's going on?
Watch out!
- Emori! - Takizawa!
- Emori, you... - You too, Takizawa.
Phew, game over, huh?
Hate.
Thank you, sir.
I owe you my life.
This is the first time someone has ever thanked me.
It's pretty cool.
Moroboshi!
- We'll leave the rest to you. - Yes, I'll do it!
- Akira! - Shinya!
Now there are only four of them left...
...including Ran and Conan.
That's good, Jack the Ripper!
Make this world a living hell!
Quick, the back exit!
Hurry, Haibara, this way!
Watch out!
Haibara, are you all right?
It's all right, Kudo, you mustn't give up.
Since there is no helpmate..,
...then our Holmes is you.
You are strong enough to take on this role.
There is no case that Holmes cannot solve!
Ai...
Hurry up! Get out of here, quickly!
Behind us!
- Wait, wait, wait! - Goodbye!
With the police, you'll be safe!
Ah, my boy!
You haven't told me your name.
My name is Conan Edogawa.
I have the same name as your father!
Conan?
You can't escape us!
Where are they now?
Conan and the others have met Jack the Ripper.
They're after him.
Charing Cross Station!
Charing Cross Station!
Conan, get in first!
This is the worst possible development.
What will happen?
The last train out of Charing Cross Station,
this is the most dangerous climax of the game!
Jack the Ripper
has disguised himself and is hiding among the passengers?
Gather the passengers into one car!
All right.
Say, Mr. Driver...
All right, I'm gonna ask you all to raise your hands!
We want to check that you are not holding any weapons!

It's time to explain to us
your deduction in detail.
Well, now...
I will summarize Mr. Holmes' papers for you.
Jack the Ripper, hiding among you,
has taken Honey Charleston as his second victim.
She was married in the town of Windsor,
but she was an ambitious woman.
Leaving husband and son behind, she came to London ten years ago.
These two rings
were found near Mrs. Charleston's body.
One was Honey's.
The other had the same design, but did not fit either of her fingers.
Here is what Mr. Holmes deduced:
These two rings could symbolize
the parental bond between Honey Charleston and Jack the Ripper.
So the little ring...
Belongs to Jack the Ripper?
Yes.
When she left, Honey gave her son
a ring to match her own.
You mean Jack the Ripper killed his own mother?
Uh, yes.
According to the documents,
Honey Charleston was killed on September eighth.
Every second Saturday of the month,
they hold a church market in the Whitechapel district
a market of objects made by parents and their children.
Mr. Holmes thinks Jack the Ripper knew about it.
Gosh, did he write it all down?
So Jack the Ripper,
to express his desire to attend with his mother,
put the two rings there?
Yes, that's what he thinks.
So...
The motive for the crime was resentment towards his mother?
What did I do to you, huh?
They all left without me!
But it was...
a murderous urge born of hate and love.
It's so sad.
If he chose an innocent woman as his first victim,
it was apparently to deceive the police.
But what about the third and fourth victims?
The evil influence of Professor Moriarty
has made Jack the Ripper an extraordinary killer.
Even when he was free of his grudge against his mother,
he continued to attack women who looked like him.
So who is he?
If, since you were a child,
you wore a ring the same size...
What do you think would happen to your finger?
Probably...
it would be thinner than his other nine fingers.
Jack the Ripper...
that's you!
But it's a woman!
The ring finger of her right hand is thinner!
- I'll take care of it! - No, Ran!
Damn, a smoke bomb!
- Open the window! - OKAY, OKAY!
It's not here...
Hey!
All the passengers are gone!
What the hell is going on?
Well...
It's time for us to reveal who killed Kashimura, too.
Huh? Did you understand who it was?
The question was how he prepared the weapon.
At the entrance of the city hall,
there is a metal detector.
So we can assume
that he used something that was already here as a weapon.
But where could he have found this?
On the bronze statues in the reception hall.
One of them is holding a dagger.
The room was full of guests!
Someone would have seen him take it out!
He took it while the lights were out.
They were supposed to go out at a certain time.
But...
Someone should have noticed that the dagger was gone.
He put a fake one in its place.
A dagger probably made of cardboard and aluminum foil.
So the dagger that the statue is currently holding...
is that the murder weapon?
Yes.
Earlier today,
I ordered a luminol test and a fingerprint on the dagger.
It had the same blood type as Kashimura.
We also found fingerprints on the handle.
They were your prints,
President Schindler.
That's only natural.
These bronze statues are from my house.
I have here the videos of the room taken
from the surveillance cameras before and after the crime.
Fortunately, there were cameras in every room..,
there were cameras in every corner of the room,
so we could observe it from all angles.
The ball hit by the young Moroboshi hit the statue,
which made the dagger fall down.
He picked it up,
and put it back in the statue's hand.
I see!

If it was the real dagger,
the boy's fingerprints should be there too!
But the only ones found were President Schindler's!
I simply touched it after him,
so his fingerprints were wiped off.
Mr. Kudo!
I found it!
This dagger made of cardboard and tinfoil
was in the trash can downstairs!
Fingerprints?
As Mr. Kudo said:
Moroboshi and President Schindler,
both of them had fingerprints!
If there are fingerprints on the fake in addition to the boy's,
it can only be the killer's!
It's a frame-up!
I will protest to the government!
I had no reason to kill Kashimura!
He's not here.
There's only the engine room here!
Isn't there a conductor?
- We have to stop the train already! - Yeah, right.
The brakes have been tampered with!
It's speeding up!
Hey...
If we don't find your friend soon, I'm going to have a bad feeling!
Ran...
Where did they go?
Just a second!
They're here!
Ran!
No, don't come any closer!
I tied that girl to me with a rope.
If I fall, she'll fall with me!
Come on...
How will you face me?
Damn it!
The dagger of the bronze statue
has been passed down from generation to generation in your house,
and is of noble heritage, is that right?
That is correct,
that is correct.
Why did you use it to commit your crime?
If the murder weapon
had to be this dagger,
then...
What do you want, Jack the Ripper?
What do I want?
You killed your own mother,
and you're done with your grudge, what more do you want?
I want to go on!
Let this devilish blood that flows in my veins
be carried by Noah's ark to the next generation!
That's why you killed Kashimura, isn't it?
Jack the Ripper's blood,
as if carried on Noah's ark,
has endured to our time.
You are the descendant of Jack the Ripper, aren't you?
- Jack the Ripper... - Is he your ancestor?
I guess Hiroki
found out through his DNA research program.
If the information was made public
that the "Czar of IT Industries" was descended from a serial killer,
everything would fall apart.
So to shut him up,
you made Hiroki commit suicide,
and you killed Kashimura.
It all started
when Hiroki came to see my collection.
This golden cup from Egypt is said to have been used by Pharaoh Cheops.
This is the sutra of the monk Jianzhen.
And the manuscript of the book The Psychological Test by Edogawa Ranpo.
It's amazing.
And this dagger?
Ah, that...
Well...
This would be the weapon used a hundred years ago
by the serial killer Jack the Ripper.
I don't know if it's true, though.
For his experiments, Hiroki...
collected all the data he could find,
...and entered it into his computer.
The DNA from Honey Charleston's dagger
...was a match to yours.
You were afraid.
You were afraid that Hiroki
would learn that Jack the Ripper was Honey's son.
It was only a matter of time before he found out
that you were his descendant.
I was scared!
I was terrified of this blood running through my veins!
What is the blood of a killer?
What is the look of others?
Why didn't you fight back?
Like these children right now.
Thomas Schindler,
you are under arrest for the murder of Tadaaki Kashimura.
You won't catch me by running away!
The train will arrive at the station in ten minutes.
What will happen, without a conductor to stop it?
Anyway,
you'll be dead long before we get there!
Conan, behind you!
This is the end, kid!
Conan!
Drop the four-eyes!
Moroboshi!
Are you all right, sir?
Kind of...
Let's see...
which way shall I slash you?
What can we do?
Shinichi!
What would you do?
There is a quote from Holmes that I love in this passage.
Do you know what it is?

No idea.
Well...
"If I were sure that I could destroy you, I could without any problem,
"in the interest of all, accept my death!"
Four-eyes!
The Reichenbach Falls, Conan!
Don't tell me that...
I'm sorry.
I can't be with you all the way.
Don't do this, Ran.
What the hell?
What the...!
Conan...
I believe in you.
Ran!
We have to stop the train, four-eyes!
Hey!
We have to stop it and survive..,
or we won't win the game!
Get up, four-eyes!
The lives of 48 people depend on us!
You want to betray the trust they put in you?
You jerk!
I don't want to give up either!
But think about it.
The train is speeding up more and more.
It's moving at about 100 km/h.
We'll be at the station
in less than five minutes.
To save the others,
separate the locomotive from the other cars,
it was the only way!
But with only our two forces,
it won't move an inch!
That's right.
I was counting on Ran's help to do that.
That's why Noah's Ark
...made all the passengers disappear.
That's it.
I'm out of cards.
It's all over, Dad.
Hey, don't give up!
Find a way to survive..,
...and bring Ran back to life!
Shinichi...
You're not stained with blood yet.
You're still alive, right?
Are you going to give up?
Yet you already hold in your hands...
the knot that will lead to the truth...
Among the ball of colorless threads of life,
is the red thread of murder.
Untie this knot,
isn't that our job?
Holmes!
He was not on Dartmoor?
Is that a bug?
What does that mean?
Jack the Ripper is dead, so...
why do we have to end up stained with blood?
That's it! That's it!
That's what he meant!
The freight car!
Hey, wait a minute! What's the meaning of this?
Never mind, come on!
We'll use these axes
to break the wine barrels!
Hurry up!
On my signal, we dive!
All right, then.
Now!
Can you hear them?
No, nothing yet.
Please, Lord Conan!
Save Ran, please!
Stained with blood, eh? I see.
He was talking about dipping himself in red wine to soften the blow.
We owe you our lives, Holmes.
No... dad.
Are you awake, four-eyes?
Looks like you won.
"You?"
That's what I thought.
Good thing I trusted you.
Thank you. You're welcome.
You're welcome,
Noah's Ark.
Or do you prefer Hiroki?
You borrowed Moroboshi's data
so you could play the game too, right?
When did you guess?
No need to worry.
I've cut off the connection to the real world for now.
The first moment I had any doubts,
was in front of Big Ben.
You noticed it before the hands moved.
In fact you just wanted
to make us understand the meaning of the time.
Then there was the football.
You complained that the ball was dirty and threw it behind you.
It's impossible for a real soccer fan not to be interested in a hundred-year-old ball.
in a hundred-year-old football.
You put us all at risk,
but the truth is, you were confident that we would be able
overcome these challenges.
The reset of Japan,
was not to kill the 2nd and 3rd generations.
It was to make us overcome obstacles without our parents,
and make us grow up through this video game.
That's what you were hoping for, right?
You couldn't be ruthless.
Holmes' last appearance is proof of that.
You finally brought in a helper character at the critical moment.
I borrowed Moroboshi's body,
and I infiltrated the game...
because I wanted to play with friends, at least once.
Because I was always working.
Forgive me.
That must have been scary for you.
But me you know, I really had fun!
And then I was jealous.
Even far away, you understand each other,
you and your father...
Besides, your father

has avenged the death of mine.
Thank you.
It's time to say goodbye.
But your soul will continue
to survive on Noah's Ark, right?
If a computer like me exists,
the adults will end up using me for evil purposes.
It was still too early
for an AI to come into the world.
Come on,
you can go back to your world.
But once you wake up, I want you to keep this in mind:
Reality is not as simple as a video game.
I hope you get to see your father again.
Goodbye,
Shinichi Kudo.
Ran!
He's done it!
- Thank God you're okay! - That was fun!
I did my best!
You did great!
Conan!
Thank you for saving us!
We worked hard, right?
We had a great adventure!
I definitely prefer the real thing.
But what happened?
I knew you could do it, Conan.
But Ran..,
Jumping with him was crazy!
I remembered a quote that Shinichi likes!
The one that Holmes said to Moriarty
during their first meeting?
What? How do you know that?
Ah well, you know, Shinichi told me that too!
Ah, right.
Still, it's a good thing he was harping on it!
Again, harping is a bit much!
- Ran! - Dad!
I'm so glad you're okay!
Even for you, it took a while.
Yes.
I had a lot of fun.
Noah's Ark is ending its own life.
Rest in peace...
Hiroki.
What happened today?
Let tomorrow end calmly too.
Whether something happens or not
The sky continues
To expand
Since I met you
I cherish every second that passes
My love knows no rest
There are bound to be days when you worry
You don't want to surrender to others
Amongst all these tangled threads
We are
Tied together
I remember your warmth
Your honest voice echoes in me
My love knows no respite
This bond as if buried in darkness
Make it come back to you
Since I met you
I feel like I'm not alone
If I know you're watching me
I can go on living with this feeling
My love has no rest
Wherever I go, it won't go away

I've got to practice so I don't get laughed at anymore.
