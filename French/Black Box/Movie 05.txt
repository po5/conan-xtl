Mount Fuji!
Beautiful!
It is indeed the most beautiful mountain of Japan.
What's that over there?
That's the twin towers recently built in West Tama.
With their height of 319 and 294 meters,
they are the tallest in Japan.
Wow, I'd like to go up there.
Professor, can we go there on our way back from camping tomorrow?
It's a bit of a detour, but why not?
West Tama, huh?
Teiji Moriya
Mayor Okamoto
This is where I revealed the crimes of the former mayor
and Teiji Moriya challenged me.
Still...
- They really like camping... - We're going camping today!
And tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow!
Auto Camping
That was good!
Hey, you left a lot of rice grains.
My mother told me never to leave anything!
And she's right.
Farmers have to work hard 88 times
to bring you each grain.
- Work 88 times? - That's right.
If we separate the parts of the "rice" character
we get the number 88.
Is that right?
- Oh, yes! - He is right.
That's why at 88 we celebrate his beiju, the age of rice.
By the way, at 77 we celebrate his kiju, for happiness,
and at 99 we celebrate hakuju, the white age.
Do you know why we say kiju for the 77 years old?
Because the ki in kiju looks like 77 when divided.
And without the "one" above it, the character "hundred" becomes "white".
One hundred
White
(Hakuju)
I should have expected it, you really know a lot of things.
In fact, you lie about your age, right?
You don't know the half of it.
On that note, I have a little quiz for you!
How old do you think 44 is?
44, you say?
I'll give you a hint: it's a name followed by a compound word!
A name followed by a compound word...
What is it?
44... 88...
I don't believe this.
Professor...
I get it, but it's way too stupid.
You think so?
And you, Ai, did you find it?
I don't think so either!
- The same! - I can't either.
So here is the answer!
Do you agree that 44 is half of 88?
If 88 is rice, and this is half...
then it's semi-complete rice!
That was it.
Well? Don't you like it?
Half rice, in song, is half a verse!
It's a joke!
W.C.
That was close...
It's cold!
Tomorrow we will be at the twin towers of West Tama.
Of course, he will be with us.
We found him, Chief.
At the twin towers of West Tama...
People say it's the closest place to heaven.
It is perfect.
Close to the other world...
That's where we'll execute him!
DETECTIVE CONAN COUNTS DOWN TO HEAVEN
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug, and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
And when Ran asked me my name, I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa - Conan Doyle
To find out who those thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
Perfect!
I'm Hiroshi Agasa, the genius inventor.
Let me introduce you to my masterpieces:
The hypodermic projectile watch,
the voice modulating bow tie,
the hyper-fortifying shoes,
the turbo-engine skateboard...
And finally, the radar glasses.
I recently added a new feature to these glasses.
It is...
an infrared vision function!
I designed these inventions to assist Shinichi when he became small.
With the help of these gadgets,
he borrows Mouri's voice to solve investigations
and arrest criminals.
Take this!
Oh yes, I almost forgot!
His little friends...
each have a Junior Detective badge

as well as a watch-lamp of my own creation.
There are four of them besides me who know the real identity of Conan.
His father, Yusaku Kudo, author of detective novels,
his mother and former actress, Yukiko Kudo,
Heiji Hattori, the high school detective from the west,
and a fellow student of Conan, Ai Haibara.
But her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She used to work with the men in black,
until her sister, Akemi, was killed by the organization.
In order to escape them,
she swallowed the same drug that was given to Shinichi
and also became younger.
The men in black pursue Haibara relentlessly.
And now...
something is going on behind my back!
My body has become younger, but not my mind!
I'll solve all the mysteries!
There is only one truth!
It's really tight in here...
Because you came up behind, Genta!
And you were in the front going in...
You guys seemed to have more fun here.
Hey, Conan, move over a little!
That's eating five bowls of rice first thing in the morning.
Excuse me Ayumi, I'm getting ahead of myself.
Mitsuhiko, shall we play a game?
We can play the 30 seconds game!
We count 30 seconds in our heads,
and stop the clock when we're done.
Sounds fun, let's all play!
I have to focus on the road.
Without me either.
28... 29... 30 !
40 seconds!
I'm ten seconds over!
29... 30 !
- 27 seconds. - You were almost there!
And 30! What?
59 seconds...
Your stopwatch is broken!
It's not the stopwatch that's broken!
28... 29... 30 !
Exactly 30 seconds!
- Too strong, Ayumi! - You have psychic powers!
It's just a fluke.
Hey, by the way, Haibara!
Who were you calling last night?
I didn't call anyone.
You must have been asleep, right?
Didn't I?
West Tama Twin Towers
It's so high!
You can't even see the top.
It looks like they're going above the clouds!
Hey, that's Conan!
Oh, Ran! What are you doing here?
Hey, why are you all here?
We're just checking out the towers on our way back from camping.
What about you guys?
Mio Tokiwa, the one who owns those towers,
took the same seminar as me at the university.
She sent me an invitation before the official opening in 7 days!
- Oh, I didn't know. - You didn't know either, did you?
Dad didn't tell me either!
I thought it was suspicious, but I finally got him to confess!
Confess? But I wasn't hiding it!
I understood!
You came to watch your uncle!
Yes, especially since Mio Tokiwa...
...she's the heiress of the Tokiwa Group, and she's still single!
No wonder Ran's worried, since her mother lives elsewhere.
Excuse me, sir...
- Mr. Kogoro Mouri? - Uh, yes!
Chinami Sawaguchi (29) - Secretary
I'm Mrs. Tokiwa's secretary, Chinami Sawaguchi.
The president is with a client right now,
but let me guide you to the showroom.
Tower A, where we are, contains only offices.
And from the 31st floor up,
it's all Tokiwa Group offices.
The showroom is on the 1st and 2nd floors.
What kind of company is Tokiwa?
They mainly make software,
but they also deal with everything related to computers.
Even video games?
I have to see that!
That sounds pretty interesting!
Welcome everyone!
This is Mr. Hara, general manager and programmer.
How do you do?
What's that?
A game console, perhaps.
Would you like to test it?
Yoshiaki Hara (age 32) - General Manager of Tokiwa
This computer simulates what you will look like in ten years.
Our face in ten years? That's impressive.
Professor, I want to try it!
Let's go then, sit down!
I don't want to look ten years older.
Are you ready? I'll throw it.
Here we go, your faces in ten years.
Huh? Nothing changes.
It doesn't work, this device!
Yes, it does work.
Come and see Ayumi's.

She's cute!
You'll be more successful than this girl, believe me!
As if a kid could understand the charm of adults!
- Anyway, let's go try it too! - Yeah!
Who's this?
Typical high school heads!
I think you look great on them!
You do?
Yes, you do.
Now it's me and Ran's turn!
A typical grandma's head!
Oh, shut up!
She looks like a younger Eri!
She's far too beautiful for Shinichi!
It's infuriating to think that she'll be all his.
What are you talking about, Sonoko?
I'm not...
What's that?
Why are you blushing, huh?
No, it's not what you think...
It's Conan and Haibara's turn!
Hey, Haibara!
Not for me.
I'll pass too.
With ten more years, I'll look like Shinichi,
and Haibara will look like Shiho Miyano, after all.
Let's see your arrogant face in ten years!
Come on, Haibara!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Damn, this sucks!
I wonder what Conan will look like.
A mistake?
That's strange...
How lucky is that?
Maybe this means we won't exist in ten years.
Yes, I understand.
Dear guests,
please follow me to the reception room on the 75th floor.
The elevator is this way...
- My apologies! - Oh, it's nothing.
That's all her!
She's from the year of the boar and often rushes headlong into things!
So you get that a lot.
Does this elevator go straight to the 75th floor?
Yes.
This is the VIP elevator.
It goes directly where you want it to.
The only way to stop it from the outside,
would be from the concert hall on the 66th floor.
It's high!
What a view!
You'd think we were getting close to heaven!
We're in the middle of preparing for our launch party,
so it's a little crowded.
Mr. Mouri!
It's been a long time, Miss Tokiwa.
Thank you for coming all the way here.
- I was supposed to come alone, but... - I'm his daughter, Ran!
My mother says hello!
Hey, Ran!
Let me introduce you.
My classmate, Sonoko Suzuki,
and the inventor, Mr. Agasa.
And this is Conan Edogawa,
Ai Haibara, Ayumi Yoshida,
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya, and finally Genta Kojima.
Welcome everyone, I'm Mio Tokiwa.
Let me introduce you too.
This is my art teacher.
Hosui Kisaragi (60) - Painter
Japanese painting artist, Hosui Kisaragi.
Hosui Kisaragi ?
The author of the famous paintings of Mount Fuji?
I know you!
You're the detective here, Sleepy Kogoro.
That's "Kogoro the sleepy one".
He stinks of booze, that old man!
This is Mr. Iwamatsu Oki, councilman of West Tama.
Iwamatsu Ã”ki (55 years old) Tama city councilor
Mio Tokiwa (36) - President Tokiwa
He helped us with the construction of the towers.
And this is the man who designed the buildings.
Hidehiko Kazama (41) - Architect
The architect, Mr. Hidehiko Kazama.
Mr. Mouri and I are related in a way.
I am the disciple of Teiji Moriya.
Of Teiji Moriya?
But I reassure you...
It's clear that I'm not going to blow up those buildings.
Blow them up...
Because they're not the same height, or symmetrical?
You know a lot about it.
Come quickly! You can see it up close!
- It is superb! - And huge!
You've got quite a view!
You can see Mount Fuji even at night, here.
Even at night?
What does she mean by that?
What can you see on the other side?
What's that?
The roof of a dome?
Tower B is dedicated to commerce.
At the bottom there are stores,
and on top there are hotel rooms.
On the highest floor there is a swimming pool,
and the dome that covers it may be open.
Well, my word!
Tell me, Mio...
Can I get you a hotel room this weekend?
It is that they are not yet in use...
So you refuse?
As you wish.
I'll get you a suite on the 67th floor.
I'd like to have dinner together, too...
That's an original brooch.
A gift from an admirer?
Oh no, I bought it myself.
Mio!
I'm going home!
Ah, I'll walk you home!

No need.
He looked upset...
Miss Mio bought all his works to sell them at a good price.
So it's a little tense.
Chocolate!
Damn, you saw me.
I'll give you one.
- Here you go. - Thank you, sir!
Thank you!
Thank you!
He's a genius in his field, but he acts like a child.
Well, that's what allows him to create fun games.
I know!
I'm developing a new video game.
Could you give me your opinion?
- On a game? - Really, can we?
My house is in Soho.
We live in Beika!
It's very close then! By bus, we're there very quickly!
Would you like to come next Sunday?
Okay, we'll come!
What's wrong with you, Ai?
Nothing's wrong.
Ran...
I'd like to ask your advice in private.
Can we meet tomorrow?
Yeah, no problem...
I'll tell you the time and place later.
Ran...
Can we talk alone?
The hair's the problem, isn't it?
Maybe I'll try to lock them up too!
You don't see cars like this often in this day and age!
What's the name again?
A Porsche 356 A.
What?
You two!
This is the VIP elevator!
Employees must use the other one!
- Uh, yes! - Our apologies!
Hey, that car, where was it?
And the color?
Oh, it was parked out front. And it was black.
That's Gin's car!
Wait, Conan!
Where are you going?
Hurry up. Faster, faster.
There it is!
Oh, my God!
What the...
What were they doing here?
To tell you the truth...
I've been in love with Ayumi since kindergarten.
But Ayumi seems to like Conan...
Tell me what to do, Ran!
How did you and Shinichi..,
...from childhood friends to lovers?
Wait, me and Shinichi aren't...
And then...
I've been thinking a lot about Haibara lately too...
If I like two girls at the same time...
Does that make me a bad guy?
No, you're not a bad guy.
Falling in love is a beautiful thing.
You should cherish those feelings.
So...
But for now, being good friends is enough, right?
With Ayumi and Ai.
And Conan and Genta too, of course.
Yeah, right!
Our donut boxes are half price!
Hello !
Actually...
I really like Conan.
But he likes another girl.
Is it Ai?
No... It's you, Ran!
It can't be!
Yes, Conan does, I'm sure of it!
Then could you talk to him?
Tell him your boyfriend is Shinichi..,
And that he should leave it alone!
What?
Otherwise it's too sad for Conan...
But we don't know if Conan is in love with me.
Yes, I know it!
How do you know?
Women's intuition!
You do?
Do you? What?
I say that apparently, Conan is in love with me!
What are you talking about?
It's not true, you idiot!
How would you know?
Ah, well...
Well, childhood loves come and go.
Don't think about it too much!
Hey, think about it more seriously!
In this case, it's better not to lie
and be honest with yourself.
Be honest with myself?
The appropriate answer should come naturally to you.
Well, see you later! I'll call you back.
I'm the least honest person in the story...
Twin Towers of West Tama
Tower B, floor 67 - Continued
What the...
Police Station
I've gathered you here for one reason.
In a hotel suite in the Twin Towers...
a man has been stabbed.
Oh, that man!
It's Mr. Iwamatsu Oki-kun, from West Tama!
When he rented the room to Miss Mio Tokiwa,
you were apparently there.
- Chiba! - Yes, I was.
The time of death of Mr. Oki-kun
is estimated between 10 pm and midnight.
The murder weapon is probably a knife,
but nothing was found at the scene.
However, - in Mr. Oki-'s hand,
we found a broken sake cup.
- A sake cup? - Here it is.
It's a choko cup of some value.
Mr. Oki-kun had a taste for alcohol,

so it is very likely that he brought it with him.
We think he may have wanted to leave a clue about his killer.
So the potential suspects,
are these five people, in your opinion?
Since the building is not yet open to the public...
I know!
The choko cup must refer to the chocolate!
The killer is Mr. Yoshiaki Hara, who loves chocolate!
No way!
It can't be Mr. Hara!
Yeah, he's a good guy, he shared his chocolate with us!
Shut up, kids!
Mr. Hara is probably innocent.
Of the five people we interviewed,
he was the only one with an alibi.
Alibi?
You could have told me that earlier, detective!
Maybe the broken cup means the killer is cracked.
In that case, Mr. Mouri is our prime suspect.
Shiratori!
That was a joke.
What the hell...
What about the motive for the crime?
We're still investigating that,
but if Mr. Oki-kun was only a city councilor,
he actually had more influence than the mayor.
By the way, about the twin towers,
he himself would have revised a city law that forbade
the construction of such tall buildings.
That's why Miss Mio
couldn't refuse the room, even though the hotel wasn't open.
By the way...
The brooch Miss Mio was wearing...
It looked a bit like the cup, didn't it?
Wait a minute!
- Mio would never... - Well, I...
The person most likely to commit this murder,
would be her.
After all, Mr. Oki's room was on the 67th floor of the B tower,
that is to say the floor below her room.
It can't be...
Say,
the choko cup looks like the pots used in Japanese painting, right?
My father does some traditional painting,
and he uses a pot like that as a mortar to prepare the gofun.
One more person who can be related to this cup...
On the other hand, I don't really see a connection
with Ms. Sawaguchi and Mr. Kazama.
Mr. Shiratori.
Is it true that Mr. Kazama is Teiji Moriya's disciple?
Yes, it is true.
But unlike Moriya, who was very artistic,
he is more technically minded and not really picky.
As for Chinami Sawaguchi,
his father was a journalist,
and he died of exhaustion when she was in her 4th year at the university.
But for now, - none of this seems to be related to Mr. Oki.
Inspector...
I think the culprit wants to interfere with the opening of the towers...
The blood only spurted out on the bottom of the cupboard.
And in an unnatural way, it seems.
It's not for children.
Right.
But still...
What were Gin and Vodka doing at the Twin Towers?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
We're talking about a sake cup!
Hey, Haibara.
You think it's them?
It's true they have alcohol code names,
but their victim couldn't have left such an obvious message.
They're too careful.
- Is that okay? - Yes.
Beika Station
Mitsuhiko, we're here!
You are early.
We were so excited!
We are happy, we will beat Conan this time!
Beat who, you say?
How did you know?
It's too easy to know what you're thinking.
You wanted to solve the case alone, but if you had told me,
I would have stopped you because it's too dangerous.
Just...
I let it go this time,
but no more sneaking around, right!
Yes !
Did they really learn their lesson?
So who are you going to today?
Mr. Kazama and Mr. Kisaragi's.
Tomorrow we'll go to Mr. Hara's.
Mr. Kazama lives in Setagaya,
but he has a shop in Asahino, one station over from West Tama,
and he stays there until the towers open.
Mr. Kisaragi lives alone,
and he built a workshop house in Asahino 3 years ago.
They did a lot of research.
In the end, Haibara should have come.
Did you invite her too?
Yes.
But she said she had to clean her room today.
Big brother!
In the end, this is how traitors end up...
Big brother... Big brother!
Asahino Station
Let's see...

The loft rented by Mr. Kazama should be in front of the station.
And Mr. Kisaragi's house...
It should be behind that hill!
Let's start with Mr. Kazama!
This is CAD, right?
You make all the plans by computer?
Well, you know your stuff.
No one uses a drawing board these days.
A drawing board?
I see!
You on the other hand, don't know that!
In the old days,
we used to put a sheet of paper on a big board
and we drew with a pencil and a ruler.
Really?
By the way, kids, did you want something?
Come on, ask him quickly!
- Why me? - It was your idea!
Okay, then...
Actually, Mr. Kazama, we think...
...you have a nice loft!
It's airy and you can see Mount Fuji from here!
Don't worry about it.
We're the Junior Detectives!
We're investigating - the murder of Mr. Oki-kun.
That's promising!
Alright, ask me all your questions,
my little detectives.
Let's begin then.
What did you think of the deceased Mr. Oki-kun?
You're getting right to the point.
He was a very vulgar man.
But I got this job thanks to his law revisions.
I'm grateful to him for that.
Were there any disputes
between you and Mr. Oki when you were making the plans?
Not with Mr. Oki, no.
But with other people, though?
No, I didn't mean it that way.
Oh, this photo...
That's my only son.
He's cute, right?
When I work alone at night,
I always want to hear his voice.
Sometimes I call him even though I know he's asleep.
A real sugar daddy.
Kisaragi Mansion
Go ahead.
Well...
We're the Junior Detectives.
About Mr. Oki-kun's murder...
Children shouldn't get involved in grown-ups' business!
That said,
you won't want to leave empty-handed.
I'm going to offer you something.
It's nice that you did our portraits, but...
We couldn't ask him for anything.
We can't investigate too much without being police...
That's the way it is.
It's already 6 o'clock, let's stop for today.
Agasa's house
What was that noise?
Oh, that was my snoring...
Haibara calling in the middle of the night?
You know, Genta had mentioned it when we were camping that night.
I wonder if he was right...
But...
She shouldn't have any more contacts to call.
I trust her.
But there is still a possibility
that her fear of the men in black will drive her back to them.
Don't worry, teacher.
Nothing to worry about. Bye-bye, now.
Hi! You're early.
Hello, Conan.
- You're late! - We were waiting for you.
Haibara is coming to Mr. Hara's with us.
I see.
That's okay, right?
I'm interested in Mr. Hara's video game, too.
Apartment 407.
This is Mr. Hara's place.
What's this?
- The door's open. - What's the matter?
That's not very safe!
It's us, Mr. Hara!
Conan!
Mr. Hara!
Get help!
Shot in the chest. He died instantly.
A knife?
He was about to eat some cake.
This is...
a sake cup!
But then...
it's the same killer!
What do you think, Mr. Coroner?
We'll need a complete autopsy to be sure,
but I estimate the time of death to be yesterday, between afternoon and early evening.
Mr. Hara had obviously just cut himself a piece of chocolate cake.
That's when the killer came in,
and he attempted to struggle with the silver knife he was holding.
But...
what about this sake cup?
It makes sense.
These are serial murders perpetrated by Mr. Oki-kun's killer.
It is also now more likely that the cup is not a message
left by the victim, but by the culprit.
Hi, kid.
Are you finished, Mr. Tome?
Yes.
By the way, I heard you found him?
Yeah, it was scary...
Ah, is this the sake cup?
Yes, that's right.
What's this? These pieces are not stained with blood.
Say, Mr. Tome,
is that all there was?
Of course it is!
No clue ever escapes me!
See you next time!

That should convince you that it's not them.
They don't leave any traces.
Mouri Detective Agency
Thanks to the autopsy, we now know the time of death.
The murder took place between 5 and 6 pm yesterday.
Also, all the data on his computer has been erased.
This may be related to the motive of the crime.
Mr. Kisaragi is innocent, since you were at his house at 5:00 pm.
However,
after your visit, Mr. Kazama
would have had time to drive there.
What about Mio?
Mrs. Tokiwa and her secretary, Mrs. Sawaguchi,
have no alibi for those hours.
I know that this does not please you,
but Mio Tokiwa,
Hidehiko Kazama,
and Chinami Sawaguchi are our main suspects.
And it is very likely that the murders will continue.
Inspector Megure has therefore advised
Mrs. Tokiwa to postpone her party on Saturday...
But she refused.
And that's not all.
She also gave me this for you.
It's an invitation to her launch party.
And, uh...
It's got our names on it, me and Conan and the kids.
Us, too?
Really, what was she thinking?
Hibari residence
Chief!
Is this the place?
The owner confirmed it to me by looking at her picture.
So she escaped from the organization
by hiding out in this dump?
The rent was paid in advance for a year,
and the phone goes to voice mail.
I asked the neighbors,
and sometimes the phone rings and someone leaves a message.
But when I wanted to listen to the answering machine,
it's strange, but...
There was no message recorded.
Right
Who did this, and for what purpose?
A woman is still a woman.
There is a computer in the car.
Go get it.
It's a tracking software developed by the organization.
It only takes 20 seconds to trace the source.
Yes, sir!
You have reached Miyano.
I am not available,
so please leave your name and message after the beep.
Akemi, it's me.
The day after tomorrow I will be at the launch party for the twin towers.
Tracing failure
Kudo...
As I thought, you were calling your sister.
Or rather to her house,
in the apartment where she was hiding when she was alive.
I see...
You needed to talk to your dead sister.
I understand how you feel.
- But it's far too risky... - As if you could understand!
- Hey, Haibara! - Wait up!
It's better to leave it for now.
Damn it!
It was only a matter of seconds before we had it!
Boss!
You've reached Miyano.
I'm not available...
She erased her message!
You think she noticed we were listening?
No, that's impossible.
She deletes her messages so that no one listens to them afterwards.
She doesn't suspect for a second that we were there,
listening to everything.
Do you think she'll call again?
Probably never again, no.
But...
it looks like the sky is the limit.
The launch party for the twin towers...
It's time, Sherry.
I can't wait to see your face freeze forever.
Teitan Elementary School
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was aware of the danger.
I knew I would have to stop at some point.
But every time I felt lonely,
or the fear consumed me,
I would pick up the phone without realizing it.
I wanted to hear his voice, even for just a few seconds.
Silly girl.
You're not alone.
I was planning on quitting soon, anyway.
I won't do it again.
I deleted the messages, don't worry.
But...
Lately I've been wondering who I am.
Who am I?
And where should I exist?
I don't have a place.
Haibara says she has no place!
What are you talking about?
Your place is right here, finally!
I belong here.
I'm here.
And I'm here!
You see?
I told you, you're not alone.
Twin towers
Main control room
Basement 1 - Control room
She's not here yet, the rich kid?
She's already on her way.
I can't wait for the party!
There's sure to be some good food!

I want a bowl of rice with eel!
I don't think they serve that.
Say, I wonder about something.
What if Mr. Hara is actually one of the men in black?
That wouldn't be impossible.
They've been recruiting promising young people for a long time
in the fields of security, medicine and science.
And Mr. Oki-kun?
They wouldn't be very interested in his job,
but in his youth, who knows?
In any case, once he joined the organization,
those who want to escape or who try to betray them
are eliminated without mercy.
Just like they try to kill me.
So if the culprit is among these four people...
Yes.
There is a good chance that he is also from the organization.
I'm here, sorry for the wait!
Sonoko! What happened to your hair?
I wanted to change my image.
I did what she did,
wavy curls!
So, how does it look?
How does what look? You want to say something?
No, nothing at all.
He's under Miss Sonoko's spell.
Really, Conan?
No way!
Maybe I should curl my hair too...
Inspector, we should go to the party.
No.
Since Mrs. Tokiwa has refused our help,
we can only wait here.
We'll just have to pray that nothing happens...
Oh dear, caviar, foie gras, duck...
I can't resist !
- I'm going to try it too... - Not you!
Be reasonable, Professor.
I'll get you some low-calorie dishes.
This little one acts as if she were your wife.
I'm hungry all the time, because of her.
This car is so cool!
It's a Ford Mustang convertible!
But how did they put a car together here?
They probably assembled it piece by piece here.
No, they didn't.
They took it up in the freight elevator.
The freight elevator?
We have one at our house too.
They're bigger and can lift heavy things.
Even an elephant?
Yeah, I think so...
Do you know many people who have elephants?
What a beautiful sight.
"If Shinichi was here to see this landscape with me,
"I could die happy!"
You thought so, didn't you?
Nonsense!
I wish we could have seen Mount Fuji from the two towers,
but the foundation wasn't strong enough for that.
Oh...
Tower B doesn't have a view of Mount Fuji, so.
Dear guests, I am delighted to welcome you
to the Tokiwa Towers launch party.
Thank you all for coming.
First of all, I would like to propose a game.
In honor of my father, the late Kanenari Tokiwa,
and for the 30th anniversary of the Tokiwa group, whose name means "time,"
it will be the game of counting 30 seconds!
It's like the game you invented!
For the person who counts right or comes closest to it,
this car...
A Mustang convertible will be offered as a reward!
- Awesome! - A car!
A convertible imported from overseas!
That's so cool.
However,
in the event of a tie, the winner will be decided by rock-paper-scissors,
and the loser will have to settle for this mountain bike with helmet included.
- I prefer the bike. - Me too!
We couldn't drive the car.
It's in the bag, Mitsuhiko!
We have Ayumi on our side!
It's like we already won!
Conan... Where did you go?
Everyone hand in their watches.
We'll return them to you with a matching gem.
Did you hear that? A gem!
The Tokiwa group is good...
Here you go.
Take a flag when you drop it off.
Go ahead.
- Here you go. - No thanks, I'm fine.
Ditto.
I don't wear a watch.
Besides, I don't feel like playing.
All right, then.
Let the children come closer so that we can see them well.
Well then?
Don't Conan and Haibara play?
With that, we'll start.
Count 30 seconds from the signal,
then raise the flag we gave you.
Let's go!
Ready? Start!
- 8... 9... 10...  - 15... 16...
I've lost count!
That's it!
That's it!
Damn...
I have to copy someone...
- And there you go ! - You, with the blue flag!

Congratulations, you are our winner!
Daddy!
Seriously?
It's you, Mr. Mouri!
Please, come closer!
Excuse me, folks!
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri!
Care to comment?
Well, I guess I can kiss the rental cars goodbye!
Oh, boy, Dad...
We lost.
I was only at 25...
I was at 12...
All right, fine.
- Get back to me and... - Excuse me, sir.
- Mr. Kazama, please... - Excuse me, please.
Dear guests.
I'd like to introduce our chief guest!
The pride of our country, master of Japanese painting,
Hosui Kisaragi, whose works are shown here!
Renowned for his love of Mount Fuji,
he painted it in all its splendor for over 30 years.
And to celebrate the opening of the twin towers
he has created a new piece by his student Miss Mio Tokiwa!
Let me tell you: Mount Fuji under the spring snow!
This is...
What is it?
President!
Damn it!
Untie her!
Get Mio down!
- And lower that curtain! - Yes!
It's too late...
There's a piano wire tied to her collar!
Is it tied to the painting?
It's a...
a sake cup!
But then... This incident too!
What happened? Miss Mio Tokiwa was...
- Let's go! - Yes!
A painting of Mt. Fuji...
You can see Mt. Fuji even at night here.
That's what she meant.
To sum up the facts,
someone hung a piano wire on her necklace.
The rope went over the stage,
and lifted her up as the painting went down.
I see.
Who was on the stage at that time?
Me and Master Kisaragi.
All right, stand here.
- Kiba, go to Mrs. Tokiwa's place. - Yes, sir.
These lamps are for reference.
Miss Mio was in the center.
I was here.
And you, Ms. Sawaguchi...
- You were backstage? - Yes, I was.
Right here, I was lowering the board.
Where did she get her necklace?
She told me it was a gift,
but I don't know from whom.
When was the painting brought in?
Last night.
We brought it in ourselves,
accompanied by Master Kisaragi.
So whoever is best able to attach the rope to the painting...
Sorry, but I don't know anything.
I'm thinking about it, Mr. Kisaragi...
You were upset that Mio sold your paintings, weren't you?
That's not a good enough reason to kill someone.
And especially, if I believe your words,
we're talking about serial murders, aren't we?
If that is the case,
since I had an alibi during Mr. Hara's murder,
I can't be the culprit.
We didn't tell Mr. Kisaragi about the sake cup.
He couldn't place the cup to blame it on the serial killer.
Excuse me...
In the dark, I heard someone approaching
and said something to Miss Mio.
Was it true? - Was it a man or a woman?
I only know that I smelled perfume.
Yes, it was me!
But I...
it was to get the president to confirm the program.
Inspector, I know who did it!
The culprit is you, Chinami Sawaguchi!
That's not true!
Why would I kill her?
Ms. Sawaguchi...
Your father was a very upright journalist,
who constantly attacked corrupt politicians, right?
After your father's death,
you became President Tokiwa's secretary.
But during the construction of the towers,
bribes were going around!
Mio and Mr. Hara conspired
to pay a bribe to Mr. Oki-kun,
so that he would have the city's laws revised!
Having inherited your father's sense of justice,
you couldn't forgive that.
That's why you killed them.
No !
But, Mouri...
The sake cup left by the killer
has nothing to do with Madame Sawaguchi!
Oh yes it does, Inspector.
The word choko is written "boar's mouth" in kanji.
Choko
Ms. Sawaguchi is of the sign of the boar,
and has "mouth" in her name.

If we combine the two, we get the word choko!
We can therefore deduce that
that by breaking the cup which represented her
she wanted to leave a message on the scene of the crime:
that of the immense anger inherited from her father.
I see!
Her theory holds up when he's not sleeping...
It's nothing but a far-fetched interpretation.
Come again?
The sake cup is not broken this time!
If she wanted to express her anger...
You're annoying me, get out of here!
Ouch!
You're a little confused, aren't you?
If you have a theory, enlighten me.
I don't.
All I can say is,
is that Miss Mio drank too much tonight.
If she wasn't drunk,
don't you think she would have noticed the rope being tied?
A pearl!
What is she doing here?
Wait a minute, maybe...
Mr. Kazama!
Tell them I'm innocent!
Well, I didn't see anything in the dark...
If the culprit is who I think it is...
I've got it!
That's the motive for the crime!
But that means this case...
Oh, right.
So that's what it meant.
I've got it all figured out.
I hold the key to the mystery surrounding these three murders!
4th basement Electrical room
What's going on?
What's this tremor?
An earthquake?
But what's going on?
An explosion?
Where?
In the generator and electrical room of the 4th basement!
And in the computer room on the 40th floor!
The computer room?
Mr. Kazama!
That's where the Tokiwa Group's main computer is!
We're about to lose vital data!
Hajime Tsukamoto (age 51) Security guard
The fire on the 40th floor has spread to the back of the tower!
Evacuate the area as quickly as possible!
Roger!
Inspector, we need to evacuate the people.
If the generator and the electrical room have exploded,
the alarm won't go off.
The elevator won't work either?
No.
Yes, the panoramic elevator should work!
Should it?
It is powered separately, to evacuate the VIPs.
It works!
- How much can it carry? - Up to nine adults.
Evacuating everyone will take too long!
Are there any other ways out?
If you take the fire escape to the 60th floor,
we can get to Tower B via the catwalk.
Good!
Women, children and seniors will take the elevator.
The others will evacuate by the stairs!
The situation?
The electrical rooms have exploded.
The sprinklers are out.
- And the fire doors? - Closed.
Can we go through tower B to reach it?
Yes, there is a direct elevator.
Good!
Teams A and B, go to the electrical rooms!
Team C is coming with me to take the catwalk,
and we'll go down to the 40th floor!
Got it!
Go ahead, Conan.
You go first, Ran.
Don't argue.
We're overloaded.
Conan...
Don't worry, I'll take the next one.
Fine, go ahead.
Okay, the remaining women, Conan,
and you Mr. Kisaragi, you all take the next one.
I'll take the stairs.
It's just that...
Mr. Kisaragi, you...
Don't treat me like an old man!
Well, whatever you say.
Mr. Kazama, if you please.
Okay, everyone!
I'll guide you, so follow me!
Shiratori.
You three go ahead.
I'll catch up with you.
Got it.
Teacher.
Can you...
Yes, okay.
Right, sir?
I'm sorry...
You can go ahead.
- But I... - That's fine!
We'll take the catwalk on the 60th floor
to evacuate through the other tower.
See you at the bottom!
Come on, hurry up!
Thanks, kids!
Oh no, it's all dark.
How will we find our way out?
What do we do?
We gave them our clocks.
We're in trouble!
Oh dear...
You should have thought of that before getting off the elevator.
I had forgotten!
Conan and Haibara didn't participate in the game!
Let's hurry up and get out!
Wait a minute...
Shouldn't we wait for the elevator to come back?
That would be stupid.
The next one will be full too.
Well, let's hurry to the 60th floor.

Tower B, floor 45 Elevator lobby
- Let's go! - Yes!
Given the size of the explosion and the thoroughness of this plan...
Could it be that the people responsible
are the men in black?
I can understand them wanting to destroy the computer room,
but why the electrical room?
Well, come in.
You too, Chinami.
We'll talk later.
All right, then.
Was it to disable the sprinklers?
Or did they have another purpose?
We're still lucky
that this elevator is powered separately!
It would have been a horror to go down all those stairs!
Oh no!
Gin!
Time to go to sleep, Sherry.
For eternity!
Sonoko, your panties are showing!
What's up? Why are we stopping?
No... Is that someone else?
The laser sight is gone.
Did he understand that it was not her ?
It's no use, it won't start!
Ran, take me up!
Oh get up!
Conan, I'll do it!
Hang in there, Ran!
We're counting on you!
You're amazing, Ran!
Tower A, Floor 45 Main Elevator Hall
Where are we?
The 45th floor.
That's where the catwalk is!
Oh no, smoke!
Let's run to the other tower!
That's me.
Did you find her?
Tower B, floor 60 Bridge hall
No...
There are only men who have crossed over.
She may know we're targeting her and will have fled to the roof.
But she won't escape us.
Destroy the bridge.
Tower A, floor 45 Gangway
Follow me this way, we can get to the other tower!
There's the catwalk!
Watch out, Conan!
What's the matter?
The gangway has collapsed!
Mr. Mouri!
- The elevator has stopped! - What is it?
Ran!
Ran! Are you okay?
We're fine.
What are we going to do, Conan?
It doesn't look good, the track is blocked.
There's a lot of smoke behind the fire door.
No way...
Now what?
It does not have any more batteries.
It's dangerous to go on in the dark.
Let's wait here for help.
Are you okay, Conan?
Ran, you're not going to...
I hope it works like in the movies.
Hold on to me, Conan!
It's Ran!
It's what? Let me see!
Ran!
What's she trying to do?
Aren't you scared, Ran?
Of course I am.
But you're with me.
And Shinichi told me to wait for her.
I have to survive so I can be here when she returns.
Conan, I...
Everything's going to be okay, Ran.
I know better than anyone how you feel.
Damn, the pipe is on fire!
Are you okay, Conan?
Yeah. You're really good, Ran!
Mr. Mouri!
Ran!
- Sonoko! - Thank God you're okay!
You don't have to take risks like that...
What's that?
Look, look, look! The panoramic elevator!
Professor! Where is that person?
Sorry, I lost him along the way!
And I can't find the children either.
What's wrong?
Ayumi, Genta, Mitsuhiko!
Can you hear me?
We can hear you, Conan!
Where are you?
We are...
in front of the 45th floor bridge.
What?
Are they up there?
Takagi call the rescue helicopter!
Uh, yes!
Tower B, Floor 60 Elevator Hall
I'll borrow your lamp!
Hey, kid! Wait up!
What's that?
That noise...
The skateboard!
Is that Conan?
Ouch...
You're amazing!
- So cool! - You're a real hero!
No but really...
This is no time to be impressed.
What the...?
It's Conan's skateboard!
Conan just jumped off the bridge at 60!
What?
This is Megure.
Detective.
We're going up to the roof, send a helicopter!
"We"? Where the hell are you?
It's exhausting to climb 15 floors.
Hang in there, Genta! We're almost there!
Yeah, right.
You go ahead.
Where are you going, Conan?
Hey, where are you going? Hey!
What are they...?
You know Conan, he must have a plan.
Let's get to the roof already.
You're not giving me time to think!
Tower A, floor 75 Reception room
Someone's here!
It's Mr. Oki-Ms. Mio's killer.

Having decided to kill Miss Mio for some reason,
that person gave her the pearl necklace.
And this same person asked her to wear it
during the party where she would exhibit her painting.
So the murderer is...
Right
Miss Mio's art teacher.
Hosui Kisaragi!
You are...
Conan Edogawa.
A detective.
The pearl necklace you gave Miss Mio
was designed to be easily detachable.
And next to it, you prepared a second necklace.
During the evening, you took out this other necklace,
and using a piano wire hidden in the folds of the curtain,
you connected it to the picture of Mount Fuji.
Then you..,
you approached Miss Mio by the light at her feet,
and undid her necklace.
While she was panicking,
you told her that you would help her put it back on.
You then put the other necklace on her.
The one attached to the piano wire.
- In short... - Miss Mio...
was not tricked into putting the piano wire on her collar,
but by putting a collar on her that was already attached to the rope.
That's why she didn't notice anything.
This pearl I found on the floor
fell off when you undid her collar at first.
And you dropped a sake cup
to show that it was a serial killing.
Wait a minute.
Mr. Kisaragi has an alibi for the murder of Mr. Hara.
There's nothing strange about that.
He didn't kill him.
The fire reached the 70th floor!
What about the rescue chopper?
I'll check it now!
Conan.
That night...
after we left, Mr. Kisaragi
went to Mr. Hara's residence to kill him.
But...
he was already dead with a bullet in his heart.
You immediately thought
to make it look like the work of a serial killer,
in order to use your alibi for the murder.
Because if these are serial murders,
an alibi for only one of the crimes was enough to clear you.
Thus,
you broke a cup like for the murder of Mr. Oki-kun.
At that moment,
some pieces fell on already dry blood.
That's why the pieces recovered by Mr. Tome
were not stained with blood.
Then,
on the picture of Mr. Oki-kun's body taken in the hotel room,
the blood had spurted only on the bottom of the wardrobe.
I assume that this is because
because one of your paintings was hanging there.
You pretended to come and offer him a painting on a scroll
to justify your visit and make him lower his guard.
That's a fun theory you have there, little detective.
But you're missing something.
If you're talking about evidence, I have some.
There, in your cane.
Miss Mio's first pearl necklace should be hidden there.
How did you guess I was hiding it in there?
The noise.
After Miss Mio died,
your cane made a different noise.
You have the hearing of a detective.
Ah, here it is!
But why did you kill her?
Because she had sold your paintings at a good price?
No.
The motive of the crime must be linked to the twin towers.
The same goes for the murder of Mr. Oki-kun,
and the attempted murder of Mr Hara.
Your paintings of Mount Fuji...
The last ones all had the same angle and the same composition.
They were painted from the same place, right?
Yes, from the top of a small hill on the outskirts of West Tama.
For years I climbed that hill
to paint my pictures there.
But with age, the climb became difficult.
Therefore, three years ago,
in order to continue painting Mount Fuji in the future,
I bought the hill and built a house there.
I set up my workroom in the perfect place.
From my window...
I had a perfect view of all of Mt. Fuji.
But that woman...
...ruined everything!
But then..,
the broken cup symbolized...
Mount Fuji?
Yes.
Mount Fuji split in two by the twin towers.
It was the expression of his anger.
But...
For Miss Mio, the cup was not broken.

He just left it to show that it was the same series of murders.
He had already made his point:
the painting of Mount Fuji split in two by Miss Mio.
Now that you've discovered the necklace,
there's no way for me to escape.
I'm sorry, sir.
As a detective, I can't let you die.
Hey, we're here!
Congratulations on understanding Hosui Kisaragi's motive.
It's been bothering me ever since we visited his house.
When we came out of Asahi Station,
Mount Fuji appeared to be cut in two by the towers.
And Kisaragi's house was on the opposite side.
But in his studio,
the curtain was closed despite the huge window.
This was because he did not want people to see
Mount Fuji split by the twin towers.
I have one more question.
Do you want to know who killed Mr. Hara?
It's just a guess on my part,
but he was holding a silver knife.
Silver in Japanese is called gin.
Look up there.
The same word, gin, on a bottle label,
how do you pronounce it?
Gin!
I think Gin had Mr. Hara at gunpoint,
and he reacted by grabbing the knife from the table.
He may be smart,
Gin must have thought he was just trying to defend himself.
He didn't realize he was leaving us a message.
So Mr. Hara was working for them?
Yes.
He probably hacked into their computers
to steal data or something.
That's why they took him out and erased the data from his computer.
And in case he transferred the data,
they blew up Tokiwa's main computer.
That makes sense.
Damn, I'm out of batteries.
I'll go upstairs and get help to carry Mr. Kisaragi.
Wait for me here!
B Tower Roof - Swimming Pool
There's no wind, so it should be fine.
Everyone come back!
Hurry up!
Who could do such a thing ?
With this, the helicopter won't be able to approach.
They can wait for the fire to die out,
but by then...
Their time will be up.
I can't take it anymore.
What's wrong with this building?
The way things are going,
we're going to have to wait for the fire on the roof to die down.
We can't wait.
A bomb?
There's one under every table.
And the timer...
Only four minutes left!
Damn it!
They want to blow up the whole room
...so no one will know who their target was!
Ran.
Hurry up!
Captain, that's not far enough!
Damn it, can't we do anything?
Wait a minute...
That roof...!
Great, the keys are on it!
I see it!
We can reach the other tower with this car!
We can't.
There are 50 m between the two towers.
To jump from one to the other, you would have to go about 60 m.
We are 20 m above the other tower.
In a straight line,
an object should advance in the air without loss of speed,
but in descent, because of gravity,
it undergoes an acceleration of a certain percentage.
To calculate the time it would take to fall 20 m,
we use the formula t = âˆš2S/g.
The t is the time in seconds,
the g is the acceleration,
or 9.80665 m/s squared.
S is the fall distance, so 20 m.
By applying these numbers to the formula,
we get 2.02 seconds.
In short, we would fall 20 m in about two seconds.
We would have to fall 60 m in two seconds.
So 30 meters in one second.
So we would have to go at 108 km/h.
Considering the length of this floor,
we could accelerate to 50 or 60 km/h at best.
We'd crash before we reached the other tower...
But with this?
Don't tell me you want to enjoy the explosion!
What? What are you talking about?
He wants to use the blast from the explosion
to propel us forward.
To do what?
It's that or die, anyway.
Let's give it a shot.
Alright Conan, let's do it!
- I'm in. - Let's do it right!
Timing will be everything.
If the bomb doesn't go off
at the exact moment the car goes through the window,
we'll lose speed and crash to the ground.
I know.
The problem is that we won't see the timer from the car.
And my watch is out of batteries.

In this case, Ayumi can do it!
Ayumi could manage to count exactly 30 seconds!
But she made a mistake earlier...
What do you say, Ayumi? Can you do it?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure. But...
If you are with me, Conan...
If you are here with me,
I think I can do it!
Ayumi...
In that case,
I will stand by the timer until 30 seconds are left,
and then I'll go upstairs, is that okay with you?
No time to think.
Let's do it.
Do what?
There are bombs all over the floor?
Have the roof dome opened quickly.
The dome...?
No time to explain!
I'll do it! Mr. Kazama!
Hello? It's me, sir!
Open the dome immediately!
Without delay!
Sorry, sir.
What are you going to do, Conan?
Ran.
I'll be right there.
Hello? Conan?
55, 54, 53, 52,
51, 50, 49, 48,
47, 46, 45,
44, 43, 42, 41,
40, 39, 38,
37, 36,
35, 34, 33,
32, 31...
30, 29...
28...
Haibara!
- What's the matter? - Haibara, she...
She won't stop counting!
What's wrong?
Haibara, what are you doing?
Come quickly!
Don't be silly
This way is safer.
No, don't tell me...
she's going to sacrifice herself?
21...
20.
What are you doing?
I'm listening to what my mother says!
You mustn't leave a single grain of rice!
11,10...
Let's go!
Let's go!
Haibara!
I won't let you go!
Oh no!
Haibara is going to crash into those pillars!
I'm borrowing this.
Conan!
Ran!
We're okay!
Yeah!
By the way Conan, where did you learn to drive?
In Hawaii, my dad taught me...
Chief.
In the car there were
five kids and an old man.
Looks like she wasn't at the party after all.
Whatever.
We accomplished our main goal.
Yes.
But I can't believe that guy
betrayed us and hacked into our data like that.
We found him, boss.
At the West Tama Twin Towers, that's where the hacking took place.
It was Hara, just as we thought.
We took care of Hara,
and we blew up the Tokiwa mainframe.
No more risk of the organization's data being exposed.
I wish I could make this building his tomb..,
but that's for another time.
To think that Mr. Kisaragi was the killer...
What a surprise.
Is it?
I suspected him from the start!
The police investigation will probably go no further.
Yes.
No one will probably ever know
that Gin killed Mr. Hara.
The origin of the explosions will also remain unknown.
Thank you for earlier.
You saved my life.
No, I didn't.
I was just doing my duty as a man!
You too, Kojima.
I'm like a grain of rice to you, right?
And if not, Ayumi,
how come you counted right this time?
It was a lucky guess!
The truth is,
it's thanks to you, Conan.
When you are next to me, my heart beats fast,
and I can count by the rhythm of the beats!
It's true that the first time too...
28... 29... 30 !
That's why she told me to stay by her side.
You were so cool, Mitsuhiko!
- No, I wasn't. - You too, Genta!
Oh, yeah?
Well, what are you going to do?
What do you mean?
If you make Yoshida cry,
I'll make you pay.
Hey, oh...
Don't you think that from now on
We should do what we can
Let's do it the way we felt
Before we met
We had nothing, but when we closed our eyes
We imagined a place to live together
Still love in my heart, I'm not afraid
Even if it doesn't work out
No, we're better than that
Yes, let's go for it and who cares if the wind changes
I always, always give you my love
It's not a dream, I'm holding on
It's not true, until the end
We don't realize it right away
But we always get there in the end
How hopeful your heart is
Your wishes will come true in hard times
Always have faith and try
Even if it's not easy

No, we are better than that
Yes, all these moments will shape the future you
I always, always give you my love
Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose, but who cares
You don't make mistakes for no reason, there's a chance to take
Thank you for being the way you are, sometimes life is so beautiful
I always, always give you my love
Hey, wait up!
This car, it's not...
Yes, it is.
That's the Mustang convertible you won.
My dream car...
Although, actually...
maybe it'll still run when it's dry.
