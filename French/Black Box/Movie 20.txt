BND - Riesling
CSIS - Aquavit

Japanese Police - Bourbon
That's it.
Step away from the desk and put your hands up.
Your group's plans are easy to guess.
Mr. Furuya, is everything okay?
Yes.
Those eyes... impossible!
Mr. Furuya, get out of the way!
Freeze!
Hold it right there!
Hold it right there!
National Police Agency
Stop right there!
Are you crazy?
What's wrong?
NOC: Stout, Aquavit, Rye...
Sending / Sent
Who are you?
Akai?
Stay out of this, Akai! This is a matter for the Public Safety Bureau!
What's up?
I'll get you!
Shit!
If she gets away, it'll cause international panic!
You're kidding me...
against the grain?
Rye?
It gets better and better.
I'll be able to kill you!
Akai.
You bastard...
That's me.
It got away from me. I'll need to clean up.
Sure thing.
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE WORST NIGHTMARE
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug,
and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name...
I invented Conan Edogawa.
In order to find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
Besides,
the professor isn't the only one who knows my true identity.
This is Ai Haibara.
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She used to work with the Men in Black,
but to escape from the organization,
she tried to commit suicide
by swallowing the same drug as me, which made her younger.
The Men in Black organization is shrouded in mystery
to the point that almost all I know about them
is that they have code names for alcohol.
And to discover the identity of its members,
investigators decided to infiltrate this organization.
Undercover CIA agent,
Kir, alias Rena Mizunashi,
and a Japanese police officer,
Bourbon, also known by the code name "Zero",
aka Tooru Amuro.
And another organization is secretly investigating the men in black:
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI.
James Black,
Andre Camel,
Jodie Starling...
and Shuichi Akai.
The latter is an exceptional sniper within the FBI,
but it seems that he and Amuro
are linked by a sinister destiny.
My body has become younger, but not my mind!
I will solve all the mysteries!
There is still...
only one truth!
Professor, we're out of snacks.
- Huh, you ate everything already? - Including our share?
Oops, sorry...
You're making a face.
What are you looking at?
They still haven't said what caused the explosion last night
so I was checking the news just in case.
They're talking about the aquarium we're going to, on TV!
Can we watch, Conan?
Yes...
I want to watch too!
The belt is bothering me.
Hey oh, you don't take off your belt when you drive!
Pff, I'm bored.
We'll be there soon, so be patient, Genta.
- Ah, it's starting! - On the occasion of the reopening,
let's see what new features await visitors to the aquarium.
There are three areas in total that have been improved.
Let's take a look at the first one:
The various stores and game rooms
are now all indoors.
Visitors will be able to enjoy them to the fullest,
from opening to closing,
and without having to worry about the weather.
The second major improvement
concerns the main attraction of the aquarium:
the graceful dolphin show!
It was already very popular before,
and has been reworked again.
The dolphins have worked on their performance
and will offer us hours of wonder and surprises!

- Goodbye! - They are so cute!
Finally, the last improvement...
is the great novelty of this reopening:
the world's very first double Ferris wheel!
It has a north wheel and a south wheel,
and has a totally different view from each side!
In addition, fountains placed in front of the Ferris wheel
will allow you to admire the water and light effects.
A great show to admire at 100 meters high!
It makes you want to go there!
- I want to ride the Ferris wheel! - Yes, me too!
Didn't we say we were going to the aquarium?
We can go to both. Right?
- Yes! - Yes, let's do both!
Professor,
you offer us the tickets, eh?
I see it! It's huge!
- It sure is! - Too good!
We'll be there in five minutes.
Here we are.
Here I go!
- Yippee! - Wait for us, Genta!
Hurry, hurry, Professor!
Come on, Haibara and Conan! Hurry up!
Have you decided between the aquarium and the Ferris wheel?
- What are you talking about? - We want to go to both, of course!
So, I challenge you!
Answer my quiz correctly and I'll take you to both.
Okay, listen up!
Which of these four colors turns into
when you spread it around?
One: red, aka.
Two: blue, ao.
Three: brown, cha.
Four: black, kuro.
A color that changes...
when you spread it everywhere?
I don't understand !
Teacher.
That's not very mature.
Try saying it
with "all" in front of it, and you should get it.
- Don't help them, Conan! - Differently?
For example,
"all red" is makka,
"all blue" is massao...
- Ai, if you tell them that... - I found it!
It's brown, for maccha!
Ah yes, it becomes something else!
Yes !
What are you talking about?
Red
All red
Blue
All blue
Brown
All brown
Black
All black
Aka becomes makka,
ao becomes massao,
cha becomes maccha,
and kuro becomes makkuro.
Focus on the brown one, Genta.
Maccha, doesn't that remind you of anything?
Ah, but yes!
The matcha tea!
Wait, it's cheating if you help them!
Come on, let's go buy the tickets?
Yes !
Wait, wait, wait!
Ferris wheel first!
No, we can't do both!
Come back!
That's a big Ferris wheel!
Think we'll see the house?
What's wrong with it?
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Are you all right, ma'am?
Your face is all dirty.
Your eyes are a different color!
Maybe she doesn't speak Japanese.
Yes, I understand you.
What are you doing here, all alone?
You are not with friends? Besides...
you are hurt.
Your knees, and your hands...
and your smartphone is broken.
Can I take a look?
No, go ahead.
How long have you been here?
Uh...
Where are you from?
I don't know.
Ma'am, what's your name?
My name?
Sorry, I don't know.
Can I see your face?
Yes...
Nothing serious, but it's recent.
She must have hit her head in a car accident.
In that case, she must be suffering from post-traumatic amnesia...
But how do you know she was in the car?
Look at her smartphone.
It was hit so hard that it's completely ruined.
And these..,
are shards of windshield.
So she hit her head while driving.
It must have been an older model car.
The newer ones use a protective film on the window
to prevent shards of glass.
Plus, it smells like gasoline.
It does.
Say,
do you have anything else on you?
- What do you... - Can I see?
Here you are.
What is it?
So there...
They look like memory cards,
but in translucent colors.
What are they for?
Conan, Haibara!
We bought your tickets!
Oh boy, here comes trouble again.
What's this? Who is that lady?
Look, she has different colored eyes!
It's beautiful!
It's a false eye, isn't it?
But no, Genta.
She has minnows.
Minnows?
Does that mean they're made of glass?

- No, it has nothing to do... - Oh, I know!
It's an animal species, right?
She has animal eyes?
Is that right, Conan?
Yes...
Excuse me, sir.
He laughed at our nonsense.
By the way, what are you doing here?
You're just in time, Professor.
This woman had an accident,
and it seems she has amnesia.
That's right, Shi...
Uh, Conan?
Yes.
This may have something to do with yesterday's incident...
We have to call the police!
No !
Hey, lady...
why don't we call the police?
I don't know, ma'am.
But you need help...
Come on, don't take any unannounced pictures!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
This isn't for the police.
I need pictures to find people who know you.
People who know me?
Let me help you get your memory back.
Are you serious, Conan?
We'll help too!
After all, we...
we are
the Junior Detectives!
We'll help you find your friends,
and remember who you are!
Leave it to the professionals!
Thank you.
Let's start looking for people who know her!
Yes !
But... what about the Ferris wheel?
What are you talking about?
There's something more urgent!
- Let's ask the mascot! - But the tickets are paid for...
Out of the way, professor!
Come on!
- Let's go! - Follow us!
We're off!
Come on, hurry up!
Wait, kids!
This is not a game, you hear me?
Don't tell me you're really gonna hide this from the police.
Who do you think I am?
Ran Mouri
Last night, cars on Highway 11 in the capital
were caught in the flames of an explosion in the warehouse area...
Dad?
Oh... Yoko dear...
Daddy!
Are you done sleeping instead of working?
Leave me alone!
A detective needs to rest his brain!
So if I understand correctly, you're hung over.
How do you... well...
I mean, you're not...
Here, this is from Conan.
He found a person with amnesia and wants you to tell the police.
I've notified Officer Takagi,
but you help them, too!
- What a beauty! - Are you listening to me?
Where is this lady?
Uh... at the Tohto aquarium.
Got it!
Wait, Dad!
Detective Mouri is in charge of this case!
It's not really a case...
Him, then...
Detective.
These are the photos Ran sent over.
Apparently, there's a chance that she was in a traffic accident.
A traffic accident...
It could be related to yesterday's incident.
They're still looking for the driver, I think.
Given the magnitude of the incident, it's strange that neither the press
or even us, have any information about it.
You think...
We'll have to investigate this.
Inspector Megure!
What's up?
The investigation department doesn't know more than we do.
Oh well...
What is it about?
There are rumors that someone infiltrated the Police Agency last night.
The National Agency?
But the police station hasn't been informed of any of this.
What does that mean ?
There may be a great power at work...
Bingo.
I found her, Gin.
Where is it?
- At the aquarium in Tohto. - The aquarium?
Yes.
Don't worry, I'll bring her back soon.
Thank you to all our visitors for their presence today.
When is the show?
The dolphin show is about to start.
I wonder if she has really been here before.
Yes...
With such a peculiar hair and eye color,
it's strange that nobody recognized her.
Where do we go from here?
We've already been through most of the park...
Come on, lady!
This is the last one, focus!
They are abusing...
So cool!
Congratulations!
You made the highest score today!
Come on, your turn!
Hold out your hands.
- My turn! - And me next!
All right.
- Yippee! - Come on, my turn.
She smiled again!
You look better when you smile, ma'am!
- Yes! - Well, okay.
You think so?
Totally!

Here, you can choose three key chains.
Great!
We get three?
- I'll take him! - I'll take him.
I want this one!
- Here, this is for you. - Hey, but what about the lady?
I'll be fine,
don't worry.
- Well, still... - You're the one who won them.
Hey, you three.
Here are Conan and Ai.
Are you having a good time?
What about helping the lady get her memory back?
Well, actually...
We were going to do it after one game.
And then the lady won us these keychains!
You guys haven't even started?
Looks like we'll have to cover this area ourselves.
Hello, I'm here!
It's me, Hiroshi Agasa!
Professor!
What are you doing up there?
The Ferris wheel is empty!
It's time to get on it!
Oh, really?
Let's start with the Ferris wheel, shall we?
Great idea!
Maybe she'll remember looking at the scenery.
Let's go!
Ma'am, let's get on the Ferris wheel!
- Hurry up! Come on! - Come on, let's go!
Oh dear.
Let's let the professor have his fun, he loves Ferris wheels.
He was the one who wanted to ride it the most, actually?
That's right.
Excuse me.
Did you ever see the woman playing darts earlier?
The young lady with the silver hair?
Yeah, you know her?
I don't remember, no.
Yet, such precision,
I think I would remember!
She put them all in the center.
That's more than a fluke, there.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, here, wait.
Can you give this to your friends?
What are these?
We had some unpainted prototypes left over.
Since this young lady didn't get anything,
she can have it, if she wants.
She can paint it any color she wants.
All right! That should make her happy.
Thanks again!
Bye, have fun.
Are you coming, Haibara?
Yes... Where to now?
Let's go ask the staff in the remaining areas,
then we'll join the others.
Like here with the arrows, it will probably be more effective
to observe what she's doing rather than looking for tracks.
I can't wait!
What do you think we'll see at the top?
- The Bell Tree Tower, I bet! - What are you doing in a place like this?
Let's go home.
Don't stand there, ma'am, or we'll go without you!
I'm sorry, I thought
I thought someone was talking to me.
An acquaintance of yours?
No, it was a misunderstanding, it seems.
Well, you are complete?
Yes !
Then this way.
Change of plan, there seems to be a problem.
Make it quick.
We can't let them get away.
I know we can't.
Wait for me, Mom!
We didn't learn much from the construction zones.
Maybe we should tell the teacher, right?
What?
You've been in the dark all day.
I have?
Hey, Conan, Haibara!
We're here!
Look up!
We're here!
Can you see us?
We're here, look!
Genta, look out!
- What's the matter? - Genta!
Don't do it!
Genta!
Genta!
I'm going down!
I can't do it from here.
I can't hold on!
Genta!
Genta, you okay?
Genta, you okay? Open your eyes! Open your eyes!
What are you doing, ma'am? What are you doing, lady?
I'm relieved.
I remember!
I fell from up there.
Is he okay, is he not hurt?
No, I'm fine, the lady saved me!
Phew...
Take him to the infirmary, just in case.
But why?
Here you are.
You can go now.
Okay, thank you very much.
Oops...
Why is the teacher the most hurt?
Shame.
He's worse than a child.
You'll see when you're my age!
The teacher is better, shall we go back to the Ferris wheel?
Thank you, ma'am!
Let's go!
Shall we go?
Uh, but...
I'm not going to be a bother?
What are you talking about?
You saved my life!
Yes, I did!
Well, shall we go then?
Wait a minute!
Edogawa...
Can I talk to you?
If you want.
- Then we'll go ahead... - No, no, no, no!
Wait a bit.
All right. All right.
What's wrong with her?
She's not funny.
What's wrong with her?
Listen carefully.
While Conan and Haibara are busy talking...

Are you really sure?
Is she one of them?
I'm not 100% sure,
but you must have felt it too.
Her right eye,
when I think about it, it looks fake.
A fake? But then that would be...
Yes.
The number two of those you call the men in black!
Rum.
Madam, madam!
Yes ?
If this really is Rum,
maybe she's just pretending to have amnesia.
It's true that we don't know Rum's sex or age.
Yes.
When I was with them,
the individuals I heard about were
a very muscular man,
a man with a feminine appearance,
an old man, and several others.
But also...
a person who as a result of an accident
has a prosthetic eye in one of her eyes.
If this woman doesn't have minnows eyes,
but an artificial eye...
I see, that could mean that she is lying about her amnesia.
But why would she need to lie to get closer to us?
Uh...
It's true that her physical abilities suggest
that she is careful because she is from the organization,
but if she really does have amnesia,
then the other way around...
No !
She mustn't remember anything!
Don't tell me
that you're thinking of getting information out of her once her memory comes back?
You are not that unconscious, reassure me!
If you do this,
we won't be the only ones in danger.
These children could be deleted too!
They're not here anymore!
What is the teacher doing?
- How cute you are... - Teacher!
My little pigeons!
This is not the time, professor!
Where are the children?
Where are they? What's wrong with them?
Damn, it's Conan.
If I were you, I wouldn't pick up.
I bet he'll just scold us.
Yeah, he will.
Hey, look at that,
a flock of pigeons!
Oh, yeah.
- Do you see them, ma'am? - Yes, there are a lot of them.
This number is not available...
No way!
My money's on the Ferris wheel.
They really wanted a ride.
Yes, let's go.
Wait for me!
You might be an athlete, don't you think?
If you weren't,
you couldn't have saved Genta like that.
I agree, plus you have style.
Style?
You think so?
Yeah, you look like a supermodel.
The fountains are growing!
They're getting higher and higher!
It's beautiful!
- Did you see that, ma'am? - Yes, it's beautiful.
Look down, ma'am!
You can see a rainbow. Come up front and see!
Oh, yeah.
- Are you okay, ma'am? - Are you hurt anywhere?
I'm fine, I'm just dizzy.
You probably have vertigo.
We're coming up to the highest point!
You're right!
This is what I've been waiting for!
This is the top of the line!
What's wrong, ma'am?
Hey, hang on!
- What do we do now? - Wait, I'll call for help.
Ayumi, Mitsuhiko!
I don't know what to do, she's saying strange things all of a sudden.
- Maybe she remembers something. - NOC...
Ayumi, call Conan on my phone.
Yes.
Genta! What is she saying?
She is talking about knocking on the door...
- A door? - Kir...
Bourbon...
She's talking again!
Don't make a sound, Genta.
Stout... Aquavit...
Riesling...
Come on, quickly...
It's ringing!
What?
Someone is calling me, maybe it's them.
You're right.
Mitsuhiko, finally!
Help, Conan!
Ayumi? What's wrong?
We were on the Ferris wheel when the lady felt sick...
What is it? What's wrong with her?
Well...
She's holding her head and she looks like she's in pain.
And she says something, but we don't understand...
I wrote down everything!
Mitsuhiko writes down what she says.
Understood.
Please, Conan, come and help us quickly!
Conan, where is the woman in question?
They're getting her out of the infirmary now.
Takagi, let's go.
Yes.
Haibara, teacher, I'll leave the rest to you.
Let's go too.
No way!
We can't go.
Excuse us
Please come in.
As I told you on the phone,
the police will take this woman under their protection.
That's not a problem,
but I would like you to pass on a message
to the medical team who will be handling this.
That seems obvious,

is that his amnesia is due to a violent blow to the head.
But the important thing here,
is that the brain scan revealed some extremely rare lesions.
Right here, look.
And this is not due to yesterday's accident?
No.
I think she was born with it.
Is it related to the seizure she had?
It's not an area of the brain that's normally used,
so I doubt it has anything to do with it.
All right, I'll give them the information.
- Okay, well... - Hold on, please.
Just one more thing.
We found this during his examination,
in his right eye...
What is it?
Looks like a contact lens.
Well...
It is a contact lens
turning his eye black.
So that means
we were wrong about the prosthetic and the black eye.
I thought I'd tell you, just in case.
Excuse us.
Everything is ready for the trip.
In that case, we'll go.
Okay.
Thank you for everything.
What's this? Aren't you going with them, boy?
No, I had one last question to ask you.
I'm listening.
It's about the colored lens.
If she had a black lens on one eye,
does that mean she basically has two blue eyes?
Actually, her right eye was transparent.
Transparent?
Well, more exactly, it appears transparent.
It's really very rare,
but sometimes the iris is almost the same color as the sclera,
and we have the impression that it is transparent.
So, it's the same thing: she has a clear eye.
Doctor!
Thank you very much for your help.
- Do you understand? - Yes, I understand.
Bye-bye, now.
- Be careful on your way back. - Is it here?
Where is my client?
Sir, this is a restricted area,
this area is closed to the public
Since I tell you that this case concerns me!
Uncle Kogoro.
What are you doing?
Kid, you're just in time!
Where is my beautiful client?
She's not here anymore.
They took her to the police hospital.
And she's not your client.
What?
You didn't listen to anything Ran said, did you?
Are you done?
Yes.
- What happened? - I don't know.
I knew she was acting weird.
Apparently, she had amnesia.
And where is she now?
They're taking her to the police hospital.
So the police are starting to act up too.
Yes.
There's something else that bothers me.
What?
While she was riding the Ferris wheel,
she apparently had a seizure.
- A seizure? - Yes.
All right, well, keep watching her. Keep an eye on her.
I'll keep an eye on her.
A seizure on the Ferris wheel... I don't like the sound of that.
Why did Haibara suddenly take a dislike to the lady?
That's a good question. They were getting along fine until now.
Do you know why, Professor?
No, I don't.
When I asked her, she said she was going home because she felt bad.
Ayumi, there's no point in asking the teacher.
Yeah, she's always getting mad at him.
Yes, she does.
Oh yes, I have something for you
from Conan.
But this is...
the same figurine we got at the dart game.
But why is it all white?
Conan explained it to me, but I forgot.
Never mind, we'll ask him in person.
Who could it be?
Speak of the devil! It's Conan.
Hello?
Professor, are you still with the children?
Yes, we're having tea at the Poirot Café.
I need some information and a favor.
Before that, how is the young lady?
They took her to the police hospital.
She should be fine.
That's good.
- Should we pay her a visit? - What did you want to ask me?
Could you try to restore the data from her phone?
I'd like to try, but I don't know if I can get it all back.
Thank you, sir. And another thing,
when she had a seizure on the Ferris wheel,
she said something, right?
Can I know what it was?
I'm missing the beginning for that,
but I got the rest of it down!
So...
"Stout, Aquavit"...
and then, "Riesling".

- Do you understand anything? - Names of alcohol! But then...
Professor, you're at the Poirot, right?
Yes.
Can you pass me Amuro?
Amuro, you say?
I have not seen him today.
He is on leave today.
He called me just this morning to say he wanted to take the day off.
I tried to call him back,
but he's not answering and I'm worried.
Did you hear that?
I hope it's nothing, it's worrying.
Amuro... I hope it's not...
London
This is Stout, I'm on the bus.
Wait for instructions.
At your command.
Stout...
I trusted you.
Too bad.
Stout is dead.
Okay, come back now.
I will.
Toronto
For 32 years, the CN Tower
was the tallest building in the world.
The EdgeWalk takes us to the top
of the tower's 116 floors,
which takes us to a height of 356 meters!
Look at that helicopter!
That chopper... wouldn't it be...
Serves you right.
A fitting end for a dirty spy.
I took care of Aquavit.
Good work, now get back here.
I was going to before you told me!
Berlin
Hey, where do you think you're going?
I thought I told you you only had a minute.
I'm telling you again: I'm not a NOC!
So let's settle this once and for all.
Okay, Riesling?
Gin.
It's time to show which side you're on.
Give me the names
of the other rats you're undercover with.
Spit it out and you won't suffer.
Don't make me repeat myself!
I am not a NOC! You don't have to threaten me, Gin.
Threaten you?
You really think I'm nice enough for that?
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Zero.
Come on, come quickly.
Where are we going?
To Japan.
What?
Only two more to go.
MI6 in the UK,
CSIS in Canada,
and the BND in Germany.
Members of all the intelligence services are being murdered.
Is that it?
They were all undercover in the organization.
So they were killed by the men in black.
An agent of the organization
may have stolen data from the National Police Agency.
We got this from an Akai report.
An agent of the organization...
Ms. Jodie.
You contacted me
because you think I met with this agent?
Yes.
I suspected as much.
But this woman has amnesia,
and the smartphone that could have given us information is broken.
A smartphone?
Did she have it on her?
She had left it on the bench, so I kept it for her.
Better send it to the FBI for analysis.
- Yeah, we would. - Wait a minute, wait a minute.
The professor said he'll have it restored soon,
so I think it's best to wait.
In that case, let us know when it's done.
We need to know as soon as possible how much information they have acquired,
or it will cause a worldwide panic.
What data did they steal?
The unofficial covers.
But that's...
Yes, the NOCs, the illegal agents.
The Agency has a list of names of clandestine agents around the world.
Which means that
that any spies inside the organization will be killed.
There is more to it than that.
If the NOC list is published,
it could destroy every intelligence agency in the world.
If that happens,
the organization will have a monopoly on information, right?
Exactly. And if that happens,
these last three assassinations
could be just the beginning.
Here we go.
Do you think we were right not to tell Conan and Ai?
Yes, they would have forbidden us to go in there.
Let's go in, already.
- We'll see if they'll let us see it. - Yes!
Yes.
Yes, that's it. Tohto police hospital.
Do whatever it takes.
I'm counting on you, Kazami.
I understand.
Bourbon, what are you doing here?
I came to bring her back, of course.
I was sure you came to shut her up before she regained her memory.
And why would I do that?
I don't quite understand what you're saying.
And how do you plan to talk to her?
She's under police guard, with no visitors allowed.
Unless you have a way to see her easily?
For example, a special connection with the police...

What have you been talking to me about?
Whatever you like.
I don't like talking on my feet, let's go somewhere else.
If it's an order from the organization, then so be it.
- What do you think? - Bad luck.
They won't let anyone see it.
Seriously?
Is she that sick?
I say we go check it out ourselves.
What? But how?
Like this!
Yes, it is!
Officer Takagi
Yes, thanks to our great ally!
Professor!
What's your status?
I should be able to get the last of the transmissions by now.
Please hurry.
Yes, sir.
How about that?
Genta, it doesn't work like that!
Damn it, I was wrong.
Officer Takagi!
Oh yes, he's back!
- How is the lady? - Can we see her?
Keep it down!
Don't forget I sent for you on the sly.
On the sly, eh?
Excuse me, I got carried away...
Madam!
Phew, you look better!
Your headache is gone?
No, it's better. Thank you.
In normal circumstances you would not have been able to see her,
but since she seems to have placed her trust in you,
maybe you can help her recover her memory.
- Is that right? - Yippee!
Thank you very much.
But only until her next exam.
All right!
There you go!
Where should I put it now?
Let's see... how about here?
That's fine.
How about it?
What are we going to do?
We're stuck...
We made it, ma'am!
Looks like it.
I forgot...
Here, this is for you.
It's for you. It's...
The man from the dartboard gave it to us afterwards.
He said to paint it any way you want.
Are you sure I can have it?
Of course, you saved my life after all!
Madam!
We all match now.
Yes !
What color will you choose?
Red? Or pink?
I'd go with black, to make an orc.
But white is more like you, actually.
You have white hair,
and that way you save money on paint!
Genta, you're missing the point.
It looks really cheap.
Well, that's good, right?
You okay, Genta?
Sorry about that.
You didn't hurt yourself, did you?
No.
For once I won!
Only because the lady helped you!
Well yes, you only followed her instructions.
Yes, I admit it.
Excuse us.
I'm Kazami, public safety.
I was told Inspector Megure was in charge here.
Are you the inspector?
Yes, I am. Why?
I'll ask you to hand that person over.
What is the reason?
We also have the right to investigate.
This woman is suspected of having infiltrated the Police Agency.
We have to find out her purpose without delay.
I count on your understanding
because I'd like to start the proceedings as soon as possible.
You are in no position to refuse.
I understand.
Well, follow me. I have prepared the papers to be filled.
What will happen to you, ma'am?
I don't know what's gonna happen.
Your visit ends here.
It's time to go home.
Come on, I'll take you back to your room.
Yes, ma'am.
- Ah! Madame! - Are you leaving?
Ma'am!
Thank you all,
I'll take care of it.
Yes.
We'll take another
a ride on the Ferris wheel again sometime.
- Yes! - Absolutely!
You promise?
Well, let's go.
Do you think she'll be all right?
I'm worried about her...
So am I.
Is that you, Shinichi?
I finished my analysis.
So, what does it say?
Here you go.
"NOC: Stout, Aquavit, Riesling."
"The ones you were worried about,
"Bourbon and Kir"!
Damn, that's what I was afraid of!
Professor, I need to find out quickly what address this email was sent to.
Let me know as soon as you know!
Haibara?
Don't do that.
Please don't.
Remember what you told me?
That you don't want to run away from your fate.
I don't want to run away either.
Kudo...
Thank you, Mr. Takagi.
I'm sorry I was so insistent.
It's all right. Be careful on your way back.
Yes !
Genta, don't make that face.
We'll surely see her again one day!

I know, but hey...
I have an idea.
Why don't we ride the Ferris wheel again?
Oh yeah!
The lady said she wanted to ride it again,
so let's take a picture from the top and send it to her!
If we leave now, it will be dark by then.
There might be too many lines for us to get up there.
Don't worry about that.
The Suzuki Group is one of the shareholders of the aquarium.
That's my plan.
Good thinking!
Sonoko
Sonoko Yeah, I'm counting on our other great ally!
So you think we're NOCs?
Curaçao sent us a list of NOCs
and your names were on it.
Curaçao?
Rum's sidekick?
Yes.
Intelligence is his specialty.
So you know about him.
His physical characteristic is that he has different colored eyes.
The whole organization knows that.
They've been friends for a long time.
If you confess everything nicely, you won't suffer.
If we have escaped the assassination,
I take it the intel from Curaçao wasn't perfect.
Am I right?
You're as perceptive as ever, Bourbon.
Everything was going great until she stole the list,
but then the police spotted her and she caused an accident on the run.
To top it off, she has amnesia.
In that case, you should save Curaçao and get the list back!
Gin! It won't be too late
to check our identity after that!
No, it won't.
But...
- Gin! - Chief...
I punish when I have suspicions.
That's the way I do it.
On that note,
it is time
to punish the traitors!
- Are you almost done? - Don't be in a hurry.
The analysis will be finished in 30 seconds.
Good.
As soon as you get the address, do as I asked.
I will.
I'm supposed to pretend I'm sending this
from this broken phone, right?
Yes. Hurry up, time is running out!
There, it's over.
And now he's hanging up!
Over here, cool kid!
Quick, read this.
But this is...
Kir!
Well then, Kir? Go on.
You were taking off your handcuffs, right?
You shoot your allies at the drop of a hat?
It's not for you to say whether you're our allies or not.
I'll give you a minute to ask for mercy.
The first one to sell the other one out will have the right to beg me
not to let him die like a rat.
Vodka, do a head count.
Roger that.
60 seconds.
We will not be intimidated!
If I said he was a NOC,
that would be like admitting I'm one, too.
You would never let a spy live!
50 seconds.
You never know.
I can be very nice, you know,
Kir.
40 seconds.
What, are you guys going to cover for each other?
Cover for what? I don't know if this is a NOC!
I don't know either!
- 30 seconds. - But I can say...
that I am not a NOC!
I could say the same thing!
It's time.
20 seconds.
Which one of you is the rat?
Are you really going to do it?
Who's gonna yell first?
Ten seconds.
Nine. Eight.
So, is it Bourbon?
Or Kir?
Four. Three. Two.
- You'll be the first... - One.
Zero!
Bourbon!
What? What? What? What's the matter?
- The lights... - Kir, Bourbon!
Don't move!
Bourbon is gone!
He got away.
What the hell...?
Go after him!
Sorry Kir,
I couldn't show you how a rat dies.
But you mustn't be sad,
I will send Bourbon to join you soon.
- Goodbye, Kir. - Gin, wait!
Don't shoot, that's Rum's order.
So what should we do?
Well, that's understood.
Curaçao just sent an e-mail.
They're both innocent.
Did she get her memory back?
Well, it looks like
we're off the hook.
Can you take these cuffs off me now?
No way.
Rum has given other orders.
We have to wait for verification that the e-mail came from Curaçao.
It's going to be difficult to get her out
from the police hospital.
Don't worry about that.
If my hunch is right,
there should be some movement soon.
Good timing, Gin.
Those public safety jerks are finally getting their act together.
I figured as much.

They didn't even realize they were being bugged.
So where are they going?
Right where you thought they'd go.
They're just getting her in the car.
Get the thing ready.
Seriously?
This is a good opportunity to test its effectiveness.
You wouldn't try to start a war, would you?
That's an order from Rum.
This mission must be completed successfully.
I understand.
Oh, my God, this is insane!
I'm having so much fun, I can't believe it!
I'm having so much fun.
Gin, are you really going to use it?
Boss, I failed.
It got away from me.
Never mind that.
We'll take care of Bourbon and Kir later.
Getting Curaçao back is the priority.
But the cops and public safety are guarding the hospital.
Curaçao just left the hospital.
So where does she go?
They're taking her
to the Tohto Aquarium.
Gin, wait a minute...
you had it all planned, didn't you?
Vodka, let's go.
- Start the car. - I'm going in.
Okay, got it.
We'll meet you there.
We'll handle the rescue.
Roger that.
They both escaped the worst.
Good for them!
You did great,
your plan worked perfectly.
I didn't do much.
The last sentence of the email was incomplete,
so I just sent it back
ending the sentence with "they're innocent, don't worry".
- They should be off the hook. - Yes.
No.
We just bought them time.
They will try to save their agent first
and head to the aquarium in Tohto.
Not the police hospital?
No.
The public safety division took her to the aquarium.
They did?
- Then let's follow them. - No.
Akai is already on his way there.
We'll take care of rescuing the agent left at the warehouse area
and investigate the NOC list.
Good.
Conan,
you get down here.
We don't know what might be going on down there.
- But I... - Don't worry about it.
Trust the FBI to handle it.
Okay, I will.
Okay, well, good luck with that.
Thank you. Okay.
We'll call you when it's over.
By the way..,
what does Mr. Akai know about the organization's agent, exactly?
Nothing very specific.
He just knows that she's Rum's partner,
and that her code name is Curaçao.
Thank you. Be careful!
So it wasn't Rum, but Curaçao.
Curaçao is a liqueur made from orange peel.
It's mainly white curaçao,
orange curaçao, blue, green,
or even red.
If it is possible...
Yes, there are five colors.
I've seen this palette before,
but where?
Remember...
Is this the key?
The brain scan revealed extremely rare lesions.
She's holding her head and looks like she's in pain.
And she's saying something, but we can't understand...
"Stout, Aquavit"...
and then, "Riesling".
I see! If my reasoning is correct,
it explains everyone's actions.
But then, it sucks!
If I don't hurry up,
the organization will have the list of NOCs!
Yes, it's good.
We have it with us, as requested.
So we can get her on the Ferris wheel?
Yes.
I don't know if it will work, but it's our only chance.
Can you do that?
Yes.
Can we meet somewhere?
No, the organization has eyes and ears everywhere.
I'll stay solo until we get to the Ferris wheel.
See you later.
Wait, Mr. Furuya!
What a pain in the ass.
Why do I have to waste my vacation week going to the aquarium?
With kids, of all people...
Here we are.
- Finally! - Yippee!
Let's go !
Wait, kids,
stay over here.
All right!
You staying here, Dad?
I'm not in the mood to see fish!
I'm going to crash for a while, so have fun.
Thank you, Dad.
Keep me posted.
Yes.
That aquarium again?
I thought they'd bring her back to the crash site.
She had a seizure on the Ferris wheel,
maybe this place is hiding a secret.
Let's watch them from a distance for now.
Good.
Is Sonoko still not here?
- She should be here any minute. - I'd like to go upstairs for a walk.

My apologies, we have used up our tickets for the day.
So contact your supervisor.
Tell him it's a matter of public safety.
- Ran! - Sure, right away!
Right over there!
Ah, there she is at last!
Sonoko!
Sorry, the procedures took a while.
So you did it!
You're the best, Sonoko!
Yes, you can say thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
Sorry, I'm enjoying it too.
Don't worry, one more or less...
Well, I'll leave you to look after the kids.
Yes.
I'll take you to the Ferris wheel,
stay close to me.
- Okay, okay, okay. - Yes!
Can we really leave them with him?
Don't worry, it's his job.
Besides that, why didn't you invite Shinichi?
Why not?
- What should we do? - First, call the security...
What, you know them?
No, not exactly,
but I think I've seen the woman with these public security people before.
These guys are from public safety?
Yeah. I wonder if anything happened.
Wow, nice one!
Let's get out of here.
Sorry, Sonoko.
I can't help it, I'm too worried.
So what are you waiting for to call her?
Damn, this is my second phone.
Ran Mouri Calling
I knew it.
Something wrong, Ran?
Shinichi? I wanted to talk to you about something.
What is it? Please hurry.
Ah, you're busy?
- What did he say? - A little, yes...
Stop it, Sonoko!
Oh dear...
Are you listening, Ran?
Sorry, but I'm in a hurry. I'm hanging up now!
Wait, Shinichi!
I'll call you back when it's over.
- But... wait, where are you? - I'm hanging up!
He's abusing me.
Did he say he was too busy again?
Yes.
Go find out what else he's up to.
I think he's here.
What do you mean, he's here?
I could hear the announcement from the speakers behind him.
I see...
The question is: who is he with?
How naive you are!
A boy wouldn't come here alone!
Come on, let's catch him in the act!
Sonoko!
Danger: high voltage
The whole power supply is not connected.
The original building has its own line.
Never mind.
I've finished.
You can go,
they won't spot you right away.
Good job.
Go faster,
we'll attack the plan in 15 minutes.
Got it, it's going to shake!
Thank you all for your visit
to the Tohto Aquarium Ferris wheel.
Our water and light show is about to start.
The north wheel is being inspected,
only the south wheel will be available from now on.
Come on in.
- Great! - Let's cut the line!
Hold on a second, kids.
Who are they?
Mrs. Suzuki's guests.
So...
is the reservation for the wheel just for them?
It seems so, yes.
What a bummer!
I'll never find it now!
I must stop it before it goes up...
What are they up to at Public Safety?
Look, it looks serious...
Did something happen?
But this is...
Kudo, where are you?
I knew it!
It's that Ferris wheel!
The public safety people are here.
Did you reserve the wheel?
Yes, I did.
My apologies!
There's been a mix-up and I've had some
some invited children about ten minutes ago!
What do we do now?
Do we wait for them to finish?
No, if it's just kids it's fine.
But since we have secured the Ferris wheel,
it is certain that they will act
as soon as we're back on the ground.
Stay on your guard.
Yes.
Well, let's go.
Excuse me, I'm joining some friends!
Let me through, sorry!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Don't come up!
Hey there, you can't come up here.
Damn, I missed them by a mile!
Sorry, let me through!
If they set a trap,
it must be here,
inside the wheel, where no one will look.
I need to figure out their plan quickly,
and notify public safety and the FBI!
Is that Akai?

What are all these
all those cables up there?
Oh no... If it's what I think it is...
This sucks, I have to go check it out soon!
Here they are, exactly as planned.
I've got eyes on Curaçao in a gondola,
with a guy from public safety.
They'll reach the top in about ten minutes, I'd say.
Ten minutes? What's your status, Vodka?
Anytime.
Are there any other agents?
Yeah, they're spread out in every section,
but that shouldn't interfere with our plan.
I'll let you give the signal, then.
I got it. I got it.
You bastard...
Have you really forgotten me?
Yes.
That's okay.
As soon as you remember, I'll make you tell me
where you hid the list of NOCs
and everything you know about the organization.
I should have beaten him to it.
There he is!
Looks like you made it out of here.
If you're here, it's because I guessed right...
What? What's the matter?
You turned off the lights,
thus plunging us into darkness.
Kir, Bourbon!
Then, understanding that I could not move
you opened the door to draw them out
and make them believe I had run away.
Thanks to that, I was able to hide in the dark
and hear their whole plan.
I suspected that if it was you,
you would come up here.
Why didn't you tell me? What made you decide?
It was taking a lot of risks
for information that you could have gotten even without it.
You came up here to have a chat?
Yes.
I'm here to ask the FBI to drop the case,
and let public safety handle Curaçao.
And if I refuse?
Then I'll have to do it
the hard way.
Bring it on, Shuichi Akai!
All these electric cables connected to the fire hydrant,
it's definitely suspicious!
It would be risky to open it.
Maybe this way?
Is that a detonator?
That means...
that at the end of all these electric cables in the ceiling
must be a bomb.
What do I do?
Well, since it's a remotely controlled detonator,
if I'm not careful moving it and they find out, it's over.
I know! I know!
He will be able to...
Dear visitors,
- thank you for having waited until here. - But why is it...
is nobody here?
- Our special show...  - No way!
- Now it will start! - Why are they up there?
Amuro, I think I told you
not to go after the wrong enemy.
Don't worry, I'll go after the organization
as soon as I'm done with you!
And if, while you're doing that,
Curaçao's memory comes back and the organization takes action?
Just say you don't trust them
since the Japanese police let them steal information!
Damn... where the hell is Akai?
Come on, answer!
Up there?
Where the hell are you?
Stop it, now.
Are you defeated?
Come on, let's start the second round.
Akai!
You're here, aren't you?
It's an emergency, help me!
If they fail to get Curaçao back,
they'll blow up the Ferris wheel with a bomb!
Please respond if you're there!
We have to defuse the bomb before they activate it!
This is serious business!
Is this true, Conan?
Amuro? How did you get up there?
I'll explain later, tell me where the bomb is!
There are several, between the axle and the wheel.
It is controlled remotely, who knows when it will explode!
We must act as soon as possible!
I understand,
I'm coming with the FBI!
Well, that was too good!
Yes.
Don't look so worried, Ran,
I'll help you find him!
It's not that,
I'm afraid to disturb him if he's in the middle of an investigation.
You're too concerned with other people's happiness.
I'm telling you:
We're going to catch this runner red-handed!
Forget it, Sonoko.
I won't.
We haven't looked in the best place yet.
The best place?
Yes, that's where I mean!
The aquarium?
Just!
So, Amuro?
I'm almost there.
The problem is resolved.
There was a trap, right?

Yes.
You did well not to try to open it yourself.
Akai! What about the bomb?
It's definitely C4,
...and it's really been well arranged.
If everything explodes at once..,
the axle won't be able to bear the weight and the whole thing will fall apart.
Okay.
We don't have time to hesitate, then.
Is that it?
So, can you defuse it?
Yeah, it's a very common guy.
I know how he works.
You know anything about bombs, Amuro?
A friend of mine from the police academy taught me a lot of things.
He was even the best, a pro at defusing them.
Although, in the end,
he died trying to defuse a bomb on a Ferris wheel.
A bomb on a Ferris wheel?
Don't worry.
His technique was flawless.
I'll prove it to you.
Use this.
It's got tools in it.
I'll let you handle the bomb.
What about you, Akai?
The presence of a bomb proves
that they intend to make their move here on this Ferris wheel.
And there's only one way they can come
to get to Curaçao without being in range of the blast.
By air?
That's right.
I'm going back upstairs to buy you some time.
Defuse that bomb at all costs!
Easy for you to say...
Amuro, here.
Thank you, sir.
The question is going to be:
how much time do we have to defuse it?
Well, sure, because we don't know when it's going to explode...
No, one minute.
Whatever they're planning...
Where are you going, Conan?
To protect the NOC list!
First the other one, now him...
That's it!
These spotlights are the same colors as the maps of Curaçao.
And now that it's dark, they have the same level of transparency.
If my deduction is correct,
the moment Curaçao sees these colors,
she'll remember the list.
Basically, her brain serves as their data storage!
And...
the door to her memories will open the moment
when her gondola reaches the top.
When she sees those lights of the exact shade,
she'll remember everything for good.
It's going to be time.
Gin, final check.
I'm launching this in three minutes.
Ready?
Whenever you're ready, go ahead.
Chianti,
proceed to the alpha point.
Switching to stealth mode.
It's working.
I have to hurry to get to Kazami.
I have to cut this wire here...
Oops!
I almost made a mistake!
If this thing lights up, it's dead.
Impatience is the best trap, huh...
Matsuda.
What's the meaning of this?
We're almost halfway through!
If it wasn't for the fireworks,
then Mr. Furuya's information was wrong?
What's wrong with you?
Stop it, calm down!
Why?
Hadn't she already recovered her memory?
Don't tell me that the email sent to Rum earlier was...
Calm down, sit still!
Hey, I said stop!
This is all your fault, Curaçao.
You've been storing valuable information for the organization
in your very special brain.
You do have a fantastic gift,
but if you misuse it,
you become a threat to us.
You understand, right?
In the end, ending up like this,
it was your destiny.
Farewell,
Curaçao.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No way...
But... what are you doing here?
Back off, Vermouth.
Curaçao.
You are colorless.
In other words, you're just darkness.
Rum?
If this darkness pains you,
let it dye you another color.
You will only use your gift to serve me.
To input data
and to extract it.
Thus, I make you my right hand,
Curaçao.
Hey, are you okay?
Get a grip!
What a mess.
Wait here, I'll call an ambulance.
It's no use.
So she was back all right.
Curaçao is in the recovery area.
She'll be on top in two minutes.
I think you can start.
Vodka, get the clamp out.
Got it.
Opening the airlock.
That propeller noise...
It should be close by now.
But, uh...
what are they going to do?
Impossible...
Who is it?
It's been a long time, Vermouth.

I see you've recovered your memory.
Yes.
By the way, when do you expect to get me back?
It's not that there are a lot of cops down there, but...
You don't have to worry about that, Gin's on his way to get you out.
He is?
Yes.
Other than that, when did you get your memories back?
Rumor has it that a message was sent from your phone,
but if it wasn't sent by you...
This e-mail? Of course it's from me.
Is something wrong with it?
No, nothing's wrong.
Well, then Kir and Bourbon are clean.
They ran away from being killed by mistake, I guess.
It's time, Cinderella.
Stay here and wait for your pumpkin coach.
OKAY.
Five seconds left.
Three, two, one...
zero.
Execute
What?
Damn, they've started!
Vermouth has given the signal.
It's total darkness on the surface.
OK.
Start the descent.
Grab Curaçao!
Roger that.
Stay calm, everything's fine!
For your own safety, please stay put!
Hey, look over there.
Can't you see the aquarium is lit up?
-Shall we go in? -Yes.
Follow me, all of you!
No, don't push, it's dangerous!
I have a bad feeling about this.
I have to get the kids out of here fast!
Damn, it breaks down while we're up there!
One does not have chance.
To say that we were almost at the bottom!
What's up?
No, it's not responding.
What is Kazami doing?
Sato, Takagi.
Apparently public security doesn't know any more than we do.
- I thought so. - What should we do?
Let's ask to cooperate.
But they're...
The situation is too urgent to be bickering between divisions.
- Do you understand? - Yes!
He doesn't seem to be here either.
Excuse me, Sonoko,
I may have made a mistake.
Hey, look outside! It's madness!
- Let us through! - Excuse us!
What the...
what's going on?
I can't make out the wires in the dark.
I was almost there, though!
That was the worst possible moment!
If I wait here, I can get back into the organization...
No...
Are they going to take the gondola?
This is...
Device control, stand by.
Intercept in 20 meters.
Let's go!
If the public safety inspector is here,
it was Curaçao I saw jumping.
Damn it!
Wake up!
Sir!
It's going to be tricky with this rifle.
I've got to find his weak spot.
Damn it!
He's too far away for me to reach.
All right, let's get out of here.
You got it.
Eight o'clock.
On the Ferris wheel.
Movement.
Did the cop get away?
- Run a thermal scan. - On it.
It's the shape of a man!
And there's a kid with him.
Chief, Curaçao's not in there!
What's not in it?
Curaçao...
Drop the gondola.
I'll drop it.
Hey, but...
they can't be serious!
Gin! What did you do that for?
Curaçao's gone.
Change of plan: we take out Curaçao.
How impatient.
There's no way she betrayed us!
She got out of the gondola,
can you think of another explanation?
Find Curaçao!
Got it.
Chianti.
Get us away from the Ferris wheel.
(sighs): All right.
Korn, get the IDWS ready.
Copy that.
She's not going to...
What?
You're going to take me back to them?
Them? You mean the organization?
I knew it, she got her memory back!
Could it be that you are
Sherry, the traitor?
Come on, we have to get away.
It's not safe here.
What do you mean, run away?
That's not a funny joke!
Gin is here.
You must know what that means.
But why are you helping me?
I don't know.
Really, I don't know why.
But I'm Curaçao, I can dye myself any color.
I'd rather be like this
than the way I was before.
That's the only reason.
Come on, come on, little Sherry.
Wait!
The children are still in a gondola!
If we don't save them soon...
I don't know what's going on, but with this...
Okay, now..,
I can tell the wires apart.
Just focus.
Go slowly, without hurrying...
but hurry!

Mister!
Sir, wake up!
This is not good!
Good then?
Still no trace of Curaçao?
I hear movement in the Ferris wheel.
Two kids and some adults...
Oh no, this sucks!
Chief!
There's someone near the detonator!
What's up?
Right over there.
We had it stashed in this fire extinguisher.
Did public safety find him?
All we have to do is cut these two wires connected to the detonator.
Come on, then it's over!
No signal.
I did it!
That was close.
Come on, Korn.
Make it rain!
I like that better.
Blast them, Korn!
I'm going in.
What the hell is going on?
Damn, I've got to do something!
This sucks, I've got to hurry.
I can't do it from above.
I can't do anything.
Too many people on the phone, the network is saturated.
I hope the kids are okay.
Quick, jump!
Get out of here!
Damn it! If I move, I'll be targeted!
I can't do anything now!
It's me they want.
You can't be used as bait!
Take care of the children.
Stop, they'll kill you!
Those movements and that figure...
It's Curaçao, I'm sure of it!
The shots are concentrated in one place.
Someone is being targeted.
It's now or never!
Die, Curaçao!
No...
I can't detect Curaçao anymore.
Mission accomplished!
No, not yet.
There are still rats to eliminate.
Aim the bomb at the axis.
In the wheel?
Yes.
If it was Curaçao, there's a chance she could take advantage
of the collapse to get away,
but there's no way a regular cop could get away.
Korn.
Hurry up and reload, and blow up that wheel.
Get it over with before air support arrives.
I will. I'll clean it up.
Haibara?
You're not hurt?
- No, I'm not hurt. - Say, Ai...
what happened?
I'll explain later,
so do as I say, okay?
Yes.
Akai!
Amuro!
I'm here.
Akai!
Anything broken, kid?
No.
Go hide,
I can still hear the propellers.
Where's Amuro?
I don't know where he is.
But if they have opted for a direct attack,
it means he managed to defuse the bomb.
Now we just have to figure out how to beat them.
Is the gun just for show?
Amuro!
Can't you shoot back, Mr. FBI agent?
In theory, yes,
but the night vision scope is broken.
I only have the normal scope I had in reserve.
I'll never touch that black metal raven.
If you could see it, could you?
Yes.
But how?
You'd have to pull the tie rod.
I haven't seen a mating bar!
You can't see it from the front.
If we could make it move
and in addition light the propellers for five seconds...
I should be able to illuminate it,
but without knowing its shape, I won't be able to find the propellers.
I think they are trying to blow up the axle!
So the Ferris wheel will collapse?
That sucks...
there's still half the bombs in there.
Pull, pull, pull!
Damn it!
I can see where they're shooting from,
but not where the propellers are!
You just need to see what it looks like?
Okay.
Don't miss it!
I see it!
Come on!
That light...
Fireworks!
What the hell is that?
- Fireworks. - We're under attack!
Where is it coming from?
Go to hell.
Did he get it?
Oh, great.
We're in trouble now!
We're going down!
Korn, get out of the way!
Oh, my God!
If the axis is destroyed, we're in trouble!
It's over, we have to go!
Save yourselves!
Run for it!
Get away from the aquarium!
Oh no!
She's going to fall on the aquarium!
Who the hell are these guys?
I don't care who the people are
about to die.
Attention, everyone to the dolphin stage!
Don't stay here!
The Ferris wheel...
Ran, we have to go!
Damn it, it's speeding up the hill!
Conan!
Amuro!
Can we stop it?
I don't know, but we have to try!
Amuro!

I'm fine, just stay focused.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Akai!
You have a plan, right?
Do you?
Yes, I do!
No, still not!
- No, it won't stop. - Sonoko, hurry!
Run for it!
That won't do.
No matter, I still have a plan.
Kudo?
I can't make it in time.
Stop, don't rush.
Akai!
How about this?
...about this?
Ran?
But, that balloon...
Come on, blow it up! Faster!
Blow it up even more!
Run away!
No... it doesn't stop!
Children!
Stop!
We stopped, right?
Great, we're saved!
It's probably because of Conan!
Amazing, that kid.
He actually managed to stop that huge wheel!
That backhoe...
Who was driving it?
You did good,
kid.
Hold on a second,
I'd like to identify the body.
If you like,
but in this condition, it's not recognizable.
I understand that.
Good work, you can go.
Is this...
Yes.
Small.
Can I see what you just picked up?
What is it?
Maybe it's data storage!
No.
Not data.
Memories.
Even if it all ended up burning.
Have you finally given up
the idea of traveling alone?
I've always told you that
But nobody blames you
An infinity of twisted threads
On the days when you can't do anything
The days you lose the fight
If you look back you'll see
All those old you trying to move on
Even all these tragedies
May be only nightmares revived
Ah, this world will take
The color you give it
Sometimes it will be sweet
And sometimes even cruel
Every word you say flies away
So much repeated nonsense
So many confused schedules
Covered in sweat and exhausted
You chain together small regrets
No matter how many compromises you make
We can't find common ground
We can't manage to direct
Our attentions towards each other
We can't see the end of the tunnel
But we have to keep going
Ah, this world will take
The color you give it
Scream until it hurts
Look for a clear tomorrow
These budding feelings will make waves
What we see day after day
Is the undeniable truth
And this, even if each one of us
Lives according to his desires
Ah, this world will take
The color you give it
So choose your words well
And act with confidence
Someone will be there to see your courage
Yesterday, at the aquarium in Tohto...
We were almost there...
You guys are so lame!
I'd like to see you there!
Alright, I'll do it!
She said...
she wanted to protect us.
She wouldn't have kept the keychain until she died, if it wasn't true.
But why did she do that?
We played at the hospital...
and we gave her a keychain.
Even she was too happy.
Wasn't she?
Yes !
We all have the same one.
- That's it. - Look!
But then she disappeared.
She must have recovered her memories and gone home.
To think we were about to become friends.
We sure were.
You know, I..,
I think you are already friends.
Just look at the way you think about her.
Oh, yeah.
You're right!
Yes !
If that's the case,
she found her thanks to them.
Yes.
At the very end, she regained
her own color.
