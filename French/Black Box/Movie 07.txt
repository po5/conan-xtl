DETECTIVE CONAN CROSSROADS IN THE OLD CAPITAL
My name is Shinichi Kudo, high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug, and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name, I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
To find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
I'm the Osaka area high school detective, Heiji Hattori!
My father, the chief of police in Osaka,
passed on to me his talent for deduction and for kendo.
My mother passed on to me her courage and her guts.
Oh yes, and it was my grandfather who gave me my dark skin color.
Hattori in the west
and Kudo in the east...
always on an equal footing...
But then, as expected,
he ended up using an array of gadgets created by Professor Agasa
to solve case after case.
Other people know Kudo's identity besides Professor Agasa and myself.
His father and mother,
as well as Ai Haibara, who goes to the same elementary school as him.
This little girl
was in fact a member of the gang of men in black,
but in order to leave the organization,
she ingested the same drug as Kudo,
thus making her body younger.
Otherwise, I too have a childhood friend in the same class as me,
Kazuha Toyama, who is really grumpy.
Who's the grumpy one?
Where did you come from, idiot?
You're the idiot, who were you talking to?
What do you mean, who?
I was just summarizing the situation for the audience!
There!
What's that? You're really not clean!
You're the one who's messed up!
Even as a child, I still have all my intelligence,
There's still only one truth!
"Here, Beika, Beika! The exit is..."
Does that mean you won't be going home for a while?
Yeah, I'm in the middle of something here...
Oh, well...
It's getting cold, so take care of yourself, huh!
You too, don't sleep with your stomach open!
But I don't sleep with my stomach open, you idiot!
Yoshinoyama! (play)
You walk on the white snow of the ridge,
are you waiting for your lover to return?
Do you think you're Yoshitsune and Shizuka Gozen, or what?
Bah what!
It's normal to worry about your childhood friend, right?
My father makes too much noise, I hang up!
Hey, wait!
No way!
Next time I'll call when he's not there...
Yoshitsune and Shizuka Gozen?
Those two never met again, I think...
Oh well...
Tokyo - Nishikunitachi
Kamei no Rokuro (35 years old)
Kataoka no Hachirô (34 years old)
Washinoo no Shichirô (35 years old)
What's Benkei doing?
Yeah, he said he had solved the riddle, though...
He was the most enthusiastic...
Kataoka!

Neyagawa - ''Takohei

Higashiyama - "Snack Jirô
Suruga no Jirô (32 years old)
A few days later Tokyo - Police Department
After investigation, the five people killed
in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto were all members of the Genji Botaru robbery gang.
Therefore,
for this case,
Miss Sato!
Detective of Kyoto Police Fumimaro Ayanokoji

I heard that Inspector Ayanokôji
is a graduate of the same class as Shiratori.
Yes.
He's from a noble family, hence his nickname of Royal Inspector.
Look, in his left pocket.
But... what's this?
That's his chipmunk.
Apparently he always carries it with him.
He's even stranger than Shiratori!
Since 1991, the Genji Botaru gang
has been known to steal Buddha statues
and works of art around Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto.
Their particularity
is that all the members have taken the names of Yoshitsune's servants
and that they all have a copy of the "Gikeiki".
Gikeiki
They are eight, with a number in their name:
the leader is Yoshitsune, then we have Benkei and Ise no Saburô.
They were all killed, except the three mentioned.
We know that their copies of the Gikeiki were stolen.
Any clues about the killer?
We know that he is an expert in sword and archery,
Osaka Police Prefecture Inspector Otaki
but we don't know the age or sex
of Yoshitsune, Benkei or Ise no Saburo.
It is necessary to stop as soon as possible
the culprit of the murders as well as the remaining members of the gang of thieves.
We will do our best to continue the investigation.
Hattori Residence
The Yoshitsune of the Heisei era
leading a gang of thieves...
Are you there, Heiji?
What's up?
Oh boy! It's precious, isn't it?
Yes, I'll put it away then.
Are you going out?
Yeah, I wanted to check something...
Oh? Are you disappointed?
No, no, I just thought we could go see the cherry blossoms in Tomorogi.
But it's okay!
Oh well! I'll go then.
Be careful!
I will!
Why am I smiling at him like this?
Finally Kyoto, the home of all Japanese people!
Well, I'm nice enough to bring you here,
so don't disturb me in my work!
Yes !
How lucky he is, Conan, to be in Kyoto!
Apparently the Sannô temple asked Mr. Mouri to come and help them.
We also want to go there!
I could take you there, but well...
Oh! Really?
I'll be able to see Conan!
- Kyoto, Kyoto, tomorrow is by... - Only if you answer this quiz first!
Oh well, no!
You don't want to take us, actually.
Why not?
Try, at least.
It'll kill time, that way.
Uh, what do we do?
We can try!
Yes !
Do you all know who Benkei is?
Yes, he's Yoshitsune's servant, right?
Hey, who's Yoshitsune?
His real name is Ushiwakamaru,
he's known for defeating Benkei,
who was waiting on Gojo bridge in Kyoto to kill his 1000th victim,
and then made him his servant, that's him, Yoshitsune Minamoto.
At that time, the Genji and the Heike were fighting each other,
and Yoshitsune defeated the Heike.
But his half-brother, Yoritomo, hated him,
Hiraizumi
and he committed suicide in the Koromo river of lwate prefecture, at that time called Hiraizumi.
Well, you know about it!
Here is the quiz then!
Benkei's first love was called Uzune,
but she ended up marrying another man.
When Benkei found out:
1) He got angry;
2) he was happy;
3) He cried.
So, what's the verdict?
Oh, his first love...
It made him angry, that's for sure!
He couldn't have been happy!
So answer one, "He got angry"?
He cried.
What?
That's answer three, "He wept."
You were thinking of Benkei's "Achilles heel", weren't you?
Ah, as usual, you got me, Ai.
What is his "Achilles heel"?
It's his weakest point, where he is most sensitive,
enough to make even a man as strong as him cry!
And for Benkei, his "Achilles heel" was his shin (mukôzune)!
I agree... But I don't see the connection with the quiz!
Uh, well...
I got it!
It's the son-in-law (muko) and Uzune who got married!
Muko + Uzune = "Mukouzune"
Oh my...
Another pun?
As we gave the right answer, we can go to Kyoto, right?

Well, it's Ai who answered well...
But she is also a member of the Junior Detectives!
It's mean to exclude her like that!
My mom always tells me not to become an adult who doesn't keep her promises!
All right, uh...
Thank you!
Yes, thank you.
Sano Temple
That must remain between us...
Ryûen (34 years old) monk of Sannô temple
Oh, Mr. Mouri!
Thank you for coming from so far!
I'm Ryuen, it's me who called you!
Let me introduce you.
Here is Enkai, the main monk.
Enkai (65 years old) Main monk of Sannô temple
These gentlemen are regular visitors to our temple.
Shozo Sakura (51 years old) Antique dealer
Mr. Shozo Sakura,
He has an antique store in Teramachi street.
So you are the famous Kogoro Mouri?
Ah, well, am I that famous?
Shuntaro Mizuo (33 years old) Noh actor
Next to him is Mr. Shuntarô Mizuo, inventor of the Mizuo style of Noh theater.
And here is Mr. Taiga Saijô, owner of a second-hand bookshop.
Taiga Saijô (35 years old) Owner of a second-hand bookshop
Nice to meet you.
Yes, they are more than just followers, they are also our kendo buddies.
Oh, you all practice kendo?
That's why you all have a brilliant form!
Kendô comrades?
By the way, I heard that there is a Buddha statue here
that you take out only every 12 years?
Yes, the idol of this temple, Yakushi Nyorai...
Will be presented to the public in 3 days, right?
We also came hoping to see him.
Well, I'm sure our good Yakushi Nyorai will be pleased too!
What are you saying?
The statue was stolen?
Yes, 8 years ago already...
Bodhisattva Nikko
On the right, we have the statue of Bodhisattva Nikko,
and on the left, the statue of Bodhisattva Gakko.
Bodhisattva Gakko.
On the other hand, the statue of Yakushi Nyorai, normally in the center, has been stolen.
I wanted to report it immediately to the police,
but the head monk stopped me.
According to him, the statue would reappear one day if it were to be so.
What indulgence...
Since then, 8 years have passed...
But 5 days ago, we received this.
No stamp, no sender...
"Solve this puzzle to find the Buddha statue."
What kind of gibberish is that?
Thanks for the tea!
Obviously no witnesses, so early in the morning...
Thief!
Go away!
Ouch, it hurts!
Right on the tibia, of course it hurts!
Here, it's yours!
Thank you, young man, what class!
But no, not at all!
I'm Tae Yamakura, I manage a tea house in Miyagawachô.
Tae Yamakura (52 years old) Owner of a tea house in Miyagawachô
Give him your card too!
Yes, please. I'm Chikasuzu.
Chikasuzu (19 years old) Maiko (Geisha apprentice)
Nice to meet you.
How can I thank you...
Oh no, I didn't do anything special!
In that case, come and visit us one day!
Take care of yourself!
Thank you.
What the hell does that mean?
On the fifth step at the top,
a cicada, a tengu and a goldfish.
And on the 4th step, we have a rooster and... a loche?
A yellow loche, yuck!
I wonder what that mark is there.
Just a stain, right?
Between the 2nd and 3rd step, a violet, a tengu and Mount Fuji.
And an acorn on the side!
Say, Dad, do you think you'll find it in three days?
Don't worry!
After all, there's no mystery I can't solve!
Hey oh, you really believe that?
Well, let's leave the riddle to the pro, and go visit Kyoto instead!
Yes, do that, you're bothering me here!
Actually, Kazuha told me that she'll show us the city tomorrow!
But Heiji can't come, apparently.
We don't need a guy who's already settled, anyway!
Oh, so he's not coming?
Are you coming too, Conan?
Oh, I don't think so.
I promised some kids in the neighborhood I'd go fishing with them...

Well, you've already made friends!
But be careful, eh.
Yes !
No doubt, the Buddha statue was stolen by the Genji Botaru gang...
But... why would they steal the statue?
And what does it have to do with the 5 murders?
"Genji Botaru", huh...
Speaking of Yoshitsune and Benkei,
it must be there!
Gojo Bridge
Nothing that seems to be related to the strange enigma...
On the Gojo bridge in Kyoto, the great Benkei...
shoots his wooden sword...
on Ushiwakamaru and hit him!
Hattori!
The gods must have arranged our meeting!
What's that?
Say, give me back my shinai now!
Oh sorry! Thank you, thank you!
- Let's go! -Yes!
Practice hard!
Why take his shinai from a kid?
By the way, what are you doing here?
I can ask you the same question!
Actually, the owner of the takoyaki restaurant killed in Osaka was an acquaintance.
Apparently he was a member of a gang of thieves,
but I had been going to his house since elementary school.
He took good care of me, so I thought I would avenge him by finding his murderer...
So that's why you came to Kyoto, to find information about the murderer...
I have something that might interest you!
I see...
This riddle could also lead us to the culprit, right...
So you too...
Yeah, I guess so.
If it was the Genji Botaru who stole the statue,
I thought I'd find clues to solve this puzzle
in places related to Yoshitsune and Benkei...
But I don't understand anything in Kyoto...
Let me do it then!
I will guide you!
Gojo Tenjin
Here is the Gojo Tenjin.
The Gikeiki says that it's here and not on the Gojo bridge that they met.
What do you think? Do you see a connection ?
No... it doesn't look like it...
Well, next then.
But I don't like it!
What's that?
Why didn't the monks of Sano call me?
I'm the detective of Kansai!
Uh, well... to keep the police out of it?
Your father has his reputation, after all!
Well, never mind.
Wait, now that you mention it...
Here it is!
"Benkei stone"? Benkei Stone
It is said that Benkei used it to sit on,
or that it was thrown down from Mount Miei, there are several legends and stories.
No link here either, it seems...
Oh well!
To the next one then!
Where are we going ?
Keiage Incline.
I'm Ayanokoji of the Kyoto Police.
It seems that you are looking for clues about Genji Botaru,
but this is not Osaka.
Don't interfere!
A chipmunk...
Understand?
There really are cases everywhere, huh!
Yes!
Kiyomizu Temple
I'm taking a picture!
Yes, with the cherry trees!
It's so beautiful!
Ah, if only I could see a landscape like that...
...with Makoto, it'd be so wonderful!
But, uh, Ran!
I'm getting even!
Kazuha, did you get angry with Heiji?
Actually, he came to Kyoto to solve a case...
And Kyoto is where his first love is!
Keage Incline - Sosui Park
Vairocana Yoshitsune Buddha
It's not here yet.
Let's have lunch!
Yeah, let's.
Cherry trees...
It's just that seeing cherry blossoms
always reminds me of what happened 8 years ago.
I was exploring a temple in Kyoto,
and while I was climbing up a lattice window...
one of the bars broke,
I hit my head really hard on the floor and passed out.
I don't know how long I could have stayed asleep there...
but when I woke up...
then the eighth, and you'll be on the street Tôji,
the ninth marks the end.

I swear it was not a dream...
I tell myself that I will meet her again by chance, one day...
Hey oh, why are you laughing?
Sorry, sorry... go on!
When I go to Kyoto, I always bring this.
A crystal stone.
It's shape looks familiar.
Does it?
Do you know someone who has one just like it?
No.

Besides, does she know?
Does she?
Oh, Kazuha?
I didn't tell her but she seems to know.
She found out because of this...
A magazine article?
Yes! It's a very popular magazine in Kansai.
He was asked about his first love...
and he said it was a girl a little older than him, when he was in third grade.
Apparently this stuff is very precious because it belonged to him.
It's crazy that they even took a picture!
What's this?
Just a crystal stone.
I'm sure she gave it to him...
Do you know who this girl is?
No, I don't!
Heiji has apparently only seen her that one time,
but I think he looks for her every time he goes to Kyoto.
Ah! That's why they took a picture!
In case that girl reads the article, and wants to contact him...
Yeah, it's crazy, huh!
And on top of that, they posted a picture of him in 3rd grade!
Oh, so cute!
But yes, he was really too...
Anyway, Ran, that's not the point.
But you don't have to worry about it!
Even if he did have a first love..,
that's all in the past!
You two are a great couple now!
Yes, but for men, their first love is always special...
Sonoko!
Well, let's move on!
How about a zenzai?
Madam, 3 zenzai, please! And quickly, if possible!
This is the west gate of Kurama Temple.
Normally we have to enter from the front,
but this way is shorter!
Kurama temple - Inner shrine at 588 m
Here is the "Sôjôgatani Fudôdô".
Sûjôgatani Fudôdô
This is where Ushiwakamaru met a tengu, who taught him the art of war.
It's true that this is the perfect place to train with a sword!
This cedar is really huge!
Hattori, it's not here either...
Get down!
Not so fast!
Hey, Kudo!
It really looks like Ushiwakamaru!
Damn it!
Kudo, here! Here we go!
Here you are!
What are you doing here!
Kurama Temple
Kurama Station
Hurry up for the next train!
Departure is imminent...
Uh, no need to go so fast either...
Hey, there are tracks here!
You're distracting me, shut up!
Traffic violation... He'll soon lose his license.
But why?
Damn it!
That was close...
Maybe he's the one who killed the Genji Botaru members!
I guess so.
But I don't understand why he wanted to get you too.
Oh, Heiji!
Why are you here?
Well, I ran into Ku... uh, Conan by chance,
and we were thinking about the riddle together.
And did you solve it?
Not yet... it's quite difficult!
What about Uncle?
Well...
Ponto district
Sakura" tea house
Kayo Ichi Geiko (Geisha)
Oh la la!
Chikasuzu (19 years old) Geiko (Geisha) apprentice
Yes, Miss Chikazuku, you are the best!
Thank you, you are too kind.
Come and pour sake for Mr. Mouri!
Yes, of course.
Please excuse me.
Oh yes, yes.
Oh la la, my little Kogoro, you are in paradise!
Get in quickly, then!
Uh, how did you know...
Mr. Enkai told on me!
I see, the head monk...
Please join us, then!
Thank you very much, that's nice!
Oh? But we know each other, right?
Yes, I'm Chikasuzu.
Thanks again for your help.
Do you know her, Heiji?
Yes, well, just a little.
Honestly, I leave for five minutes and this is the result...
Miss Ran, please don't be angry with your father.
We're the ones who invited him!
Yes, we wanted him to solve the Genji Botaru case for us.
Besides, all the members would have a copy of the Gikeiki, wouldn't they?
Teahouse owner
I have one too, it's such a good book after all...
Isn't it, Mr. Bookseller!
Yes... but I don't like it that much!
It's also called "Yoshitsune's Story", but it's really more about Benkei!
I like this book!
Especially the story called "Ataka no Benkei"!

What is "ataka"?
It is a Noh play.
Wishing to escape from their pursuers,
Yoshitsune and his servants disguised themselves as travelling monks,
trying to pass through Ataka,
but their disguise was about to be discovered.
That's when Benkei hit Yoshitsune with a steel stick,
Eh, but why?
To fool the guard who was going to unmask them.
Impossible indeed to think that a servant would dare to hit his master!
That's how Yoshitsune and his troop managed to pass Ataka.
Benkei, in tears, apologized to Yoshitsune,
but the latter, on the contrary, congratulated his lively reaction.
It's a beautiful story about the deep bond between them.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm very tired,
can I go lie down in a room downstairs?
Well, since you're the only guests here tonight, why don't you go into the next room?
I'd rather be downstairs, it's quieter.
Could you wake me up at 9pm?
Have fun!
You can see the river!
This is the Kamo River.
The cherry trees are beautiful!
Oh yes, they are!
Come and see, Ran!
Lovers love to watch them from the Kamo River,
but to see them from the river
...that flows under this building, the Misogi, is even more spectacular!
Yes, it's beautiful.
Yes, it is very beautiful!
Your fingers are so white and thin,
you could eat them!
Did you hurt yourself?
Yes, but it's nothing.
Uncle Kogoro will heal you!
Okay, that's enough!
Always the same mistakes...
Hey oh, look at this.
Inspector Ayanokoji?
What's he doing in a place like this?
Why don't you take a walk on the veranda below and look at the cherry trees!
The weather's nice and the moon should be beautiful tonight!
Shall we go?
Yes, of course!
I'll stay here.
Me too!
Why do you ask?
Are you interested in the maiko?
Idiot, go!
Don't talk nonsense!
Yeah.
Yes! Go! Come on!
Oh no, you got me!
There's no stopping him now!
He's letting himself go, as usual.
Chikasuzu, I want my revenge!
I'm going to the bathroom too.
Don't bother, I'm not drunk, just take care of Mr. Mouri.
I will.
Let's go!
- Yes! Come on! Come on! - Oh, the moon is out!
The moon...
Yeah, so what?
Nothing, I just remembered an appointment with Ran.
By the time I realized I had to meet her, I was already two hours late.
That's not good!
I really didn't think she'd still be waiting for me,
but I went to check anyway...
Who's there?
Sorry, Ran, I was completely...
Phew!
I was afraid something had happened to you!
That's when you...
That you started thinking of her as more than just a childhood friend...
No, you idiot, not at all!
I liked her even before that...
She's still waiting for me, right?
What's going on, Ran?
Nothing's the matter!
He's getting on my nerves, that one!
But...I envy you, Kazuha!
You do?
Because...you can see him anytime.
Ran...
Well, yeah... I hardly ever see Makoto either.
It's so hard to be a girl in love...
They've got a lot of energy, haven't they?
Damn.
Mr. Sakura, it's 9 p.m.!
Mr. Sakura?
Excuse me, sir.
Oh? Has he gone out already?
Not even there?
Mr. Sakura?
Oh?
What was that scream?
Help me! Help me!
What's the matter?
Mr. Sakura...
Mr. Sakura!
Don't let anyone in!
Ran, call the police!
Yes !
Someone cut his jugular with a sharp tool.
What a clean cut...
Maybe it's the same killer again.
Ah, I thought I'd seen you before...
You're the high school detective Heiji Hattori, right?
Yes.
Could you go back to the room, before the police arrive?
Don't come out under any circumstances!
Yes, of course.
It seems that Mr. Sakura was killed while searching this room...
But why?

The buttons on his jacket were torn off.
Yes... Maybe it was hard to unbutton his jacket with gloves on,
but his wallet's still intact and full.
Whoever did this was not after his money.
Don't touch the body!
How many times do you have to say it!
It hurts!
Good evening.
Ayanokoji, Kyoto police.
Thank you for coming.
Come this way.
Stay there.
Yes !
Oh, good evening, Inspector!
That was fast!
Where is your chipmunk today?
I don't always have it with me!
What do you think? Someone from outside?
We can't rule it out...
If someone had opened the door, the owner would have heard it.
Also, the culprit knew, strangely enough,
that Mr. Sakura had gone down to the storage room.
To sum up...
it is most likely that it was an acquaintance of Mr. Sakura,
namely Mr. Saijo, Mr. Ryuen or Mr. Mizuo.
After Ran and the girls went out,
they all went to the bathroom.
Besides, there's a staircase right next to it.
So they pretended to go to the bathroom,
when in fact they went down to kill Mr. Sakura.
But there's one thing that bothers me...
Mr. Mizuo went to the bathroom with Chikasuzu.
All the maikos seem to do that.
But Mr. Ryuen and Mr. Saijo went alone.
It's because she was playing a game with uncle.
So it's possible that they went to the toilet deliberately at that time.
So it means that the culprit is either Mr. Ryuen or Mr. Saijo,
and that Mr. Mizuo is innocent?
Yes, if Chikasuzu is not their accomplice.
Ha, yes it's true.
Let's go !
Don't pretend!
Isn't that why you searched Mr. Sakura's jacket?
Ah... you mean this.
His store is on Teramachi Street, right?
Sakura Antique Shop
The Gikeiki?
"Ise no Saburo"?
Hattori!
What's up?
So Mr. Sakura was Ise no Saburo!
What's that?
Oh! But this is...
A copy of the riddle!
But why?
If Mr. Sakura had one with him, that means...
that Mr. Sakura sent a copy to the temple?
But... what for?
What for? Mr. Sakura was Ise no Saburo?
Yes.
He was in the Genji Botaru gang.
Wait a minute... So the number of victims is...
Am I next, since I have "5" (Go) in my name?
We already did that one...
Say,
if the riddle found at Mr. Sakura's house was a copy,
maybe Mr. Sakura had the original on him and his killer took it?
I see.
The killer surely didn't think that Mr. Sakura had a copy!
So who did it?
I think it's either Mr. Ryuen, Mr. Saijo, Mr. Mizuo or Miss Chikasuzu.
What is it?
But none of them had a weapon on him.
After you left, we were all searched!
The culprit would be really stupid to keep the murder weapon on himself.
He either threw it away or hid it.
But apparently nothing was found in the tea house...
And in the Misogi river ?
He could have thrown it out of the window in the basement hallway!
Isn't it so! That's what I think too!
Sonoko said she heard something fall into the Misogi River.
Did she?
Yes, there's no doubt.
But the police searched the river,
with no result!
It's strange, all this...
He had an accomplice, then!
He could have waited outside and retrieved the gun from the river!
No, I don't think so.
Why is that Ku... uh, Conan?
The full moon was really bright tonight, right?
There are gaps between the slats of the veranda, which allow you to see underneath...
Veranda
Sakura tea room
Riverbank
Misogi River
If there was an accomplice near the river,
Ran and the girls would have noticed!
Ah, yes...
That's what happened.
The culprit came from outside
He came in through the basement window,
before the girls went out on the veranda.
He was waiting in the bathroom
for Mr. Sakura to come into the room and kill him.

Then he went out with the murder weapon through the window.
But we didn't see anything,
nor the people on the river bank.
Just a coincidence!
The killer was lucky!
I am not convinced...
But it was him at Mount Kurama!
Kazuha!
- Hold on! - What are you doing?
You stay here, okay?
Heiji!
You want to fight, right? All right, then!
Right? Openings everywhere?
Does he have any protection?
You're the one who killed Mr. Sakura!
In that case, try...
to cut my throat too!
You're not looking for that!
My eyes...
Why did you...
Officer, over here!
Heiji, are you okay?
Kazuha... the police...
I lied, of course!
Where did you learn...
What a formidable woman...
Heiji!
Umekoji Hospital
Heiji, are you awake?
Kazuha...
What a relief...
We were worried, Heiji...
Mr. Otaki...
And... who are you again?
Shiratori, Tokyo Police.
I came from Tokyo when I heard Mr. Sakura was a member of the Genji Botaru.
Does it hurt?
Just a little.
We found some stolen artworks
in Mr. Sakura's store.
So you're awake?
What about the dagger, Inspector?
It's being analyzed at the lab.
Let me know when you find out more.
If you run out of evidence...
you'll always have my shoulder wound.
Evidence, for what purpose?
To prove that this dagger was used to kill Mr. Sakura.
If only we had something that actually hit the killer...
Ah! The motorcycle!
He had a motorcycle!
It was a stolen motorcycle.
Any evidence to identify the killer?
As a matter of fact...
Do you know what this is about?
It was found in Mr Sakura's Gikeiki...
Are you sure about that?
Well, all right...
I hope you've learned your lesson.
On that note, I'll be going too.
Take care of yourself.
I'm going to call my father.
All right!
I'll ask your doctor!
- Yes, Conan's with me... - Ran!
I'm going out for a while, watch over Heiji for me!
Oh?
Are you sure you're okay? You should rest...
I'm fine.
I swear, that guy was something!
I've never seen that before.
And he was probably using some kind of protection.
I wanted him to pull out his dagger and hurt me
and then I'd have proof...
And he left it behind.
Why did he leave it behind?
And that's not all.
He wanted to take my bag, which fell while we were fighting...
Really, I don't understand anything.
Don't tell me that he is your first love...
Why not!
No way!
Mizuo Residence
You were attacked?
After that?
It's a bit impolite, but I came to ask you for your alibi.
The culprit was wearing an old man's Noh mask.
A Noh mask?
Mr. Saijo and Mr. Ryuen, could I ask you for yours too?
Eh, us too?
What a day!
We wanted to think, with Miss Chikasuzu, about who killed Mr. Sakura.
Oh, well...
Well, all right.
I came straight home and slept.
But I'm single...
My room is far from my mother's,
so no one can vouch for the fact that I stayed here.
Same thing for me.
I live alone above my store in Teramachi Street.
As for me, I read for a while in the main temple building
then I went to rest.
But I have no witnesses...
I see.
One more thing... Do you practice archery?
Archery?
No...
I own an Azusa bow, for the Noh play with the maple trees.
I once used a bowstring to ward off evil spirits...
So no one present last night practices archery?
I think so... Yamakura...
Ah, Ms. Yamakura does archery?
Tae Yamakura
But she wasn't here last night.
No, well...
I'm sorry.
Oh, you're here!
You are?
What?
Over here.
Are you Chikasuzu?
Yes, I am!
It's a change from her maiko makeup, isn't it?
Go on, get in!
Yes, thank you!
Thank you for last night.
We look forward to seeing you.

We do the same.
Thank you, goodbye.
Sannô temple is in Rokkaku street, isn't it?
This is Ebisugawa street,
Maru, Take, Ebisu and Oshioike
and then Ane, San, Rokkaku
So this is the 6th street!
Maru, Take, Ebisu and Oshioike
What is this song?
Well, I just know that it is called "temari-uta", "the balloon song"...
It's a song from the streets of Kyoto from east to west, listed from the north.
Maru, Take, Ebisu and Oshioike
Ane, San, Rokkaku, Tako, Nishiki
Shi, Aya, Bu, Taka, Matsu, Man, Gojô
Setta, Chara-chara, Uonotana
Pass the sixth and the seventh,
then the eighth, and you will be in Tôji street,
the ninth marks the end.
This is how all the children of Kyoto remember the streets of the city!
Oh!
So you are originally from Kyoto?
Yes !
How old are you?
I'm 19 years old!
Nineteen?
This is Oike street.
I'll leave you here.
- Goodbye, goodbye. - Goodbye! Goodbye!
Do you think she could...
No doubt, she comes from Kyoto and is 2 years older than me!
But everyone knows this song here.
Finally, I saw her again!
Hello?
Heiji, but finally!
Leaving the hospital alone!
Ah, Mr. Otake...
Kyoto Police Prefecture
Anyway, we got the results of the dagger.
They found blood there that belonged
the same blood type as Mr. Sakura's...
The type of dagger also matches the wound on Mr. Sakura's neck.
I see.
Heiji, please don't be reckless!
If something happens to you, I won't know what to tell your father...
Yes, I know! Thank you very much, Mr. Otake!
Now we're sure that the one who attacked me
must be the one who killed Mr. Sakura.
So the four people who couldn't get rid of the murder weapon
are not guilty...
Conan!
What are you doing?
What the hell...
Because we took his quiz, Professor Agasa brought us here!
Genta, on the other hand...
He got lost.
What about the badges!
We've already managed to contact him!
But Genta can't read kanji, so he doesn't know where he is...
So we thought you could look for him with your glasses!
Okay, let me do it!
That's great! Ah, here!
No, but...
You're on a case here too, right?
Yes... We'll talk more about that later.
Ah, here we go again, Ai, give me a pill.
What's this?
It's an anti-gargoyle.
He uses them on important occasions.
I also have some for those who want to pretend to be drunk,
or for those who want to take a day off work.
My little Ai has been a great help.
Nobody will want it...
Rokkaku Temple
Oh, there it is!
We are in Rokkaku temple.
That's great!
Ah, he is here!
Saved!
Phew, we found you!
I thought I would never see you again!
I thought I'd never see you again!
This is a great gadget !
A badge with a radio transmitter...
The waves emitted are synchronized with my glasses,
Hattori!
Yes, they are!
What's that?
Kudo...
You think...
No doubt about it.
Yes... What she heard,
it was the gun that was thrown away!
So, it must be one of the four...
No, one of the three.
My first love can't be a murderer!
Hello...
But, there is one thing that bothers me...
The song I remember is a little different from the version I heard before.
Oh?
My first love sang "Yome, San, Rokkaku" instead of "Donkey, San, Rokkaku".
I wonder why...
Go figure!
Found it! A piece of his mask!
Inspector?
What's the matter?
What about this?
It belongs to the victims killed in Tokyo.
One was wearing a hat, another a scarf, and the last one gloves...
Same color, pattern and fabric.
Weird, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Hey, what is it?
For example, if Shiratori wore them all at the same time, there would be nothing wrong,
but if the Inspector was wearing the hat,
I wore the scarf,
and you wore the gloves, wouldn't that be weird?
Yes, it would.

It's as if Mr. Shiratori had passed away and left us each a piece...
But yes!
Uh, what?
Ah, I'm hungry!
Wait a minute!
Chikasuzu's mother was a geiko from Miyakawa district,
but died of illness when the little one was five.
As she wasn't married,
it seems that Miss Chikasuzu was taken in and raised by Mrs. Tae Yamakura, from the tea house.
What's "unmarried mother"?
Well...
It's a woman who had a child without marrying the father.
Nobody knows who the father is,
but someone was sending money to the tea shop every month.
However, these transfers would have stopped abruptly 3 months ago.
Indeed, there is something to think about...
For three months?
But, Inspector, where did you learn all this?
From the "royal inspector"?
Not at all! It turns out that I'm quite well known in the Gion district...
And you're proud of that?
They say he's my rival,
but he always carries his chipmunk with him, frankly...
- A chipmunk? - Yes, in his pocket!
Even though he left it at home last night when he came.
Chipmunk...
Hello.
Shiratori.
Megure here!
We thought of something about Yoshitsune and Benkei!
A division of property?
We can solve the mystery with that.
In other words, we think either Yoshitsune or Benkei is already dead!
I get it!
Mr. Mouri, do you really know who the murderer was?
Yes.
I'll get started.
The culprit is you, Miss Chikasuzu!
What the hell!
That's totally absurd!
Is he all right?
Let's hear him out...
She wanted to avenge her father's death,
who is none other than Yoshitsune of the thieves' gang!
Yoshitsune was betrayed by his men and killed three months ago.
That's why the money transfers have stopped.
I see...
And you had an accomplice,
namely Benkei.
Benkei?
But who is this Benkei?
You are the "royal inspector"!
What is it?
Miss Chikasuzu, you were hiding something when you came to the tea house.
A dagger and the inspector's chipmunk!
Oh, so cute!
He's the key to this mystery!
Miss Chikasuzu, you pretended to go to the bathroom in the evening,
and then killed Mr. Sakura.
You attached the dagger, hidden somewhere in the living room,
to the chipmunk, which escaped through the basement window.
It then fell into the Misogi River and was carried away by the water.
The inspector, who was waiting below, recovers him and tries to kill Heiji later.
OK! So it's him that I heard falling in the river!
It is you two who killed all the other members.
Inspector, do you do archery?
I've never tried anything that complex!
Oh, I see.
But, Miss Chikasuzu,
I've heard that archery students get hurt in this area.
Indeed, I injured my yamakura while archery, but...
I have just started, so I will never be able to aim at someone so well!
I think she's right.
Only novices get hurt here,
according to my friends at the kyudo club.
Besides, if he had been killed like that, he wouldn't have been able to share his possessions.
Mr. Mouri, do you seriously suspect this girl?
Well, it's that...
This is a joke!
The maikos are too busy training and taking care of their clients,
they don't have time to kill people!
Say!
What?
Isn't the chipmunk a little small to carry a dagger?
Shut up!
I'll prove it to you!
Come on, move little chipmunk !
I really don't know what to say anymore...
You do it on purpose just to annoy me!
Stop it!
The poor thing, anyway!
This is cruelty to animals!
Oh, shut up!
Genta, save him!
OK, OK.
Kudo...
Yes...
Thanks to him, I know who did it.
I've figured out who did it, too.
We wouldn't be saying this if we weren't practicing archery...
We need proof, and...
to find out where the Buddha statue is.
Poor little chipmunk!

Maybe we can feed him!
I found some acorns!
That's it!
It's like the acorn rhyme!
The acorn rhyme?
Is that...
Hey, what are you doing, Kudo?
What if the riddle refers to the streets of Kyoto?
What?
First, the streets from east to west.
On the 5th step,
Gojo street
it's Gojo street.
On the 4th step, Shijô street.
Shijô street
Between the 2nd and 3rd step,
we have what's between Sanyo and Nijo streets,
Oike street
or Oike street.
The proof.
"The acorn that falls and rolls"?
Then the streets from north to south.
The violet is for the song "The spring stream",
Ogawa street
so Ogawa street.
A tengu is also called "karasu-tengu",
Karasuma street
hence Karasuma street.
Mount Fuji = Tomi
As for the Mount Fuji,
Tominokôji street
refers to Tominokôji street.
And the rooster?
The rooster can be used for the dish "Yanagawa Nabe",
So Yanagi no Banba street?
Yanagi no Banba street
The rooster...
Maybe Nishi no Tôin street?
The character of "rooster" is similar to the character of "west".
Tori (rooster) = Nishi (west) Nishi no Tôin street
It's so complicated...
So what is this?
The cicada is also called "aburazemi", so Aburakôji street.
Aburakôji street
The tengu is Karasuma street.
Karasuma street
And the goldfish?
We feed it with what we call "fu", so Fuyachô street?
Fuyachô street
The violet and the Fuji have the same color,
like the rooster and the loche,
the cicada and the fish,
and if we connect the 2 tengus,
The kanji "king" ?
But why?
That's another trait! Here.
"Tama" or "Gyoku"
"Tama" is also read "gyoku", namely "precious stone". "Tama" or "Gyoku"
This place...
The Buko temple!
Well, we found the treasure, I guess!
Are you alright?
Yeah, just a little uncomfortable...
Rokkaku Temple
Ah, thanks.
How are you feeling?
Much better.
Hattori, eight years ago,
you fainted at Sanno Temple, didn't you?
How did you know?
Idiot, because I saw how you looked at the temple and its cherry trees.
I also saw the window you were talking about...
Yes, it was under those cherry trees that I picked up the crystal stone.
Sorry to disappoint you, but this stone
never belonged to your first love.
I beg your pardon?
It's probably the "byakugô" of the statue that was stolen from Sannô temple.
Byakugô
The "Byakugo"? You mean the hair in the middle of the forehead of the Buddha that is supposed to shine?
Yes.
This hair is often represented by a crystal stone.
The same goes for the Noh masks.
Here is what I think:
8 years ago, the gang of thieves Genji Botaru
broke into the Sannô temple
and stole the Buddha statue.
But while carrying it, the stone fell down...
Their leader Yoshitsune didn't notice it until later,
and sent one of his men back to the temple to get it.
And at that moment...
- I want to eat zenzai! - And I want to eat anmitsu!
They had no choice but to hide the statue in Mr. Sakura's store.
And 8 years later, by pure coincidence,
they knew you were the boy who picked up the stone.
Because of the magazine?
At the same time, something happened in the gang.
I guess their leader became seriously ill.
Feeling that his time had come, he moved the statue to another place
and gave each member a sheet of the puzzle revealing its location.
Whoever solved the riddle would then become the next leader.
Then he died.
The remaining members
were unable to solve the puzzle.
And then,
the murderer proposed to Mr. Sakura to join forces with the others,
Mr. Sakura, knowing the other one's sword skills,
convinced him to kill all the others.
Moreover,
he told him that he would find the stone of the statue together,
and that they would split the money once the statue was sold.
Yeah.
Mr. Sakura, the only owner of an antique store in the gang,

was probably the only one with access to the black market to sell the statue.
That's why he thought he was perfectly safe.
But the murderer deceived Mr. Sakura.
From the beginning, he intended to kill them all
and keep the treasure for himself.
But he had to solve the riddle to find the statue.
Bukkô Temple
And so
he thought of calling the great detective Mouri to solve it.
This is the Buko temple.
Did they really hide the statue somewhere here?
I have a strange feeling...
Hey!
What's the matter? Kudo!
What are you thinking about?
But this!
The Gyokuryu temple?
That was the line on the riddle?
Yes.
Kazuha?
Hello!
We've got the girl.
Meet me at Gyokuryu Temple on Mount Kurama in one hour.
If you tell the police, I'll kill her!
Heiji, don't come, you'll get killed!
Kazuha... Kazuha!
Hattori?
Kazuha... has been kidnapped.
What's this?
I have to go alone to Gyokuryu temple in an hour.
Gyokuryu temple?
That's good.
Let's go together now!
Hattori!
Modori bridge
Having learned that his father had died, a child came to Kyoto.
The funeral procession was passing on this bridge,
when his father temporarily came back to life (modori).
He was able to talk to his son, the legend says.
Hello?
What is it?
Mount Kurama
Gyokuryu Temple
Master's order:
Put this sword in Benkei's drawer, and the bow in Rokkaku's.
Uh, Benkei's drawer...
Starting from the top, one, two, three...
What do you mean, Benkei's and Rokkaku's drawers?
Buko temple?
Yes, that's what I heard them say.
But where did they go, those two...
Kazuha doesn't answer either...
Gyokuryu Temple?
Ah, I'm hungry!
Oh yes, already?
Excuse me!
Where is this temple now?
On Mount Kurama.
But I think it's been in ruins for a while...
Thank you, sir.
Mount Kurama?
He's late.
No wonder he knew it was a trap!
I see.
Maybe he was just scared!
Heiji!
You, there!
You didn't hurt her, did you?
I'm alright!
That's what you want, isn't it?
It is to recover this stone
that you attacked me here yesterday!
Even if you failed...
To have the treasure all to yourself,
you killed Mr. Sakura at the tea house in Ponto.
Why Ponto instead of Gion or Miyagawacho?
Because there was a river under that teahouse!
A river?
After killing Mr. Sakura, who was looking for the statue in the shed,
you put a transmitter used to find lost children or to avoid robberies
with the murder weapon in a bottle, which you threw away.
Then, with your phone,
you managed to locate the transmitter and went to retrieve it.
Then you went to wait for me to return to Osaka on my motorcycle
to kill me with the same dagger!
The first time, Kazuha stopped you from killing me,
and you deliberately left the dagger behind so that you could be removed from the list of suspects!
You wanted us to think that the killer was someone who left the salon with the dagger.
Isn't that right, Mr. Taiga Saijo!
Or should I say, Benkei Musashibo?
You live up to your reputation, Heiji Hattori.
How did you know?
Because you lied about not being an archer.
When you sat down,
you first drew your right foot back halfway,
which is a common way of sitting among kyuro practitioners.
"Putting your foot back halfway"
And also because, when you were asked if you did archery,
you accidentally said "Yamakura".
I think about it... Yamakura...
You weren't thinking of Ms. Yamakura,
but rather the place where novices get hurt,
"Ya no Makura"
on the second phalanx of the left thumb.
You probably said that
thinking about Ms. Chikasuzu's injury, exactly at that place.

Only archery practitioners know this word, after all!
Besides, I knew that Mr. Ryuen was an amateur
because he used the wrong word to talk about the string.
Before, I was doing kendo with Ryuen and the others, in the city club.
But I discovered that there was a club which practiced the Gikei style in Kyoto,
so I studied this style by myself
then I stopped going to the city club 2 years ago,
after I told them that I had become the heir of this style.
A "Benkei" who practices the Gikei style, eh...
As I always preferred Yoshitsune to Benkei,
I wanted to become Yoshitsune!
However, the name Yoshitsune was already taken,
and even though I was the head of the gang, I had no choice but to be Benkei.
So you stole the statue just for the money!
Yes, but not for personal gain.
It was to build a kendo club!
Yoshitsune was the head monk of this temple,
and he took care of it even when it was deserted.
He let me use this place to train in Gikei style,
but he died three months ago,
so the temple was going to be destroyed!
I wasn't going to be able to use it to start my club anymore!
I just wonder:
you were only using Mr. Ryûen, right ?
Exactly, since he had already spoken to me about the statue a while ago.
It's me who sent the riddle to the temple
and of course he came to ask my opinion.
I wanted to make him ask Kogoro Mouri for help.
I killed Sakura
because I found someone else to sell the Buddha statue,
thanks to a handy little thing called the Internet...
Okay, enough of this chatter, are you going to give me that stone or what?
Let Kazuha go in exchange!
Oh yes, but only if you tell me where the statue is...
What?
So, where is the statue?
In this very temple!
Pardon?
Would the tree have hidden the forest?
Lie !
I already searched the temple !
It is nowhere!
It is the truth!
Kazuha, run!
Heiji!
These are my little disciples...
Don't move!
Heiji!
Don't!
That's not Heiji!
But... who are you...
Who the hell are you!
Shinichi Kudo...
Detective.
What's that?
What's wrong? You let him take this?
He called me and asked me
if there was any way I could turn him back into Shinichi, even for an hour.
But I don't have the prototype antidote to Apotoxin 4869 anymore,
Even the Baikal alcohol, which he once took
to cure a cold and which turned him back into Shinichi,
has no effect on him anymore.
That's when I had an idea.
I thought that he could take the pill that would give him the symptoms of a cold
and then again Baikal...
maybe then he could get his old body back.
And, and so?
As I thought, the experiment was successful.
He could become Shinichi again.
But as he has the symptoms of a bad cold, his body is very weakened
and I don't know if he will survive.
And how is Heiji?
I don't know.
He absolutely has to lie down until his exams tomorrow,
so I've been asked to look after him...
Shinichi?
Shit, man...
How dare you deceive me!
She must be able to escape...
but I can't move!
No way,
the Baikal will soon stop working...
You're a great detective,
but as a samurai...
you're not worth a damn!
Hattori!
Heiji!
Sorry I'm late!
Late? Idiot!
What the hell were you doing!
Hey Kudo!
You dared to take my clothes!
And moreover...
I don't know what you used,
but I'm not that black.
Oh well...
Anyway, I'll take over from here!
Go, quickly!
Hide to become small again.
And come back when it's done!
Wait!
I'm your opponent!
Kazuha, don't tell anyone you saw Kudo!
Not even Ran!
Not even Ran! Why not?

It's not your problem!
They won't see each other anyway...
It's better she doesn't know.
You won't leave here alive!
What's that fake sword?
Follow them!
Did you find them?
Not yet...
Look for them!
What's up?
Shh, not a sound, don't move.
Shinichi!
You have the same face... as that day.
What's the matter?
You're covered in sweat!
And who were those people?
But where are they?
Never mind, let's go home!
Sorry, Ran.
I can't see you now-
We can't open it, it's locked!
Do something!
That tatami smell...
I was locked in here.
Go get an axe, quick!
Damn it!
We don't have much time...
Isn't there something we can use as a weapon?
What the hell is this?
There are drawers!
"Put this sword in Benkei's drawer, and the bow in Rokkaku's."
Heiji, the sword is in Benkei's drawer!
Is it? In that drawer?
Yes !
But how do you know which one is Benkei's?
I've seen this somewhere before...
These lines here, isn't it like the streets of Kyoto?
But yes!
This line represents Karasuma and Yakoyakushi streets!
Wait...
Maybe the drawers have names too?
Names?
That's it!
"Rokkaku" is Rokkaku street.
And Benkei's drawer...
is the Benkei stone?
Sanjo street
East of Sanjô and Fuyachô streets,
Fuyachô street
It's like the song!
Err... Maru, Take, Ebisu and...
Maru, Take, Ebisu and... ah what's next!
Ah, shit!
- I can't remember! - Maru, Take, Ebisu and Oshioike
Yome, San, Rokkaku, Tako, Nishiki
Heiji, "Tako" is two blocks after Sanjô!
Uh yes!
2 above the octopus (tako),
from east to west,
we have Teragoko and Fuyatomi...
Fuyachô is the 3rd!
There!
En garde !
The two sides of this unique blade are identical...
It's one of Muramasa's "cursed swords" !
It's the best sword to kill a monster possessed by Yoshitsune.
What's that?
Go away!
What are you waiting for, follow them!
Yes, sir!
Listen, I'll create a diversion so you can run away!
No, I'm staying with you!
Do as I say!
Heiji!
They're here!
Quick, go!
- You, get the girl! - Yes!
Conan!
Kazuha,
where is Heiji?
There! There!
Hattori!
Damn it...
I can't get a signal to call the police!
That's it!
Turn it off right now!
Yes...
Good, if only someone could see the fire...
Hey, oh, Ran!
You're awake!
Hey, Dad!
Where's Shinichi?
Are you dreaming?
He can't be here!
But why were you sleeping here?
And you, what are you doing here?
We're the ones who told him.
Kazuha was kidnapped by the Genji Botaru...
Mr. Mouri!
Let's end this once and for all!
Fine by me!
You won't get away with this again!
How about this, then?
A short sword?
Not just a short sword...
it's soaked with a poison that takes effect immediately!
How do you know?
I only have to touch you to finish you off.
What a jerk!
Oh no, Heiji, be careful!
You can't escape anymore...
My archers are aiming at you from below!
Do something!
- Conan! - Wait! Wait! Wait!
Hey, over here!
Take this!
Come on, Hattori!
Heiji!
The Benkei who wanted to be Yoshitsune...
If you had been Benkei,
Yoshitsune would have been killed by passing through Ataka.
The master is defeated!
Here!
- Stop them all! - Yes!
Great, Conan!
Yes !
But earlier you called Heiji by his last name!
Sorry, I got carried away...
It's Heiji!
Heiji!
Hello!
This temple...
The riddle is finally solved.
Apparently, the effects of the drug were only temporary...
Anyway, it allowed me to collect some precious data.
How are you doing?
Just fine.
But where is the Buddha statue?
Heiji, Shinichi...
Yes, what is it?
Uh, no, nothing.
So it was a dream...

Sannô Temple (early morning)
I beg your pardon,
in the end I didn't find the Buddha statue.
But no, come on...
It is surely the Buddha who decided so.
Don't worry about it.
Have a good trip!
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
But what are we going to do?
We only have one hour left before the ceremony!
What are you saying, we'll make do with what we've got.
Master Yakushi Nyorai!
You finally came back!
Gyokuryu Temple (at dawn)
She's here, Kudo!
Just as I told you!
Let the temple form the character of "ball"...
and that the small line is the place of the hiding place!
I didn't even think of that.
When you add in the key to the "roof",
Ball > Treasure
it gives the character of "treasure"!
That "roof" was the one!
I see.
Like it was nothing.
Yeah.
They're a pair, those two!
Kind of like Yoshitsune and Benkei.
Huh?
You mean young Hattori and Detective Mouri?
You're a long way from being done learning.
What's up?
Come on, it's your turn, Ayumi.
Thank you, thank you.
You're so cute!
How about I take you with me?
No way.
He's my best friend!
Do you have few human friends?
Well, I'm really sorry I suspected you two.
Don't worry about it.
In fact, I know very well who my father is
and it was I who told him that I didn't need him to send me any more
to send me any more money!
Your father?
Who is my father?
It's a secret!
That damned priest!
Maru, Take, Ebisu and Oshioike
- Yome, San, Rokkaku, Tako, Ni... - It's "Donkey, San", stupid!
But where did you learn this song?
At my family's home in Kyoto.
When I was in 3rd grade, I think...
They taught it to me when we went to see them together.
With me?
Well, don't you remember?
Oh yes, I do.
You couldn't wait for me to finish getting ready
and you told me you were going out to play near Sano temple.
At that time, I was dressed with a kimono.
They did my hair and even put some make-up on me!
Afterwards, I went to look for you at the temple,
but as I couldn't find you, I played ball and went back home.
Frankly, I would have liked you to see that!
With the cherry blossoms, it was really beautiful!
Maru, Take, Ebisu and Oshioike
Yome, San, Rokkaku, Tako, Nishiki
I could finally see it...
What? You saw her?
Did you see your first love, Heiji?
Who is she? That maiko?
If you think I'm going to tell you, you idiot!
Come on, tell me!
We'll see, maybe in 1500 years!
What does that mean?
Conan, what are you doing!
You're covered in sweat!
Shinichi...
Oh, by the way, I called Shinichi!
I asked him to pretend to be Heiji and save Kazuha!
Didn't I?
Ah, yes, but he was really weak!
He left in the middle!
But you told me not to tell anyone...
I see...
So... so it was really Shinichi!
I finally saw him!
If I could finally see you
I wouldn't let go of your hand.
The blooming of the cherry trees announces the end of spring
with its vaporous petals of flowers.
The song of my memories comes back to me,
and still remains sweet in my heart.
Again and again, it is a miracle to be able to see you,
in this city where the wind blows gently.
I promise to remember again
your hand in mine when we walked together.
I can hear your voice carried by the wind,
like a clear and distant memory.
Ignoring the fear of being hurt, I promised
that another day, in the same place,
we would meet again under the red maples,
with a smile on my face, when the season arrives.
Again and again, I am alone in this city where the flowers dance
and I can't go back.
The landscape is the same as that day
and I waited for you, crying softly.
The flower petals fly in the wind
as if they were caressing the surface of the water,
the more I think about it, the more I hurt.
They say everyone is lonely,

but you can't help but look for someone
and we find ourselves pursuing
only ephemeral and fragile things.
Again and again, with you in this city that changes colors,
no need to promise to see each other if we can meet.
I will be by your side at all costs next time,
you that it is easier to hurt than anyone else.
An ice cream, please.
Yes, that will be 300 yen.
In the end, I was the only one who couldn't see the person I wanted to see?
Sonoko, I'm sure one day you'll see Mr. Kyogoku.
Yeah, but you know, I really don't like waiting for people...
You too, right?
Oh, I don't mind.
Because the longer you wait, the more, when you see him...
You look the same... as you did that day.
You're happy, aren't you?
Ah, damn it, if I could only get Shinichi to listen to this...
