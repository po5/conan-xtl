Look! There is a dinosaur!
Is it?
Him then... He always disappears without saying anything.
Here, are you thirsty?
Thank you.
Damn, it's only three minutes!
Wait, Shinichi!
Great, we made it in time.
What's here? It's just an empty space.
Be patient.

What?
The fountains light up every two hours.
You love it, don't you?
Shinichi.
Let's say it's a present to celebrate your victory in the karate championship.
Please accept it.
What's with your arrogant tone?
A rainbow!
Great! Let's toast!
I'll do it.
What a bummer!
If you could see your face!
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE MURDERER IN HER EYES
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug, and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name,
I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
To find out who these thugs are, I live with Ran and his detective father.
Ouch!
Detective Mouri, how did you solve this case?
To be honest, I'm not sure.
No wonder...
Every time..,
I use my hypodermic projectile watch
and my voice modulator bow tie,
to put him to sleep and solve cases with his voice.
Professor Agasa invented these two gadgets.
It is a pleasure!
He also created for me
a skateboard with a turboshaft,
radar glasses,
a pair of super-strength shoes,
and many other unique gadgets.
By the way...
Neither Ran nor his father know who I really am.
In confidence..,
there's Professor Agasa, Heiji Hattori, another high school detective.
But also Ai Haibara, a classmate.
She was an accomplice of the men in black.
But to escape from the organization,
she took the same drug as me,
and became younger after swallowing it.
The mystery still hangs over this organization.
And now,
a wall has been erected between Ran and me
and is trying to separate us!
My body has become younger, but not my mind!
I'll solve all the mysteries!
There's still only one truth!
The fountains?
Yes, and the rainbow was beautiful above.
Oh yes, it was!
Always fixating on trivial things.
We'll have to go back to that Tropical Land.
Right?
We haven't been there since that time.
Of course we haven't!
Since that day, I've become a kid.
So, when are we going?
Well... How to say...
Do you think Conan will be there?
Maybe.
We'll see when we get there.
Sorry Ran, I'm still working on a complicated case.
I'll call you back later. See ya.
Wait, Shinichi!
Damn it! Business, business, more business...
Stupid business!
He certainly won't solve this one!
I would love to see his defeated face.
Conan defeated...
I lost, I bow!
VICTORY
Why are you smiling?
Conan!
Just at the right time!
We were just on our way to your place!
We had a quiz for you!
A quiz?
When we asked Ai what she thought of you, she said:
"When I look at the moon, it's not summer."
Answer 1: she paid you a compliment,
Answer 2: She said something bad about you.
Which one is the right one?
"It's not summer..."
"The moon..."
I got it! That's answer 2!
- Right? - Huh?
How do you know?
We see the summer moon in June, July and August.
With the Chinese readings we have: this is not "A Good Guy".
You are impressive, Conan!
Hell, it's not even funny.

Now tell me why you're smiling?
Will you bow if you are told?
Will you?
Quick, let's cross!
Stop! Don't go!
When the light is flashing, it's like it's red.
Wait wisely until it turns green again.
- Yes. - Yes.
We got scolded.
We deserved it,
he's right.
Now it's my turn to ask you.
What do you think this man does for a living?
School teacher, maybe?
No briefcase then, he's not in business.
A cook of eels?
The answer is policeman.
- A policeman? - A policeman?
When a policeman takes notes,
he opens his notebook horizontally to write inside.
Oh, I see!
You're too good!
Osamu Narasawa (48 years old) Policeman (Assistant Inspector)
You know everything about everything!
Oh, it's green! Let's go !
-Yes! -Yes!
He was shot!
He's the guilty one!
I'll get you!
Conan, look out!
Call an ambulance!
Okay, okay, okay!
Damn it!
He got away!
Hold on, sir!
Who shot you?
Who shot you?
Today at around 2pm at the Beika Park intersection,
police officer Osamu Narasawa was shot several times.
The culprit is still at large.
To find him,
the government is planning to send in reinforcements and the investigation has been handed over to the crime squad.
You have already been questioned, but we still have some questions.
Describe the culprit.
It was a young man.
No, it was a very beautiful young woman.
Not at all, it was a middle-aged man.
And what color was his umbrella?
It was black.
It was green.
I think it was blue...
Did you really see it?
And you, Conan?
His jacket and umbrella were pretty gray but...
I don't know if it was a man or a woman.
However, his umbrella was on his right.
So that means he fired with his left hand.
Our culprit is therefore left-handed.
By the way, detective,
what was the victim holding in his pocket before he died?
We were able to recover his police notebook, which served as a memo.
Its contents are being analyzed,
and will be examined with a fine-tooth comb.
Inspector Megure,
the shells found at the crime scene
indicate that they were fired from a nine-millimeter automatic weapon.
A nine millimeter?
A weapon that could have been used by a woman as well.
Fortunately, no one else was involved.
And neither were you.
Yes.
Damn it!
If only I could have crossed over,
I wouldn't have missed it!
Park House Residence
Yôichiro Shiba Policeman
New murder case!
Extremist act? Gang-related business?
Police Department
Investigation Bureau
Yes, this is Megure...
Ah, is that you Mouri?
I'd like to speak with you about the incident last night.
I'm sorry, but I don't have time right now.
Some other time.
Ah! Hello? Can you hear me, Inspector?
What's up?
He said he was busy.
It's normal, two police officers have been killed.
I know that very well, but how can I say...
He's not his usual self...
Listen to me, Shiratori, what we found out must stay between us.
No one else must know.
I understand.
After investigation and analysis, the results show
that both officers were killed with the same weapon.
Police Station - Chief's Office
According to the investigators, it was one and the same killer.
Toshiro Odagiri (56) - Chief of Police (Chief Superintendent)
Now let's go to the weather.
A high pressure from China has settled on the east of the country...
Beika Sunplaza Hotel
I think Shiratori's sister is tactless.
Who would have a wedding party at a time like this?
15th floor: Wedding meeting Kotaro Haretsuki - Sara Shiratori
It's not her fault, she was planned for a month.
Nobody could have predicted these murders.
Besides, it's not a party, it's a post-wedding meeting.

It is the friends of the bride and groom who organize it.
I know it!
Say, what does Shinrô Haretsuki do?
He is a painter.
One who doesn't seem to sell much.
An artist who doesn't sell...
You have to say goodbye to love with this kind of person.
Kogoro Mouri
You always write so badly.
Mama!
Were you invited too?
Indeed, I'm here because Sara is part of our law firm.
Eri Kisaki
Your writing is beautiful!
I swear, married people signing separately...
Please, please, please.
You have number 87.
Come on, Conan.
Yeah, I'm coming.
Look at all the people!
Oh! The Inspector's here too!
You can spot the policemen at a glance.
Their eyes are cold
and the atmosphere is stifling.
How can you blame them?
It's not a time to celebrate when there's a case in progress.
Officer Sato is still glowing for her part.
How's that? It changes my image, doesn't it?
No, it doesn't!
You look great!
Ah, that's Odagiri. I'll say hello to him and be right back.
Who is it?
The chief superintendent.
He was police chief
when your father was still a cop.
He is the head of the department now.
Sorry for the wait, the bride and groom will make their entrance.
A round of applause for them!
They are too beautiful!
Kotaro, Sara, congratulations to both of you!
Mr. Mouri?
Good evening and congratulations to your sister.
Thank you very much.
Let me introduce you.
This is my doctor, Dr Kazato
who also works in psychiatry at the Beika-Yakushino hospital.
Kyosuke Kazato (36) Psychiatrist at Beika-Yakushino Hospital
Nice to meet you.
I am Mouri.
This is my wife Eri and my daughter Ran.
And this little parasite is Conan.
Stop calling me a parasite.
Are you seeing a psychiatrist, Shiratori?
Well, let's just say that work brings its own set of worries.
Besides..,
I think you should see one too, Mr. Mouri.
You're right, sometimes I do lose my memory...
Right? What do you mean by that?
Stop laughing!
Ouch!
Excuse me a moment.
Inspector!
Oh, it's you, Mouri.
How's the investigation going?
Sorry, but not now.
Why won't he talk to me?
He has something he doesn't want you to know.
What is it, Takagi? Is that true, Takagi?
I don't know!
Say, you have feelings for Officer Sato, don't you?
How interesting!
How about I go see her and tell her?
No wait, don't!
It's understood!
It wasn't made public but,
Officer Shiba was also found dead holding his notebook.
What?
What?
That means...
You don't need to know anything more, Mr. Mouri.
Need not to know.
You understand, don't you?
Need not to know...
Something not to know.
Impossible!
Need not to know...
It's a code used among policemen.
So the culprit in this case would have a link with the police?
And not only a connection, but could be part of it.
In other words, the whole community might be suspected!
Didn't he say anything specific when he applied?
No, that's not really his forte.
A man has to be able to do it, in my opinion.
There are so few of them left who are capable of saying those mushy things.
I always wanted to know...
What did daddy say when he proposed?
Like I said, mushy nonsense.
Tell us everything, please!
I don't remember much of it.
Don't try to act like you have amnesia!
I could use an example!
Come on mom, tell us!
"I love you more than anyone else on this earth."
Something like that!
Really?
That's beautiful!
If Shinichi said the same things to me...
Don't make the face of one who thinks that!
I wasn't making that face!
What's wrong, Ran?
You're all red!
Nothing, everything's fine.
What are you doing here, Toshiya?
You can't be here!
You're not allowed to be at this party either!
Toshiya Odagiri - Rock singer
You weren't invited!

Shut up a little!
I was in that hotel for work!
This is his son, Toshiya.
I think he's in a rock band.
Don't get carried away, it's not a big deal.
Enjoy the party, Toshiya.
Get out of here!
And stop begging like a dog!
What?
Toshiya!
I'm leaving!
Toshiya?
What's this? I think I've seen his face somewhere before.
Sato?
About that...
I can manage.
But I...
Don't worry about it.
What the hell!
Number 38, please.
Okay, then.
Ah, Ran!
Officer Sato!
This is a strange party, isn't it? It's all cops.
Indeed, and by the way, be on the lookout too.
Right?
Policemen are getting killed one after another.
Don't worry!
I'm pretty tough!
Oh?
A cut?
What happened?
That's strange.
Don't move, I'll go look.
Officer Sato, there's a lamp here.
What's up?
Look!
No, Ran!
Officer Sato!
Officer?
Hold on, Officer Sato!
That's because...
Because I took the lamp.
No !
Ran!
Ms. Sato!
Can you hear me Ran? Are you alright?
She just passed out.
The one who's hurt is...
Sato! Sato! Please, hold on!
Damn it !
Megure, call an ambulance!
Shiratori, seal off all the exits!
Yes, sir!
I'm calling from the 15th floor of the Beika Sunplaza Hotel.
A woman is hurt, send an ambulance!
The magazine is out...
Nine millimeter automatic.
It's the same guy.
But, uh...
Why a lamp?
Hurry up!
Block all the exits!
Leave the children aside and give them the gunpowder residue test!
Everyone will pass, including me!
That goes for this jerk, too!
Was he still here?
However, I don't see these two.
Beika-Yakushino Hospital
Operation in progress
Inspector Megure, how is Ms. Sato?
One of the bullets is lodged next to her heart.
She has only a 50-50 chance of recovery.
Detective, how is Ran?
Luckily she wasn't hurt..,
but she's still unconscious.
She's in the back room.
Ran will be fine.
I'm curious about that lamp, though...
Could it be...
How's the investigation going, Shiratori?
Everyone's been tested..,
...but nothing came of it.
Nothing?
We think the culprit got away before the exits were closed.
What about the prints on the gun?
Nothing on that side either.
Do we know how the power outage occurred?
Yes, a phone would have activated a bomb that blew up the electrical panel.
Officer Chiba Investigation Bureau
One thing puzzles me.
Did the lamp we found in the bathroom belong to Ms. Sato?
I don't think so.
There was an open cupboard under the sinks.
I think it was there...
already lit.
What? So the perp put it there?
I see.
With the light on, no one would have noticed it.
This proves with almost certainty, the link with the said case.
What case?
No, nothing...
Why don't you tell me?
One wrong move and Ran could have been shot!
Please, Inspector!
Hurry up, there's a problem!
What's wrong?
Ran's regained consciousness, but she's acting strange!
What's wrong?
Ran!
Are you okay, Ran?
Kid... who are you?
What the...
Not only does she not remember us..,
but she doesn't even know who she is.
That can't be!
I'm your father, Kogoro Mouri!
And this is your mother,
Eri Kisaki!
I don't know you.
I don't remember anything.
Ran.
Dr. Kazato,
I'm sorry to bother you so late..,
but no other psychiatrists were available.
Do you know who you are?
Do you remember what happened today?
No.
What is the capital of the United States?
Washington, D.C.
What is 5x8?
40.
Can you get the lead out of this pen?
Meeting room 4
Retrograde amnesia?
Yes.

It is a loss of memory triggered by an emotional shock or a serious injury
that affects memories prior to that event.
In her case, I think she suffered a psychological shock
after seeing Officer Sato shot.
Will her memories come back?
I can't say for sure at this point.
However, the things that are essential to her daily life have not been affected.
So she can continue to live normally?
Yes, she can.
But for the moment,
we will keep her under observation for a few days.
It is normal that she is shocked after seeing someone being shot...
But, there must be something else that made her lose her memory!
Something that devastated her even more...
Ms. Sato's surgery is over.
They managed to remove the bullet,
but she's not out of the woods yet.
I see.
Inspector!
With all this, you still refuse to talk to me?
You know that, Shiratori! Just tell me!
We'll do everything we can to catch the culprit.
Damn it!
Officer Chiba?
Were you able to identify the fingerprints on the lamp?
Yes, but we only found Ran's.
We thought Ms. Sato had taken it..,
but it was obviously Ran.
In that case, I'm sure Ran...
must have thought it was her fault that Officer Sato got hurt.
That would be the reason for her shock!
And the cause of his amnesia!
Ran...
Ran...
Even if your memories never come back..,
I'll always be...
Your friend, you hear me...
I'll tell you everything.
But Detective Megure...
If we get fired, we'll open a detective agency like Mouri.
Detective.
Takagi, you stay with Sato.
And you Chiba, look after Ran.
If there's any trouble, report it right away.
-Yes! -Yes!
Last summer, a surgeon from Tohto University Hospital,
Tamatsu Jinno, was found dead in his residential apartment.
Tamatsu Jinnô (35 years old) Surgeon at the university hospital of Tohto
On this case,
Inspector Tomonari
there was Inspector Tomonari, a senior officer of the investigation bureau.
Under him were Narasaki and Shiba, the two murdered policemen.
Policeman Narasawaki
Police Officer Shiba
Officer Sato
But also Sato.
After drinking heavily,
he cut his right carotid artery with his surgical scalpel.
He bled to death.
He was discovered
by his sister, Ms. Tamaki, a reporter who lives in the neighboring town.
Tamaki Jinnô (27 years old) - Tamatsu's sister, a reporter
Look at this woman!
She was at the party!
It's coming back to me now! She's already come to see me about a case!
Did she come to the agency?
What did she ask you?
Well... Well, I... I was a little drunk at the time,
I don't remember what she was talking about.
I remember the case of this Jinnô.
A few days before he died,
he was accused of medical malpractice by the family of a patient, right?
Yes, he was.
Since he had left a letter of apology on his computer,
Detective Tomonari concluded that it was suicide.
However
his sister Miss Tamaki rejected this idea.
She said that her brother was a terrible doctor who did not care about his patients
so he would never have killed himself because of a simple surgical mistake.
And about a week before the event,
he was seen arguing with a man with purple hair outside a warehouse.
Purple hair?
To verify this, Detective Tomonari accompanied by Sato, Narasawa and Shiba went there.
It was very hot that day.
The temperature was over 35°C.
It's locked.
We'll stand guard. Shiba, go to the other side.
Yes.
It's hot.
Inspector, what's wrong?
It's a heart attack! We have to call an ambulance!
Yes, we will!
Don't call!
Don't what?
We are in the middle of a surveillance!
But!
It's alright...
I'll take a cab and go to the hospital.

You, continue the surveillance!
But Sato was worried, so she followed him soon after.
Detective Tomonari!
She immediately took him
to Tohto University Hospital. Tohto University Hospital
However, on the operating table,
the inspector took his last breath.
Miss Sato is slow to return.
Ah, here they are!
Damn it! What a stifling heat!
Let's go !
Wait a minute! Don't you know who this guy is?
That's Toshiya, A the son of Superintendent Odagiri!
In the end, because of the inspector's untimely death,
Tamatsu Jinno's case was classified as a suicide
and the investigation was suspended.
Chiba told Miss Tamaki that they had investigated the young man,
but that they hadn't found anything that connected him to this case.
I didn't know anything about it.
Besides, Detective Tomonari had a son,
a man named Makoto.
Oh, that man was at the party too!
Wasn't he?
He left quickly, though.
Could he be involved?
He might be. At the wake...
Why didn't you call an ambulance?
If you had, maybe my father could have been saved!
But I... The inspector has...
You are responsible for his death!
I'll never forgive you!
Here, Conan.
Thank you, sir.
Shortly after that,
Narasawa and Shiba were transferred to another department.
Also, Shiratori noticed recently...
that Sato was spending time outside of work investigating something.
Narasawa had asked Shiba and Sato
to revisit, the three of them, the investigation that had been suspended a year earlier.
- What was it? - What?
Only, Miss Sato doesn't seem to have discovered any connection
between Toshiya and Jinno's death.
A short time later,
Narasawa was murdered.
Then, it was Shiba's turn.
So we are convinced
that their death is linked to the case of a year ago.
Thanks to the notebooks,
we have deduced that the culprit is connected to the police.
Takagi investigated Makoto, Detective Tomonari's son.
and I investigated Toshiya, the son of the superintendent.
I thought that the culprit would certainly go after Sato next.
I proposed to assign a bodyguard to him,
but she refused.
Is that why you called her to the party?
Yes, I did.
I understand, Inspector!
Toshiya Odagiri is the culprit!
He went ahead knowing that Narasawa, Shiba and Sato were taking over the Jinnô case!
However, it was not him who shot Sato.
He didn't have any gunpowder residue on him.
Oh, I see.
And then there's Makoto Tomonari.
We don't know where he is now.
He was seen around on the days Narasawa and Shiba were killed.
And today we learn that he was at the party...
But we know that the culprit is left-handed.
Now that I think about it, Makoto's left handed too!
Alright, fine! Put out an APB!
Yes !
Say, Inspector, how was the cut on Jinno's carotid artery?
What was it like?
It was a clean cut from top to bottom on the right side.
So, if it was a murder,
the culprit would certainly be left-handed.
Right?
How do you know that?
Because...
In order not to get splashed with blood,
he must have used his left hand to sever the carotid artery.
Isn't that right, Conan?
Yes.
I see.
But there's nothing to link Makoto to the Jinno case.
If Jinno was really killed, it must have been another left-handed man.
Toshiya is left-handed too.
He struck his match with this hand.
There is another one. His father, superintendent Ôdagiri.
He is also left-handed.
Ridiculous! He can't be the culprit!
Inspector...
Beika-Yakushino Hospital
I am Ayumi Yoshida.
This is Genta Kojima, Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya and Ai Haibara.
We are Conan's friends and we are here because we were worried about you.
That's very nice of you.

I'm sorry, but I don't remember any of you.
Oh no, it's not possible!
You played with us a lot!
Do you remember me? I'm Hiroshi Agasa.
I'm the genius scientist who lives next door to your friend Shinichi Kudo.
Shinichi... Kudo...?
Do you remember Shinichi?
No, I don't.
I see...
What's wrong, Haibara?
I felt like I was being watched.
I must have been dreaming.
Sorry, I'm a little tired.
Don't worry and have a rest.
Who is it?
Shit!
What's wrong, Conan?
Maybe Ran saw the culprit's face when Officer Sato was shot!
What's the matter?
If so, he might be after his life.
We've been waiting for you.
Don't worry, Takagi and Chiba will take turns standing guard.
What about her?
She's with a friend.
Great, let's go!
Mrs. Kisaki?
Yes ?
Dr. Kazato would like to talk to you about your daughter.
The MRI didn't show any brain damage.
As I suspected, amnesia is the mechanism her mind chose to protect itself.
You think if you take her back to that hotel and replay the scene,
she'll get her memories back?
What are you talking about?
Let's not force her to remember something she wants to forget.
Then what? You want to leave her like this?
I'm just saying I'm against making her suffer.
Calm down, come on.
Forcing her to remember could affect her brain condition.
You see?
Excuse me.
Hello? This is Dr. Kazato.
Okay, I'll call him.
If Ran saw the culprit's face..,
...she must regain her memory and be arrested quickly!
But like the doctor said..,
forcing her to remember might affect her...
In that case, I will do everything to protect her!
There's no answer.
Please excuse me.
Is there any way to bring her memory back gently?
Most of the time, the memory comes back when the patient is completely relaxed.
Okay.
When Ran gets out, I'll come live at the agency.
You'll what?
That way I can take care of her...
...and it'll give her a chance to relax.
You're kidding, right? It's my stress that's going up!
I don't give a damn about you,
This is for Ran's own good. Do you understand me?
This doesn't look good!
Two days later.
Don't force yourself to remember too much, Ran.
Okay?
Yes.
If his memory comes back, don't hesitate to contact me.
I will.
We've lived here since you were born..,
so it's been 17 years now.
Do you remember this?
This is where you live.
Mouri Detective Agency?
Come on, I'll take you in.
What's the matter, Ran?
The sight of a puddle frightens him.
There was a puddle when Officer Sato was shot, too.
Can you move forward a little?
Yes, I can.
The agency is on the second floor.
I solve dozens of cases in this office.
All you do there is drink beers and watch TV!
On the second floor, we have the living room and the kitchen.
And over there is your room.
This is Shinichi Kudo.
He is a good-for-nothing who plays the manipulator with you!
Who are you calling manipulative?
You do a lot of karate, you know?
I do karate?
You even won the inter-school championship, remember?
No.
I see.
But don't worry,
I'll remember everything soon!
You're right!
Let's celebrate your release from the hospital with a nice meal!
How about I cook something for you? It's been a while, hasn't it?
What is it with you two?
Your cooking?
Oh, I'll be fine...
I'm not very hungry actually...
Come on, you don't have to hold back, Conan.
I'll cook my beef stew, you'll tell me about it!
It's the worst of them all!
May I ask where you are going, dear?
I completely forgot about the mahjong game I promised the neighbors tonight!
Do you think this is the time to play when your daughter is not well?
Or are you saying that you don't want to eat my food?
Do you?

I am reassured, she is doing better than I thought.
Everything will be fine then!
Ran.
My bodyguards?
Officer Takagi said the culprit might be after you.
We, the Junior Detectives, have decided to protect you!
We'll call ourselves,
Ran's protectors!
Ran's protectors!
Oh dear...
I got a sting gun!
I got my boomerang!
And I got handcuffs!
Do you really think these toys are enough?
It's very nice, I feel more reassured.
Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream to thank you.
-Yes! -Yes!
That's great!
She still doesn't remember anything?
No.
It would be better for you if she stayed amnesiac, right?
You wouldn't have to worry about her finding out your identity after all.
What are you saying?
If only... I could, forget everything too.
Forget about my sister's death, the organization, the drugs I made...
It would be so nice to forget everyone
and just be Haibara, a simple schoolgirl.
And then,
I'd be with you...
With you forever.
Haibara, you...
I'm just kidding!
Feeling better?
Hi, kids!
Is this your new girlfriend?
Just another party pooper!
Look, these are the photos from the karate tournament you won.
Remember?
No.
That boy...
He is Shinichi Kudo, your boyfriend!
I'm not her boyfriend!
You seem to remember!
- Don't I? - Don't I?
Is that true, Ran?
No.
But...
But what?
I feel a strange nostalgia.
But I don't know what's causing it.
If you saw this Shinichi, could you remember?
Yes, let's go find him!
If it were that easy, we would have done it already!
He's a high school detective who solves cases all over the country, right?
I swear, where is he
when Ran's in this state?
Makoto Tomonari (25 years old)
Yes ?
The bathroom is free.
Thank you for your help.
Do you know what kind of person Shinichi Kudo is, Conan?
What kind of person?
I think he cares for you a lot,
but he finds it hard to express it properly.
I would love to meet him.
How about going to Ginza tomorrow, Ran?
How about that?
Your father's driving me crazy.
Let's go shopping to take our minds off things.
You can come too.
Yes.
Are you all right?
Miss Sato! Miss Sato! Please hold on!
I'm fine, thanks.
I...
Damn it!
There he is.
Ran!
Ran!
Beika-Yakushino Hospital
Ran!
Shh. She's just been sedated.
Is she alright?
Just a few scratches, fortunately.
However, because of that accident,
I'm afraid she'll be afraid of regaining her memories.
Takagi! Weren't you watching her?
I'm sorry about that!
However, we're sure of it now.
Ran saw the culprit's face when he shot Sato.
We're going to do everything we can to protect her, right?
Yes !
Protecting her isn't enough.
It's up to us to find him!
Beika Sunplaza Hotel
the other day, none of the people present in the hotel
had any gunshot residue on them.
Is it really impossible
to fire a shot without leaving gunshot residue?
Wait a minute!
If I remember correctly...
The umbrella was buttoned up.
After the incident...
It was loose and the umbrella was on the other side.
And then, when Ran was released from the hospital...
Could it be that...
What? That was your umbrella?
Do you know where it is?
I'm sorry, it had a hole in it, so I threw it away.
Didn't you?
Of course, after all this time...
Oh?
I was just kidding, we got it back fine.
Good joke.
Thank you.
I knew it!
I found it!
How to fire a shot without leaving any residue!
Thanks to this, Mr. Makoto and Miss Tamaki aren't the only suspects,
There's also Toshiya... No, actually, all the party guests are suspects!
This is it.
I see!
If Miss Tamaki was at the party,

is because she was following Toshiya!
You there! Why are you following me everywhere I go?
Do you want to know?
Know what?
I'll find evidence linking you to the murder instead of those two murdered cops!
Was that a trick?
You are Miss Tamaki, the sister of Tamatsu Jinnô, right?
A year ago, your brother had an argument with Toshiya Idagiri,
but the latter was not questioned because he was the son of the superintendent.
Who are you, kid?
My name is Conan Edogawa. I'm a detective.
A detective?
If you really cared about your brother,
then you must have cursed the three policemen
who ruled it a suicide.
I hated my brother.
I'm only investigating to find out the truth.
Let's play for all we've got then and infiltrate enemy territory.
What's that?
Superintendent Ôdagiri's house
He's testing the edge of the sword.
Impressive!
You are Tamaki Jinnô, aren't you?
I have something to give you.
To me?
I found it a month ago, in Toshiya's room.
T. Jinnô.
My brother's?
Yes, it is.
I remembered that was the name of the last case
Tomonari was working on before he died of a heart attack.
I asked Toshiya about it
and he confessed to blackmailing Tamatsu for money after discovering
his black market in drugs.
However, none of this was in the investigation report.
So I ordered Narasawa to take over the case.
It was you who asked for the investigation to be reviewed?
At present, Inspector Megure is in charge of the case.
If Narasawa had decided to review the case on his own,
he might have stopped you from helping your son.
So I would have had a motive for the murders of those policemen, too.
If you want to find out the truth, show me the investigation reports.
I can't do that!
It's the job of the investigators to bring the truth to light.
Beika-Yakushino Hospital - Relaxation Room
I'm glad you're okay.
Thank you, besides the doctor said
I can be discharged from the hospital.
Tell me, Sonoko...
Come on, you can call me by my first name!
What kind of a child is Conan?
What kind of child is he?
He risked his life to save me, so I was wondering.
Well, compared to kids his age,
I'd say he's strangely perceptive and has good intuition.
Anyway, to me he's still just a cheeky kid.
I see.
What?
This year, Tropical Land
has opened two new attractions
to the delight of all visitors.
I know this place.
Tropical Land?
Yes, you went there with Shinichi!
Psychiatric examination room
I see.
Her memories are starting to come back.
Do you think that if she goes to Tropical Land, she will get her memory back?
There is a possibility indeed.
I'd like to try to go tomorrow.
What?
Wait, I'm against this idea.
You're in danger of being targeted by the killer again.
and if you remember the incident, you'll suffer again.
To be honest, I am very afraid to remember,
but, I can't stay like this.
I have to take a step forward.
Ran.
You're really brave, Ran.
Determined as you are, I think we can let you go.
In that case, let's go the day after tomorrow.
I have an appointment tomorrow that...
Don't worry, I'll go with her!
I will protect her with my life!
Kogoro.
I'm coming too, Ran!
Thanks, but don't tell Conan, okay?
If we tell him, I'm sure he'll want to come.
But I don't want him to be in danger again.
I'll do it.
It's awfully late.
Yes.
If you want to see the investigation reports, I can get you a copy.
You can?
I am a reporter after all.
They're at my place, you'll get them tomorrow.
Alright!
I'll go there!
He left unsuspecting.
Let's go too.
Great! She's coming out!

It's a good thing we've been on the lookout since this morning!
Conan doesn't seem to have been informed.
That's okay, he's usually the first one.
Don't do anything dangerous, you understand?
Follow that car!
Did you find anything, Mr. Detective?
The notebook that Officer Shiba was holding...
What about his notebook?
If he took it out of his pocket..,
it should have been the other way around, right?
If we take it like this and take it out...
You're right.
Maybe it wasn't Shiba who took it out of his pocket,
but the culprit himself.
Oh, I see.
It's possible, indeed.
What do you think?
I'll find out!
Aren't you right-handed, Miss Tamaki?
Aren't you? I was originally left-handed, but I forced myself to use the other hand.
When I'm thinking and smoking, for example..,
I sometimes use my left hand unconsciously.
Unconsciously?
Now that I think about it...
Wait a minute! So that was...
No !
So that's what he meant!
Didn't your brother work at the university hospital in Tohto?
Yes, but excuse me Conan, I have an errand to run.
Let's do it again, shall we?
Until next time, Conan.
Tropical Land.
You got it.
I remember this place.
If I remember correctly, when you and Shinichi came here...
you solved the mystery of the roller coaster murder.
Let's go for a ride!
You might remember something else!
Let's see... The mystery ride
is next to the Island of Strange and Dreams.
Get on in front of it.
Do you get it?
Conan Doyle probably meant this.
What?
Nothing.
Ah, that's them there!
I wanted to do it too.
What are you talking about?
We're here to stand guard and watch out for anyone suspicious!
Let's go !
Let's go!
Gee, I thought Mouri was afraid of heights...
Oh no!
Time out!
Hey, are you okay?
Ran, would you like a Coke?
I'd love one.
Tropi balloons!
Seriously, what idiot came up with this stuff?
Here, are you thirsty?
Here's your Coke.
Thank you, sir.
Is that you, Shinichi Kudo?
But I still can't remember you.
Excuse me, Mr. Mouri, but I have to go to the bathroom.
Great!
Thank you, sir.
The balloons are flying!
Watch out, Ran!
Come back!
Be careful, there are people around!
You won't get away!
Oops!
Stinging water gun!
Take this!
You're Makoto Tomonari!
What's this?
A knife?
Makoto Tomonari, you're under arrest for attempted murder!
- That's just great! - Great!
Total Victory
Ran's protectors
For Ran's protectors!
I'll take him back to the station.
Wait, I'll come with you.
- We did it! - We did it!
You're safe now, and without me around..,
you'll remember Shinichi more easily.
Pa...
Don't worry, you'll call me dad when your memory comes back.
Thanks to the Junior Detectives, you did a great job!
He said we did a great job.
This is coming from a great detective.
He congratulated us!
We can go have fun now!
I want to see the parade!
We can stay until evening, right?
Of course we can.
Ran and Shinichi stayed until evening too.
- Great! - That's great!
Is it really over?
Let's go to the demon lab and have some fun!
Tohto University Hospital
What, you little one?
Are you the student of the famous detective, Kogoro Mouri?
Yes.
Will you ask him for an autograph for me?
For me too!
I'll do it.
I can give you as many as you want.
Doctor Jinnô? He was a bad doctor in my opinion.
It's true, he was only after money and he was also incompetent.
It was serious, he accumulated medical errors.
The one about the patient who was brought here because of a heart attack, remember?
He had cut the arm of the surgeon who was operating with him.
Yes, right!

Because of this, the patient could not be saved!
Could you tell me more?
I knew it!
I have to warn Uncle!
This is the Mouri Detective Agency.
The great detective Kogoro Mouri is currently on an investiga...
Damn it!
Kisaki Law Office, go ahead.
It's Conan.
Oh, what do you want?
Kisaki Law Office
Is Eri there?
If you're looking for her, she went to Tropical Land after her trial.
Midori Kuriyama Secretary
Tropical Land?
Ran is apparently there.
Oh no!
Police Department
Are you ready to talk?
A man contacted me and wanted to inform me of the real cause of my father's death.
So I went to the Beika intersection.
But the man never showed up
and nearby, policeman Narasawa was shot.
When I returned home, I received another call from him.
This time, he told me to meet him in front of the Maison-Parc residence.
But as I expected, he didn't come.
And in the underground parking lot,
I discovered the lifeless body of policeman Shiba.
I understood then!
The culprit had tricked me!
I slept in the hotel that night.
When I checked my answering machine the next day,
there was a message from officer Sato,
who wanted me to go to the Beika Sunplaza hotel.
She added
that if I didn't go, I would be apprehended.
But when I got there, there were so many police officers
that I left the party and ran away.
But in that hotel, officer Sato has...
Why didn't you call the police right away?
I didn't trust them after what happened to my father!
So I hung around the great detective Mouri and asked him to help me.
So it wasn't Ran you were trying to approach in Tropical Land?
No, I wanted to talk to Mr. Mouri.
Just a second! What about the knife?
I was defending myself. Whoever did it might have been after my life.
So that means...
That means that the culprit is still out there!
And he might have an accomplice!
Ran's in danger!
Blizzard's Daedalus
But yes, from up there...
Is the observation deck open?
Of course, everyone's watching the parade.
Thanks a lot!
Welcome to the maze of the blizzard.
Where are you, Ran?
Are Genta and the others here?
Then Ran can't be far...
That's him!
Ran!
That's right, I've got the detectives' badge!
Genta, Mitsuhiko, Ayumi!
If you can hear me, please respond!
I can hear you, Conan.
Guess where we are?
Surprise, we're in Tropical Land!
Hey ho, calm down and listen to me carefully!
The culprit has a gun pointed at Ran!
- What?! What?! - What?! What?! What?!
Tell Ran to blend in with the crowd and get out of Tropical Land!
Can you hear me?
Ran, get out of there now!
You're being targeted!
Watch out!
Professor!
Because of me, the people around me...
Don't wander off, Ran,
That's what the culprit wants you to...
Right? Ran! Ran!
Damn it!
Ran's on the island of dreams and fairy tales next door!
And to get there...
Next people.
Hey, kid!
Over there!
Conan?
It's okay now, Ran.
Let's join the crowd and get out of here.
That way!
Damn it! So he doesn't care about the others, as long as he can kill Ran!
Help, we're being followed by a shady guy!
Jump in the boat!
Hey, you!
Conan, where did you learn to sail a boat?
My father taught me in Hawaii.
Huh?
That's far enough, don't you think?
No.
Coke!
Coke?
20 h 40.
Conan!
The waterfall!
Hang on!
Hurry up!
One more effort, we're almost there!
Damn it! He's already caught up with us!
Once we're up, we'll hide in the rocks!
Hurry up!
Conan?
It's closed to the public here at night, so you can show yourself.
You're the careful type.
But, there's no need to hide anymore.
I understood the real meaning of Officer Narasawa's message.
What he meant before he died,

it wasn't his cop's notebook, but his heart.
Cardiology
The word "heart" is found in the term "cardiology".
Isn't that right, Dr. Kyôsuke Kazato?
How long have you known it's me?
It struck me the first time, when I remembered your call.
Right-handed people don't type in numbers with their left hand.
So you were actually left-handed.
I see, I was careless.
Seven years ago, at Tohto University Hospital,
you were working with the worst surgeon.
And then one day,
during a joint operation, Jinno made a mistake
and cut your left wrist with his scalpel.
The accident made you lose your left hand
which was your talent as a surgeon.
Although very proud,
you gave up surgery for psychiatry.
Your pride drove you to become exclusively right-handed.
Exactly.
I never imagined that I would be found out by dialing a simple number.
Something happened a year ago, between you and Jinnô
when you had joined the psychiatry at the Beika-Yakushino hospital.
I came across him by chance.
He invited me to his house for a drink.
Drunk, I asked him to answer the question that had been gnawing at me for six years.
Was this accident
was it really an accident?
You are so naive.
So he had done it on purpose.
I felt like killing myself right then and there.
He was just
under investigation for medical malpractice.
That was reason enough to kill himself.
As I imagined, the case was dismissed as a suicide.
But, you must have heard that it was going to be reviewed.
Narasawa, who was transferred to the Beika station, told me this.
He came for consultation because of an emotional shock
caused by the death of Inspector Tomonari.
During our sessions, I also learned that Makoto Tomonari had a grudge against the police.
So you went ahead and shot the three policemen who were taking over the investigation.
And to frame Makoto for the crime, you sent him to the crime scenes.
Precisely.
For Narasawa and Shiba, I contacted him myself.
For Officer Sato...
You fabricated a message from
from the recordings of one of your patients' sessions.
That's right.
It was Shiratori who told you that Narasawa was found clutching his notebook.
I'm her doctor, after all.
So to throw suspicion on Makoto, Detective Tomonari's son,
you made sure that officer Shiba was found with his notebook in his hand.
Good thinking, Conan.
But there's nothing to prove my guilt.
When Officer Sato was shot,
no gunpowder was found on me.
If you must know, I figured out your little trick.
What?
I'll tell you everything after you're arrested.
That way!
He'll be waiting for us at this exit!
Island of adventure and discovery
This place...
This is the main island of the area.
We came here by passing under this sea.
Did we?
Let's go !
We didn't finish our discussion.
Damn it! He must have followed us by boat!
I'm really annoyed if you discovered my little trick.
Because that would make me a suspect in the case
Officer Sato's case.
Even if Ran testified against you..,
you'd be exonerated because of the negative test, right?
That's right.
Ran only saw me for a brief moment after all.
But it's better to be careful to avoid any problems.
So go ahead, I'm listening. Let's see if you're right or not.
Of course I did.
First of all,
after you blew up the 15th floor,
you put on your gloves
and took an umbrella left behind before going to the bathroom.
You held it open in front of you
and pulled it through the hole in the middle.
The umbrella therefore protected you from gunshot residue.
That is why no gunshot residue was found on you.

And your gloves, you must have thrown them in the men's room.
Right on, Conan.
I'm really going to have to kill you too.
Conan?
Tell me, why?
Why are you so protective of me?
Why?
Because I love you!
It's because I love you
more than anyone else
on this earth.
Jump!
Take a deep breath!
Quickly!
Thank you.
Little man.
Damn it!
Science and Astronomy Island
In 46 seconds.
There he is!
Let's get this over with once and for all, Conan.
After all, none of you
have anywhere to go anymore.
Conan!
It's okay, she just scratched my arm.
I told you, you can't run away now.
If you kill Ran here, you'll bring evidence of Makoto's innocence, right?
That's right,
...I'd like to get it over with before he gets arrested, but never mind.
Well, ladies first then.
Right?

No, Ran!
Officer Sato!
Here, are you thirsty?

- If Shinichi said the same things to me... - I don't remember much.
- University Hospital... - What's wrong, Ran?
Get away from me!
The jets are falling and this is the end!
Why don't you just give up?
What kind of childish trickery is that?
That way!
Die!
Take that!
Conan.
Ran?
Did she...
Damn it! I'll get rid of you first!
I can't do that!
I remember everything!
I know you shot Officer Sato,
and I also know I won the karate tournament!
Won... the karate tournament?
So strong!
Ran!
Mom, dad.
You've...
You've got your memory back!
So you remember me too?
Of course, you're Sonoko Suzuki, my friend for life.
Ran...
Ran! I'm so glad!
So he was the culprit.
Superintendent Odagiri told us that the re-examination order came from him.
It's not fair that you got him alone, Conan!
What are you saying? Conan didn't want anything to happen to you!
That's what bothers me!
We're all Junior Detectives here!
I'm sorry about that.
You're bleeding, Conan.
There you go.
All's well that ends well, this time.
Yes.
Good work, Mr. Detective.
What are you doing here, Miss Tamaki?
I came to check on Toshiya, who was doing a live one here.
It turned out to be useless after all.
Weren't you the one who said you'd protect Ran at the risk of your life?
It was Conan and the Professor who risked their lives to protect her.
Ah... Well...
She's safe, that's the main thing!
Are you sure?
Yes.
Listen everyone, Ms. Sato has regained consciousness!
There's nothing to worry about!
Really?
Ms. Sato!
We did it, Takagi!
That's great!
The case is closed now.
Not so fast!
There's still the matter of Toshiya's blackmail.
The victim may be dead,
but make sure you get a statement from him.
I will.
You were probably the first to bring this case to light.
Who the hell are you?
Something not to know.
Need not to know.
I'm just a schoolboy.
If only all the darkness in this world would disappear
we could love each other without having to change our appearance.
Why does time separate people?
Say, stand by me at least for this moment.
I am stronger when you are with me.
The ring of our engagement shines beautifully.
You will make even the smallest of my dreams come true.
You are the one who fills my heart.
I am stronger when you are with me.
The ring of our engagement shines beautifully.
You will fulfill even the smallest of my dreams.
You are the one who will make them come true one day.
Thank you, Conan.
You said that to get my memory back, right?
Didn't you?
You listened to us at the hotel.
What my father said when he proposed to my mother.
"I love you more than anyone else on this earth."
You said the exact same thing.
What? Your father too?
Am I wrong?
Ah... Well... No, you're right.
I thought so.

After all, we have too big an age difference.
But, it made me very happy. Good night.
Good night.
Whatever.
Wait! Does that mean...
I said the same thing as that old geezer?
