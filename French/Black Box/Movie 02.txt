Mommy!
Don't come any closer, Ran!
A nightmare?
What was it? You dreamt I was shot?
Is that why you called me in the morning?
It's because I'm worried!
Sometimes people are mad at lawyers...
You worry too much, Ran.
You've been to too many cases...
That's why you're having these nightmares.
But I'm glad you're okay!
Besides, in my nightmare...
you looked a little younger!
Oh, come on! I am still young, thank you.
Yes, yes. My apologies!
As long as you understand!
Well, see you at 7:00!
Daddy and Conan are looking forward to it!
Could it be that she remembers?
Conan!
Why are you up so early?
Oh, no reason.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
It's true, we're having dinner with her mother tonight.
I have a little trouble with this woman...
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE 14TH TARGET
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug, and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name, I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
To find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
Yes, this man is Ran's father...
And he's now known as the great detective Kogoro Mouri.
But in reality, he's a real lout...
We all know who really solved those cases, right?
My secret? Two inventions by Professor Agasa.
The first...
is this.
The hypodermic projectile watch!
We raise the sighting device...
and a button fires a tranquilizer dart.
It allows me to put my target to sleep instantly.
Next...
The voice modulator bowtie!
By turning the dial on the back
I can imitate all kinds of voices, children or adults.
I have other secret weapons!
The hyper-strengthening shoes!
An electromagnetic discharge stimulates the muscles of my feet,
increasing my physical strength to the extreme!
For chasing criminals,
I've got my turbo skateboard.
The last one is more useful than it sounds: the elastic straps!
Pressing a button makes them retract.
It's a really unique invention!
I have not yet discovered the identity of the men in black...
but investigations don't wait!
My body has grown younger, but not my mind! I will solve all the mysteries!
There is still only one truth!

Kogoro Mouri
Huh? Are you going to eat that too, Genta?
So what? I'll eat as much as I want!
It's dark chocolate, the flavor of adults!
Huh? Is it?
Nonsense.
It takes a long time...
Look at that! Me and Conan are super compatible!
Your game must be broken!
That's not the point, Genta!
Divination by cards is a lot of hooey anyway!
I'm going to read Conan's future! His birth date...
- May 4... - Hey, I didn't give you permission to read my fortune.
Your soul mate will be closer!
It's probably about me and Conan!
"A's hunch?"
Of "A"? Wait, how old is this game?
Hey, what does "A" mean?
Well, A is...
It's what comes before B, so...
A is for "accras" and B is for "beignets"!
Oh, I thought it was kissing.
Sorry, I overslept.
You're late, Professor!
Sorry.
Tohto Aviation Museum
Great!
There are lots of airplanes!
I heard you can pretend to fly a helicopter here.

Sounds like fun!
Too bad!
For what, Conan?
For the driving simulation
you have to be at least in 5th grade!
What? That's lame!
I'm sorry.
I did it plenty of times when I was in 5th grade.
Let me tell you an interesting story instead!
Hey, you've got to stop it or it'll take forever.
I'll take care of it.
- The pegasus from Greek mythology... - Tadam!
It's quiz time!
What's the matter with you?
Three people born on New Year's Day, April 1st and Children's Day
decide to form a group.
What do they call their group?
Hint: It's an animal that can fly like Pegasus!
An animal that flies?
Huh? Did you figure it out, Conan?
Sure, just add up their birth dates.
- What? - Their birth dates?
The first of January, the first of April...
...and May the 5th... That's October the 7th?
That's right, October the seventh.
This is the reindeer, tonakai in Japanese.
The Christmas reindeer pull the sleigh by flying.
Good answer!
Always so good, Conan!
Hey, isn't that Eimei Shishido over there?
Photographer Eimei Shishido (45 years old)
Classy!
Mouri Detective Agency
- Thanks for visiting! - Next!
Essayist Minoru Nishima (37 years old)
Here you go.
Here you go.
Thank you!
I'm a fan of yours!
Keep writing delicious books!
Delicious, huh? Thank you.
He's even more handsome than in the pictures!
He's just my type.
You, Sonoko...
- She's a real racing nut, that one. - But this is...
Model Nana Osanai (21)
Yes, that's Nana Osanai, the model!
I'm not interested in women. Shall we have that tea?
What time do you eat with your mother?
At seven.
I bet it's you who prepared everything again.
You go to a lot of trouble.
It's ten years since your mother left, isn't it?
Yeah, when I was seven.
I remember their fight.
They chose to live apart because they were too different.
And it was right after that...
your mother began her brilliant career as a lawyer.
And on the side...
Your father left the police force to open his seedy detective agency.
What do you mean, seedy?
And then he suddenly became a very successful detective,
but if it wasn't for you, he might as well be out on the street!
That's a bit of an exaggeration.
But my mother did well for herself.
That's me!
Home safe?
What, you're not ready yet, uncle?
He's been playing mahjong all day and just got home!
Pff, why do I have to have dinner with Eri in the first place?
Stop complaining and hurry up, please.
We're near Lake Tohto
where Aqua Crystal, a marine entertainment center, will soon open.
With us is its owner, Mr. Katsuyoshi Asahi.
Aqua Crystal Manager Katsuyoshi Asahi (61 years old)
Thank you for agreeing to answer our questions.
Conan.
I'm going to change !
French Restaurant "La Fleur"
Sorry for the delay, Mom!
It's nothing.
I guess someone's been playing too much mahjong again.
Always so perceptive.
I better not blunder in front of her.
Good evening, Conan.
Uh, good evening!
- Oh, you're such a dork, Mr. Tsuji! - All right, then!
It's been a long time, Mr. Mouri!
Well, good evening, Mr. Tsuji!
Mr. Mouri?
Pro Golfer Hiroki Tsuji (age 36)
The detective.
Oh, the famous detective?
Kogoro Mouri?
That's me. Kogoro Mouri, detective.
Let me introduce my family!
My wife, Eri, and my daughter, Ran.
And the squatter, Conan.
The squatter? He couldn't say it any other way?
My name is Tsuji.
I met Mr. Mouri at a golf tournament.
By the way, isn't Thursday the opening day of the American tournament?
Yes, it is.
I've been training for this tournament all year.
This time, for sure, I will be in the top ten!
I'm counting on you.
However, you also have to know how to rest.

I was thinking of taking these ladies flying tomorrow.
Mr. Tsuji has his own helicopter, which he flies himself.
Oh well, I'm planning to take a ride next Sunday too.
You're all invited if you want.
Wow, are you sure?
That's great.
That's just great!
Uh... I'm not very comfortable with anything that flies.
That's very kind of you, but we decline.
Really? That's a shame.
Pfft, that sucks.
This is Mr. Sawaki.
He's known Mom and Dad since they were young.
What's that grape badge?
That's a sommelier's badge.
A sommelier, like Mr. Sawaki,
Sommelier Kohei Sawaki (36 years old)
He's a wine expert.
And the thing around his neck?
It's called a tastevin.
It's used to check the taste of wine.
Well, you know all about it.
I learned everything from Mr. Nishina's books.
Like red wine, which is drunk at room temperature.
While white and ros√© are served chilled.
Many people say that, yes.
But everyone is free to drink it at the temperature that suits their taste.
That's fine.
A light red wine can be very good served chilled.
The important thing to remember is that the wine loses its bitterness when chilled.
Really?
But I'm surprised.
Ran has reached the age where we are interested in these things.
It also reminds us that we're getting older.
That's true.
The two of them have a good rapport.
Conan, you've got it all over you!
It's okay, you don't have to...
Here, don't move.
"A hunch from A?"
Ah kids, you have to do everything!
It was delicious.
The taste of the food and wine remained as it was back then.
Say, do you remember that?
15 years ago, the first time we ate here
you gave me a present.
Yes, Zigoba chocolates, your favorite.
We ate them on a bench in Beika Park.
Yes, we did.
Towako!
Who is that?
Is that Peter Ford?
Club owner Towako Okano (32)
Newspaper presenter Peter Ford (40 years old)
He is often invited on TV shows.
What is she doing with such a guy?
And who is this Towako?
She's the owner of a club in Ginza.
She always takes good care of me!
I'll leave you to it.
Already? Won't you come and have a coffee at home?
Sorry, I have work to do.
Thanks for dinner.
Mom?
Mom!
Dad!
Damn, Towako is gone!
He's irretrievable...
One week later
Midori-dai Police Hospital
Come in.
Juzo Megure
"Thirteen Megure?"
It reads Juzo!
Ah, right !
Oh my, holy Genta...
Inspector Megure's first name is Juzo?
Oh, Mouri !
You came here on purpose to see me? And with the children...
We were all about to go for a walk together.
How are your injuries, Inspector?
Luckily, no quick injuries were sustained.
His life is no longer in danger
but they'll keep him here for a few days.
Say, Inspector...
Why don't you ever take off your hat?
Oh, that... no reason.
He must be losing his hair.
Or maybe he's got a big hump!
The weapon is thought to be a pistol-type crossbow.
We don't know if it was aimed directly at him
or if the culprit was just looking for a random target for fun.
This is currently under investigation.
Hey, detective!
You have a gun, don't you?
And you let him get away?
You don't think he keeps his gun while jogging!
And even if I did have it,
I'm not as good a shot as Mouri!
Was my father a good shot?
One of the best in the whole police department!
Well, just goes to show that everyone has a talent.
By the way, we found something where we think the shot was fired from.
Here you go.
What is that thing?
Looks like a Western sword.
Does it?
I've seen this somewhere before!
Where was that...?
Kisaki Law Office
Hello !
Hello.
That's a nice pin.
Counselor.
Here is your agenda for today.
And there was this for you in the mail.
Oh, Zigoba.

It's those Swiss chocolates you like.
I see, it's from him.
But the sender didn't put his name...
Never mind, I know who it's from.
From... Water!
Master!
Tohto University Hospital
How is she?
Don't worry about her.
We've pumped her stomach, so she'll be fine.
What a relief...
So it was poison?
Yes.
Certainly a chemical fertilizer.
Mommy!
Mommy...
Ran.
Eri...
You came too?
Are you okay, Auntie?
Even Conan...
Thank you, I'm fine.
We'd like to keep her overnight, as a precaution.
Take care of her.
First the inspector, and now Eri.
Is it a coincidence?
By the way, she collapsed when she ate the chocolate?
Yes.
They were apparently delivered to her office.
Zigoba!
And then... a paper flower!
Is this...
the same criminal?
Oh, this flower...
But where have I seen that before...?
Agasa's home
She who is so careful,
how could she be poisoned?
Uncle made her angry at a dinner the other night.
She thought it was an apology gift.
I see.
Here, I finished fixing it.
Who is the joker who did this?
Professor... Don't open the door!
Professor! Professor!
I'm alright. Go after him, Shinichi!
But...
I'm telling you to go after him!
Got it!
Which way did he go?
Ayumi and the gang live on the left...
OK.
Conan!
A black dirt bike?
What's a "dirt bike"?
That's right, Genta! That's the dirt bike!
Conan!
Got it! Left, then.
She's turned towards Beika station, Conan!
Got it!
I'm going to overtake her!
There, I've got it!
Don't think I'm going to let you get away!
Are you all right, Madame?
Thank you, ma'am.
What the...?
Yes! I understand!
Central Hospital of Beika
Cards?
The perpetrator uses playing cards to choose his victims.
The first one was inspector Megure.
His first name is Juzo, right?
It's spelled like "13", the number of the king of spades.
Don't you think his sword looks like the one at the crime scene?
Next, Ran's mother's name, Kisaki.
It means "queen" in Japanese.
An allusion to the Queen of Spades.
And the queen is holding the same flower as the one on the box of chocolates.
It's true, it's the same!
But what does Agasa have to do with the 11th card?
His full name is Hiroshi Agasa.
The character shi is composed of those of "ten" and "one".
It corresponds to the jack of spades.
The jack is a warrior originally.
Look at this funny sword.
No doubt, it is the same one.
But why cards?
And why spades?
The spade symbolizes death.
Just as the heart is love.
The diamond is money.
And the club is happiness.
So the culprit will follow the order of the cards
and attempt to murder 13 individuals whose names are linked to a number?
And people you know, moreover.
Who would do that?
Our only clue was the motorcycle, but according to the license plate it's stolen.
Inspector?
What are you doing here?
After Eri, Professor Agasa... I had to come.
But your injuries are not...
Come on, it's almost nothing.
I heard you.
The culprit must be Joe Murakami.
Joe Murakami...
Who is he?
He's a croupier who acts alone.
He committed a murder ten years ago...
and was paroled last week.
A dealer? What's a dealer?
It's the guy who deals the cards in a gambling game.
This is Joe Murakami, 10 years ago.
Murakami...
He does have a grudge against me.
Why?
I'm the one who stopped him.
What the hell!
You were just doing your job as a policeman!
I know, but...
I heard about this case.
It seems to me that after he was arrested...
Shiratori! No need to talk about that.
But...
Why doesn't he come after me directly?
If he's after me, he should...
He probably wants to make you suffer.
Indirectly and slowly.

Hey, in your circle
is there anyone with a "ten" in their name?
That could be the next target!
Ten... So, j√ª or t√¥...
Towako!
Towako Club
Welcome to the club.
Oh, Mr Mouri!
Towako!
You've got nothing!
What do you mean nothing? Is something wrong?
Tell me...
What were you going to say, in hospital?
You were going to say something about Murakami.
It's not a secret so I can tell you.
It was another officer who told me.
Ten years ago, Mr. Mouri was assigned to the department in charge of the case
with Inspector Megure.
He was only an assistant inspector at the time.
Anyway,
they arrested Murakami on suspicion of murder.
While they were recording his written statement at the station
Murakami asked to use the bathroom.
Mr. Mouri and the inspector
ordered an officer to accompany Murakami
and they took a smoke break.
That's when your mother arrived.
She had taken you and was bringing Mr. Mouri a change of clothes.
That's when the incident happened.
Murakami had taken advantage of a moment of distraction from the guard
to steal his gun.
I remember that.
At that time, I was...
Prepare a car!
I'm taking the girl on a date to hell!
Mommy!
Ran, stay away!
Mouri.
You seem out of it.
Ah, it's nothing.
So Uncle shot Auntie?
I'd forgotten all about it until now.
It's normal that you wanted to forget.
But...
Why did my father shoot?
He must have been convinced that he would succeed.
That he would avoid the hostage and only hit the killer.
But the bullet deflected and hit your mother.
Even in the department,
the fact that he fired despite the hostage caused a lot of noise.
And it seems to me that this is where
your father turned in his badge.
- Hello? - Hey, Ran, long time no see.
Shinichi?
Professor Agasa told me.
That doesn't sound like fun.
It's much more serious than that!
Where are you now? You have to come back!
I'm sorry, I'm buried in business here.
I won't be able to get back for a while.
Oh, well...
Don't use that sad voice.
I'll ask the professor and the inspector for the details of the investigation.
I'll call you if I find anything.
Say...
Would you have shot ?
I think I understand.
The reason why my mother went to live elsewhere.
Because he shot her...
Even if he was a good shot...
I can't trust him anymore!
You wouldn't do that, would you?
Good question... I don't know.
But even if it's an established fact that he shot her,
it's not necessarily the whole truth.
What do you mean? I don't follow you!
Anyway, that's all I can say.
Cheer up, Ran.
See ya.
Ah, wait!
Shinichi? Shinichi!
The truth...
Inspector, I'm going to take the emergency exit.
Wait, Mouri!
He's quickly motivated when it comes to a beautiful woman.
Uncle didn't come home after all...
That said...
Why would Joe Murakami
voluntarily leave some clues incriminating him?
To provoke uncle and the police?
But how, while he was in prison,
was he able to find out about uncle's entourage?
He even knew the brand of chocolates Ran's mother liked.
Hiroki Tsuji?
Tsuji...
Ten Tsuji...
Ten
Hiroki Tsuji, the pro golfer?
Yes. It was Conan who noticed...
He's got the "ten" character in his name too!
Tsuji...
That's right, he's there!
I just called his house,
and they said he left for the helipad 30 minutes ago!
Got it.
Call the station
and have them send a team to replace us!
Yes !
Let's go too, Conan!
Let's go, Mouri!
Where to? To have breakfast?
Hey, Dad!
Hey, you two! Why are you here?
Are you really asking?
This case concerns us too!
I'm your daughter, I'll have you know!
So you're saying that Mr. Mouri's relatives

are attacked one after the other?
That's right.
And in order, starting from 13.
You are next, so you are at risk!
You'd better cancel your flight.
Come on, it'll be all right.
If you're so worried, why don't you come upstairs with me?
Uh, I'm all about flying...!
By the way, where are you headed?
Tohto airport.
But I'm taking a few detours.
When did you file your flight plan?
Let's see... The day before yesterday, at the airport office.
Inspector.
Murakami may be planning to attack him at the airport.
Well, take the car and head for Tohto Airport.
Yes.
Hurry!
We'll take the chopper with him just in case!
Ran, I understand your reasons, but you're staying here.
What? What? What? But...!
That's fine.
Inspector... Put me with Shiratori!
Are you going to leave me?
No, I, uh... I have to go to the bathroom!
Detective! I don't want to die!
Come on, go! We'll die together!
We'll really die!
Fine, I'll go.
Come on Conan, we too...
Where is he?
No...!
One sheep, two sheep...
Is that a spell so we don't crash?
- Conan! - When did you get on?
I wanted to sit in the copilot's seat at least once!
Welcome to my cockpit.
We're going to fly over Beika too, where you live.
Yeah! That's great!
Too bad, it's too late to bring him back.
But you'd better behave or I'll eject you!
Everything looks normal.
What are you looking at?
You are lucky to be in a helicopter, look outside.
Anything wrong?
No, nothing.
You put on eye drops earlier.
Are you still using them?
Yes.
In the car or when I'm flying, always.
We're approaching Beika!
It's true!
We can see your house, Mouri!
I don't want to look!
- What's the matter? - The light hurts my eyes too much!
What's wrong?
No... Could it be the drops?
But then...!
Sir! We're leaning to the left!
Mouri, can you fly?
Of course not!
We can't stay in the air!
Isn't there a landing place?
The Teitan school! Good!
What?
We can land in the schoolyard!
Take over the pedals and the group maneuvers!
Stop, you fool! You want to kill us?
Don't worry.
I did plenty of simulations when I was a kid.
But you're still a kid...
Mr. Tsuji!
We'll crash if we don't do something! Please help me!
Alright, alright... Let's go !
You mean it?
Altitude: 90 m.
Speed: 75 km/h.
Ready!
Here we go!
Altitude: 60 m.
Speed: 55 km/h. Depress the right pedal 10 degrees!
Run straight ahead at 150 meters!
Genta, can you hear me? Genta!
Is that you, Conan?
We're going in for a helicopter crash landing!
Get everyone out of there!
Helicopter?
Everybody run! We've got a chopper crashing on top of us!
We are not going down!
We're making a left turn! Step on the right pedal!
Oh no! We're deflecting down!
He really crashed!
Is Conan on board?
We're saved!
Conan!
Anything broken, Mr. Tsuji?
- There's a fuel leak! - What's wrong?
It exploded!
Isn't a helicopter expensive?
The propeller alone must cost about 10,000,000 yen.
How many bowls of rice with eel ?
Beika central hospital
Luckily nobody was hurt.
Hiroshi Agasa
But, Professor...
It's not fair!
Conan is the only one who could fly a real helicopter!
Is that what's bothering you? We were almost killed!
About that...
The eye drops that Mr. Tsuji was using
has been replaced by a mydriatic instead of vitamins.
A mydriatic ?
It is an agent often used to treat myopia.
It causes the pupil to dilate.
I see.
That's why the sunlight was bothering him.
But the eye drops he used
is recommended for the treatment of iritis.
Iritis?
What is the difference?
The one for myopia dilates the eye in 5 minutes and the effect fades quickly.
But the one for iritis

takes effect in more than ten minutes and also lasts longer.
How long?
It depends on the person,
but the pupil remains dilated between ten and fifteen days.
That long?
But then...
For the opening of the tournament on Thursday...
He'll have to cancel, I guess.
Say, when did the culprit switch the drops?
Well, that...
When Mr. Tsuji took his car out of the garage this morning
he said he had put on some eye drops.
Right after that
he heard glass breaking.
He left the eye drops on the center console...
and went back inside to look.
Apparently, someone had thrown a rock to break the window.
A rock?
It was the same for Professor Agasa!
But Mr. Tsuji thought it was a child's prank
and left the housekeeper to deal with it.
No doubt that the stone was thrown by our man!
The drops were changed while he was going home to check.
Yes, most likely.
Inspector!
The culprit can only be Joe Murakami.
Look what we found.
The ten of spades.
Hurray!
The next one will be number nine!
Do you know anyone who might be a match?
Well, I... I can't think of anyone.
- Eight, on the other hand... - Eight?
It's probably Mr. Sawaki, the sommelier.
His first name is Kohei.
The top part of the k√¥ of his name is an eight.
Well, let's go see this Mr. Sawaki.
So this Joe Murakami...
is seeking revenge on Mr. Mouri
by attacking his relatives one by one?
Yes.
I must say, Mr. Mouri...
You look pretty calm.
Oh, I'm number five.
I still have some time before I'm targeted.
Oh, there's wine.
It's a wine cabinet.
It's to keep it at the perfect temperature.
There are many bottles.
Mr. Sawaki's parents have vineyards in Yamanashi.
They have hundreds of bottles in their wine cellar.
Isn't that right?
Yes, that's right.
I'd like to open my own store one day.
I have a passion for wine.
Do you mind if I take a look?
Please do.
The floor is damaged!
Ah, are you okay?
I dropped a bottle the other day.
You don't have any slippers, Conan, so be careful.
Margaux, Lafite, Haut-Brian...
All quality wines, I see.
By the way, what's his name again?
You know, your treasure...
Little...
Do you have a Ch√¢teau Petrus?
Ch√¢teau Petrus!
It's the wine that Poirot drinks in Death on the Nile!
I had one...
But I drank it the other day.
What? But you said
it would take years to reach its peak.
I finally couldn't wait.
Mr. Sawaki...
You can talk wine next time.
Can you tell me your plans for the day?
Do you know Mr. Katsuyoshi Asahi?
He's a businessman who owns several restaurants
in the downtown area.
Yes, I've met him before.
He hired me for a job.
I think he's going to open a marine entertainment center.
The Aqua Crystal, I think.
That's right.
He offered me to manage one of the restaurants on the premises.
I have an appointment with him at 3:00.
Katsuyoshi Asahi?
- Asahi? - Wait a minute...
That's the ninth one! He has a "nine" in his name!
So Mr. Asahi would be the next target.
But...
He paid me to find his cat, so he's not really a relative.
Murakami may think otherwise.
If you're going to protect Mr. Sawaki, you might as well go and meet him too.
You don't mind?
No, it's fine.
- Well, Ran and Conan... - We're coming.
Conan and I will go with you.
Don't be so temperamental, Ran!
This isn't a game!
That's just it!
These people are in danger because of you!
I can't just sit back and do nothing!
Ran...
Is this the Aqua Crystal?
- How can I put it... - It's quite a building!
What a freak!
I'm a bit overwhelmed.
Well, it passes.
Hey! It's dangerous, Miss!
- What is? - Are you serious...?
Hey, Nana! Are you here too?
Well, well, well.
Did Mr. Asahi invite you too, Mr. Shishido?

Excuse me Miss, but who are you?
Who are you? Don't you know who I am, Grandpa?
It's Nana Osanai, detective.
A popular model.
The other three, from left to right:
The essayist, Mr. Nishina,
photographer Eimei Shishido, and finally...
I'm Peter Ford.
You're from the police, right?
And I think I recognize the great detective Kogoro Mouri.
You're the famous detective?
I've never seen him in person!
- Mr. Shishido, a picture! - Uh, peace.
Hey... Weren't you angry with her?
This is Mr. Kohei Sawaki, sommelier,
and Mr. Mouri's daughter Ran.
And little Conan Edogawa.
Oh?
You're the one who called my books 'delicious'.
Do you remember me?
Like good wine, it's hard to forget a beautiful woman.
Yeah, right...
You all have an appointment with Mr. Asahi?
- Yes, 3:00... - Same for me.
Me too.
Are you on a case, Inspector?
Yes, actually...
Hey, it's 3 p.m., we have to go.
Ah, you're right.
Let's go in first!
Now that I think of it, those four...!
Is the entrance to the Aqua Crystal only accessible by monorail?
Huh? No driver?
Just press this button, it seems.
Start
That's pretty impressive.
Oh...
You can't stand air travel either?
No, I'm more of a water person.
I'm a real anvil.
Well, I...
We all have a phobia.
Even if it's a fact that he shot her,
it's not necessarily the whole truth.
It looks like an aquarium!
It's really an underwater restaurant!
A Ferrari F40!
How did they get it down here?
We didn't run into Mr. Asahi.
It's strange that he lets his guests wait...
Murakami would have already...?
What do you mean? What are you talking about?
That's right, we still need to explain...
Inspector!
- I'll search the other rooms. - I'll go with you.
Very well, then.
Well, as a precaution, everyone sit with their backs to the wall!
The emergency exit is here.
Wine cellar.
This is the only locked door.
I see, so this happened...
Nothing to report.
- I think I'm your number six. - Why?
There's a six in the Shishido shishi.
Oh, yes!
The other three also have a number in their name.
What's that?
Well yes, nana means seven,
Nishina has the ni of "two",
and in Ford, there's four.
I see...
You only need one and three to have all the numbers.
The three, you have it right in front of you.
Right? Don't tell me...?
My full name is Ninzaburo Shiratori.
Zaburo, three!
But I don't see who would have the number one.
Shinichi.
Ichi means one, so it could be him...
Do you think Kudo will come here?
No, it just came to me.
She has a point.
If I hadn't gotten smaller,
I would have been interested in the case and I would have come logically.
So I am number one.
I ask just in case, but...
Does anyone have a connection with Joe Murakami?
How would I know a guy like that?
I don't know him either.
I do.
Before I was an essayist..,
I was a crime reporter.
I wrote an article on the Murakami case.
I also have a connection with him.
I did a photo series called "Portraits of Killers."
Joe Murakami was in it.
Was there any particular incident?
No, nothing at all.
Anything wrong, Miss Nana?
He was released eight days ago, wasn't he?
Yes.
Then it's not related.
Come on, don't take it so seriously!
Forget what I said!
More importantly... It's you, right?
The author of this rag, Les restaurants parisiens!
The restaurant recommended in it was downright nasty!
- Your palate is out of whack? - How dare you?
My palate works perfectly!
- Prove it, then. - Prove it?
I brought a souvenir for Mr. Asahi.
Try to tell which wine it is.
A blind tasting?
I'll do it.
That delicate scent of violets...

And that velvety feeling right down my throat.
This is Napoleon's favorite wine.
A Chambertin.
Gotcha!
As if I'd give away such an expensive bottle!
But then...?
You are a sommelier, aren't you?
Yes.
Give the answer to this cheap essayist.
A Beaujolais windmill.
Bingo!
No way! This, a Beaujolais?
Even a Beaujolais, if it is of good quality and well aged
can achieve a taste and aroma similar to a good Burgundy.
Do you understand now?
If I were you, I'd quit this essayist-gourmet job right away.
All this has made me want to drink wine!
Let's all drink together! I'll get it for you!
A beer for me. Where are the kitchens?
Over there!
Will you show me the way, kid?
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!
Who are you calling kid?
Jackpot
You'll be happy, kid, there's juice!
Is that right? That's great!
But don't call me "kid" anymore.
For you, Ran.
Oh, thanks.
Damn it!
You're right, Mr. Sawaki, it's delicious!
Another drink, Mr. Sawaki?
No thanks, I'll have some mineral water.
Thank you, sir.
You don't drink beer, uncle?
Of course not.
Murakami could attack us at any time.
Here, Inspector, drink up.
Here Conan, you can have mine.
No that's alright, I'll get another one!
Hey, don't go snooping around, eh!
There's mineral water in the bottom drawer of the fridge.
Oh, thanks.
They have some rare condiments, so I wanted to try some.
- Are the fruit juices upstairs? - Yes!
Mr. Asahi is really late!
What's he doing?
What's up? What's wrong with you?
I was just kidding!
I swear to God...
Mr. Ford!
This is no time for bad jokes!
Besides...
Why were you invited?
It was his secretary who called me.
Mr. Asahi is a fan of my work and wanted to meet me.
I think he wanted some publicity for this place.
I was also called by his secretary.
And for the same reason.
I even received a gift!
Look at this nail polish!
It's a very expensive French brand!
You too, Mr. Nishina?
Yes.
What are you doing, Nana?
Drawing a picture of the wine cork with nail polish!
Cute, huh?
What's this? A raccoon?
Oh, you're doing that on purpose! It's a cat! A cat!
Mr. Sawaki, here.
It fell on the floor.
"Mr. Kohei Sawaki.
"I'll probably be late,
"so choose a bottle from the M-18 shelf in the wine cellar
"and serve it to the guests.
"You'll find the key in an envelope near the cash register.
"With all my friendship, Katsuyoshi Asahi."
When I picked up the cans...
I didn't see any paper.
Hey, I want to see the wine cellar!
Me too!
I'm also curious to see what wines he has.
Let's go together, then.
- Wow! - This is amazing!
- It's cool. - On the contrary, it's almost too warm.
The wine should be kept between 10 and 14 degrees
for an ideal conservation.
It's 17 degrees here, that's too much.
Look, Inspector, only renowned wines!
Roman√©e-Conti, La-T√¢che, Le Pin...
C√¥te-R√¥tie, Clos du Mesnil... I don't believe it!
The M-18 shelf...
This is the one!
Watch out!
A trap device!
Uncle! Inspector!
That's the same tile I was shot with!
Inspector!
The crossbow is installed here.
The eight of spades.
So this is Murakami's shot.
He must have written the letter, too!
If that's the case...
why did he skip the nine and go straight to the eight?
Don't tell me...
Inspector! Let's get out of this building already!
What's this? It's closed...
Wasn't the entrance here?
But it was...
Can I get my coat if we leave?
Please do.
Mr. Asahi!
The nine of spades! It's Murakami!
Inspector!
The door's locked with an electromagnetic lock!
What the hell?! Okay, I'll call for backup!
No, I can't get a signal!

The line is cut. Damn it!
Inspector, I'll check the emergency exit!
What the hell?
It's blocked by cement.
This is all your fault!
You got us into this!
He's right! Do something about it!
Since Murakami didn't change the order after all...
the next target will be you, Nana.
Don't do this to me!
Why should I be targeted by a guy whose name I didn't know?
But you are curious about something, aren't you?
Well, yes, just now...
He was released eight days ago, wasn't he?
Yes.
That's an unrelated story!
We'll be the judge of that.
Tell us about it.
It was three months ago...
that's what they say!
I didn't see it
but I panicked and ran.
Was the motorcycle a dirt bike?
No, it was a regular bike.
Inspector.
As Miss Nana was saying, that's probably irrelevant.
The priority is to find a way out of here!
You're right.
Maybe we'll find another way out by searching.
So let's split up and all go looking.
No choice, it seems.
Ran and Conan, you stay here, understand?
Miss Nana too, don't move from here!
Okay...
They're taking too long to get back!
Can't they find a way out?
Don't worry, I'm sure they'll find it soon.
I'm going to look too.
We were told to stay here!
You're really too curious...
But uh!
A breakdown?
What's wrong? Why did it break down?
Glow-in-the-dark varnish!
- Help! - Don't move, Miss Nana!
No! This breakdown would be...?
What was it? What happened?
What was what? What was that scream?
Inspector!
- Mouri, the electrical room! - I'll get it!
Miss Nana?
Is that it?
Miss Nana!
What the...?
- Miss Nana! - Get out of the way!
She's dead...
The seven of spades and the joker...
It's Murakami! He's in the building with us!
What the hell... I'm going after him!
Don't go alone, Mr. Mouri! I'm coming with you!
Mr. Shishido.
Please don't take any pictures.
Why is that?
Since we won't have backup,
you'll have to examine the body.
Don't you want to take pictures of the crime scene first?
You have a point.
But you will hand over the photos to the police afterwards.
Yes, of course I will.
But how did Murakami do it in the dark?
With the glow-in-the-dark nail polish.
Miss Nana's nails glowed in the dark.
What's that?
I see.
There was a phosphorescent product in the nail polish we gave her.
The nail of her middle finger!
Hey, Inspector.
The nails on her left hand are weird.
Her nail polish came off.
No, it's her nail that broke off?
I think her fake nail came off.
A fake nail?
You put them over your nails.
There are all kinds of patterns
and you attach them with glue.
So it must have fallen off in the corner?
Ah, there it is.
It's not going to help us solve this case.
Oh...
The trace from a left hand!
It was obviously grabbed with force.
But then...
the murderer is right-handed!
If I remember correctly, Murakami... is left-handed!
Murakami is not Miss Nana's killer!
Just a moment... The other time, the culprit had shot...
Remember... Remember!
With his right hand!
Curses!
I was wrong about everything!
Inspector, bad news.
Murakami is nowhere to be found.
Maybe he's already gone...
Impossible, there's no way out!
He must be hiding somewhere!
No, the culprit is not Murakami.
It is someone among us.
Who is it? Who killed Miss Nana?
But I'm thinking about that now...
The killer hit the can I left on the ground!
The contents are spilled on the floor.
I know that when I put it down it was still half full.
If the killer hit it, then...
The contents of the can should have spilled...
on the pants of the culprit!
The murderer of Miss Nana is one of these four men.
Is it him?
But why?
I'm sorry, Mr. Sawaki.
Because of me, Mr. Asahi was killed

and you're not going to get the job he offered you.
That's okay, I was going to turn it down.
To tell you the truth, I'm going to quit my present job
and move back to the country.
I am an only child, you see.
I have to take care of my parents.
In any case, it is better to stay put.
Especially you, Mr. Shishido.
I know, I'm the next target.
I'll be careful not to get killed.
Inspector, I have no intention of dying!
I'll get out of here alive, you hear?
Now wait a minute...
That man might be...
What the hell are you doing?
I thought you might be thirsty.
You little idiot!
Don't walk around like that!
We still don't know where Murakami is hiding!
I don't have a number in my name!
- No, but oh! - Here you go.
Here you go, Mr. Sawaki.
- Thank you, sir. - Hey, kid, bring me one!
I'm coming!
Japanese water is really good.
It's good!
There is no doubt about it!
But I have no proof...
I know! Where was it?
That's it, I have my proof!
What was it?
- There must have been an explosion. - Shiratori!
- We have to protect Mr. Shishido! - Got it!
Mr. Shishido! Where are you, Mr. Shishido?
- I'm right here! - Turn that off!
Do you want to die?
I'm number two, there's still time!
Mr. Sawaki, you're not hurt?
No...
You think he'll attack me again?
I don't know...
Thank God for the emergency generator!
What the...?
Help! Help! I can't swim!
Hang on to me!
You survived, kid, good job!
Didn't you? Ran!
Where's Ran?
No...!
Hey, Conan! Where are you going?
Ran, where are you?
Ran!
Ran, everything's fine now.
Just stay calm.
Shinichi...
Conan!
It's too heavy.
I know, my elastic straps!
Damn, my foot is stuck!
Damn it! I'm running out of air...
Ran!
Hey, Ran! Ran! Damn it!
I'm okay!
I've got to hurry!
Hey, Ran! Ran! Hang on!
Dad...
You can thank Conan.
Thank you, Conan.
Uh, no...
What is it?
I think my wound has reopened...
What?
Here, look!
Six to two of spades!
Damn!
He wanted to kill us all at once, the bastard!
But this is what will happen if we do nothing!
There is no exit!
- Yes, there is an exit! - What?
The glass window that exploded!
I see it!
We can get to the ocean that way!
It's impossible, I won't be able to!
Don't be a wimp!
I'll carry you, okay?
Then I'll carry the boy.
I can make it by myself!
I'll take you to the surface.
You can make one last effort, right?
- Let me help you. - Thank you, sir.
I will guide you.
Let's go !
Here we go, hold your breath!
Don't let go of my hand!
Okay, okay, okay.
- Come on, take my hand! - Yes!
- Grab Ran! - Yes!
We're safe, aren't we?
Yes, there's nothing more to worry about.
Nishina! Nishina!
Hey, hold on!
I'll do CPR!
I have a first aid certificate!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Officer Shiratori will do it!
Uh, I don't have anything...
Hurry up, Shiratori!
Yes, sir.
That's odd...
Muri?
Detective, this crime spree...
...weren't committed by Joe Murakami.
What do you mean, "not by Joe Murakami"?
Because the person who shot Professor Agasa...
and Miss Nana's killer...
were right-handed!
Right-handed?
You're saved !
The culprit must have
met Murakami after his release.
He learned that I had shot him in the shoulder ten years earlier
and that he was a former dealer formerly known as "Joker"...
and he decided to use these facts.
- Use them? - Yes.
The unsub realized that the people he wanted to kill
and himself had names with numbers in them.
So he combined that with the numbers on the playing cards
and tried to conceal his crime among others to incriminate Murakami.
But then...
If I, Mrs. Eri and the teacher were targeted

it was a cover-up to make it look like Murakami's revenge?
Exactly.
So the ones the culprit really wanted to kill...
were Mr. Asahi and Miss Nana.
And Mr. Tsuji as well.
In his case, exchanging his eye drops
was a safe method, leaving little chance of survival.
His intentions were therefore clear.
Mouri, who is this culprit?
The culprit is among us!
How could it be?
I'm thinking about it, but Miss Nana has publicly embarrassed you.
No! I didn't kill her!
No, you were on the list of victims.
The fact that the perpetrator blew up the underwater restaurant
proves that he was trying to kill you, who can't swim.
By the way, Officer Shiratori.
To perform artificial respiration
what did you do first?
First?
I lifted his head and angled his throat
so that the air could circulate.
So if you didn't do that
and pretended to resuscitate him to plug his nose and mouth
what would have happened?
He would have died, of course!
You mean...
Exactly.
The one who killed Mr. Asahi and Miss Nana
and who tried to murder Mr. Tsuji and Mr. Nishina...
Mr. Kohei Sawaki, that was you!
At last, Mr. Mouri! I was targeted, too!
It was just a prearranged set-up
last night, right after I killed Mr. Asahi at the Aqua Crystal!
So the letter found under the table...
And the secretary who invited us...
That was a move by Mr. Sawaki.
Of course he's also the one who gave the nail polish to Miss Nana.
And the pattern? What was the motive?
I suppose...
it has to do with her eating disorder.
Taste disorder?
That's when you can't taste food and drink, right?
Right
He has lost his sense of taste.
A taste disorder
is apparently triggered by stress or a blow to the head.
A blow to the head...
But then it was Mr. Sawaki that Miss Nana almost hit with her car!
But, but wait!
You talk about a taste disorder...
but he guessed what kind of wine Miss Nana was serving!
He guessed just by the color and smell of the wine.
Is it possible?
Mr. Sawaki continued his work as a sommelier
just with his sight and smell.
But he had become an imperfect sommelier,
far from the ideal he had been nurturing.
That's why Mr. Sawaki
decided to resign and return to the country.
But before that, he wanted to get back at Miss Nana
and all the others responsible for his loss of taste.
His frustration must have been immense.
So much so that he broke the bottle
that he kept preciously for the day he would have his restaurant.
Is that what made the hole in his floor?
But how did you know all that?
This...
is because he tasted a bottle of spices.
The vial in question
was chili powder, a very hot spice mixture.
Someone whose tongue is a working tool
would not put strong spices in his mouth.
But what convinced me that he was suffering from this disorder
was the mineral water I asked Conan to drink.
Mineral water?
The glass that Conan brought you
was the only one with salt in it.
And I drank it without noticing anything.
It's true, I admit it, I have a taste disorder.
But this...
that doesn't prove that I killed Miss Nana.
Oh, but I have proof.
It's in one of your jacket pockets.
It's the cork that Miss Nana drew on!
The cork that Miss Nana had in her hand until she died...
what is it doing in your pocket?
The answer is...
Is that when you attacked Miss Nana from behind
she turned around and grabbed you!
That's when the cork slipped into your pocket.
And the fake nail found on the floor
must also have come off at that moment.
For a sommelier like you to be incriminated
to be incriminated because of a cork, it's quite ironic !
And I have another proof!
If I'm not mistaken, it's still sleeping...
inside your pocket!
I'm talking about the unused card

with the same pattern as the others: the ace of spades!
The card of Shinichi Kudo!
The ace of spades!
Mr. Mouri.
You're right on all counts.
Three months ago, I was driving home from work
I was almost hit by his car and fell off my motorcycle.
Some time after that, I suddenly lost my sense of taste.
The doctors told me that it was probably also due to stress.
In despair, I gave up on my vocation.
Nana Osanai, the person responsible for my accident,
and those who had caused me stress: Asahi, Tsuji
and Nishina would suffer my revenge.
But...
What had these three men done to you?
Asahi foresaw that there would be a wine boom.
He took advantage of his great fortune
to import several famous wines!
And he didn't care about keeping them well!
Nishina!
You've taken yourself for a gourmet with your pretentious books!
You popularized false information about wine!
And Hiroki Tsuji!
He insulted my honor as a sommelier!
Four months ago...
he invited me to a party at his house.
Here it is!
This will serve as my sommelier badge!
And for the tastevin... Wow, it's impeccable!
You tried to kill him for such a futile reason?
Trivial?
You have no idea how I felt then!
Everything I aspired to...
My vocation as a sommelier, my fame, my pride!
He trampled it all underfoot with his filthy feet!
Did you kill Joe Murakami?
Yes.
I met him by chance on the day of his release
in front of Mouri Detective Agency.
That was the day Uncle played mahjong all day!
I thought that he could be useful to me.
I invited him saying that I was a friend of Mr. Mouri.
Murakami had hated Mr. Mouri at the time
but he was sorry and came to him to apologize.
That's when it came to me.
I was going to cover up my crimes with playing cards.
Killing Murakami when he was drunk was a piece of cake.
So you had nothing against Mr. Mouri and Inspector Megure!
Right
Why did you send for Mr. Shishido and me?
Just to get numbers 6 and 4?
That's right.
Numbers 5 and 3, Mr. Mouri and Officer Shiratori,
were bound to come when they heard I was invited here.
I must admit that I expected Shinichi Kudo to come as well.
It was unfortunate, but it wouldn't change anything.
What if all these people were dead too?
Didn't you care?
The explosion in the restaurant was only meant to kill Nishina.
What did it matter if the others survived or not?
All I had to do was make this place fall apart
and with Murakami gone, the case would never have been solved.
Bring this place down?
Mr. Sawaki.
You can't run away now, surrender.
Officer Shiratori!
- Restrain Mr. Sawaki! - What's that?
What is it?
Oh, no, you don't!
Come on, then!
Damn it!
What is Mr. Sawaki doing with Ran?
What the hell are you talking about?
You just revealed all his crimes!
Didn't you? Did I do that?
Nobody move! One move and she loses her life!
Damn it!
Ran's too exhausted to use her karate!
The foundation of the building was shaken by the explosion!
Ran!
- Ran, where are you? - She's here.
Where's he going to go?
- He's going to escape in a helicopter! - What's wrong?
He called her to run away...
using the secretary's name!
- I won't let him! - Hey, Mouri!
Let us handle this! Ah, Conan!
All of you, clear the area quickly!
But I can't swim!
Don't worry about it.
We'll get a plank to drag you to the other side!
- Let's go, Shiratori! - Yes!
- Where is he? - Up the stairs!
Is he going to take the elevator?
Mouri, this way!
Quick, hurry up!
Inspector.
How's Officer Shiratori doing at shooting?
Like me: A real disaster.
What the hell is going on here?
What the hell are you doing? Land!
What's wrong? Why does this man have a knife?
Damn it!

What is this elevator that does not go up to the roof?
Hurry up and come down!
I'm the one who called a chopper!
Mayday! Mayday!
At the Aqua Crystal Heliport
a man with a knife has taken a young girl hostage!
The building is in danger of collapsing! Send reinforcements quickly!
Ran!
Don't come any closer!
Stay back, or I'll kill her!
Stop, Mr. Sawaki!
Let go of Miss Ran, or I'll shoot!
That's interesting.
Shoot me if you have the guts!
His hands are shaking.
He might hit Ran!
Shiratori, no!
Inspector, are you okay?
Running away in a helicopter won't get you anywhere!
Let go of Ran!
Shut up, you!
I'm taking him with me and killing Tsuji!
Kill Mr. Tsuji?
He won't be able to participate in the American tournament!
Isn't that enough?
No, I'm going to kill him and myself!
And I'll kill that girl too!
Mr. Sawaki...
Shinichi...
Help, Shinichi!
If we let him take her away...
Ran will be killed!
This is bad!
At this rate, not only will Ran be left behind..,
...but so will all of us!
Give me your gun.
Give me your gun...
Or I'll blow her away!
Hey, Shiratori.
Give me your gun.
Give it to me, I said.
Are you kidding? Surely not to you!
How about it? Hurry up!
It's okay!
Kid! You're going to bring her to me!
Don't you care if I kill her?
No way!
It's too dangerous for a child!
Hey!
Come on, faster than that!
No !
Conan, don't...
Don't give it to him!
Good boy! Bring it here!
Come on, quickly!
Hurry up and bring it to me!
I see.
Now I understand better!
That's why uncle...
Shi...
Shinichi?
Damn it!
Hey, get up! Hey!
Ran!
That was close, huh Ran?
I see.
That's why Mr. Mouri fired.
Not to catch the culprit...
but to save the hostage!
Yes.
A hostage shot in the leg
would be a burden to a fleeing criminal.
It was to save mom.
That's the truth, right...
Dad?
Kohei Sawaki!
You're under arrest for murder, assault and kidnapping!
Let go of me! I want to die!
We won't let you die.
You're going to feel the weight of all your crimes!
Well, that was a close one!
Uncle, you cured your phobia of helicopters!
Let me down!
Here you go.
The gun went off suddenly, I had one of those chills!
Oh, dear...
It's good that the bullet grazed his leg.
But a little mistake and it could have ended very badly!
I'm sorry.
Actually, when I was at our villa in Hawaii
my dad taught me how to shoot at the local range.
But I can't tell him that.
Anyway...
It wasn't easy for Ran.
Oh dear.
Inspector, please take this opportunity to really rest.
Yes, I'll do that.
Ah, don't bother taking off my hat!
Say...
Do you think Shinichi would have fired too?
I don't know.
If he was as good as me, he might have shot, yes.
I think so.
Right, Shinichi?
What's this?
This is Shinichi's card, the ace of spades.
I've been holding it in my hand all this time.
Maybe Shinichi has been protecting me.
Silly girl.
The one the ace of spades saved...
A hunch from A
it was rather...
me!
I keep having the same dream
And when I wake up
I realize my heart is pounding
love never follows a regular rhythm
Settling down on my comfortable couch
I end up falling back asleep in spite of myself
I wish I could go back to the nostalgic days
When I was just a little girl
Your hand gently caressed my hair
I never stopped waiting for that warmth
You are the only one who has ever
wrapped me so tenderly
I love you so much
Yes, I love you so much
You are the only one who has ever
wrapped around me so tenderly
I love you so much
With all my scarlet heart
A few days later
Did you?
Did you understand why daddy shot you?

Of course I do.
He's still my husband, after all.
I mean, it's only natural for a husband to protect his wife.
But why did you leave the house, then?
That night, your father
said my cooking was stinking and refused to eat.
Despite the pain in my leg...
I forced myself to cook, full of gratitude.
But he...
Stupid!
If you're going to serve me this, you might as well go to sleep!
That's why I left.
It makes me angry just thinking about it!
That old boor!
Ah, that's why...
They're not about to make up...
Now that I think about it, Mom's cooking...
it's inedible.
