So how do you like the view from the Bell Tree Tower,
the pride of the Suzuki group?
It's great, Sonoko!
Thanks for inviting us.
Aren't you going to say thank you?
Normally the opening ceremony is for staff only, right?
- Thank you, thank you! - That's so cool!
Thank you so much!
You bet...
She's the one who asked us to come.
Hey! Are we going home?
What, already?
We just got to the top.
Why am I in a high place again?
Come on dad, come with us!
The view is great from here.
Nonsense.
Well, I'm going!
What the hell...
First of all,
they say that only idiots want to go to the top.
You say that, but in reality you're scared shitless!
Idiot!
We're not even that high, this is nothing.
So it won't scare you to look at the ground.
The ground?
The ground...
is gone!
- Help, I'm scared! - Ah! Dad!
I'm afraid of heights!
- Sir! - This elevator will...
This elevator goes straight up to the special observatory.
There you can enjoy the view from a height of 1,000 feet.
Let me off!
I'm so embarrassed...
Sorry, Sonoko.
Don't worry about it.
- I'm used to it by now. - There's no way...
Let's go back and enjoy the view.
Hey, Sonoko...
What's that building?
Oh, that little building? That's the Asakusa Sky Court.
No connection with the Suzuki Group.
Even when it's finished, I doubt it will pass our first observatory.
So the Bell Tree wins.
Of course!
Hey, look at the river!
It's full of bridges!
Yes, that's the Sumida River.
The blue one on the other bank is Komagata-bashi,
the red one is Azuma-bashi,
and this railway bridge is the Tohto Bell Tree line.
Look, a train is coming!
So stylish!
Hey, but it stops on the bridge.
It's just slowing down.
Asakusa Station is just over the bridge, that's why.
Oh, I have an idea! For our summer paper,
why don't we make a model
of the Bell Tree Tower and what's around it?
Oh yeah, that would be cool!
That sounds like fun!
Are you doing it with us, Conan and Ai?
- I don't know, it seems diffi... - Why not, right?
- Great! - It's decided, then.
Let's do it right!
It's a good thing we came here.
Let's take lots of pictures!
I'm going to shoot.
I'm going to find out about the tower.
But maybe someone here thinks he's above schoolwork?
Leave me alone.
Right there, the yellow building.
Wow, that's impressive!
I see it! What a wonder!
This building was built 30 years ago.
And now that the Bell Tree Tower is complete,
the view alone is worth four stars.
It's a five-star property, for sure.
Thirty years? That's a little old, isn't it?
I like this house a lot.
So do I.
Anything wrong?
No, it's nothing...
He's a sniper! Get down!
You're crushing me!
Please remain calm!
Damn, people are freaking out!
Yes, he's here all right.
Where's Ran?
He's okay.
Professor,
Your keys!
My car keys?
I'll get my skateboard.
- Here you go... - Professor, you're heavy!
Wait, wait, wait!
Please, calm down.
Conan...
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE DIMENSIONAL SNIPER
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug,
and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name...
I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
In order to find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.

The Men in Black organization is shrouded in mystery
and I'm not the only one secretly investigating them.
Starting with the FBI.
James Black,
Andre Camel,
Jodie Starling...
and Shuichi Akai.
He was a top sniper in the FBI..,
but he was killed by a CIA agent undercover in the organization.
And here are new protagonists!
Masumi Sera,
a self-proclaimed detective who transferred to our high school.
And finally, Subaru Okiya,
an engineering graduate student
who is currently living in my empty house.
But who is he really?
My body has become younger, but not my mind!
I will solve all the mysteries!
There is still only one truth!
A shot this accurate from this distance,
don't tell me...
that it's them?
I have to make sure.
That building, it was...
Damn it!
What was what?
It fell!
I'm very close to the building.
This is it!
Okay, okay, okay.
He couldn't have gone far.
To avoid the traffic jams, he had to run away...
on foot...
or on a motorcycle.
Is that him?
Given the size and thickness,
no doubt about it: it's a rifle!
Haibara, can you hear me?
What a piece of junk!
Haibara! Haibara!
Answer me, Haibara!
What's wrong? I can't hear you.
I can't hear you, where are you?
I'm chasing a suspect's bike.
Professor! Call the police!
I'll do that.
It's registered to Shinjuku Se-3317
and is heading towards Mitsume...
He's turning left!
You can't escape me like that!
What's wrong?
Edogawa? Is everything OK?
Yes. He crossed the Sumida river by the Kototoi bridge...
Damn...
The range of the badge isn't wide enough.
Damn, I'm in his blind spot!
Where is it?
Is he going the wrong way? Don't tell me he's...
- Look out! - He looked like Yaiba!
It can't be true, did he spot me or what?
Why are you here?
Well...
What are you doing here, Sera?
I'll tell you later.
Let's go!
The suspect's motorcycle is registered to Shinjuku Se-3317.
It was last seen crossing the Kototoi-bashi,
heading west on the river.
All cars to follow the motorcycle.
Apprehend the suspect.
What?
Were you at the Bell Tree Tower?
I was following the man who was killed.
On an investigation, you know.
So you were there when it happened.
Yes.
If I expected to be!
I see it.
Hold on tight!
He turned left onto Route 6 and is taking the Kuramae-bashi.
We'll catch him on the bridge.
Roger that. We've blocked the road.
Damn it!
We're going to follow him, so behave yourself!
No, it would be dangerous to insist.
Don't worry,
I'll soon know where he's going.
He's stopping.
If this is true,
he will change his vehicle here.
That would not be good. Let's hurry!
Yes.
But be careful.
I know I will.
I'll just check!
The suspect drives a medium-sized motorcycle.
He's right out front, apparently.
Yes.
- That motorcycle... - Yes.
It's definitely him.
Did he continue on foot?
Oh, my God!
Sera! Hey, Sera!
Agent Camel!
You're mine!
Come on!
Ow, ow...
You okay, Sera?
I'm fine...
If it wasn't for my helmet, I would have stayed there.
You don't look like you're hurt.
But are you okay, Agent Camel?
No problem.
I'm fine thanks to this.
Ah, I see.
But about Jodie's gun...
I know, it's just between us.
It's ruined, it got away.
It's no use.
Let the Japanese police take over.
I'll ask them to search the Tokyo Bay area.
It'll be hard to catch him.
For a SEAL,
the sea is like a playground.
SEALs?
Please take a look at this.
Based on our photos and this sniper's technique,
we have a potential suspect.
Timothy Hunter, 37.
He's a former Navy SEAL, special forces sniper,
who spent three years fighting in the Middle East since 2003.
His many exploits have earned him the title of war hero.
Why would such a hero have...

We think that the cause could be this Silver Star.
Silver Star?
It's a medal of honor awarded to individuals
who have displayed gallantry in action
against an enemy of the United States.
Hunter earned that award in 2005,
but the next year,
it was rescinded for violating the rules of engagement.
Withdrawn?
Yes.
An army sergeant
reported that he shot an unarmed civilian.
Of course, Hunter denied it.
Due to lack of evidence during the investigation,
there was no trial,
...but the affair cost him his reputation as a hero...
and he was nicknamed the "dubious hero".
After this incident, which had undoubtedly upset him
he returned to the battle,
but he lost his usual calm and became isolated.
He was hit in the head by an enemy bullet.
- It is terrible... - What happened to him?
He miraculously survived his surgery.
But once he was discharged, he returned home and...
he was not yet at the end of his days.
He wanted to live a peaceful life
and settled in Seattle, Washington,
but the terrible memories he had of the war
continued to haunt him.
This misfortune that befell him
even affected his wife and sister who lived with them.
He made bad investments,
his sister had her marriage annulled and committed suicide,
his wife died of a drug overdose...
In no time, Hunter had lost his reputation,
his fortune, and even his beloved family.
It's been six years since then,
and Hunter's completely off the grid.
And why exactly is he a suspect in this case?
It was three weeks ago.
A reporter from Seattle named Brian Woods
was found dead, shot with a sniper rifle.
The police, in checking on the victim,
discovered that he had written an article
entitled "The Dubious Hero," and that for this
he had harassed Hunter and his wife to the point of neurosis.
So the police and the FBI made Hunter a suspect
and we found out that he had been in Japan two weeks ago.
Since we were on vacation in Japan,
we were ordered to apprehend him.
I see.
So that brings us to today.
Yes.
Speaking of which, did you find Hunter?
We're searching Tokyo Bay, but we don't have any leads yet.
That's not surprising.
As you know, the acronym "SEAL"
is an acronym for "sea, air and land."
They are particularly good swimmers...
and also good shooters.
Speaking of shooters,
we found some strange objects on the roof
of the building he shot from.
What kind of objects?
- Chiba? - Right away.
On the railing overlooking the Bell Tree Tower,
we found a die and an empty 51 mm shell.
Regarding the shell,
the caliber is 7.62 mm and matches the bullet he used.
It also matches what Hunter used,
a Mk.11 of 7,62 NATO caliber.
- So it's definitely him! - About the gun...
Did you find one
at the crime scene in Seattle as well?
No, nothing like that...
but there's a connection between Hunter and the dice.
what?
Hunter liked dice games
and apparently has a dice tattoo on his left arm.
I see...
It's a bit of a long shot,
but Hunter could actually use it to send a message.
Yes.
But the most obvious clue that points to Hunter
is the victim herself.
How so?
Hunter had a reasonable motive for wanting to kill Mr. Fujinami?
Right
It was Hiroaki Fujinami who, seven years ago,
ruined Hunter by making him invest in a dilapidated property.
- Really? - That explains it...
Then it's this Hunter the culprit, for sure !
By the way Sera, why were you following Mr. Fujinami?
That's right.
Explain to us.
A relative of someone in my class
was going to marry this Fujinami.
He must have found him suspicious because he asked me to investigate.

- My investigation revealed... - Her investigation? Who does she think she is?
That he was swindling foreigners
by selling them dilapidated properties in Japan.
It's true that when I saw him...
It's sad that he got killed, of course,
but maybe it's a good thing the wedding didn't happen.
And if not, in relation to what you were saying,
I don't think the killing will stop there.
No, I don't.
Who else do you think Hunter might target?
- Jodie, the photos. - Right away.
We found at least three other potential targets.
Three, you say?
Yes.
These are the people who are most at risk.
Jack Waltz, 45.
He's the former army captain who accused Hunter
of breaking the rules.
He currently runs a military equipment factory in San Diego.
Next up is Bill Murphy, 35.
He's a former sergeant
Under Waltz's command, who testified
in the Hunter case at the time.
Since his discharge, he has been working as a secretary for Waltz.
He'll have a hard time killing them if they're in San Diego.
No.
These two men are currently in Japan.
What?
Waltz has been in Kyoto with his family for two days,
and Murphy is currently staying in Nikko.
- One in Kyoto... - and one in Nikko?
Yes.
They plan to stay for another eight days.
Finally, the last person...
is Hitoshi Moriyama, 34.
That's Hunter's sister's ex-fiancé, and the cause of her suicide.
He's a businessman who was living in Seattle at the time,
but he went out of business four years ago and we don't know what happened to him.
So of the three, two are in Japan?
They will be targeted for sure!
Let's warn the police of Kyoto and Tochigi without delay.
But also,
put out an urgent APB on Timothy Hunter
as the prime suspect!
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!
A former SEAL shooter, huh?
That's something.
At least I know now that the organization is not involved.
Still,
why did he wait six years for revenge?
Hunter, I mean.
- It's weird, yeah. - Now that you mention it...
Well, it just took him like that.
And more importantly,
no more playing detective, okay?
Do you realize you almost died?
And you too, kid! Stop snooping around!
Yes.
No, but really!
Sera...
this time there was nothing serious,
but don't put Conan...
...into dangerous situations again.
Ran...
Don't worry about it.
I'll protect him no matter what, I promise.
And anyway, no bullet can reach his heart.
Neither will yours.
Well, I'm off,
I left my bike there.
See you, Conan!
It goes in one ear and out the other!
Why did she say that about my heart?
You'd fight off bullets with your karate.
As if that were possible!
Knowing her, she could.
What do you have?
We've got fireworks, and you're shooting your mouth off.
What did you expect?
They saw someone get killed.
Yeah, well, sure...
It's not just about that!
We had taken a lot of pictures, but they took everything!
With our cameras, too.
It's just temporary,
they'll give them back to you soon.
There might be some clues on it, that's why.
It's turned off.
- So did mine. - Same thing.
That's it.
So that cheered you up a little bit?
- It would have taken more. - Yeah, it wasn't enough.
We should have bought more.
Oh, but I had it all planned out.
I saved the best for last!
The balloon belt?
This is a new version.
Throw it as high as you can.
Yeah... Come on, hurry up.
Okay, I'm setting the timer...
Let's do it!
It's high!
Yeah, come on!
- Wow! - All right!
Hooray!
This is fantastic!
I'll call it a firework!
However, the neighbors are not going to be happy.
Oh, boy! What are we going to do, Ai?
Oh, dear...
It's not fair, only Conan did it.

Yeah, first!
Don't you have anything for us?
Oh no, damn...
Is it morning already?
This guy, Hitoshi Moriyama...
I'm sure I've seen his picture in an article or something.
Or was I mistaken?
The FBI sent us these photos.
These are the individuals that Hunter might have to contact.
Yeah, I heard.
I sent three teams to interview them, but...
Can I ask you again to share with us
the information you have?
Of course.
The first one is Scott Green.
He was a chief warrant officer in the army
and runs a motorcycle store in Machida to
enjoy himself while making money.
When he was a SEAL, he was an instructor at the shooting school
and Hunter was one of his students.
Next up was Kevin Yoshino.
He was a sergeant in the Marine Corps
and works at a military supply store in Fussa.
He resells items
that he buys directly from the U.S. Army.
And finally, Mark Spencer.
He wasn't on the list you gave us yesterday.
No, he wasn't.
He doesn't have a direct connection to Hunter,
but he is a former army major
who serves as an advisor to the U.S. military living in Japan.
Hunter doesn't have many friends,
it is possible that he turns to him.
Indeed.
He must have received help from one of them
just to get a rifle in Japan.
Yes.
Right? Tim did what?
I mean, Mr. Hunter... is he being charged with murder?
He's just a suspect at this point.
During the war in the Middle East,
Mr Hunter saved your life, didn't he?
Yes.
Without him, I'd probably be dead.
So if he were to come to you today asking for help...
for example, to get the rifle used in the murder,
an Mk.11, to be precise...
I don't sell guns.
You think this is real?
Shoot it if you want to check.
You met Hunter?
Yes.
He told me he just arrived in Japan.
And you know where he is?
Sorry, I have no idea where he is now.
Whoever did this got away on a motorcycle.
It was a rebuilt motorcycle, with a fake license plate.
Are you accusing me of giving it to him?
Sorry to disappoint you, but I only sell new motorcycles.
What do you think of the accusations made at the time
against Mr. Hunter?
It's probably true.
He went too far in trying to protect his allies.
He mistakenly thought the person was armed and shot.
That is not true!
Mr. Hunter would never do that!
He was framed!
Framed?
This guy Waltz was jealous of Mr. Hunter...
as a former sniper.
Jack Waltz was a sniper?
He stole his Silver Star from Mr. Hunter
and he...
So you think he didn't
breaking any rules?
No, I'm sure he didn't.
Mr. Hunter,
he is a hero who has saved the lives of many of our comrades.
So if he comes to me for help,
...I don't intend to refuse.
I don't know about that.
I have never met anyone named Hunter
and I don't know anything about him either.
Oh, well...
And what is your opinion about the accusations
made against him?
The question is no longer whether it is true or not.
If this Hunter is the killer in this case,
as a former Marine myself, I can't condone his actions.
Eliminate him as soon as you find him.
You want us to take him out?
That said, a police officer is no match for Hunter.
Would you like me to lend you my driver?
- Carlos! - (laughs): Yeah?
This is Carlos Lee,
a former Navy sniper.
He killed 36 enemy soldiers in the Middle East.
If you count the unconfirmed kills,
it comes to 78.
Oh yes, that's right.
That said, it's still below Hunter's 79 kills.
It takes a sniper to defeat another sniper.
So, what's up? Are you taking him?
Beika Library
If it wasn't a newspaper article,
it would have been a women's magazine.
But it's not going to be easy, it looks like.
Okay, spread the card out on the table.
Okay!

Let's start by scoping out the area.
Oh, you're already starting to do your homework?
Of course we are!
That's good!
Such responsible kids deserve a reward.
What? What's this?
A fireworks belt?
No, I can't do that, it disturbs the neighbors.
It's something more practical.
- Our detective badges? - New versions!
I improved their communication function.
He was very offended that someone called them "junk".
What, did you hear me?
I don't see any difference...
You didn't improve anything else?
That's lame.
But no, that's not all.
If you change the setting and press this button...
They glow!
You put in LEDs!
- They look better than before! - Yes!
You can choose the color and who you want to talk to!
That's great!
But it makes a weird noise, right?
Noise?
I don't hear anything, though.
Do you? Can't you hear it, Professor?
It's the Mosquitone.
Very high-frequency sounds become hard to hear with age,
so adults don't hear it.
One of my revisions must have produced it by accident.
I'll have to fix that.
Well, might as well leave it, right?
You never know, the Mosquitone might come in handy.
But...
in the end, it's a defective product.
Talk about a disappointment!
I've lost my motivation.
In that case, I'll cheer you up with a quiz.
What?
- Again? - It's just going to be a pun, right?
Come on, at least listen to him.
If Ai says it...
- Let's hear it for Haibara. - Well, if you must...
Well, let's do it!
If a sniper challenges you to rock-paper-scissors
what do you have to play to win?
Hint: translate "sniper" into English.
What's a sniper?
English, right?
Did you find it, Conan?
Yes...
but you won't like it.
We don't speak English!
- We give up. - What's the answer?
The correct answer is scissors.
The opponent is a sniper,
so he'll play paper!
So to beat him, you just have to play scissors.
He will play "pay fear"?
Does that mean paper?
Is he supposed to play that because it rhymes with sniper?
Scaremonger?
No, you know, paper...
Which of these sports will a sniper be the best at?
One: baseball.
Two: soccer.
Three: golf.
Uh... well...
That's answer number three.
If you pronounce "sni" in slang,
it's "nis per", so nice par.
Good one, Ai!
- You're good, Haibara! - What's a "par"?
You'll be doing the next quizzes.
No! Word games are my specialty!
Let's leave the teacher out of this. Are we doing this homework?
- Yes, we are. - Let's do it!
Boo... I'm going to "have to" leave.
By the way, I heard you lost your smartphone.
The police called, they found it.
Oh my, that teacher...
it was more important than his quiz!
One more thing... Masumi Sera.
Watch out for her. She doesn't tell me anything good.
You can talk.
Can I? Are you leaving, Conan?
He's getting his cell phone back. Let's start without him.
Thank you for visiting.
The library will be closing soon...
This is weird.
Was I dreaming, or what?
Bingo!
Hitoshi Yasuhara...
What? His name is not Moriyama anymore?
He started an import-export company 4 years ago...
His wife is a famous cook...
She runs a cooking school in Honjo...
Excuse me, we're closing soon...
Yes,
I'll put this away right away.
Thank you, sir.
"Mr. Hitoshi Yasuhara
"chose to take his wife's name when he got married."
I see!
That's why he doesn't have the same name anymore.
We were looking for organization,
and instead we have a complicated case...
Yes.
Plus, we're dealing with a former SEAL sniper, no less...
If only Akai were here...
Sorry!
That's okay.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Shu...
I have a question for you.
Between a police sniper or an army sniper,

which one is the better shooter?
It depends.
At 100 yards, it's the police.
They are better in terms of shooting accuracy.
Are they?
Yes.
Police snipers are mostly used for
hostage situations.
In these cases,
it is imperative to deprive your target of all physical ability
in a single, very precise shot.
To kill a human being with a single bullet
and death is immediate,
you have to shoot at only one place.
The brain?
Exactly.
If the target is hit elsewhere, even in the heart for example
he could still fight for about ten seconds.
During this time, the hostages
and the other police officers could be injured.
Where exactly should you shoot, then?
You face the enemy
and aim at the tip of his nose.
Would you feel able to do that?
Don't worry about it.
As long as I'm here, you'll never have to.
I'll see to that.
Shu...
Thanks for everything!
Be careful not to lose it again, okay?
Yes !
Conan? Well then, where have you been?
I lost my cell phone.
That's why you haven't been answering...
I'm sorry.
Is something going on?
Yes.
I think I found Hitoshi Moriyama.
I will ask him if it is him.
Wait, I'll go with you.
Where are you now?
In front of the Azumabashi police station, in Honjo.
What a surprise!
I'm in Honjo, too.
-You are? - Yes, I am.
It must be our destiny to solve this case.
Here, turn left here.
That was fast, Conan.
Yes.
Anything new?
Don't worry, you didn't miss anything.
Well, shall we go in?
- Watch out for the exit of the vehicles. - Damn it!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Run, Conan!
Oh, my God!
The sniper could only have fired from two locations.
Which one do you think it is?
I'm betting on the higher one.
Are you with me?
Yeah, I was thinking that one too.
If we line up Mr. Moriyama's wound with the hole in the glass,
it looks like the bullet was fired from the small building,
but at that time, his car was coming up from the parking lot.
Therefore,
you have to take into account the inclination of the slope
to get the real trajectory of the shot.
As a result,
there's only one building that can fit!
It's this building, right?
Wait, Conan! Don't go alone!
Damn it!
Hey, lady!
You have to go through the reception!
He's really unconscious!
Hunter might still be around...
A three? Don't tell me...
Conan!
Hey, check this out.
We were right, then.
Police Station
So Mr. Moriyama had returned to Japan...
Yes. We were careless.
Since these two men were murdered,
I think it's safe to say Hunter is the killer.
Yes.
The diameter of the bullet also matches the Mk.11 that Hunter used.
The two crime scenes also tend
to suggest that he did it.
How so?
I will let officer Akaboshi explain.
Yes.
Mr. Fujinami usually took his clients to high places
to sell them unsanitary properties.
He probably used the same method with Hunter.
So he would have chosen a time when he was scamming again to kill him?
Yes.
According to the real estate agency,
Mr. Fujinami illicitly obtained several tickets
for the opening of the Bell Tree Tower
and repeated his sales pitch there every day.
As for Mr. Moriyama,
after cancelling his sister's wedding,
he married another woman.
So Hunter probably chose
a place near their house to kill him.
Mr. Moriyama would pick up his wife at the same time every night
to take her from her school to the gym,
so we think he waited for that time.
On the day of the murder,
the door and the camera were destroyed,
which made it easier for him to infiltrate.
He went several times to investigate,
and then he shot with precision and attention to detail...
as one would expect from a former SEAL sniper.
Yes.
Speaking of attention to detail,

did you find a die and a shell this time too?
Yes, I did.
On the roof from which he fired.
You have the picture right here.
This time the die shows the number three.
Last time it was four, right?
You think this is...
a countdown?
Of course it is!
If that's the case,
then Hunter was planning to kill four people in Japan.
He already killed Hiroaki Fujinami
and Hitoshi Moriyama.
So he should kill two more,
each by rolling a die with the number two, then the one.
This is terrible!
If this deduction is correct,
then the next two...
Yes, they will definitely be
Jack Waltz and Bill Murphy.
And by the way..,
both of them have been briefed on the case by the police
and they have changed their plans in Japan a lot.
Their original plan
was to meet in Tokyo in two days,
but they decided to lock themselves away until the case was solved.
Mr. Waltz's family
would prefer to return to the United States as soon as possible,
but since Hunter plans his moves in advance,
there's a chance he might beat them to it and come after them there,
so they're kind of stuck.
Maybe it's better for them this way.
Yes.
All the police precincts are looking for him,
so he can't go where he wants.
And it won't be easy for him now
to get to Nikko or Kyoto, where the roads are most heavily guarded.
This being said, we cannot wait without doing anything.
Hunter is certainly still in Tokyo!
Find him for me at any cost!
- Yes! - Yes, sir!
What is it, Conan?
Yes, yes.
What is it, Conan?
Hunter was murdered?
They're still checking his identity,
but it's pretty sure it's him.
Yes.
I'll let you know when I know more.
We found a journal
in the room where Hunter was hiding.
His translation told us some startling things.
I invite you to look at these pictures.
"August 3.
"He came to provoke me again by stealing my prey.
"He's doing this to challenge me, that's all I see.
"I must kill him at all costs
"and take care of the two remaining preys myself."
Apparently,
someone beat Hunter to the punch
and killed Mr. Fujinami and Mr. Moriyama before him.
Maybe the real culprit then challenged him directly,
and managed to kill him?
In that case, the individual we saw,
it wasn't Hunter...
We believe
that the killer fired from a boat parked on the Sumida River.
And again, on the deck of the boat,
we found an empty shell and a die with the number two on it.
But unlike the other murders,
he shot from a shorter distance this time, from a distance of 150 meters.
And despite this,
there was a bullet hole in the door,
probably from a misfire.
There was also the mark of a missed shot on the deck of the boat,
which the forensics team is analyzing right now.
We have not said anything to the press
about the shell casing and the die, have we?
No.
So if they were present at the scene of the shooting,
that means, including Hunter,
all three victims were killed by the same person.
Conversely, in the Seattle shooting,
there was nothing at the scene.
So you think that only Brian Woods
was killed by Hunter?
Yes.
Well, that would explain it, anyway.
Assuming that theory's correct,
we need to focus on the numbers on the die.
After the four, the three and the two,
that leaves the one...
Is he going to take another victim?
Yes.
But we have no way to prevent it.
Indeed...
Nothing tells us anymore that Hunter's two enemies,
Jack Waltz and Bill Murphy, are the next targets...
No.
And by the same token, it has become impossible
to know who will be the next target.
It couldn't have been worse.
This morning, in the Sumida district of Tokyo,
a third homicide took place
in a dilapidated building in Azumabashi.
The victim is Timothy Hunter, a 37-year-old American.

He is a former SEALS sniper in the U.S. Army,
and he was the prime suspect for the police in this case.
The police have not yet made an official announcement,
but it seems more than clear
that all three murders were committed by the same person!
What? But then...
He will surely make other victims!
And who knows who will be next!
Huh? So it could be anyone?
No, it couldn't be...
but if they don't find him soon,
- nobody is safe... - Did you hear that? It's scary!
Helicopters are swarming around the Sumida River!
So downtown is risky?
I heard the next one will be in Shibuya...
Better to take the underground tunnels, right?
I heard it sucks in Harajuku too!
It's in Harajuku (lol)
They just want to scare you.
Don't be fooled, you idiots!
Takeshita Avenue is empty, it's amazing!
I've never seen that before!
This is Asakusa, right? They keep their kids inside.
This is stupid!
All the victims were adults.
There's no old people in the temple either.
That's crazy!
The first murder was in the Bell Tree Tower.
It's still closed, right?
Besides, I heard it's visible from the other two crime scenes!
Can you see the Bell Tree Tower?
So that's the key to this case?
Anywhere you can see it from is risky, then!
Use an umbrella! We won't be able to see you from above!
You're laughing your head off!
Mouri Detective Agency
reporting from Kinshicho,
where five people have been injured, some seriously.
It's panic all over Tokyo.
The rumor that the culprit is killing at random has spread quickly.
You have to understand people,
a sniper killer in Japan,
is unprecedented.
Here you go.
Thank you, Ran.
Thank you, Ran.
Have you found a suspect?
Well, no...
Honestly, finding Hunter dead,
it threw everything off.
So...
we would have liked your opinion.
I understand that.
Ooh, I don't know if that's gonna get you very far.
Whoever did it
is somehow connected to Hunter, that's for sure.
Yes.
The people in Japan who are connected to him
are his former shooting instructor,
Scott Green, who was also a SEAL sniper...
and Kevin Yoshino, an ex-Marine Corps sergeant.
To tell you the truth,
they've been MIA since last night.
What?
However, they have no motive for wanting to kill Hunter.
So the police have no leads?
Maybe there's another person involved
that we haven't found yet.
No.
You're forgetting someone.
The former commander of the Yokosuka base,
retired admiral Mark Spencer...
- But he... - had a driver!
A former navy sniper,
Carlos Lee.
But neither Spencer nor Lee knew Hunter.
Yeah, they didn't have a motive.
They did: his sniper pride.
- His pride? - That's right.
Hunter killed 79 enemies on the battlefield.
What about Lee?
Uh, wait...
A total of 36.
That's just the confirmed kills.
If you count the others...
Uh, I'm looking at...
I think it was 78.
Right
For Lee, it was unbearable,
because he knew he was a better shot.
That's when Lee heard about
about the murder in Seattle that Hunter was suspected of.
Hunter had reached a record of 80 kills.
So Lee went ahead...
and he killed Fujinami and Moriyama?
So it was 80 all over.
And now that they were tied,
Lee challenged Hunter to a final duel!
- Bang! - Yes, I understand!
We'll investigate that!
Uh... okay?
Thanks for your help!
Thank you!
Way to go, Dad!
It's a stretch, but the numbers add up.
Anyway, whether or not your uncle got it right,
we need more information.
New information, huh?
By the way, the bullet found in Hunter's body
was a 5.56 x 45 millimeter.
It was lighter than the others and didn't go through him.

Was it? Wasn't it the same as the other times?
No.
He received it in the head and yet
we could identify it without any problem because the damage was so small.
Did he use another gun because he was closer?
I suppose so.
Maybe he wanted to increase his chances of killing his target?
And yet, he missed a shot.
That's odd, yes...
Did you discover anything else?
There is one intriguing detail, yes.
When they autopsied the body at the university hospital,
they found him very thin.
- Very thin? - Yes.
He was unrecognizable from when he received the Silver Star.
You'd better do a pathology
in addition to an autopsy, in my opinion.
Oh?
And also, X-rays of his brain.
All right, I'll talk to Detective Megure.
I'll keep you posted.
Conan!
Where are you going? Don't go too far away, it's not safe.
No, don't worry.
I'm just going to get my skateboard back from the teacher.
Wait, Conan!
Yeah, I heard about that.
But who would want to kill Hunter?
I don't know, either.
At least I don't have to worry about Hunter coming to kill me.
I'll have to thank whoever killed him.
Sure, but we have to be careful.
Of course, always.
Even if we forget about the two murders in Japan,
the fact that Brian Woods was killed
means we're in danger too!
You've always worried about nothing.
Even if I was just following your orders,
I still regret what I did
on the battlefield.
It's a little late for that!
It's because of me that you live in luxury,
because you followed my orders and took the Silver Star from Hunter!
Don't forget that!
Yes, I know... sorry.
Don't worry about it.
Look, my family's going back to the U.S. as soon as we find the tickets.
The Japanese police are useless.
You'd better go back as soon as you can.
Yes, sir.
I'll see you there.
Mr. Murphy?
I work at the front desk, and there's a delivery for you.
All right... thanks.
Is this from the base at Yokosuka?
But who...
"I know what you did in the Middle East"?
What's that?
"I don't want to make a fuss,
"but we need to talk about breaking Hunter's rules.
"I've enclosed a ticket for you.
"Come to Tokyo or you'll be court-martialed!"
"Do not say anything to Waltz
"and destroy this message immediately.
"Mark Spencer"?
Oh, my God...
Sure is weird
that he missed his first shot when he was closer to the target.
Yes.
Maybe he was nervous about facing another sniper.
That's not all.
It's suspicious that all the crimes took place in Asakusa.
That's true.
Maybe the distance, the bullets
...and the dice, maybe there's some other meaning behind them?
Yes, Mrs. Jodie?
We did an anatomical pathology on the corpse, as you suggested,
and we discovered a large dose of tranquilizers in his stomach.
And strong ones at that.
Tranquilizers?
We figured out the reason when we did an MRI on him.
He had a bullet fragment lodged near his brain.
And it was from before he died.
It was the bullet that hit him eight years ago, right?
Yes.
His surgery at the time saved him,
but there was still a splinter...
It was putting pressure on his nerves, especially the optic nerves.
He must have suffered from frequent headaches
and it may have affected his vision.
He couldn't see well?
And he still managed to hit his target in Seattle? That's good.
Unless it's the same killer in both cases...
But in that case, he had no reason to kill Hunter.
Yeah, there's a reason.
You're saying...
If I'm right,
then the two murders in Japan and Hunter's
have a whole new meaning . . .
Hello, this is Takagi.
Is that you, Conan?
You're just in time.
Could you give Mr. Mouri a message?
Tell him that unfortunately, Lee had an alibi.
- And also... - There's no time.
Where are Mr. Waltz and Mr. Murphy?
Mr. Waltz is still in Kyoto,
...but Mr. Murphy said he would be fine and he ignored our warnings.

He took an express train to Tokyo this morning at nine o'clock.
Apparently he had an appointment, so he was sent a ticket.
He received a ticket?
If he left at nine...
He must arrive at 11 o'clock in Asakusa, from what I understand.
Oh no!
If this is a trap set by the killer...
he'll be in a place where he can see the station!
Besides, his target will be wisely sitting in the place he reserved for him!
So he must be near the station!
We have to hurry up, there are only 3 minutes left!
Watch out, Mr. Murphy is going to be killed!
What do you mean, Conan?
Hello?
Is the train here yet?
Well, it's slowing down on the bridge...
Is there a car stopped on the bridge?
Maybe.
He's got a gun!
No... Is he going to shoot from there?
No time to turn around!
Conan!
You think...
he's going to shoot while the train is moving?
I have to block it until the train passes.
Please let me...
Come on!
This way, Mr. Murphy!
In a few moments, our train will arrive...
Come on, realize the danger!
Oh, boy!
Hey, Mr. Murphy!
Conan!
Look out, look out!
Will be...
What the hell is that?
Die.
Sera! Hold on!
What's wrong with you?
Damn it!
No !
Damn it!
Operation in progress
You're not hurt, are you okay?
Yes.
There's blood on your clothes...
- It's not mine. - Conan!
Inspector Megure!
Can we talk to you?
I don't like shots...
Why don't we go home?
Is she almost done, mom?
So he doesn't kill randomly,
he was after Murphy from the beginning...
Thanks, that's what I wanted to check out.
So maybe Hunter and the killer were working together...
How so?
Thanks to the FBI's help, we just got
some new information.
What's this about?
Eight years ago, Hunter...
received a head wound that left him with permanent damage.
He was no longer able to shoot a gun, apparently.
But in Hunter's journal,
he seemed to talk about challenging the perpetrator...
That was a lie.
We think Hunter had the perp kill him.
- What? No way! - No way!
By orchestrating his own death, he was the prime suspect,
he messed with the investigation
and made Murphy, his next target, drop his guard,
so he could kill him.
He probably planned it all along.
When the perpetrator targeted Hunter,
the reason he missed his first shot from 150 yards away
it's probably because
even if that's what Hunter wanted, he hesitated to shoot.
And if he used a lighter bullet for this kill only,
it's probably because his regard for Hunter
made him not want to damage his body too much.
I see...
And Hunter had poor eyesight, so when he fired back,
he had no intention of hitting him.
He realized that the perpetrator was hesitating and sent him a message.
Yeah. And as a result,
it makes more sense of this strange situation
in which two experienced snipers, at close range,
both miss.
But isn't it a bit dangerous to base a deduction on that alone
to make a deduction?
No.
We have evidence to support this hypothesis.
Evidence, you say?
We had our colleagues analyze the videos
taken by Conan and his friends at the Bell Tree Tower during the murder,
and in addition to the killer, we can see...
another person who could be his accomplice.
It's true!
Yes, there are two of them!
Hunter is supposed to be a spotter, that is, an observer...
SEALs don't normally use spotters...
Maybe they wanted to be careful
for their first shot in Japan.
Unless...
Hunter must have figured he'd never be free
from his terrible headaches and deteriorating eyesight.
So he entrusted his revenge and his own death to his accomplice...
Wait, there is still the mystery of the die.
Yes...
This time again,
a shell and a die were found at the scene of the shooting.
What number is it this time?

In fact, it was not the "one"...
but the number five.
What?
Wasn't it a countdown?
After four, three and two...
it should have been one!
What the hell does that mean?
I thought it was indicating the remaining targets
as a message to Mr. Waltz...
I guess our way of thinking
our way of thinking was too limited.
Maybe he had another reason to go after Mr. Waltz
than to have pushed his family to suicide...
In any case,
we must find Kevin Yoshino and Scott Green as soon as possible!
Whoever did this, I will not let them get away with it!
There won't be another murder, I swear it!
The Asakusa district and the numbers on the dice...
really don't mean anything to you?
Don't make me repeat myself!
I don't care about Asakusa or the dice!
You'd better hurry up and arrest Scott Green!
He is the guilty one, for sure!
It's just that...
we still don't have enough evidence.
What a joke!
I see that it's useless to talk to you.
Thank you for the waste of time!
Mr. Waltz.
Whatever happens, stay away from Tokyo.
As you can see from the map, the culprit is
will probably strike again in the Asakusa district.
I didn't mean to, I'm not crazy!
Well, and if not,
hurry up and get me plane tickets to go back home!
Thanks to Murphy's sacrifice, I know exactly where the killer is.
If I don't get home now, he will have died for nothing.
What a creep.
To say that about the death of his comrade...
If this guy is pursuing Hunter's revenge,
then he knows what I did eight years ago!
Damn it... I have to do something!
What, now?
Hello?
It's you!
Masumi Sera
Conan.
Let us take care of Sera.
Don't worry, she'll be fine.
The doctor said she'll be fine.
I'll call you as soon as she wakes up.
Will you do that?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Still, he was lucky.
If Sera hadn't been there,
the kid would have been in danger.
Yes.
She stepped in and took the bullet for him.
She really risked her life...
She said so, remember?
Don't worry.
I'll protect him no matter what, I promise.
And anyway, no bullet can reach his heart.
Neither will yours, for that matter.
I think about it, but she also said the same thing about your heart...
He'll pay for this.
The creep who did this to Conan
put Conan and Sera through all this...
I'll never forgive him!
Ran...
Shu... Big brother...
Shu...
Who's Shu?
That must be her brother, right?
She did say she had an older brother who died.
Oh, I didn't notice that bunch of flowers.
Oh, yeah, here.
Did someone drop it off?
Who is it from?
I've no idea.
But look at it, Sonoko, it's beautiful!
I admit it!
- Let's put it by the window. - Let's do that.
I'll borrow a vase.
What's wrong, Ran?
Nothing.
Any news about Green and Yoshino?
Well...
Several witnesses seem to have seen Green in Kansai,
...so they're actively searching for him, focusing on Osaka.
Would he be looking to nail Waltz on the way to the Kansai airport?
I don't like this.
The timing is too perfect.
If this is a decoy to facilitate Yoshino's actions...
Detective Megure.
Yes ?
James, there's something I have to warn you about.
What is it?
If it's about Green, officer Camel has already...
No, it's something more serious.
Apparently, Waltz is missing.
What's happened?
We are as surprised as you are.
According to the Kyoto station..,
after their interrogation,
...he told his wife he would return the next day...
and left through the back door of the hotel.
But why? What does he intend to do?
Something must have happened.
- Yes... - I'll let you know when I know more.
Yes, Mrs. Jodie?
Officer Takagi told me on the sly about the Green information.
What about him?
Mr. Waltz is missing?
I don't know what got into him.
If we could just figure out what the numbers on the dice mean...

I think we can find out where Waltz is going.
Do you think he's going to go where the next shot is?
I'm not sure.
But there are still some things we don't know
about who did it and about Waltz.
There must be something that connects them.
Yes...
I'll reexamine the connections between the victims and the suspects.
I'll call you back later.
It's okay, Camel.
- We can go now. - I'll be right there.
We'll join the first division and listen to their report.
Agreed, I count on you.
Waltz left saying that he would return the next day.
This means that
that a new attack will take place in the next 24 hours.
I've given you the full report. I'm counting on you in case of need.
I have everything you asked for.
Completely untraceable.
And the adjustment?
Everything has been adjusted.
I wouldn't expect anything less from you, Carlos.
You are the best.
I mean, with Hunter.
How about I let you handle the sniper?
You really would be number one after that.
You were one death away from hunter after the war, right?
I'm just following Spencer's orders in giving you that gun.
Let it go.
If the target is who I think it is, I don't need your help.
Thanks for the gun.
I have a message from Admiral Spencer.
There will be no investigation into the source of the murders.
Eliminate the sniper at all costs
and preserve the credibility of the United States Army.
The source of the murders?
What does he know?
Probably everything.
What? But how?
There's only one person alive who knows about this...
and that's me!
The sniper used the admiral's name
to scare Bill Murphy.
Murphy was terrified.
The day before he died,
he requested a plea bargain.
He sent an e-mail to the admiral
in which he confessed to the theft of Hunter's Silver Star,
your orders after that and everything else.
What?
Your crimes from eight years ago
are unforgivable, but...
we couldn't let an american soldier
commit more murders in another country.
Since he knows everything,
you tell the admiral...
that when this case is over,
I'd like to talk to him.
There's one more thing.
What is it, sir?
Did you get the meaning of the dice?
What's the point?
Now that we know the killer, who cares?
We have just received new information
regarding Mr. Bill Murphy,
who was found dead yesterday at approximately 11:00 a.m. on the Ohruri express train.
It appears that he is related to Timothy Hunter, the previous victim.
As for the woman who was found involved,
she is said to be on the mend.
That's it for our special report.
Huh? But he wasn't killing randomly, then!
That's what I said!
Because of your irresponsible speech,
you caused a panic all over Tokyo!
Didn't you? Did I do that?
Oh dear, I'm sorry!
I swear to you... A real pain in the ass, that guy.
Uncle!
Sera has woken up.
We're going to visit her now.
Sorry, go without me.
I want to try a little more to understand this mess.
- He continues despite his sleepless night... - If the last number fits,
then I've solved the mystery of the dice!
Is it true?
Yeah!
I'm a great detective, me!
I'll solve it in one night, easy.
So what does that mean?
Well, this, you see...
is a countdown!
The bridge shook, that's all.
So the die he had put on the "one"
tipped over to a "five"!
See, that solves the whole mystery... right?
Hey, kid! Where'd it go?
It's not a countdown.
There must be another way...
I have to go check with Sera about yesterday's thing...
There!
A clear line of fire.
Yes! I found it!
This is the best spot in Chigusa to shoot!
Checkmate!
That's you!
I've eliminated Murphy,
now it's your turn!
But why you?
It's the money, right?
How much did he pay you? I'll give you double!
You haven't changed, Waltz.

How about a deal?
You're in a foreign country,
you could use a little money, right?
Tomorrow night,
come to Chigusa, in Asakusa, at 8pm sharp.
We'll talk about it.
Yeah, OK.
Chigusa in Asakusa.
If you confess to all your crimes,
I will let you live.
But if you are late,
you can kiss your family goodbye...
Understand?
Hello? Hello?
Wait, I... !
Damn it!
Helen... Sarah...
Mr. Waltz! This is terrible!
Scott Green was caught on camera at Shin Osaka station!
It would be too risky to go to the airport.
I'm sorry, but you'll have to delay your return.
Damn... so it's kill or be killed!
This is the best shooting spot in Chigusa.
He'll come here for sure,
it's a sniper's dream location.
But tonight, the target will not be me...
but him!
Only a sniper can beat another sniper.
In a sniper fight,
you have to anticipate what your opponent is going to do,
gain a tactical advantage,
and above all...
whoever is in the best position guarantees victory.
Now that I have found this place,
victory is mine!
You'll regret challenging me.
Say hello to Hunter in hell!
Oh, Conan...
did you come alone?
Yes, the others will come by car afterwards.
Oh, right.
I was going to go down to the store downstairs,
I was going to go down to the store,
do you want to come?
No, I'll wait here.
- Shall we go, Sonoko? - Yes, we shall.
See you in a minute, Sera!
- All right, thanks. - We won't be long.
Call if you have any problems.
I will.
Hey, Conan.
Glad to see you didn't get shot.
I haven't thanked you yet for saving me.
You don't have to,
I was just keeping my promise to Ran.
What about the culprit?
The two suspects are still missing.
Oh well...
When I was shot at yesterday..,
I was curious about something.
The shooter was using the laser pointer of his gun.
Don't you think that's strange?
They don't usually use it.
It might alert their target,
even give away their position.
I see...
That's why Hunter chose confrontation over suicide...
Right? What are you talking about?
If he killed himself, it would have ended the investigation,
and Murphy and Waltz would have let their guard down.
But he didn't do that.
But yes!
This was his final test to make the perp
a true cold-blooded sniper!
For the first kill, he tested the maximum range of the Mk.11.
For the second, he tested the shooting at a moving target.
And for the third he tested
his ability to keep his cool.
Until his death, Hunter did everything he could
to make him the best sniper!
So the culprit...
Are you okay?
Yeah, don't worry about it.
Hi, we're here to visit you!
Genta, you're talking too loud!
- Oops, sorry. - Ah, Conan!
What are you carrying?
Something really nice, isn't it?
Yes !
It's to cheer him up, right?
- Yeah! - That's what it is!
Wow, that's great!
Did you do it by yourself?
Yes !
It's for our summer paper.
Well, it's not finished yet...
but we wanted to show it to you.
Thank you, guys!
You did great!
Yes, it's very well done.
We changed the shape of the buildings a bit,
but their size and position are correct!
Ai checked everything!
But one of us hasn't done anything yet...
It is not finished yet?
It looks very good to me already.
What do you have left?
Well, we still have to paint it.
But when we visited the tower the other day,
we could only take pictures of the west side.
So we don't know the color of the buildings.
We would have liked to go back up before painting it...
We go back, then?
The repairs are finished but it did not reopen yet,
so we'll have it to ourselves.
- Seriously? - For real?
Yay!
What?
Our model will be perfect!
Say Haibara,
the buildings are to scale, right?
Yes.
Let's go home and get our cameras.
Yes !

What's wrong with you, Conan?
I have a feeling...
I could see what was invisible on a map.
You're going to help us with the painting, I hope!
Did Conan see anything?
What? What are you looking at, Conan?
Hey, that's funny!
What is?
When you look from there,
it looks like the buildings we made
are exactly the same size!
Conan!
Excuse me, Genta, give me your seat.
Go ahead and look.
- Oh, right! - That's funny!
That's it, that's it!
This message wasn't meant to be read in 2D...
It was meant to be viewed in 3D!
Here it is!
From this angle,
the first two shooting spots are aligned.
Where are the other two?
The third one was on the boat,
and the last one was on the Komagata-bashi...
If you look at them from the same angle as before, it makes...
an isosceles trapezoid.
Wait a minute...
If you add the roof of the Bell Tree Tower observatory...
it forms a pentagon!
It's too perfect to be a coincidence.
They did it on purpose, that's for sure!
Ran, I forgot something so I'm going in first!
Conan!
Aren't you coming to the Bell Tree Tower?
Be careful, Conan.
No, not this time!
Waltz said he'd be back in Kyoto today.
That means...
...he's going to finish by 8:00 p.m., then take the Shinkansen.
Damn, I have to be quick!
Hi, cool kid. I got news for you.
Osaka police arrested Scott Green.
Hunter allegedly asked him to go to Osaka
and stay hidden until tonight.
So...
Yes.
He more or less sensed that Hunter
was coming to Japan for revenge.
When he saw how determined he was to die for it
he decided to let him fulfill his last wish.
If it was a decoy, then the culprit is...
Yes.
Ah, and FBI headquarters reported something else.
After he lost his family,
Hunter was living with a man of Oriental descent, according to a witness.
What if it was Kevin Yoshino?
That would be plausible, yes.
Got it. Thank you, Ms. Jodie.
By the way, where are you now?
I'm on my way to where I think the next shot is going to be.
What? Did you solve the dice puzzle?
I'm not sure yet, I'm going to check it out, but...
I'm running out of time!
Is there anything we can do?
If my deduction is correct,
the Bell Tree Tower observatory should still be involved.
The Bell Tree?
- Okay, let's go there! - Yes!
Be careful!
- Let's go. - Yes!
According to the model, it should be here...
From this building
we should be able to see them.
The Bell Tree...
The building from which he killed Mr. Fujinami
and the one he killed Mr. Yasuhara from.
Yes! They're lined up like on the model.
That means...
if we connect them with the other shooting spots,
it makes an isosceles trapezoid.
And if we add the Bell Tree observatory...
Yeah, no doubt about it:
it's a pentagon.
If we assign the numbers of the dice to each point and add
the two remaining to the Bell Tree...
I see, so that was it!
What the killer wanted to show
to Mr. Waltz, his final target...
is a star!
The star represents the Silver Star he stole from Hunter.
All along, the killer and Hunter
wanted Waltz to see that star!
So...
the first die was placed in advance
at the first Bell Tree Observatory
and it is also from there that he will shoot again !
He is there!
So the killer was indeed...
Kevin Yoshino!
Damn it!
Where is he aiming?
If he wants to form a perfect star,
he'll need a place a little higher up...
That's where Waltz must be !
Here ?
You will greet Hunter in hell!
Come on Waltz, come near the window.
The moment you decipher our message
will be your last.
This time, I will prevent it!
I will finally be free of the ghost of Hunter.
Everything ends tonight...
What the...
That wasn't there before!
They put it there for me to see?
Come on!
Die.

What was that flash?
It came from that building...
What? That kid again?
Damn it!
You're going to...
pay for this!
You little brat!
Damn, I got nowhere to run on this roof!
My leg...
Oh, no, you don't!
You brat!
You ruined everything, everything!
Did he? Did he get shot?
But to be able to reach him at that height...
Is he over there?
Another sniper?
How is that even possible?
The only place to aim from here..,
is the Asakusa Sky Court...
But that building...
Finally, if you shoot from the Bell Tree Tower, you're safe.
But if Waltz deciphers the message
...and he shoots at me from the Asakusa Sky Court...
Don't worry about it.
The only sniper who could shoot accurately from that distance
doesn't exist anymore.
Yes, I suppose so.
- Since your eyes don't see well... - No.
Even I couldn't have done that at this range.
Was there a better sniper than you, Tim?
Yeah, at the FBI.
A prodigy we called the Silver Bullet.
But there's nothing to worry about.
He's missing and presumed dead.
Impossible... is that him?
The famous Silver Bullet has appeared?
Subaru?
What's he doing here?
I see...
He solved the mystery of the dice too.
Conan? We've arrived at the Bell Tree.
We're negotiating our way up.
Great, get up to the observatory quickly.
Yoshino is up there!
So he was the killer.
Yes... so what are they saying?
It's dead.
The owner has reserved the tower.
They won't let us...
But by the way...
Mrs. Jodie, Ran and the others made the reservation!
Explain to them so they'll let you up...
And stop Yoshino!
Got it, we'll ask Inspector Megure for help!
- It's so beautiful! - Isn't it?
We have a great night view from here too.
It's stylish!
It's even more beautiful at night!
Yeah, totally!
Well, let's go shoot the other sides!
Yeah, let's do it!
Shinichi?
I couldn't incapacitate him...
I can't give up after getting this far!
I promised Mr. Hunter...
Well, you've improved.
Now all we need is for you to gain experience through practice.
All right, fine. First I'll kill Brian Woods,
and then I'll kill Waltz.
Are you really sure about this?
It's a little late,
but I'm sorry I got you involved in this.
What are you talking about, Tim?
I can't count the times you've saved me on the battlefield,
and now I finally have a chance to repay my debt!
I know, but...
Besides,
Waltz and the others don't deserve forgiveness.
Just because your exploits overshadowed them,
they stuck you with a fake crime!
They stole your Silver Star!
And as soon as we asked for a counter investigation,
Waltz ordered Murphy...
to eliminate you!
Yes... that's right.
If you hadn't suspected
and compared the bullet to Murphy's gun,
we never would have learned the truth...
But they stole all my evidence,
and in the end...
Kevin... I'm asking you again.
Avenge my wife and sister,
and send Waltz and everyone who destroyed my life
to burn in hell!
Yes, you have my word.
I swear to you!
I will send them to hell in their place.
I count on you!
Yes...
I can't give up yet.
If I follow the plan, I can escape.
And I can kill Waltz!
Now, that's why you have to leave quickly!
But... what about the killer?
Don't worry about that, the FBI is coming!
Yes, I got it!
The fire escape is here.
Yes, sir.
Sonoko!
- Who are you? - Let Ayumi go!
Are you crazy? Go hide!
- But... - Ayumi is...
Go away, kids!
No... Sonoko!
Shut up, you brats!
Stay here quietly!
I'll keep this one with me.
Don't come any closer!
We're FBI, drop the gun!
Shut up!
Come forward and I'll shoot the kid!
Shooting lights?
The bastard, he didn't give up!
Don't let him go in the back.
Get him closer...
Don't move, I said!
You want me to kill it?

Come on, let's save Ayumi!
Yes !
Don't be silly!
He's got a gun, you know?
I have to save her...
Sonoko! Hold on, Sonoko!
Shinichi...
What should I do? Come and help me!
Damn it, I can't do anything from here!
Cut the crap!
Drop your weapons, or I'll kill her!
If I want to save the hostage,
I have to kill him in one shot.
But for that...
To kill a human being with a single bullet
and for death to be immediate,
...you have to shoot in one place.
The brain?
Exactly.
I don't have a choice!
Damn it, I can't go through with this...
Jodie!
Yoshino!
He took the bait!
Oh no, what's going on?
You can't see anything!
Is it a breakdown?
Quiet, you two, get back!
Damn, the lights are out.
Subaru won't be able to shoot!
I see...
He was going to use the darkness to escape.
What should I do?
Oh no...
If we don't do anything, he'll take Ayumi away!
Oh, my God... Night vision goggles!
Run away, Mrs. Jodie!
Yoshino, surrender!
Camel!
Answer me, Camel!
This sucks!
At this rate, they'll all be killed!
If only there were a light
Subaru could shoot him...
But with my injured leg...
How could he see it?
Wait a second...
His binoculars, I think they're an old model.
If that's the case,
I just have to light up the Bell Tree Tower...
That's it!
If I use the height...
Can you do that?
I mean...
I absolutely have to do it!
Edogawa?
Hello, sir.
Shine the light on him!
Shine a light on him!
He's wearing night vision goggles, it'll blind him.
But how will we know where he is?
Yeah, that's it, with this.
Got it.
He'll be near you soon.
Stay still for 30 seconds so he doesn't get suspicious!
I'm hanging up now.
Do you understand me? For 30 seconds
we must not move!
Yes !
I'll get another chance.
The kid's going to create one for me, I know it.
Come on, let's make it work...
Are you ready?
Yes.
I'll press it.
Then, the sound comes from where?
Shh, wait!
There it is!
- Great! - Forward!
Now!
What's that?
Yoshida! This way!
Ai!
Damn kids!
Hurry and run!
Ran!
Don't do it, Ran!
Ran!
Damn it... I don't have time to hesitate!
What should I do, Shinichi?
You gave me a hard time...
I'm changing hostages!
It's make or break.
But, come on!
I'm coming...
Ran!
Let's go!
I've got it.
What's it?
What's this?
Ran!
This is for Sonoko.
This is for Ayumi...
And this is for Sera!
Yes, Yoshino's under control.
- She's got it! - Too strong, Ran!
Ran!
Sonoko!
That was so cool, Ran!
Uh, but are you okay?
I didn't follow everything, but yes, I'm fine.
By the way, why is it so dark? Is it closing time?
Oh, you then...
Damn, you got no mercy.
Target is under control.
All clear.
Yeah, Jodie just gave me her report.
Good work. I'll be in touch.
Aye, sir.
With my own beam of light
Slowly I was looking for you
And I will continue to illuminate you
With the invisible light of love
My dream last night took my breath away
You had become like a stranger
I don't want this flame to go out
Or I'll sink into the darkness of anguish
I'm still all alone
As I try to pass the night
With my own beam of light
Slowly I was looking for you
I know my invisible light of love
Is close to you
Even if our hearts are far, far, far away
I will never, never, never let you go
I ran to you, my feelings overflowing
To grab your hand, like a prayer
I don't want to give up anything of you
To the unyielding darkness of time
If we could be together
We would dance every night
With my own beam of light
I was looking for you
With my own beam of light
I found you at last
And I know I'll continue to shine on you
With the invisible light of love

Our hearts were hidden far, far, far away
But I'll never, never, never let you go again
Never again...
I'll never let you go
You'll finally get out tomorrow.
Yes, thank you for taking care of me.
You bet, it's a cinch!
By the way, they talked about Waltz on TV.
Apparently, the case of the serial murders
...has lifted the lid on all the crimes he committed.
He will probably stay in jail for the rest of his life.
The culprits of the murders were his victims,
and they wanted revenge, I heard.
Still, Ran..,
you did pretty well against that guy with the machine gun!
I really saw red...
You're lucky you got away with just a few scratches!
I was scared to death that he'd hit you in the heart!
Oh you know, I'm pretty lucky.
You're safe!
The only one who can put a bullet in your heart...
is him!
Oh yes, that's right!
Your beloved Shinichi!
- Are you done, Sonoko? - Yes... Well, for now.
Are you all right, Conan?
Don't try to sweet-talk us.
You've done nothing so far, so let's get to work.
Come on, the pool's waiting!
Yes !
Sorry to leave you, Haibara..,
but watch him for us, okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, don't stop.
They're abusing me...
they're going to let me finish it all by myself?
