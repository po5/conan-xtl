New York
Here is now the centerpiece of this auction.
An international treasure, the pride of all humanity...
It was thought lost forever:
one of Vincent Van Gogh's Sunflowers!
I don't know these Sunflowers...
I thought it had been burned during the war!
A little silence, please.
We will explain in detail.
It is said that Van Gogh painted seven Sunflowers when he lived in Arles.
This is the second painting in the series.
In 1945, it was lost in the flames of the
it was lost in the flames of war in Ashiya, Japan.
But last year, a painting of the same composition was discovered in Arles.
Several experts have examined it
and confirmed that it was undeniably painted by Van Gogh.
Now it's up to you to bring it back to life!
For the legendary lost work of Vincent Van Gogh,
the second of the Sunflowers...
The auction starts at 10 million dollars!
Well, they start strong!
And they all go up by a hundred thousand.
If I had that much money, I would take a trip into space.
I've got 20 million on the phone...
and 20.5 million on the Internet.
Fifty million.
- This man... - He's a celebrity buyer.
So it's over?
One hundred million!
What, are you deaf?
I said one hundred million! One hundred million dollars!
Will we get someone for a hundred and ten million?
What the hell... Who's that old mustachioed guy?
What do we do?
It's okay, we'll raise it to 200 million.
Okay, fine.
Two hundred million!
- That's Mr Suzuki! - Is he serious?
Yes, 200 million here!
If I heard right,
number 705 has offered 200 million...
But it's the famous Mr. Suzuki!
- Let's wait for the auction on the net... - Say, Uncle...
they think you're crazy!
I don't like to waste my time shopping.
You call this shopping?
No need to wait for the other bids!
Three hundred million.
Three hundred million dollars!
Sold, sold!
It's sold for $300 million!
- Conan, it's starting! - I'll be right there.
- Hurry, hurry. - The Sunflowers, bought at a price never seen before...
What did you make this time?
What is it? A robot?
Come on, professor! Hurry up! Hurry up!
Wait, the most important thing is missing.
Why hadn't we heard about this painting before?
Well, this piece burned down during World War II.
It burned?
So this one is just a replica?
That's what we thought until now, but no!
Look at this. This is from last year...
A Van Gogh-like painting was found in Arles, France.
Yes, I remember it, it was in an old attic, I think?
That's right. It's this painting that was just sold.
Hey, I'll start!
- Yeah! - Finally!
I got the big one.
I press these buttons...
- Is he going to make a bowl of eel rice? - Uh, don't dream too much...
Is it possible that it's fake?
The experts were very careful.
It underwent a very thorough examination before being put up for auction.
They determined that it was painted on the same canvas
that was used for another Van Gogh painting in Arles.
If it's something better, then... a big bowl of rice with eel?
Why does it have to be eel?
Ah! It's coming out!
- What's that? - It's still a watermelon.
Another failure?
Wait a minute!
Kamen Yaiba!
That's great!
It's Kamen Yaiba!
- So classy! - How did you do it?
But what is he doing...
- He could do something more useful. - So Ashiya's was a fake?
Well...
that is indeed a possibility.
The other hypothesis is that Van Gogh
did not paint seven Sunflowers, but eight in truth.
One of them, the one of Ashiya or the one sold this time,
could be a copy made by Van Gogh.
A copy made by the painter himself, is it possible?
Yes, and in fact, among the seven known Sunflowers,

three are copies, but they were all painted by
- painted by Van Gogh. - That's all very well, Van Gogh,
but you might want to take a look at the professor's invention.
It's quite a work of art, too.
A work with an original flavor...
I did it!
Oh, the press conference is about to begin!
Let's take a look at these images, live from New York.
Well, I'll let the buyer of the Sunflowers speak:
Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki.
A few words, please?
I am happy to have placed the highest bid
and won as planned.
You planned to go up to 300 million?
Yes, I did.
And that was for the purpose of opening an art exhibition in Japan.
An exhibition, you say?
The Suzuki Group tells you
that we intend to gather all the Sunflowers in the world
and that our Lake Rock Gallery will soon host
will soon host the exhibition "Sunflowers Raised to Japan"!
Miss Suzuki!
How many paintings are we talking about?
Will the Sunflowers you have just acquired be part of it?
Of course! Everything was planned
to make this announcement here and today.
As for the number of paintings,
with the one today, we will have seven!
You will have all seven?
Even for a large Japanese group, this seems difficult to achieve!
No worries. The project is progressing at a good pace.
For a while now,
we have been contacting all the individuals or museums that own the Sunflowers
to tell them about our wish to exhibit the complete series.
And since we have kept our commitment to win this auction
they have already given us their cooperation!
In addition...
we have hired seven specialists
to ensure the preservation, transportation and security of the paintings!
Seven specialists?
These are the "seven samurai" I have summoned for the occasion!
Your "seven samurai" are these people?
Exactly
They are all experts having received training
in countries related to Van Gogh, such as Holland or France.
On the far left, the person in charge of evaluation and art history,
- Ms. Natsumi Miyadai. - Nice to meet you.
Natsumi Miyadai in charge of the evaluation
Next, our painting expert
In charge of the preservation of the paintings: Mr. Koji Azuma.
Koji Azuma in charge of the maintenance of the paintings
Then comes the person in charge of the planning:
Ms. Keiko Anderson.
Keiko Anderson in charge of planning
I am Keiko. Nice to meet you.
Next is Mr. Taizo Ishimine, who will manage the transportation of the paintings.
Taizo Ishimine Transportation Officer
Hello.
And this is the director and organizer of the exhibition,
Ms. Kumiko Kishi.
Kumiko Kishi Organizer
I promise to make this exhibition a success.
Finally, our security officer,
Lieutenant Charlie of the New York Police Department.
NYPD Lieutenant Charlie
I'll be the one protecting the Sunflowers.
Excuse me, but didn't you say there were seven samurai?
There are only six people here.
As for the last one,
he will be here to provide security when we return to Japan.
And his name is...
Kogoro Mouri!
What, he's uncle, his seventh samurai?
It's probably because he knows that the Kid Killer will be with him.
Good luck, "Kikuchiyo".
Wow!
Look, Sonoko is on TV!
Oh yes, it is!
- Let's go watch! - Yes, let's!
And if you didn't have the seven paintings,
would you still hold this exhibition?
No, it's the seven or nothing.
- But then... - There's nothing to worry about.
Holding this exhibition has been a dream for a long time.
And there is no dream
that I can't achieve!
But this is...
A card from Kid!
Watch out, he's armed!
Call security!
Drop the gun!
Are you deaf? I said drop the gun!
No...
Hey, you can't see!
Something's going on!
Kid!
Kid!
Stop, or we'll shoot!
What's the matter?
Don't move!
Don't move, or we'll shoot!

We've got Kid trapped on the 102nd floor, in the east hallway!
Kid!
Drop the gun, come on!
All right, now slowly raise your hands...
and get on your knees.
Didn't you hear me? Raise your hands so I can see them!
Kid!
There, that's good.
Easy... there you go.
Don't shoot, Charlie!
That damn Kaito Kid!
He got away from us.
Despite the chaos, no one's been hurt.
- The NYPD is still in pursuit of Kaito Kid... - Huh, is it over already?
Did Kid steal the Sunflowers or not?
It's weird, usually Kid only steals jewels!
Everything happened very quickly, but...
Was it really Kid?
Do you need help?
What are you doing here?
I heard Kid's trying to steal the Sunflowers.
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to give you a hand.
DETECTIVE CONAN THE SUNFLOWERS OF HELLFIRE
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug,
and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name...
I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa /Conan Doyle
In order to find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
On the other hand,
the professor isn't the only one who knows my true identity.
This is Ai Haibara.
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She used to work with the men in black,
but to escape from the organization,
she swallowed the same drug as me
and also became younger.
There is also...
Kaito Kid and his assistant.
I still have some scores to settle with them.
On my honor as a detective,
this time I swear to catch them!
My body has become younger, but not my mind!
I will solve all the mysteries!
There is still...
only one truth!
We start our descent to Haneda airport.
During landing, please store your luggage
in the overhead compartments
Sunflowers Raised to Japan at the Lake Rock Museum August 1-31
or under your seat.
Here is the dummy we picked up.
It looks like you're having fun.
My uncle always gets screwed,
so this makes him feel less alone!
That said... is this reasonable?
You won't even let the flight attendants near you,
but you let this young man in like that...
Yes.
He is a detective representing Japan,
there's nothing to worry about.
But what if it was Kid in disguise?
Especially since they have the same build...
You are worrying too much.
Look closely.
You see that?
Are you out of your mind, Grandpa?
It was to convince Charlie.
What's this American doing on board anyway?
Your job was to protect the painting until we got to the airport.
You didn't have to come to Japan.
It's true that my contract was only for the United States,
but now that I know that Kid wants the painting..,
I can't stand by and do nothing.
And that's why I chose you as my samurai!
I count on you to protect the Sunflowers!
Of course you are.
All that's missing is the Kid Killer,
and everything would be perfect!
Are you all right, Natsumi?
Yes, I'm just a little carsick.
Maybe it would be good for you to walk around a bit.
Come on, it's not good to sit around too much.
I'm fine, thank you.
Where are you going?
To the bathroom.
Haneda Airport
You can't be serious... Kid might be getting off,
so what's with the flashy plane?
We advised him to keep a low profile...
but he wanted to use it as a publicity stunt.
It was your job to reason with him, Detective Nakamori!
Because you still believe that this old man listens to me?
Well, what's done is done...
Wow!

Is he taking that plane back?
And the painting with the sunflowers, is it inside?
No, but I swear, why do you have to stick us everywhere?
It's not his fault,
it's Mr. Jirokichi who insisted we take him.
Isn't that right?
Don't forget that Conan is the Kid Killer!
What you shouldn't hear, really...
Don't do anything stupid!
You're just an extra, right?
Yes...
Ran! Keep an eye on him, will you?
I'm still trying, but hey...
Who could it be? I'll be right back.
Oh it's you, Sonoko!
Ran?
We'll be landing soon..,
But I wanted to give you a heads up first.
He wanted to surprise you..,
so he asked me not to tell you, but...
Is Shinichi here?
Just because Shinichi's on board doesn't mean I'll...
Hello, Sonoko? Is Shinichi with you?
Yes, well, he was sitting there a minute ago...
Sonoko, what's wrong? Sonoko!
What's wrong, Ran?
Uh... I heard a loud noise, and then screaming...
What is it?
Detective Nakamori, come in! Something's happening on board!
What is it?
- We didn't get a call from them! - Don't tell me that Kid...
Nothing to do.
Neither the right aileron nor the safety slats are responding!
Too bad, cut the engine n°4.
- We have to put out the fire! - Good!
Is there anyone there?
This is the control tower. Flight 2501, I read you.
Roger, we are clearing runway A. Can you go ahead?
This is Flight 2501.
We're going to try it. Clear the planes around it just in case.
All right, sir.
All aircraft, all aircraft!
Check your fuel and leave the area urgently!
- Come on, there's no time! - Yes, we do!
- All aircraft... - Damn it!
Even if by some miracle they make it to the airport,
at their current altitude, they'll overshoot the runway!
Please let them make it!
To all passengers: Due to an engine problem,
we will be making an emergency landing.
Please make sure your seat belts are fastened.
Fifteen thousand feet.
10,000 feet.
Come on, now!
Kid?
What's that? Kid?
Where is he?
Where's Kid?
- Did he say Kid? - Did he appear?
Hello? Hello?
Detective Nakamori!
There is indeed a problem with the plane!
They are going to try an emergency landing on runway A!
An emergency landing?
Damn, I can't see anything from here!
- Is it because of the Kid? - Conan!
Sonoko, answer me!
Sonoko!
Stop, Uncle!
Calm down, Mr. Suzuki!
It's dangerous to get up!
But if Kid's there, then the Sunflowers...
We're starting the emergency descent.
The explosion made us lose part of the control of the plane.
The landing will be very complicated.
Please pray that we land in one piece.
Come on, let's go!
- Here we go... come on, next! - Open door eight, quick!
This is not a drill!
It's no good, we're not stabilizing!
- Don't give up, try again! - Yes!
Ran, help!
Get out of the way!
Here it comes!
It's coming!
It's wobbling a lot...
It's not gonna make it, it's too high!
It's no good...
Oh, man...
Will you listen to me?
Reverse thrust!
But we might not be able to control it anymore!
Whatever, just stop it!
Right! Right!
Reverse thrust!
What's going on?
People in the international terminal are asked to evacuate...
Oh no... it's going to crash into us!
Come on, stop... stop!
Please, stop!
That was close...
Shinichi, Sonoko!
This is the control tower. Flight 2501, do you read me?
Come in, Flight 2501!
Flight 2501!
This is Flight 2501. Sorry, sir.
I ignored the instructions and changed course.
And? Are you okay?
We avoided impact with the gate.
We're fine.
Begin passenger evacuation.
Copy that.
You got anything broken, kid?
No.
Well, that was a close one.
Yes.
That was a close one.
Sure did.
But I can't believe that Kid could do this.
What the hell is this?
Don't tell me that...
Kid!

I won't let you get away!
- Hey bug, where are you... - Kid is in the sky with the painting!
- What?! What?! - Are you serious?
Shinichi... Sonoko...
Sonoko!
What's up? Where are you now?
Relax, Ran, I'm fine.
Thank goodness...
Hey, did Kudo call you?
Shinichi? No, why?
Well...
Did something happen to him? You are not together?
Actually...
I can't find him anywhere!
Wait, kid!
It's forbidden to go there!
Damn, where did he go?
Come back here, kid!
Like it's time!
This number is not available right now.
No... Shinichi...
I'm begging you, please answer!
Sorry, Ran! I'm chasing after Kid here!
I'll call you back later!
I was so scared...
Shinichi...
Where's Shinichi?
Where is he?
Oh no!
Come on, let's go!
It's not true!
But...
Kid didn't have the painting when he jumped off the building.
I didn't lose sight of it for long.
He must have hidden it in the building!
I knew it!
These are the only tools I could
to gather at the airport.
It doesn't matter, we're just making sure it's intact.
Okay, let's get to work.
Yes.
I hope it's just dirty...
If he even has a cut..,
we can say goodbye to the exhibition.
Detective Nakamori, look at this!
Kid appears well on the surveillance videos!
He flew over this building an hour and 15 minutes ago.
On the video, he was still holding the painting.
Yes.
But why did he leave it on the roof?
The second Sunflower is heavier than it looks.
Maybe he was too heavy to carry it with his hang glider.
Maybe he intended to pick it up when things calmed down,
but the kid saw it.
I didn't see it, did I?
Shinichi told me that he saw him hiding it while he was chasing it.
So,
where is that high school detective now?
He's never around when Kid appears.
You'd think it's him, Kaito...
It's very unlikely.
Oh yes!
There is a call from Kudo from 1h15 ago.
It's at the same time as the video.
Damn, I'll have to say I was in the States...
Are you done with that?
The important thing here is to know why Kid went through the airport.
Maybe he wanted to know what happened to the plane he blew up.
Murderers do tend
to return to the scene of the crime, seemingly out of the blue.
He wouldn't have...
Hey, you!
Don't you dare call my Kid a murderer!
Open your eyes.
You almost died too!
That the Kid should crash a plane...
It's hard to admit, but okay.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
He got a little dirty from all the smoke,
but there's no need to restore it.
Great news!
We can say that we had a close call.
Good job to all of you!
We'll have our work cut out for us.
How lucky we were to find him so quickly.
Yes.
If he'd been out in the sun,
the ultraviolet rays and the heat wouldn't have spared him.
Well done, kiddo!
You've earned your title of Kid Killer!
But I just said it wasn't me...
This is the safe created by the Suzuki family,
the Iron Tanuki V2!
He won't risk anything here.
However, Kid already broke through your iron tanuki...
Don't worry, it's been improved since then.
Right, Lupin?
Adjustment complete
Well, can you make sure everyone's out?
Right away.
It's okay, there's no one inside.
Iron Tanuki V2...
Activation
...activated! Activation
Locked
The investigation by the police and the Ministry of Territory
revealed traces of explosives
placed on the outer wall of the plane's cargo hold.
The police are still looking for the missing employee
who was in charge of the cargo hold.
The owners of the paintings
The exhibition "Sunflowers Lifted to Japan" in danger?
are reluctant to lend them, because of this.
Oh? Dad, aren't you going to the meeting?

No, not today, there's a big horse race.
- Is that his excuse for not working? - You quit on the first day?
Don't be surprised if they fire you!
Firing that great detective? Not a chance.
Here, this was in the mailbox.
What's this?
Letters?
Maybe it's my fans!
Conan,
Sonoko invited me to the meeting...
Would you like to come?
Oh, I'd love to,
But we're planning to go to the museum with the guys.
Oh well, too bad then.
Besides that...
Shinichi didn't call you, by any chance?
No, not lately.
I wish he'd told me he was going to the States.
He never called me back after he chased Kid.
Ran...
Conan!
We're coming to get you.
Are you coming, Conan?
Yeah, I'm coming.
Come on, hurry!
Professor, Conan's coming!
We can leave right now, Haibara!
Okay, see you later.
Be careful, okay?
I'll see you tonight.
Ran!
What the hell?
Call the police quickly!
It's Kid!
There was a card from Kid among the letters!
Okay, okay, okay.
"Tonight I'll come and get
"from the left side of the Lullaby, the first copy."
Damn Kid!
He won't let go!
As you know,
the owners of the Sunflowers
have become reluctant to lend them to us.
Therefore, to regain their trust,
I decided to install an anti-kid security system at the Lake Rock Museum.
Since last night, at Natsumi's suggestion
we have hidden surveillance cameras in sunflowers.
If you have any other ideas, please let me know.
Money is of course not a problem.
Good.
Our job is to get this exhibit done.
I'll be busy on the spot gathering ideas.
Thank you.
Hey, Charlie,
can we count on your help?
Of course you can.
He claims to be a phantom thief,
but he's just a murderer who'll do anything to get his way.
No...
a terrorist!
What do you know about him, huh?
There's nothing to say that Kid caused the plane crash in the first place!
In that case, let's hear it.
Who else would have done it?
What would be the purpose of putting a bomb on the plane?
Mr. Jirokichi, do you have a moment?
What is it?
Sorry to bother you,
but Detective Nakamori insists on having an urgent talk with you.
- Yes, please. Put him on. - Yes, sir.
It's me, what is it?
It's okay.
I doubt the iron tanuki can be pierced,
but I'll go check it out.
The meeting is suspended.
- What's the matter? - Is something wrong?
Is it Kid?
Detective Mouri received a new message at his agency.
What did the message say?
"Tonight,
"I will come and get the left side of the Lullaby, the first copy."
That's all.
But then...
It speaks of the left painting of the triptych?
So "the first copy"...
Wait here for a moment, please.
Mr. Suzuki!
According to the message,
it is not the Sunflowers kept here that Kid intends to steal!
"The left of the Lullaby, the first copy"
refers to the 5th Sunflowers painted by Van Gogh.
And the fifth painting in the Sunflowers series,
as you know,
is currently in Japan!
Yes, in the art museum of the company Sompo Japan Nipponkoa...
Sompo Japan Nipponkoa - Headquarters
An art museum?
- I heard there are paintings. - It looks great!
Thanks for your loyalty.
This is the first museum I've been to.
Yes, the same!
We are high!
This is awesome!
Look, you can see the Bell Tree Tower.
Yes, I see it!
Aren't we here to see the Sunflowers, basically?
Oh yes, it's true.
Come on, let's go see them!
Hey, we're not allowed to run!
You should know, do they care or not?
Oh, they didn't ask to see them.
- Right, professor? - Yes, they did.
Before going to the exhibition "Sunflowers Raised in Japan",
we have to do some serious studying!
You're a hipster, actually.

Still, I didn't expect you to come too.
Didn't you want to go to the meeting?
They already have six samurai there.
Besides, the most urgent thing is to find out what Kid is up to.
He's never been interested in anything but jewels before,
it's really suspicious.
So you're here to see the Van Gogh painting he's after?
Yes.
If I find out more about this series of paintings,
maybe I can find out
why Kid wants them and what he's up to now.
Oh, we're coming to the end.
- Which one is The Sunflowers? - Ah, I found it!
So, which one of the three is it?
The middle one, I guess!
- It is beautiful! - It's something, for sure.
Why does he look so good, again?
Hey!
Keep it down, or we'll be thrown out.
- Damn, that's right... - Sorry for the noise.
It's all right.
So these are the famous fifth Sunflowers.
Hey, professor!
Really, what a wonder!
Oops, excuse me.
No harm done.
Well, I've finished looking at it.
-Already? - Yes, already.
Let's go buy some souvenirs, then?
Yeah, come on!
- Come on, teacher! - Yes, I'm coming...
You really wonder why they came.
You, my dear,
your attention seems to be focused on something other than the Sunflowers.
I'm sorry to bother you.
You remind me so much of myself at your age that I couldn't help myself.
Do you come here often, ma'am?
Yes, every day.
You must really love Van Gogh's Sunflowers.
I like them, yes,
but not the ones in this painting.
It's over here.
It's still in place, it seems.
Well then, Uncle?
- What are you doing here? - And you, then?
You're just in time, kid.
- You're going to help us. - Why, is it Kid again?
His next target...
Mr. Suzuki, it's best not to talk about it here.
Hideo Harada Director of Seiji Togo Memorial Museum
Ah, my mistake.
As you can see,
there is no problem at the moment.
So as not to disturb our visitors,
I would ask you to continue in the reception room.
You are right.
- Let's go back then. - Haibara!
I'll stay here with Uncle.
Go back with the others, okay?
- And then... - I know what you mean.
I won't tell the kids.
There you go, thank you.
He seems to trust you.
It's not what you think, for both of us...
Think again.
You have the same look I had 70 years ago.
You remind me
of the sunflower in flower language:
"I'm only looking at you."
But you know,
if you just look, you'll end up regretting it...
just like me.
People don't realize the value of things until they are lost.
Like this sunflower.
Haibara, we're going home!
Oh? Where's Conan?
He went home without us.
He had something urgent to do.
Again?
- It's like his sneaking off to the bathroom... - Thanks for the advice.
I'll try not to have any regrets.
You couldn't have looked at them for very long, Professor.
That's all right, I'll enjoy the exhibition better this way...
Kiyosuke...
And how does this letter...
suggest that our Sunflower painting is going to be stolen?
The Lullaby...
is the name of a portrait of a woman painted by Van Gogh.
It has nothing to do with the Sunflowers.
No, we have to focus on the rest of the sentence: "the left" and "the first copy".
and "the first copy".
"The left" probably refers to the triptych.
To the triptych?
Yes.
It's a set of three paintings that form a whole.
Uh, we knew that...
What we're asking is,
is how, from the Lullaby, we arrive at the Sunflowers.
Well, that...
Why, already?
Are you serious?
You have to pull yourself together, you are a samurai!
What if we...
we ask Mr. Koji Azuma to explain his reasoning?
Yes, good idea!
Azuma, if you don't mind...
Yes, of course.
If the triptych mentioned by Mr. Mouri
is what the letter refers to,
then try to visualize the Lullaby in the middle.
The paintings at its two sides...
are the Sunflowers!
Just so.

In the letter sent to his brother Theo,
Van Gogh attached a sketch in which the order is clear.
If we place the paintings in this order
then the Sunflowers next to the Lullaby
are the 3rd and 7th to its right,
and the 4th, 5th and 6th to its left.
And the first copy of the Sunflowers on the left...
Original
Copy 1
Copy 2
these are the 5th Sunflowers that are exhibited in your museum.
I understand better.
It seems that our Sunflowers are indeed targeted.
What do you think we should do?
Kid announced that he would come tonight!
You must immediately take the Sunflowers to safety.
Right away, it's going to be difficult...
It's understood.
We'll close early and explain the situation to the visitors.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Good, keep it up.
Slowly, yes.
Is there anything we can do to help?
Good question...
I'm blown away by Ishimine's Cheetah Transportation Service.
They did it all in half an hour!
The sun doesn't set for another hour.
- We're right on schedule. - Yes.
There you go, easy.
Keep it up.
Is there anything we can do to help?
Well, we...
While we're taking it in,
can you bring the lid in for us?
Yes, sure. Natsumi!
- Let's get the lid. - Yes, let's.
I'll help you.
Leave it, we'll do it.
If the team doesn't do it,
Mr. Ishimine won't be happy.
Thank you for the thought, though.
All right.
Are you ready? I'll count to three.
We're done.
- Good job. - Let's get the lid on.
Sorry, thank you.
We'll finish...
It's time for us to go check the safe, right?
Yes, it is.
Mr. Director, do you have a moment?
Charlie is right.
Since Kid said he was coming tonight,
it's a cinch he's planning to steal from the safe.
Oh, sorry.
It's all right, go on.
All right, go on.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
There's something on the lid!
Hey!
We're running out of time, so don't bother us!
But it looks like a card from Kid!
- Lift the lid. - Okay, okay, okay.
It's a card!
Is that...
Give it to me, Natsumi.
Here.
Yes, it's definitely a card from Kid!
"As promised, I took the Sunflowers.
"Kaito Kid."
He took them?
The painting is here, in front of us!
That's it?
Nothing else is written?
No.
I don't understand it!
And if the painting that is here had already been...
It would be a fake?
I can't believe that Kid lied to us in his announcement.
Yes, it's totally contrary to his habits.
- No, something is wrong... - He fooled us!
Deep down, he is still a thief.
He is ready to do anything to commit his misdeed.
Even if he has to kill for it...
So, what do you think?
If it's a fake, then it's extremely well made.
It will be difficult to make an accurate analysis here.
Oh well...
Would you be willing to entrust it to us temporarily?
In my workshop, I can analyze it in no time.
I understand.
If there is a strong chance that it has been replaced by a fake,
our superiors will surely give their approval.
No need to go that far, Mr. Director.
What's the matter with you?
What are you meddling with?
This is... Kaito Kid!
I see! It's all part of Kid's trap!
These sunflowers are real,
I guarantee it.
Kid, you bastard! You fooled us!
Hold it!
Mr. Azuma, Mrs. Miyadai! Are you okay?
- Yes, but he took the painting! - Get the kid!
- What's this? - He stole it?
Stop, Kid!
Nakamori here! Kid's running away with the Sunflowers!
He'll probably go out through the roof, so get ready!
Got it!
Kid in sight! He's on the top of the roof!
Oh no, he'll escape!
If only I had my gun...
Kaito Kid fired several shots.
We lost him!
What?! What?! Find him!
Found it!
We've been tricked!
Where is he now?
Too far away, it's gone.
Damn it! I don't believe it.
He stole it at night, just like he said he would.

Here is the card that Kid had slipped into my jacket pocket.
"I'll return the Sunflowers to you for the meager sum of 10 billion yen.
"Meet me in room 1412 of the Tohto Hotel within two hours.
"You will leave the money in cash, the bills directly on the bed.
"It's that or I'll keep it. Kaito Kid."
10 billion in two hours?
So Kid's goal was the money all along!
Why did he change like that, completely?
There must be a reason.
Or else... he's an impostor.
Our museum
could never raise that kind of money in two hours!
A person capable of such a feat,
in Japan, I know of only one...
All right, I'll get the money ready.
Would you do that?
But on one condition.
If I get the painting back without a scratch,
you'll lend it to me for my exhibition.
That goes without saying!
If you bring it back to us, my superiors cannot refuse.
In that case, will you also be able to convince
the owners of the other five paintings?
All right, I'll do what I can.
That's fine!
Well, the negotiations are over.
Let's go to the hotel now!
Yes !
Join us as soon as you are done.
Yes, sir.
Are you going with them, Charlie?
No, I'm going to get something important.
Something important?
Yes.
I'll need it badly if I'm to face up to the Kid.
All right, Charlie.
But be back before the exchange.
Don't worry, I'll be back in time.
If you'll excuse me...
If possible, I have another request.
Go ahead, I'm listening.
There is one person I would like to invite to your exhibition at any cost.
Who is it?
Since we're showing the Sunflowers..,
an elderly woman has been coming every day.
She was here today too.
Yes, she was.
It must evoke memories for her, because she is only interested in this painting.
She only looks at the Sunflowers, always with a melancholic air.
That's fine.
I thank you very much!
That's me.
I'm going to need it after all.
Are you sure?
In this country, just having it on you will make you an outlaw.
Whatever.
I refuse to let a terrorist who blew up a plane get away.
Got it, I'll set it up for you.
Thank you, Marc.
Drop him off in an hour in the parking lot behind the Tohto Hotel.
You got it.
Tohto Plaza Hotel
This is the lobby. CLEAR.
No suspicious individuals in the fire escape.
Damn, we're running out of time!
Excuse me.
Detective Nakamori, what's the security situation?
I posted a guard at each entrance and exit.
It will be useless if he is already in the hotel.
Even so, he won't slip through my fingers again!
We won't let him leave the hotel!
Hurry, time is running out.
Bring them quickly.
- I'll put them here. - Faster, faster!
Say...
can we negotiate in such a situation?
These are the instructions of Kid, we have no choice.
However, from now on, don't talk to me too much.
If Kid finds out we're here, everything will fall apart.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Still,
what an idea to ask to put the money in a place like this!
We can't help it, that's what Kid asked.
Shut up, microbe!
Excuse me...
Do you want to see the screen?
Yes.
Just a second.
Here you go.
Thanks, you're a nice guy.
I just need your help.
You're sharp and agile, I can tell.
Now I understand why they call you the Kid Killer.
I just got lucky.
Besides, I'm just an elementary school kid.
I'm not prejudiced.
If you find out anything, let me know, okay?
I will.
For that kind of money,
it would make sense to ask for a deposit to an offshore account.
If he asked for it in cash..,
there's got to be a reason.
What's the reason?
Did some reporters show up?
What's that supposed to mean? We're the only ones who know about the exchange!
Normally yes, but all the newspapers and TV channels are here!
The parking lot has become totally impassable,

and they started filming in front of the hotel entrance!
We are in front of the hotel Tohto Plaza.
Kid announced that he was only interested in the 2nd and 5th Sunflowers...
Damn, that damn Kid!
He must have contacted the press to create chaos!
Detective Nakamori.
If it was Kid who called them..,
it's because he's planning to make the exchange despite the commotion.
Enough talk, it's time.
There's no time to take out the money !
Well, too bad.
Only two minutes left, leave the last suitcases open.
Everybody out!
We'll be next door, Mr. Director.
Uh...
Stay here!
Hurry up!
It's a real furnace, this room!
Can't I open a window?
Take it easy.
There's no guarantee that Kid will come in through the door.
Okay...
That's it, we're out of here.
Good, good job.
Stay in position until further instructions.
Got it!
Knowing Kid, he's got to be planning something.
If I don't find him before the exchange starts...
What? Something's wrong...
Something's different!
Oh no... that was it!
Damn it!
Did he take the master key?
Damn, I'm out of time!
Quick, hurry!
Kid Killer!
What's the matter?
There's no time. Get in!
Explain yourself!
The amount of water in the manager's bottle has increased.
The air pressure in the room must have risen.
What is he up to?
I don't know,
but if we don't restore the normal pressure level,
he's going to execute his plan.
I don't believe this!
What are they doing? They're going to ruin everything!
The exchange starts in 20 seconds!
It won't open!
The pressure difference prevents the door from opening!
They're just doing their own thing!
Just let it happen.
We've got less than ten seconds, we're going to have to do something about it.
Five to go...
four... three... two...
one... zero!
What the...?
What is what?
- Something is falling... - Did Kid appear?
Here, I'll open it!
Kid!
Damn... damn Kid!
It's Kid!
- Kid has appeared, does he have the painting? - So the tip about the exchange was true!
He's running away!
Are you all right?
No, I'm fine...
Did Kid bring the Sunflowers?
I don't know...
Charlie, look!
Above the bed!
Why did you have to come and ruin everything?
Charlie! Charlie! Where's Kid? Where's Kid?
- He ran away. - And the Sunflowers?
Don't worry, they're all right.
But it's the Sunflowers!
Did he give it back?
Yes, but the money...
Who cares! Good work!
Let's talk to the press!
Councilman Suzuki!
What do you have to say about your confrontation
with Kaito Kid?
Kid is no threat to me.
The Sunflower owners can rest assured!
I have a strange feeling... As if someone was pulling the strings.
The Sunflowers are back in the news
after being saved twice from the thief Kaito Kid.
Hey, check it out.
I'd love to go to that exhibit!
Oh, the one with the Sunflowers?
Now the other Van Gogh Sunflowers
are coming to Japan from all over the world.
We have invited the people behind the
the people behind the Sunflowers exhibition:
Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki, advisor to the Suzuki Group,
and his niece, Miss Sonoko Suzuki.
Who's that vioque?
Didn't he crash his airship on the Akashi Bridge?
The exhibition will be held at the Lake Rock Museum.
I'm not familiar with that name.
That's because it was specially designed to host the exhibition.
That's interesting!
To display the paintings in the best conditions
and to guarantee them a foolproof security system,
we had to create a new space.
Let's see it in pictures
while Miss Suzuki continues her explanations.
The Lake Rock Museum was built
inside a limestone cave owned by our group.
It has eight floors in the basement
with one exhibition per floor.
On each floor there will be a single Sunflower painting on display,

to be able to admire them fully.
Then, once the visitors have arrived at the bottom,
the paintings on each floor will be placed in an elevator
and moved to the eighth basement.
While waiting for the elevator that will bring them back to the surface
visitors will be able to admire all together
the seven Sunflowers together!
I see!
Rather than displaying the seven together from the start,
you prefer to let people first
become aware of their individual splendor first.
Yes, but it's also a perfect security system!
Sensors will activate at the slightest anomaly
and a mechanism will place the paintings in armored cases,
waterproof and fireproof, where they will not be at risk!
And even if the paintings were to be stolen
the defense system will immediately lock all the exits.
So even if Kaito Kid sneaks in disguised,
he won't have any way to escape!
The safety of the visitors is also ensured.
The defense system can't
stop the elevator to the surface, nor the minimal lighting.
So it's powered separately?
Yes, it is.
We have prepared a video to show it in detail.
Water is sent from the lake to a tank at the entrance,
and when needed,
a hydraulic turbine is activated, which works thanks to the difference in altitude.
The energy thus created will bring the visitors back to the surface,
but also to bring back the paintings
to an evacuation room via a special route.
Impressive, everything is perfectly thought!
It is a real fortress to protect the Sunflowers.
Yes, it is.
Your only chance to see this international treasure,
the seven Sunflowers together in an ideal environment..,
is in the exhibition "Sunflowers Raised to Japan"!
I read here that this exhibition
will last only one month and will be limited to 100 visitors per day.
When will the draw for a ticket start?
Right now.
Really?
It is available now by registering on our website.
It is also open to international visitors,
so the chances will be very small!
Don't miss this opportunity, okay?
Damn, I lost!
Lost!
I was hoping to win by trying out at the teacher's house...
What, we all lost ?
Say, what happens if we win ?
They take a picture of the first person they see
and give them a login and a PIN code.
Once you enter the registration page,
you get the tickets in the mail.
You are well informed...
Don't tell me...
Yes, I won!
What a sly laugh.
Please, professor!
Could you give them to me? I want to go!
- I want to go too! - And me!
Not in a million years!
You're acting like a child.
Yeah, first of all!
- Don't be a child ! - That's really immature.
Gee, so...
If you want, I'll challenge you to a quiz!
There will be three choices, so you only get one shot.
Is that okay?
- Yeah! - All right!
Now I recognize you!
All right, let's go!
Mr. Sunflower in the flower field loves the sun, but what does he hate?
Answer 1: Spiders.
Answer 2: snakes.
Answer 3: scorpions.
So kumo, hebi and sasori in Japanese.
Yeah, so the answer is...
Shh, don't answer, both of you.
- I found it! - I have the answer too!
And me!
It's answer number 3, scorpions!
But no, Genta, that's not it!
Scorpions have venom, though.
- So do spiders and snakes! - What, really?
Too bad!
That was answer #1, spiders.
And why, huh?
Because in Japanese, it is called kumo...
- What? - You're too bad!
Kumo can mean "spider", but also "cloud"!
Mr. Sunflower likes the sun,
so of course he hates clouds!
What, no relation with the venom, then ?

In conclusion,
I keep my ticket for myself, and then that's it!
And that's it...
We would like to see the Sunflowers all together.
We really can't?
- Come on, be nice... - Please!
Please, please, please!
I will.
Yippee!
- Can we really? - However...
you'll have to help me even more than usual.
We're counting on you, Kid Killer.
Mr. Suzuki.
It's time to resume the meeting.
Yes, you're right.
Come on, kids, I'll walk you out.
Okay, okay.
Uncle,
Don't forget the tickets for Ran and Shinichi.
Ishimine,
Sorry, can you go ahead?
Yes.
Call me when you have the schedules and routes.
Say, how will you get them to the museum?
Even though the gallery is secure,
it's on the way that it will be risky.
Don't worry,
I've prepared several vehicles that will serve as decoys.
Only I know which one is carrying the paintings.
Oh, right.
If it's Mr. Charlie who does it, that's fine.
But if you're going to use "it", keep in mind:
That there is no life on earth
worth taking.
I'll keep that in mind.
But always trying to follow your ideals, you end up being betrayed.
Kaito Kid showed us that.
What are you doing, kid? Let's go!
Everyone is waiting for you!
I'll be right there.
I think she hates me.
Excuse me, sir.
A package for you, sir, with a message.
Very well, thank you.
Who is it?
To deliver this here, rather than at the office...
Be good, Lupin!
You're too spoiled, it shows...
But this is...
Kid!
Show it to me!
No doubt, it's a card from Kid!
- And this box? - It looks like a gift...
What's wrong with you, Lupin?
Back off, please!
That's enough, Lupin, back off!
What's the matter?
Given the smell and the size of the flame...
Phosphine?
It's a flammable liquid, everybody out!
Everything okay, Charlie?
Yes, there is no more danger.
Call Detective Nakamori right away.
Yes !
Are you sure?
This is an attempt on human life.
The police will ask you to postpone the exhibition.
In the worst case, you may have to cancel it.
Yes, I agree with Charlie.
I understand.
You too, not a word about this story,
you hear me?
Very well, as you wish.
Good dog, Lupin! You have a nose for it, you.
Hey, Charlie,
I think we should seal this room just in case.
Yes.
Kaito Kid, you're finally showing your true colors.
I will show no mercy this time!
Move, move...
Stop!
Just how many decoys did he prepare?
Say, about what just happened...
- What do you think? - What do I think?
Why did Kid do it?
If the Sunflower exhibition is postponed..,
the 2nd and 5th Sunflowers will be released from the Lake Rock Museum.
So he can try to steal them again.
Is that all?
If that's all,
the exhibition will be over within a month.
Why is Kaito Kid in such a hurry?
Turpentine
Hello everyone!
Thank you for coming to the "Sunflowers Raised to Japan" exhibition!
I now leave the exhibition organizer,
Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki, to open the ceremony!
What's up?
All of you who have fallen under the spell of Sunflowers,
are you ready?
Very well, then...
I declare the exhibition "Sunflowers Raised to Japan" open!
We are going to proceed with the entries.
Please line up and have your tickets ready.
Excuse me, I'm Ran Mouri...
May I see your ticket?
There are six of us.
Very good, everything's in order.
This way, please.
- We're the first ones here! - All right!
Come on, Ran, hurry up!
- Are you all together? - Yes, we are.
Please insert the tickets here.
The entrances are going smoothly?
Yes, the museum's systems and security...
are both operational.
Good, everyone outside of Goto
- can return to their posts. - Good.
Right? But, uh...
can he handle himself?

Don't worry about him, everything is automated.
Besides, I prefer to reduce to a minimum
the number of people who can come and go here.
Yes, that's for sure...
What is it now?
No, it's nothing.
Discretion is not your strong point...
I can't believe it!
Is the detective kid here too?
Goto, did anyone suspicious come in?
The first group has just gone down
into the first sunflower room,
but one person went to the second painting room.
I put it on the screen.
It's not trivial to start with the second one.
Can't you enlarge it?
Goto!
I'm sorry.
What's up? Is she crying?
She must really want to see the 2nd Sunflowers!
Mr. Suzuki, that's clearly not Kid.
Let's go back to the entrance camera.
Yes, you're right.
Put it back.
Yes.
Wow, they're so pretty!
But they're fake, I guess.
If they were real, they'd wilt right away.
It's okay that they're fake,
but they could have made an effort with the smell.
That's weird.
It was Natsumi's idea, but she hadn't mentioned smell...
Anyway,
let's go see the 2nd Sunflower, the one we bought!
Good idea !
- Let's go! - Yes!
A surveillance camera!
They seem to have them everywhere.
Conan! What are you doing, let's go!
I'm coming!
Look, there he is.
- Oh, yeah! - So cool!
That's the one I wanted to see the most!
Ran!
Hurry up, I saw Shinichi!
You did?
Shinichi...
Sonoko, where's Shinichi?
Sorry, I lost sight of him.
Are you sure it was him?
Was it? I'm not sure now...
I just saw him out of the corner of my eye.
- Maybe you got confused. - I hope that's it...
Given the level of security at the entrance,
with the X-rays and the bag searches,
there's no way to get in disguised.
So, the only option left to Kid,
is to pretend to be me, since we look oddly similar.
What is this note?
A card from Kid?
He did impersonate me!
Is everything okay?
He wasn't there either.
Sorry, I must have made a mistake then...
Ran! Sonoko!
- Conan, keep it down! - Take me to the control room!
It's a map of the Kid!
He's already inside the museum!
Kaito Kid is here!
What's the meaning of this?
If it has anything to do with the Sunflowers,
I think some of the paintings have 15 flowers.
The 4th, 5th and 6th paintings
do indeed have 15 flowers.
And are there paintings with 14 flowers?
No, there are not.
Yes, there are.
According to one theory,
there would be no difference between 14 and 15 flowers.
In a letter to his little brother Theo,
Van Gogh would have written "14 flowers" about his painting with 15 flowers.
So if the 14 and the 15 designate the number of flowers,
what do the other numbers mean?
If Van Gogh deliberately only counted 14 flowers,
one theory is that they represent
the twelve apostles of Christ, as well as Theo and Gauguin.
Yes, that's probably it!
What do you mean?
Look at the cards again.
"Eleven people plus one",
that would be the twelve apostles,
and the "plus two" after that would be Theo and Gauguin.
This brings us to a total of 14 people.
On the other hand, if he counts 15 flowers,
then the last "plus one" would be Van Gogh himself.
If this interpretation is right,
it remains to understand what these equations mean.
Why did Kid give us such a complicated announcement card?
First of all, does he even announce anything in it?
Who cares?
If we want to know what he was trying to announce,
we can ask him after we catch him.
Help me lock Kid inside the Lake Rock!
Yes...
Goto! Get all the visitors and staff out of the museum.
Yes!
Uh, but...
the museum has only been open for an hour.
If you do that, people will protest!
We'll be fine.

The first day is always a bit unpredictable,
so I only invited people from the group, and Sonoko's friends.
Mr. Counselor.
We'll take care of security, as agreed.
I'm counting on you, my seven samurai!
I see, you've planned some emergency measures.
Good, follow the plan,
and inform the others if you have to leave your posts.
I understand.
We are sorry, but we have a problem.
Please proceed calmly to the elevator.
I bet you it's Kid!
The Junior Detectives are coming in!
- No way! - No way!
Kid is dangerous this time.
Don't go anywhere near me!
Alright, alright.
How is the evacuation going?
It's going fine.
The problem is more likely to be during the search on the way out.
There's no need to X-ray them.
Just let them go once they've turned in their stuff.
If you do that, Kid will be able to get away!
Not a chance.
He's not the type to run away when his target is right in range,
you should know that, too.
It's true that I can see him hiding inside.
So let's take advantage of this opportunity to close the partitions,
and lock him in!
If he could get into the Lake Rock,
Kid must not be in disguise, nor have his accessories with him.
Under these conditions, our victory is assured.
Not to mention my twelve trusted associates
who are still inside.
Twelve trusted associates...
I see!
He could have just written "12" for the apostles,
but instead he wrote "eleven plus one"...
Maybe that means...
Uncle Jirokichi?
Your twelve trusted people,
it's the same number as the apostles on Kid's card, right?
I've been wondering why he didn't write "12" before.
Is one of them out of the way, or what?
Maybe it's... Judas ?
Yes, Judas the traitor!
What if Kid was trying
to warn us that there's a traitor among us?
Do you think someone other than Kid would want to steal the Sunflowers?
Mr. Suzuki,
I'd like to check the profiles of your seven samurai again...
What if that traitor wanted to make us suspect each other to sow discord?
They don't need to know we're investigating them.
In that case, it doesn't cost us anything to check.
- Please do. - Good.
All staff and visitors have left the museum.
Good, close the partitions quickly.
All right, I'll do it right away.
Move along, please!
Move along!
Visitors and employees are streaming out of the Lake Rock Museum.
What's going on inside?
It seems that no one has been informed of anything.
The only other places with little surveillance
are the server and generator rooms.
But no one but us is supposed to know where they are.
It's worth a shot.
This is Charlie. I checked the areas without cameras.
No sign of the Kid in the building.
Copy that.
There's nobody left in the museum.
Everybody back to their stations.
It's about time.
Damn it!
Pull over, Kid!
Damn it!
What?
A cut?
It's all right! Turn on the second generator!
- Yes, sir. - Cameras on the boards first.
I know, sir.
I'm turning the monitors back on.
All right, the Sunflowers are here!
That's fine.
Turn on that screen too,
I have a report from Megure.
Right away, sir.
It's back on!
Goto, what's going on?
A problem with the electrical panel.
The lights, the elevator
and the surveillance cameras are no longer working.
I'll send security to 2nd and 5th Sunflowers.
Damn Kid... So he was hiding here.
No, maybe the Kid is not responsible.
What do you mean?
When we reinvestigated your samurai, we found a suspect.
No !
In Arles, the town in France where Van Gogh painted the seven Sunflowers...
this person's twin brother
died six months ago.
The local police found him dead from a gunshot wound to the chest,
and from gunshot residue on his right hand,

she concluded that it was suicide.
So what? Who is it?
Koichi Azuma.
What about him? Azuma?
Yes, he was the brother of Koji Azuma, the catering manager.
It wasn't suicide. I killed Koichi.
There! Look at the sunflowers!
On the second screen!
Azuma!
Why did you do it? Your own brother!
When my brother, Koichi,
finally found the Ashiya Sunflowers we were looking for,
he suddenly changed his mind.
He found the Ashiya Sunflowers?
What are you talking about?
These Sunflowers were burned during the war.
No, it's not true.
That day, when Ashiya was bombed,
it is said that the city burned so hot it was like hell.
My grandfather, who worked as a carpenter
for a rich businessman in Ashiya,
wanted to save the Sunflowers, which were firmly attached so they wouldn't be stolen,
and threw himself into the flames.
Azuma!
Miss!
Mr. Azuma!
- What are you... - Stay back!
Good Lord!
Miss... take care of the Sunflowers!
No! Azuma!
Watch out!
Miss, we must flee!
I refuse! Azuma!
Even if we lose the war,
they won't take these Sunflowers away from us!
Azuma...
- Azuma! - Miss, we have to go!
I dream that one day, in Japan,
in a museum like the ones in the Mushanokoji novels...
people from all over the world will come
to admire these Sunflowers...
My father told me this story again and again.
Even after his death
we continued to search for the Sunflowers of Ashiya.
Relying only on the words of the employee
of the employee to whom our grandfather entrusted the painting.
His words?
To prevent it from being confiscated by SCAP,
he would have sent it to Europe, passing it off as a fake.
You mean the Sunflowers I bought...
are Ashiya's?
So they didn't burn!
They just didn't.
My brother and I finally found them.
Secretly stored in an old attic in Arles...
Ashiya's Sunflowers.
However...
After so many years of searching, finally finding the Sunflowers,
my brother changed his mind.
He wanted to leave the Sunflowers in the city that Van Gogh loved so much,
and he was ready to destroy them if I refused.
This was a betrayal of our father's and forefather's vow!
For me it was unforgivable.
We had a fight,
and as we held the gun we had bought to defend ourselves,
the gun went off, and my brother...
Koichi... I...
Run away.
Koichi!
Save yourself, I said.
- I said... - Get out of here!
Then, after learning about the Sunflower exhibit,
I got hired.
Thanks to that, I was able to see the Sunflowers return to Japan with my own eyes.
My grandfather's wish was fulfilled.
So after the exhibition was over,
I was going to go to the police.
It was faster than I expected.
I understand.
Inspector Megure of the Tokyo Police is on his way.
Are you going to turn yourself in?
Yes, of course I will.
But I'm not the suspicious person you were talking about!
What is it? You should know!
Hey... the Sunflowers are on fire!
You can't fool me!
But no, it's the truth!
- Be careful, there is a fire! - Quick, put it out!
Hey! What's going on?
What do the heat sensors say?
The numbers are off the charts.
I think he's right about the fire!
Can you put it out?
I can't, the defense system is down!
No choice, then...
Everybody out of the building!
Goto, open the roof bulkheads.
Yes, sir!
Come on, everyone with me!
Come on, Conan!
Uh... yes!
Hurry, sir! The flames are coming this way!
Yeah, I'm almost done.
Emergency evacuation
Here we go!
Hurry up!
Come on, this way!
- Come on, you too! - Uh, yes...
Come on, Conan, quickly!
Is everyone okay?
Yes, we're fine.
- How about you, Conan? - I'm fine, but...
What about the Sunflowers?
Don't worry about them.

The program was functional.
But the 2nd and 5th...
You don't have to worry about it, son.
No, I'm sure of what I saw.
Emergency evacuation
There were two paintings left!
If we don't act fast,
the 2nd and 5th Sunflowers will burn!
- What's going on here? - Just settle down.
Yes, sir.
According to Nakamori's instructions,
Azuma will be at the emergency exit.
This way! This way!
Hurry up!
Lieutenant Charlie entrusted Azuma to me.
What the hell is going on here?
There's been a fire,
so we'll need to evacuate by air.
Yes, sir.
- Let's go help the others. - Yes!
Conan?
He's not...
Damn it!
This is bad... I've got to hurry,
- or I'll end up burned too... - Kid!
Is that you? Are you back?
No time to talk, where is the other one?
Are the 5th Sunflowers safe?
Yeah, I was able to unlock them easily,
but this painting is stuck!
If I don't move fast, the paint will melt!
Move over, Kid.
Are you crazy?
It's the Sunflowers!
One of the treasures of humanity!
Is it any good?
You were aiming at me, admit it!
It's not the time to argue!
It didn't do anything... Damn it!
That old man really made them strong!
Conan!
Shinichi!
You really came!
Hey!
Are you listening to me? We have to get out of here fast!
Ran!
Give us a hand!
Help with what?
The painting's stuck!
If we want to get it out, we'll have to break through the wall.
We can't do that!
I know you can do it.
I'll try.
Back off, Shinichi.
You too, Conan.
We're counting on you...
Ran!
- Well done! - I did it!
Now let's get out of here...
Hey, Ran!
Wait up!
Oh no, we're stuck!
Don't worry, just stay behind me.
Jii, can you hear me?
Stay calm! It's safe!
- Just keep moving without getting out of the way! - I'll take care of it.
Ran!
Hold on to me.
Don't let go of me, okay?
No...
What's that?
Looks like the water came out of the tank.
So the fire is out, then?
Hey, hey, hey!
Where is Conan?
Where is he? Isn't he here?
You weren't together?
What about Ran? Where is she?
Those two... they disappear at the worst possible time!
They were behind us a minute ago...
She's not answering her calls.
Mr. Mouri, I'm going to look for them,
maybe they went out front!
Yes, do that!
Let's go with her!
Yes !
Kudo... you're not...
Are you okay, detective?
Why don't you look after Ran!
Ran, hang on!
She's okay,
She just swallowed some water and passed out.
Hey, look!
The flow seems to be decreasing!
That's because the reservoir has finished emptying.
Yes.
I'm worried about the Sunflowers, let's go see!
Did you know about the culprit's plans?
Yes, I did.
If the flowers in the hallway were used to start the fire,
I figured he'd use the tubes as an aqueduct.
Well, in that case,
the culprit is the one who suggested putting flowers in the tubes.
That's right.
Did you finally figure out who it was?
Come on, let's get out of here.
Hey, hey, hey!
How are we supposed to get out?
By going up the tubes,
we'll make our way to the top floor and out the door.
Maybe we can go up the elevator shaft.
And your original plan was what?
To get away!
Knowing you, you must have had one.
If I flew out the exit I prepared in the cave,
it would be faster, that's for sure.
But with you two in my arms
it would be a bit complicated.
Kid...
Apart from that,
if you knew what was going on, why didn't you stop it?
I figured it out
by hacking into the perpetrator's computer,
but he could have had an accomplice.
I was waiting to arrest him,
but then Lieutenant Charlie came after me.
I thought if I sent a cryptic announcement card,
a certain detective here would have solved the case sooner...
Yeah, well, sorry.
Hold on a second, I'm working on a few things.

I'm going to see if we can escape down the elevator hall.
Take the opportunity to find the culprit, will you?
Got it.
I'd hate to see you get caught again
with some stupid tricks like that again!
Don't worry.
Come on, I'll let you do it!
Shinichi...
It won't take long, Ran.
That's no good...
Since the fire took so long to die down..,
...the air pressure in the cave has dropped too low.
If we don't get out of here soon, it'll collapse on us!
Be careful when opening the doors.
Well, it looks like the paintings have nothing!
One, two, three, four, five, six...
That's strange, there are only six!
What do you mean?
She's right, there's one missing!
What does it mean?
The second sunflowers...
Ashiya's Sunflowers have not arrived!
Oh no, they didn't.
But why?
Why is this the only one that is not...
Don't worry about it.
That voice...
Is it Shinichi Kudo?
Yes.
I put the Ashiya Sunflowers
in their fireproof and waterproof case.
You again?
Are you done meddling?
Come on, at least listen to me.
You owe me for preventing the traitor,
the Judas among you, from destroying the 2nd and 5th Sunflowers.
So there is a traitor?
Yes, but you don't have to worry about that anymore.
I know who your Judas is.
We've already arrested Koji Azuma.
No, Mr. Azuma is not the traitor.
It's true that Koji Azuma
had no reason to burn the second Sunflowers.
Besides, when the fire started,
he was having a conversation with you.
That's true, but...
I can't believe that there is a traitor among us!
Yes, we are a team that has done everything to protect the paintings!
That's right.
It was Kaito Kid who mentioned the existence of a traitor.
It would be absurd to believe in the words of a thief!
Exactly!
I think we should be happy that the paintings have nothing.
You really mean it,
Natsumi Miyadai?
After all your efforts to set the fire...
What are you talking about?
Your objective,
which was to burn the 2nd and 5th Sunflowers!
From the very beginning..,
your goal was to destroy the Sunflowers of Ashiya.
Stop talking nonsense!
Why would I do that?
All right, then.
Let's check together then, shall we?
Because of Kid's intervention at the auction,
security was tightened,
so you couldn't go near the Sunflowers.
Unable to destroy them in the United States,
you waited for the airplane to come
and you bribed an employee
to place a bomb near the door of the cargo hold.
But Kid saved the painting again,
and you decided to target the fifth painting this time.
But Kid soon found out,
he sent a letter to Detective Mouri,
reinforcing their vigilance once again.
Since Kid had foiled your plans twice
you wanted to beat him at his own game.
On the lid of the shipping crate,
you placed a fake card from Kid,
and arranged for the painting to be taken to your workshop.
So Kid played the bad guy to protect the Sunflowers?
No, he didn't!
You made it all up, it's obvious!
She's telling the truth.
Natsumi loves Van Gogh's paintings more than anyone.
She could never do that!
Besides,
why would she only want to destroy two of them?
I admit it,
I still don't know why she would only target those two paintings.
Talk about a deduction!
Anyway, let's leave that for when we interview her,
and get back to the objective.
Natsumi,
I heard that it was you who suggested decorating
the museum tubes with flowers, is that true?
Well, yes.
As an art expert, you were able to bring
turpentine, which is used to restore paintings,
which you poured over the decorative flowers on the upper floor,
thus using them as fuel.

The traitor could very well have taken advantage of my idea, quite simply.
Your flawed theories do not justify
to call me a criminal!
That's how you take it...
The truth is, I would have liked you to confess everything.
But if you need concrete proof, I'll show it to you later.
I'm talking about the data on your computer,
with your plans to destroy the 2nd Sunflowers!
There's no point in continuing to lie to you, it seems.
Did you join my team
with the sole purpose of destroying the 5th and 2nd
and 2nd Sunflowers?
Yes, I did.
But because of that annoying Kaito Kid,
things didn't go my way.
So you set fire to the Lake Rock, where Kid would have difficulty in infiltrating,
to try to burn down the 2nd Sunflowers?
Yes,
but at first, I planned to do it more subtly.
Once the power was off,
I was going to destroy the 2nd and 5th Sunflowers,
and that would have been the end of it.
But Kid and that man in black got in the way.
I send security to the 2nd and 5th Sunflowers.
But how did you manage
to tamper with the paintings without setting off the alarm?
It was easy.
I just covered them with phosphine.
Phosphine?
It's a dangerous product that ignites at high temperatures.
So it was you who tried to kill me too?
I see!
If the organizer dies, the exhibition will be postponed,
or even cancelled altogether.
But why?
During the fire, or the explosion in the plane...
you could have died yourself if it had gone wrong, Natsumi!
Well...
my love for Van Gogh's Sunflowers is that strong!
Rather than have these fakes
to be displayed next to Van Gogh's Sunflowers,
I would rather die!
There is not the slightest trace of truth in what you say.
The 5th Sunflowers
have been authenticated by a thesis of the Van Gogh Museum
and the Art Institute of Chicago.
Van Gogh and Gauguin
split a canvas in two to paint on it.
There is no better proof!
You're an art curator, so you must know that.
But...
And besides,
you say you'd rather die,
but the bomb on the plane exploded just before it landed,
and even for the fire,
you had time and a way to escape!
That is...
If you were really prepared to die,
why didn't you stay in the museum and stop Kid from putting out the fire?
In the end,
you're just a criminal who only thinks about your own interest!
You are not a museum curator at all.
I wouldn't have expected that from you...
Let me see your hands.
Her obsession with Van Gogh's paintings,
and her stubborn refusal to acknowledge the authentications,
eventually drove her to crime...
Looks like you're done with that.
Yeah, what about you? Can we go upstairs?
It's impossible for her.
So what do we do?
Call for help?
Better not.
They could make things worse by coming...
Oh boy!
Is everything ok?
Yes, but will it last much longer?
It's already crazy that it has lasted so long!
All it would take is one little hole in the ceiling
for the air to seep in and bring the whole thing down!
Kid!
Can you fly while wearing just Ran?
- Don't be silly... - Can you get out or not?
I'm waiting for your answer!
I should be able to,
But I don't know how long I'll last.
avoiding the rocks and with the pressure so low.
It's going to be close.
Ran!
Kid!
I'm entrusting Ran to you!
Rah, this is no time to be playing around!
I can still get away.
With this child's body...
Damn it, we're going to fall at this rate!
Where's the exit?
Is it here?
Come on!
With this body, I should be able to get into the painting elevator.
Damn it!
Ashiya's Sunflowers!
Oh no, the tank!
We have to find them fast!
This sucks...
Look!
Please...
tell me they weren't in there.
That was scary!
I really almost died.
Shinichi?
You came to save me?
Yes, everything is okay now.
I'm fine.

Where are you going, Haibara?
I saw Kid and Ran in the air!
You mean it? Let's go !
- Yes! - Sonoko!
She saw Ran and Kid flying!
Ran and Kid?
Did you say Kid?
Damn, it's blocked here too.
There's no way out.
I'll end up buried with Ashiya's Sunflowers!
Oops...
You managed to escape, huh?
Detective...
- Ran! - Answer us!
Ran! Where are you, Ran?
Ran! Are you okay?
Daddy?
Ran!
You're not hurt, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Shinichi came to save me.
No, it was Kid who saved you!
With his hang glider!
Don't you remember?
Ah, but yes...
So it wasn't Shinichi, but Kid?
What about the kid?
Where is he?
Isn't Conan here?
No, Kid was only carrying you.
Oh no!
That means he's still...
Huh? Is this a joke?
He can't...
No way!
If I don't do something,
I'll be drowned in a minute!
If I use my balloon I might be able to eject the painting,
but that won't stop me from drowning.
But yes, that's it!
If there is so much water coming in here,
it's because we're already below the water level of the lake.
So...
if I eject the board with my firework balloon,
it should put pressure
and project me in one go...
to the surface of the lake !
Well, here we go!
Five... four... three...
two... one... zero!
Conan!
What are you waiting for, Conan?
Please, come out of there!
What the hell is he doing?
Conan!
Stop it, it's okay.
Conan will surely...
Please...come out...
Conan!
I'm almost there.
Hold on a little longer...
Hey, something's coming out!
It's the Sunflowers!
Oh, so they're okay!
We put them in their case together, with Conan.
Then Conan can't be far away!
Help me look for him!
Conan, where are you?
Where are you, Conan?
Conan...
Conan!
Ran...
Hey, there's something else!
- Oh yeah, by the painting! - Huh? Where's that?
Wait, I'm coming!
- Is your father going to be okay? - Conan...
Good job, kid!
That's my Kid Killer!
- Are you okay, kid? - Yes, I'm fine.
Congratulations for protecting the painting.
Great job!
And there you go, he still gets all the credit.
There's one more thing I'd like you to explain to me.
How did you know about the culprit in the first place?
I got a voice mail asking me
to steal the 2nd and 5th Sunflowers.
I see.
As an expert in disguise, I guess you easily recognized
the culprit just by his voice.
But why did you try to stop him?
What was in it for you?
There's someone I wanted to show Ashiya's Sunflowers to.
Show it?
That day, under the flames of the bombing,
a carpenter gave the Sunflowers to the woman who secretly loved him.
I wanted to show it to this woman, who saw her love perish.
How do you know about this old story?
I heard it from the man who witnessed the whole scene.
A young man
who was employed as a servant in this house.
He who saved this woman, his first love, from the flames
asked me in person.
He wanted her to see the Sunflowers of Ashiya.
I understand better.
That solves the last mystery.
Aren't you going to arrest me?
I'll let you off the hook this time.
Say you don't have the guts to try!
Let's just say I'm going to close my eyes
for the sake of the man who hired you
And for his sad love affair.
I think I misjudged you, Lieutenant Charlie.
So do I.
A south wind blew hard
Like it was gonna burn my skin
We've talked a little too much
Come on, let's get started! Soul & Soul
If the tapping of feet on the ground
Are the rhythm of fate
Then my heartbeat
Are hands clapping in rhythm
Sometimes we can only understand each other
Only by flaying our souls a little
They are then engraved in us
Stronger than a million letters

Oh! Rival! A south wind was blowing hard
As if it would burn my skin
The words lose their meaning, one feels through the heat
A rondo announcing a storm
If it were in another place
Or in a more ordinary context
That we had met, where would we be?
Would we have taken each other by the hand?
The smell of a stifling life
Colors that delight me
I am living my life
Like with music and paintings
I want to be able, with each passing day
To offer a modest title
By saying goodbye to them
Oh! Rival! You are nobody
On the other side of the mirror
The figure reflected there, as it is
Is only playing its role
I was afraid of the weakness
That resided in my heart
And that one day time, like a virus
Would end up devouring my body
Oh! Rival, Oh! Rival
The formless figure
That I was always chasing
Although she is neither paradise nor dream
I want to be able to see her with my eyes
The sound of my guitar accompanies
The steps of a dancer
While her silver finery sways
I wonder how far she will tempt me
Our souls are called, Soul & Soul
Not there... not there... not there!
Where could he have gone?
I searched everywhere, so...
someone must have stolen it from me!
Who did it?
Who stole my ticket?
Are you going to tell him one day that the exhibition is cancelled?
No, he only has to watch the news.
Well then, what got into you?
I was told that I would regret it if I looked at you too much.
What's that?
It's a piece of advice they gave me.
I just want my ticket back, please!
My ticket!

Who would have thought it?
The twentieth film in theaters in April 2016!
