So the CIA is after us?
They are watching us, yes,
but that is not a problem.
Is this Japanese guy trustworthy?
Yes.
In Japan they call him "the legendary assassin".
His prices are very high.
So money can buy anything.
Yes.
We can finally teach this man
that there are worse things than death...
I don't know anything about it!
I just had to drive the truck from the port,
they didn't even tell me the destination!
And who was this famous customer?
But I tell you I don't know anything!
Everything was done by phone.
They call you "Joe the Carrier", right?
A professional like you accepts such a risky job
after just one phone call, really?
I didn't know the truck was full of explosives!
Stop lying!
CONAN EDOGAWA'S DISAPPEARANCE THE TWO WORST DAYS IN HISTORY
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug,
and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name...
I invented Conan Edogawa.
In order to find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
Let me introduce my current classmates:
Genta,
Mitsuhiko
and Ayumi.
They formed the Junior Detectives
and made me join them against my will.
Next,
This old man here is Kogoro Mouri.
I don't need to draw you a picture.
These two gadgets were invented by Professor Agasa.
He's been helping me since I got younger
by coming up with all kinds of original inventions.
The balloon belt.
By pressing the buckle,
this great invention inflates and expels a balloon.
On the other hand,
the teacher is not the only one who knows my real identity.
This is Ai Haibara.
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She used to work with the men in black,
but while running away from the organization,
she swallowed the same drug as me
and also got younger.
So, with Haibara, who lives with the teacher since then,
we live like elementary school children.
My body has become younger, but not my mind!
I will solve all the mysteries!
There is always only one truth!
I'm sending, Mitsuhiko!
I got it!
Here I come!
Go for it!
Ayumi, upstairs!
Well done, Ayumi.
I'm going to get it!
Good job!
I am ready.
Yesterday, at around 10pm,
a truck was intercepted in the residential area of Haido
which was apparently filled with explosives.
The police found in the trunk
what looked like plastic explosives...
I broke them playing soccer.
I heard that, yes. The teacher's making you some new ones.
It's because of the shoes.
They went haywire and kicked the ball around.
I'm in a bit of a slump right now.
Where is the teacher?
He's fixing the tub, it's broken too.
According to the police investigation,
the explosives came from a foreign ship docked in Teimuzu Harbor...
It was near here, in fact, that they found the explosives.
Yes, they did.
But if it was a job for the organization,
they wouldn't have made any mistakes.
I hope you're right.
Sorry, the tub isn't going to be ready anytime soon.
Mouri Detective Agency
Our bathtub?
Of course you can.
But how about we go to the bathhouse instead?
The bathhouse?
Big tubs are nice once in a while.
You want to come, Dad?
I'm too shocked to move.
It's just rumors.
Yoko Okino: a date in the middle of the night?
But what if it's true, huh?
Shall the three of us go?
You want to come to the ladies' side, Conan?
Just kidding!
You're welcome.
What's up?
Are you done?

Almost!
They are lucky.
And you, Ai, is there anyone you like at school?
I'm not interested in children.
Oh well.
Say!
Is this your locker, sir?
Uh, yes it is.
Hey, boy.
Did you come by yourself?
No.
Conan!
You're not too lonely?
No, I'm fine.
I ran into a friend of mine here.
You did? Who was that?
It's someone you know.
What's up? Conan fell?
Yes, and a man he knew drove him to the hospital.
To which hospital?
Uh...
It's probably a hospital near here.
I'm sorry, I should have asked him.
That's okay, I'll look for it.
Come on, Ai.
Shouldn't we take him to the hospital?
That brat saw the contents of the locker.
You're one of us, aren't you?
How do you know that?
I was told that someone would be standing guard.
And then it was obvious, you have a killer look.
So what do we do?
For now, we wait for orders.
Can you fix it, maybe?
You're nothing but a petty thief, just good at following orders!
If I hadn't acted so fast, you'd be as fucked as me.
They don't call you Tatsu the Improver for nothing.
Your tattoo.
I've heard of you.
Even in unexpected situations,
you manage to improvise like a pro to get the job done.
And your trademark is a dragon tattoo.
You are famous in the business.
I don't know who you mean.
Say...
who are you?
You hit your head while slipping at the public baths.
Your name is Conan, right?
Conan?
Kid,
do you know what your name is?
My name?
Professor!
So, how is Conan?
He wasn't brought here, apparently.
How?
That's strange, isn't it?
This is the nearest hospital.
We have to see what other emergency services are around here.
I have a message from Shinichi!
Oh, good!
The acquaintance he met was actually Shinichi!
He says he is fine and not to worry, look.
Everything is fine, don't worry. I'm eating with my friend and we'll be back.
I see, so much the better then.
But what kind of message is this, really?
He could have taken us to eat with them.
- Shinichi? - Your correspondent
is not available right now...
Oh, right.
Let's go in.
Uh, okay.
I gave him a powerful sleeping pill,
so he won't wake up anytime soon.
I also sent a message to the famous "Ran" who was at the baths,
so we shouldn't be bothered.
That kid seemed to have a fuzzy memory,
If he doesn't remember anything, he won't be a problem.
You're Maru the Locksmith, right?
What's a burglary expert doing here?
We...
I was just asked to open the door and prepare a sleeping pill,
I'm leaving now.
I can't do that.
Why can't you?
I don't know.
I was told by message that we should all wait here.
What the hell...
You don't know who's pulling the strings either?
I was hired by phone.
Hired? Don't make me laugh.
What are they blackmailing you with?
In any case,
we'd better obey them without making a fuss.
By working in this business, you develop a certain instinct.
And I have a feeling that whoever is using us is someone not to be underestimated.
Tomorrow morning
that Prime Minister Babeo will arrive from Nihorica.
He will be received by the Secretary General of the Cabinet
to discuss at tomorrow's summit
the recent aerial bombardments by Arasen,
which is the cause of the current tense situation in the territory...
Hey, the shock has made me hungry. Can you make me something to eat?
You can eat at the caf√© downstairs.
Forget it! I'm not in the mood, I'm going to sleep.
What's wrong with her now?
She looks more and more like Eri.
Yes ?
Excuse me, sir.
I'm closed for the day...
Oh, I see.
In that case, I'll come back tomorrow.
Ah, no, wait! For beautiful women, it's different.
It's okay, you're in time.
So you think your husband is cheating on you?
Yes.

He doesn't want to admit anything,
but I don't trust his behavior.
I wanted to investigate,
but I'm up against a wall, physically and mentally.
I don't want to cause problems at work,
which is why I came to you.
I understand. Do you know who he might be cheating with?
No.
But when I was cleaning his car this morning,
I smelled a woman's perfume.
What is your husband's profession?
He has no profession at the moment.
He lets a beautiful woman like you work,
it would be the last straw if he cheated on you on top of everything else.
It's understood!
Let's go and look for your husband where he said he would go last:
the public baths.
I'll do that.
We must be quick.
Afterwards...
how about a little dinner?
Uh...
I knew it.
He's still at the bathhouse.
That means he left without his stuff.
He left his stuff there?
But then he left naked?
Come on.
His mother?
Yes, just now.
She came to get her son's things.
The boy has nothing broken, apparently.
He's on the move.
Considering the speed, he is in a car.
What is it, Ai?
I'll let you follow his bag.
What about you?
Hurry up!
OK, then,
- let's start by checking if... - Good evening.
You're the sidekick's girlfriend.
Who are you, madam?
- Hey, I'm working here! - I'm hungry.
Then go home.
But the teacher isn't here...
- I just saw him... - Do you want to eat with us?
May I?
Thank you.
But she might disturb us.
I don't mind, I have nothing to hide anyway.
Are you coming?
So this is the apartment your husband rented for his work.
He'll have to give the keys back soon,
but as he was a handyman before...
Come in.
He told me he had a lot of things to sort out,
and hasn't found the time yet.
I see.
Well, I must say...
this is the perfect place to bring his mistress.
Still, he seems like a nice guy.
Like all men who cheat on their wives.
- What's in your bag? - Hey!
My work tools.
I'm a magazine editor.
I have to go back to my office after this.
You're working late.
I've got a deadline to meet.
Oh, I see.
He's not here after all.
Hey, what are you doing?
It's open.
Hey!
You can't just go snooping around!
The teacher calls me, I'm going home.
What about dinner?
Don't bother.
Ai!
What are you doing here?
What about you?
Well, the trail led me here.
- He's coming out! - Pass them to me.
What's up? Are you done?
That woman was at the public bath.
Follow her!
Still,
for a handyman, he seems to make a good living.
Just look at this apartment.
I suppose so.
It's not that different from being a detective,
but I don't make nearly as much.
Not nearly...
- Hey, lady. - Yes, ma'am?
Did you know about the secret passage?
I see... A handyman, huh?
Ma'am, I don't think
I don't think your husband is cheating on you.
But what does that mean?
I don't know, but...
I have a bad feeling about this.
Kondo, you say?
Yes.
That's what the man who gave me the keys to the truck told me.
"Don't screw up,
"It's Kondo who's using us."
So this is the famous Kondo, the legendary assassin?
It's an urban legend. He doesn't exist.
Unless you have proof or something?
The police will protect me, right?
Please come in.
Do you have a moment?
What's up?
As we thought, the CIA intel
doesn't match the amount of explosives we found.
What? You sure about that? You're sure about that?
Yes.
I had it rechecked several times,
but it's missing.
You're kidding me...
That means that there are still some in the wild.
What are you going to do, Ai?
I'll take a look,
wait for me here.
Don't do anything rash, okay?
I know.
Let's move. Take the kid, too.
Who are you?
It's better for both of us if you don't know.
I was just ordered to get the kid's stuff,
to make up for your mistake.

You forgot this.
You don't know who hired us either?
I have my own idea.
Who did?
I've done my job, I'm done!
That's right,
your work here is done.
Shall we go, Kondo?
Professor!
There's been shooting, so call the police.
Gunshots?
Hurry up!
Ai!
- Follow that car! - Okay, okay, okay.
This little guy might be useful.
What do you mean?
That Beetle is dodgy.
The radar doesn't move.
Are they broken again?
Don't get too close,
we have to follow them without them noticing us.
Got it.
Where do they plan to take him?
Don't panic,
if they wanted to eliminate him, they would have done it already.
Professor!
What's wrong?
But what's wrong with you?
Ai!
Is this the right address?
It was probably firecrackers anyway.
Probably, but hey.
Mr. Babeo, Prime Minister of Nihorica,
arrived this morning in Tokyo through Haneda airport.
In a few hours,
he plans to visit the capital with his family.
My poor little one.
- A corpse was found yesterday... - You'll soon get better.
- In a warehouse explosion. - Mom and dad are with you.
You'll be all right.
Two policemen were injured in the explosion...
I'll be back with breakfast.
I'm afraid...
I'll stop by Shinichi's before going to school.
What are you grumbling about in the morning again?
Guess what?
I went to bed without eating yesterday, so I'm hungry already.
And Conan isn't back from his date with Shinichi!
Yeah, I didn't eat anything either,
Can you make me something?
I just said I was going out, are you deaf?
Who gave me such a girl?
No compassion for her father who worked all night.
Who is the mysterious Kondo, the handyman in the shadows?
Conan is late today.
Ai isn't here either. Are they skipping school?
They are abusing it.
We said we'd go to Yokohama after school.
Yokohama?
We talked about it after our soccer game, don't you remember?
The teacher has to take us by car to the Kamen Yaiba exhibit
at the red brick warehouse.
Oh yeah, that's right!
I hope Conan didn't forget to ask the teacher.
He'd better.
Yes.
The Kamen Yaiba exhibit?
Is this a joke?
The Prime Minister's kids are fans, apparently,
so they'd like to go.
No way...
They haven't announced anything publicly,
and the Prime Minister isn't going, just his wife and kids.
And where is this happening?
At the red-brick warehouse in Yokohama.
In Yokohama?
Yes.
They don't make it easy for me!
Okay, I understand.
I'll ask the Kanagawa police for help.
You can go back to work.
Yes, sir.
Can't you prepare a real meal?
I'm not a cook.
Doesn't that fit in with Nana the Great's palace?
So you know who I am.
Coming from the great hacker "M," I'm not surprised.
How do you know it's me?
You just confirmed it for me.
It's almost time.
Here's the kid's bag.
I made sure that the kid's family
didn't cause any trouble.
What's going on with you now?
What about the school?
I got a message from Shinichi again.
He says they're going to the Kamen Yaiba exhibition in Yokohama.
He doesn't care about me!
In Yokohama?
To the red brick warehouse.
Okay, I'll go.
The red brick warehouse?
Kamen Yaiba, Yaiba
If you call his name
Kamen Yaiba, Yaiba
He will beat all the bad guys
On his mask shines a Y
Do you mean that her husband
would be the assassin of the legend?
Yes.
Once he accepts his contract, he devises a perfect plan
and totally eliminates his target
without leaving any evidence, not even a corpse.
I found documents about Kondo's cases
at her husband's workplace.
Can we really trust this article?
I don't know.
But anyway, on her table,
there was only one file on a brand new case.
It had explanations about handling explosives

and a map of the red-brick warehouse.
Don't you think it's suspicious?
You should talk to the police.
I need a little more evidence,
otherwise they'll take all the credit.
And did you tell his wife?
She went back to her office to work,
so I haven't been able to reach her.
I feel bad for her.
It's okay, don't worry about it. I'll eat with my friend and come back.
- Shinichi? - Your pen pal...
I'm to be pitied too.
Why are men so selfish, can you tell me?
What's wrong with you? I almost ran you over!
I had an accident.
Can I get in?
Sorry, look for another car.
...break the darkness
And with a Yaiba Kick
He sends the monsters flying
- One, two... Kamen Yaiba! - Kamen Yaiba, Yaiba
His motto is courage
Kamen Yaiba, Yaiba
You are our dream, Yaiba
I had to work in a hurry,
but I managed to post all the videos from the cameras
and the sound is perfect.
It paid to do a test before in an abandoned warehouse.
The targets will be there soon.
And our little bombshell is standing tall!
I must admit that I'm not very happy about it.
But then again, the targets are kids too,
so one more or less shouldn't bother me.
It's hard to be the one to pull the trigger.
There they are!
Fifteen meters to go.
I just have to pull this,
and boom!
Ten meters.
Seven meters.
Five meters.
Conan! I finally find you!
Where is Shinichi?
Who are you, madam?
Three meters.
Two meters.
One meter...
Zero!
Two days earlier
Don't you like it?
Yes, I do.
Do you not like me anymore?
Why do you say that?
You are strange these days,
it bothers me.
It's not you.
I'm sorry to make you worry.
Is it the wedding blues?
No, it's not...
I'm sorry,
I have to meet someone.
Oh, well...
Sorry, really.
That's OK.
A delivery truck is coming.
He'll drop off a package for you in the corner across the street.
Pick it up and get going.
What's in it?
You don't need to know.
Just know there's been a slight problem,
and the police are watching the truck.
That's why you need to get the package back to a safe place.
And that's it?
Yes.
If everything goes well, your job will be finished here.
All set?
Yep.
I could only take four,
the rest wouldn't fit.
Good.
Next turn,
throw the bag out the window.
Be discreet.
I did. Now what?
That's it, that's all.
All I had to do was deliver cookies?
You've got a lot of nerve calling yourself Joe the Carrier.
You still haven't noticed that the police are following you?
Where's the package?
What the hell is this?
I put it in a locker at the bathhouse.
The area is swarming with police,
I couldn't wait with a suspicious bag in my arms.
And how am I going to get into the men's bathhouse, huh?
I didn't expect them to send a woman.
Did you hear that?
Yes.
All right.
You can go home for tonight.
For tonight? Aren't you through with me?
I have no idea,
it's not up to me.
He'll have other orders for you.
I sent a man to pick up the package.
You, you will stand guard.
What do you mean by that?
Mingle with the other customers,
and see that he gets the package.
I'll let you know if there's a problem.
Can't I go get it myself?
No, I have my reasons.
And I can't know them?
It's better for everyone.
This will be your last job,
I promise.
An adult.
Welcome back.
Hey!
Is this your locker, sir?
Everything okay, kid?
Hey, you.
I'm taking the kid to the hospital, give me a hand.
Thank you, sir.
Can you fix it, maybe?
You're nothing but a petty thief, good for nothing but taking orders!
If I hadn't acted so quickly, you'd be as screwed as I am.
They don't call you Tatsu the Improver for nothing.
Your tattoo.
Say...
who are you?
You hit your head while slipping at the bathhouse.

Your name is Conan, right?
Conan?
Kid,
do you know what your name is?
My name?
What is this place?
I don't know either.
You really don't remember anything?
Here you are,
it's a medicine for your head, drink it and lie down.
That's right,
your work here is done.
Shall we go, Kondo?
The kid has amnesia,
so it's safe to leave him here.
We've been ordered to take him away.
It's not your decision.
Are you going to take me out too when this is over?
If I receive the order, yes.
If I don't do it, I'll be eliminated.
What does he have on you to make you obey?
Nothing as important as you.
Who would have thought that Kondo the legendary assassin
actually helps his targets disappear.
You pretend to kill them and let them get away,
don't you?
You must make a good living,
since you get paid from both sides.
How do you know about this?
Because he told me.
I guess he did it so I wouldn't be afraid of you.
What does he want to do with the child?
Who knows?
Maybe this little one will be useful to us.
What do you mean?
This Ladybird is suspicious.
Is he lying down ?
Yes.
We have to wait here until morning.
A little drink?
I'd love one.
I'm impressed with your calm.
There's no point in panicking now.
You're awake, right?
I gave the woman the sleeping pill you threw away.
She's fast asleep.
You don't have to be afraid.
I'll help you get away, just get up quietly.
And you, sir?
You're being blackmailed, aren't you?
Yes.
The bag that was in the locker contains a bomb, right?
They hid explosives in cookie jars,
I saw it on the news.
You really don't know about their plan?
A lot of us are employed,
but nobody really knows the plan.
That's why I need to find the big bad.
Save yourself and go to the police...
If I disappear, they'll suspect you.
Besides...
Hello!
Are you the famous Kondo?
- Who are you? - Your partner.
You are...
Unfortunately, I'm not the boss.
We'll watch him with this, so you can rest easy.
Yes ?
The red brick warehouse?
Yes.
They're having an event there, the kid had a ticket on him.
It's going to be full of kids, so we're going to take him there
and leave him there.
He didn't get his memory back?
No.
You must be reassured.
What would you have done if we had been ordered to kill a child?
He was planning to visit the capital with his family.
You poor thing.
- A body was found yesterday... - You'll be fine soon.
- In a warehouse explosion. - Mom and dad are with you.
You'll be all right.
Two policemen were injured in the explosion...
I'll be back with breakfast.
I'm afraid...
You're safe now.
Just pretend you have amnesia.
Actually...
I figured out who the big bad is in this story.
We'd like to meet the editors of "Dynamite" magazine.
All right, who shall I announce?
Indeed, we have published several issues on this individual.
So this guy named Kondo,
does he really exist?
Yes,
that's a fact.
We also recently got a tip about where he might be...
Where is it?
Well, the person selling the pipe
was asking for a large sum of money.
We said it was too much, and we haven't heard anything since.
Excuse me, Mr. Otani,
have you seen our chief editor?
No, not lately.
Is something wrong with Kanae?
She went out earlier and hasn't answered since.
But today's the deadline.
It's almost time.
Here is the kid's bag.
Small.
Yes ?
Uh, nothing.
Yes ?
Once you drop the kid off, your job is done.
Good job.
You made me move just to drop off a kid?
Don't play hardball.
I know very well that you're not a legendary killer,
but a simple crook.
This is a job for you,
don't get cocky.

Once the kid is dropped off,
stay and watch him until he's picked up.
If the police get involved, you'll have to take the consequences.
Even a punk like you should be able to handle it.
Hey, I gotta pee.
Oh, right.
There's a bomb in the backpack.
It's remotely activated,
so they're probably planning on detonating it at a specific time.
How did you...
I didn't have a ticket to the Kamen Yaiba exhibition on me at all.
I don't know what their goal is yet,
but everything else is fine.
You are the legendary Kondo, right?
I read a magazine about you.
Yes.
But in reality, you just help your targets to escape.
That's right.
I knew that.
My father told me that he once
he helped in a case where "Kondo" was involved.
And he thought
that Kondo, after accepting his contract,
would tell the target everything
and pretend to kill him, in exchange for money,
before helping him escape.
He didn't have any proof, but okay.
That's right.
So if the truth came out,
all the people who are supposed to be dead will be in danger again.
Is that how they blackmail you?
Yes.
Who are you, really?
I'm Conan Edogawa.
A detective.
A detective?
The big bad is probably
Tatsu the Improviser.
Yesterday, at the bathhouse,
I saw a shady guy watching the lockers
while washing his upper body over and over.
Are you done yet?
Almost!
I was curious about it so I went to the locker room
and I saw you there.
You weren't even wet, you looked suspicious.
I was wondering what you were doing when that Tatsu guy came in.
When he took a key out of his pocket, I couldn't help but approach him.
And that's when I saw the cookie jar in the locker.
I was naked and surrounded by three suspicious guys.
It was a little creepy.
So I grabbed my cell phone and my GPS tracker...
Your tracker ?
You can stick it anywhere like a sticker.
My glasses serve as a receiver.
They have built-in radar.
Hey, boy.
Did you come alone?
No.
Conan!
You're not too lonely?
No, I'm fine.
I ran into a friend of mine here.
I put the tag on his jacket
and I thought I'd try to warn someone...
but they wouldn't let me.
I fell on purpose to alert people around.
Just...
Is everything okay, kid?
I was given a sniff of a product
that made me actually pass out.
- A product? - Yes.
If they had it, they were planning to use it on someone there.
Probably...
On me, yes.
They put me on guard so they could get me there.
If they didn't have anything on you, you wouldn't have been able to resist and...
They probably had
plan to frame Kondo.
But don't you think their plan is a little flawed?
The police finding the bombs
and my presence at the baths was a coincidence.
They must have changed their plans at the time.
In other words, they improvised.
Is that why you're thinking of Tatsu the Improvisor?
But...
He was supposed to have been killed at the warehouse.
However..,
the news said they only found one body.
If there was Tatsu and the other man,
they should have found two.
So I checked the radar in my glasses,
and that's when I saw
that Tatsu was moving.
I actually...
I found out who the big bad of the story is.
He's in this house.
I'll save time,
use it to find him and notify the police.
Got it.
There's still the matter of the bomb.
Let me take care of it.
I'll take care of it.
Oh, and also...
My friends may have been captured.
Your friends?
Did you catch it?
Yes.
All I had to do was tell her I wanted to talk to her about her husband.
She's sleeping peacefully now.
But did you really have to go that far?
I'm careful.
Well, start by coming back here.
I'm already on my way.
Got it.
What, are you cold?
Why would I do that?

I'll explain later.
You owe me.
Have you forgotten that I helped you escape?
I don't have time today.
I have to take care of the cat and everything...
You're the only one I can trust!
You must really not have many friends.
Your correspondent is not available at the moment.
She must be at work.
Hello?
If you call her name
Kamen Yaiba, Yaiba
He will beat all the bad guys
On his mask shines a Y
What the hell am I doing here?
And you, who are you?
I'm hallucinating...
What's wrong with you? I almost ran you over!
I had an accident.
Can I come up?
Don't worry.
The boy told me everything.
There they are!
Only 50 feet to go.
I just have to press here,
and boom!
His Yaiba Punch works like a charm
And his Yaiba Kick
Opens the way to hope
Two meters.
One meter.
Zero!
There really was a bomb!
What did the warning say?
Just...
"There is a bomb here, evacuate the civilians."
Huh? Why? What's the big deal?
What's the big deal, why doesn't it go off?
Oh, for God's sake!
Don't bother.
- You... - Don't move.
Ai, are you okay?
Teacher!
Come on, lend it to me!
But Conan, what's wrong?
Yes ?
Everything is fine, your friends are fine too.
I know who his target is.
What a scumbag.
Is Tatsu with you?
No, he's not.
Hello, Conan!
What are you doing here, Ran?
What, are you kidding?
I'm looking for him.
I came to look for you, of course!
Shinichi's with you, right? Where is he?
There's a bomb!
Save yourselves all!
A bomb?
Hurry, Ran!
Wait, Conan!
Quick, everyone run!
Run away!
Run for your lives!
- It's not safe here. - Let's go!
Where's Tatsu?
I don't know.
I swear I don't know!
He should have been here by now,
- he must have been delayed by some other... - He's not coming.
You too were just one of his pawns.
A pawn to be thrown away when his task is done.
Look at the ceiling in the cellar if you don't believe me.
He says he wants to talk to you.
That wasn't a very smart thing to do.
You think blowing up your apartment
is gonna erase your past?
Who is the most stupid, here ?
My information on Tatsu the Improvisor
says he's a novice who takes on the easy jobs.
Your wife has a nice face, you know?
That...
These two..,
are they your accomplices?
You met a woman and wanted to settle down,
but it was a bit naive, don't you think?
I still have a little job for you.
Don't try to be a hero
or miss on purpose so that the police catch you,
or you can kiss your wife goodbye.
Conan!
Where are you, Conan?
Conan!
Get up! Get up!
What's the matter?
Quickly, start the car.
What have I gotten myself into?
There, maybe it was...
Daddy?
I knew it!
This is all Kondo's doing.
That car!
Come on, give it to me!
Watch them for a while.
Got it.
You, come with me.
It's all good.
There's still time.
Good, I'm counting on you.
Who is Tatsu to you?
You know I originally found you.
About a year ago
I discovered your secret door by chance.
You were in the middle of work, I think.
Hey, come and see this.
Hurry up!
Yeah, yeah...
Here, look.
Tatsu was really intrigued by this,
so he asked about you.
I see, so you're together.
Do you mind?
Turn left here.
Was it you who put those files on the red-brick warehouse at my place, too?
You know, he really thinks things through.
Don't underestimate him.
What's this again?
What a bad boy.
Don't you know this place is full
of surveillance cameras?
Hey!
- Where did you go? Is anyone here? - Is that jerk with you?
That hurts!
I'm sick of it...
Hey, you!
I was just asked to help, I have nothing to do with it!
Are you listening?
Shut up a little.
Don't shoot!
Now...
You're going to explain some things to me.

But that's my phone!
This chick,
it's good...
Excuse me, is anyone there?
Please!
Conan, are you there?
Shinichi!
Ran, isn't it?
If you're looking for Conan, he's inside.
So that jerk with him is named Shinichi?
Now be good and...
What's that?
There's a bomb in that truck.
Get in and wait for orders.
We'll tell you what to do next.
This is your last chance.
If you want to save your wife, you can't make a mistake.
If the original plan at the red-brick warehouse had worked,
you would have gone back to the mountain house, right?
He was going to get rid of you too.
You think you can fool me with a lie like that?
There's a message from your husband on your answering machine.
This may be the last time you hear it,
so keep your ears open.
Hello?
Sorry to break it to you like this, but we can't see each other anymore.
I have to go to the police for an old job I did.
I don't know what's going to happen.
I won't ask you to wait for me,
but just know...
that my life was miserable until I met you.
Thank you for everything.
End of new messages.
If he hadn't met you, he would have stayed in the underworld
and maybe he could have had a good life.
You really messed it up.
Reception room
She would like to know when her husband will be able to come home.
We have to make sure he's safe,
so please wait a little longer.
Are you ready, Kondo?
What are you going to make me do?
The car with the children of the Prime Minister of Nihorica
will soon pass over a bridge where you can see it.
You're going to run into it and cause an accident.
I'll set off the bomb myself.
Why do you want to kill the children?
Because I was hired to.
My job is to blow them up with a bomb.
It's business, that's all.
And the funny thing is that it was originally a job for you!
What was?
I let myself into your office, you see.
And I was quite surprised
when I found out that the famous Kondo really existed.
Even better:
by digging into your papers,
I found out that you didn't actually kill any of your targets.
In fact, you were just a petty thief who helped people escape.
And that's when...
He was a client from abroad.
He was looking for the best assassin in Japan
and had just found your details.
And you accepted the job?
A little, yes, he offered a good amount of money.
I gave him my number and accepted.
I also used the list of criminals you kept at home.
It's time to go.
Drive to the edge of the bridge.
And don't hang up.
Damn it!
Just a little more.
Just a little bit more...
Hey.
What?
I told you to go back to the other house, right?
His cell phone was gone!
He left his with the kid at the red brick warehouse,
so I had to give him mine.
So if you want to reach him, call my number.
I wanted to tell you before, but with all the cops...
But still...
Freeze, police!
What are you talking about?
Give up, it's over.
It was much too big a job for you.
By the way,
I recorded our conversations.
I'll use them as evidence.
- But how can you... - Hey!
Who are you talking to? Hello?
Hello, hello?
- Hey, wait! - You can't go through.
Let me through, please!
Do you live here?
Not exactly, but...
Police officers!
This gentleman is the husband of the lady being held hostage.
Is he telling the truth?
Well, yes.
You should have told us right away.
Your wife is fine.
She should be down soon, go ahead.
Thank you.
It was you who put my tracker on Nana, wasn't it?
Yes.
Quick, call the police! There's a bomb downstairs!
What?
Oh, Conan!
Can you tell me what's going on?
It's moving.
Sir!
What?
There!
Follow that light blue car.
Okay, sir.
Are you ready, Kondo?
What will you make me do?
I see.
What about the bomb?
I left that to the police.

Hello, is this the police?
Well, actually I found a bomb.
Yes, it was in a cookie jar... Yes.
But how did you find this place?
Ah, it's because
I thought Tatsu was a bit quick to find out that the apartment had exploded.
I figured he must have been close enough to see it,
and I bet on that.
A deduction worthy of the legendary Kondo.
But I tell you I don't know anything!
A friend just asked me to take a kid to the Yaiba exhibit!
Hey, kid.
It's not safe here, you should stay away.
Do you live around here?
Yes, sorry I'm going.
Hey!
Come and help me explain it to them!
They don't believe me!
The Disappearance of Conan Edogawa The two worst days in history
I finally lost sight of myself
I lied and said I was fine
No need to make excuses anymore
Let's just let our hearts dance
I lit flames in our hearts
But sorry, because of my sigh
They threaten to go out
Let our invincible hearts cry out
Come on, free yours! Respect yourself
If I can be true to myself
That other me seen in a dream should come back
Let's wake up our invincible hearts
There's nothing to fear, bring it back to life
After all the tears I've shed
I will greet the future invincible me
Who was that man who was with Conan earlier?
I don't know him.
I don't know him.
But where is Shinichi, after all?
I don't understand anything anymore!
Attention!
I will explain you.
All this
is the work of Kondo, the legendary assassin.
My involvement in this case began...
My emotions
Escape from my control
This overwhelming depression
I'm at the point where I can't take it anymore
Even if you discover my false identity
My escape instinct is at its peak
I'm at the point where I can't smile
So I'll take my chances
I'm going down a road without rails
No one can stop this feeling anymore
I explode, I explode! My heart's in turmoil
I explode, I explode! Don't stop me
I see the future: I will be your dynamite
Your exploding dynamite
I explode, I explode! My heart is in turmoil
I explode, I explode! Don't stop me
I see the future: I will be your dynamite
Your exploding dynamite
Concerning the case of the bomb discovered in Haido,
the police discovered the involvement of a member of the Arasen government.
The embassies of both countries...
Please, let me be Shinichi again just this once!
No.
Come on, don't be so adamant.
I don't know how to explain to Ran how she could receive...
...a message from Shinichi's cell phone.
Going back to being Shinichi won't help.
It will, come on...
Give me some medicine, please!
No way.
Radine.
It's for your own good.
Well, I'll think of an excuse.
Oh, one more thing.
Thank you.
You messed with me so much that your jacket ended up like this.
It was nothing.
It's pretty beat up.
I forgot the tub wasn't fixed.
How do I do it?
