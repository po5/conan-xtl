Toma Tachihara
Inauguration of the Tohto line
On that note, if Governor Asakura
would like to say a few words...
Yuichiro Asakura (66) Governor of Tokyo
To the 13 million residents of Tokyo
and to all train fans in the country :
thank you for your patience.
I declare open the Tohto Line, the 15th line of the municipal subway!
Any threats? To the governor of Tokyo?
Mr. Asakura received this at his home yesterday afternoon.
The sender didn't put his name.
"The heavens will punish you for your arrogance
"during your four years in office."
His arrogance?
He has a very good reputation, doesn't he?
Well, everyone has their own way of thinking.
There will always be people who disagree with the general opinion.
That's right, Shiratori.
Tomorrow Mr. Asakura will be at the opening of the Tohto Line.
We've been assigned
to see to his safety.
Don't slacken off for a moment.
The governor has just entered the train.
I can't wait to see the big space exhibit!
There's a spaceship simulator, right?
Oh yes, I want to do that!
Obviously, one of us doesn't seem very interested.
You're curious about this, aren't you?
This threatening letter sent to the governor
that Detective Megure told Mouri about.
Yes.
I hope it's nothing but hot air.
Yes, it is...
We're going through the Shin-Yamate tunnel.
But by the way, this tunnel,
- it crosses the Tohto line! - Yes, it does.
It joins it and goes under it.
Tohto line
Shin-Yamate tunnel
They are lined up for about 1 km.
We get there.
We join the Tohto line just after this bend.
What's the matter, Conan?
Nothing's wrong.
This person... it's suspicious.
He was on foot, but I didn't see a car or motorcycle parked.
And he was holding something...
Don't tell me...
Professor, stop!
What is it? What?
It's a bomb! There's a bomb in the tunnel!
A bomb?
Are you sure?
Ah, but...
It's impossible outside the emergency stop zones!
Conan!
Did he set the detonator?
Damn it!
This is Megure.
It's Kudo!
You must stop the train!
A bomb's going to explode!
A bomb?
Takagi!
- Stop the train! - There's a bomb!
An earthquake?
No... it's not that.
A train's out!
It's the Tohto line!
Kudo!
Oh no, there's a curve here!
Pull over!
Stop!
Pull over!
Stop!
Did we make it?
Governor, are you hurt?
No, I'm okay.
Thank you, sir.
DETECTIVE CONAN THE FIFTEEN MINUTES OF SILENCE
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug,
and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name...
I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
In order to find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
These are my current classmates:
Genta, Mitsuhiko and Ayumi.
They formed the Junior Detectives
which they made me join against my will.
And this old man here is Kogoro Mouri.
I don't need to draw you a picture.
These two gadgets were invented by Professor Agasa.
He's been helping me since I shrank
by creating a lot of original inventions.
Like this balloon belt.
By pressing the buckle,
this great invention inflates and pops a balloon.
And this time we will see this custom snowboard.
Pressing the axle
makes it go forward even on flat ground.
Of course it has a turbo motor, just like my skateboard.
By the way...
There is someone else who knows my real identity.
It's Ai Haibara. Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She used to work with the men in black,

but something happened that made her try to kill herself,
and by swallowing the same drug as me, she also became younger.
So, with Haibara, who since then lives with the teacher,
we live like elementary school children.
My body has become younger, but not my mind!
I will solve all the mysteries!
There is always only one truth!
It was a type of plastic explosive.
The bombs had a timer, activated by remote control.
On this subject,
according to the little Conan Edogawa who saw the culprit,
he waited for the subway to pass over him
to start the timer.
The subway was moving at 60 km/h.
The stop area where the culprit was waiting was 250 m from the bombs.
It was therefore deduced that the timer was set to 15 seconds.
If the subway driver had not braked,
the train would have been caught in the explosion and the damage would have been considerable.
Who tipped off Inspector Megure
about the bombs by telephone?
Well...
An ally of law enforcement.
That's all I can tell you.
Anyway, the governor is fine,
and no passengers were hurt...
Inspector.
As usual, I'm counting on you not to say anything about me.
Given my work, I'd like to avoid making any more enemies.
His job? He's still in high school!
Besides, thanks to little Conan,
no cars on the scene
was caught in the explosion, which is a real miracle.
And how did this Conan Edogawa
noticed the bombs?
It was Mr. Kogoro Mouri, here,
who warned him in advance of the possible presence of bombs.
Oh, the great detective!
Did I say that?
Do you have anything to say to the culprit, Mr. Mouri?
This criminal act
in addition to threatening the governor's life,
it also targeted the new Toei subway line,
one of the flagship projects of the second half of his term!
This is absolutely unforgivable!
What do you currently know about the culprit?
Unfortunately, the emergency stop zone of the tunnel
was not in the field of the surveillance cameras.
Furthermore, we believe that the culprit went up
through the emergency exit and escaped through the tracks.
However, there were no witnesses.
Conan was also unable to determine his age, gender or appearance.
Our detectives
are currently looking for signs of discontent
or even anger
against Governor Asakura
during his four years in office.
That will be all, thank you.
That was the police department's press conference, live.
What, they're done already?
They didn't even mention the Junior Detectives!
That's so lame.
So, come on, let's play a game?
Good idea!
Finding this criminal is going to be a bitch.
Besides, the threatening letter
might just be a cover for another motive.
Really, you think so?
Say, professor,
Governor Asakura
was the Minister of Land and Transport before?
I've heard that during that period
he had a village in Niigata destroyed to build a dam...
Yes, I remember that.
The Kitanosawa Dam, I think.
Asakura, then a minister,
went to the village in person.
He offered financial compensation and more land in a good location
and spent a week in the village
to discuss with each inhabitant.
He gained their trust and they agreed to leave the village.
After three years the new village was built,
and the construction of the dam
was completed in five years, a record time.
Yes, I remember that.
In spite of all this, some villagers were opposed to the project until the end.
I see!
If the construction of the dam is the real motive for the crime...
Then the culprit was a villager
or someone involved in the case.
For now, it's just a possibility.
But next Sunday,
there will be a ceremony for the 5th anniversary of the village,
and the governor was supposed to attend and spend the night there.

Of course, after all that, he had to cancel his visit.
Let me guess:
you want to go to this village to investigate.
Yes.
Will you take me there?
Take you where?
We want to come too!
There is always some for Conan!
I thought you were playing?
If the teacher goes, I'll go too.
You, Haibara?
If I leave him alone for two minutes, he'll become huge.
Huge...
It's a bit late for that
Kitanosawa Dam
Kitanosawa Village
- It's soon ours. - I can't wait!
Wow, it's cold!
But the snow is all fluffy!
It's so much fun!
Let's go for another ride?
Yes !
- The kids seem to be having fun. - Yes, they do.
They sure are.
Yeah, I'm glad we brought them along.
They're okay, but...
Come on, Ran, get going!
Wait, Sonoko!
- Don't push me like that! - I'm sorry.
Why are Ran and Sonoko here too?
Not to mention...
I'm here.
The legendary hot spring...
The best part?
It's mixed!
I've been dreaming about these mixed baths !
Will I meet a sexy woman there ?
Or a beautiful girl ?
Let's see!
Bingo!
Oops!
The water is good, isn't it?
It's kind of exhilarating to bathe
while watching the snowy landscape on your journey, don't you think...
miss?
I don't know what to choose.
Everything looks delicious!
The takoyaki is too good!
So is the grilled squid.
And the grilled mochi is great!
Let's try everything!
Not before my quiz.
Which of these snacks
is it better to eat under the powder snow?
Answer 1:
a grilled potato.
Answer 2:
a grilled mochi.
Answer 3:
a grilled squid.
Answer 4:
takoyaki.
What is powder snow?
Light snow.
Powdery...
Powdery... powder...
I found it!
Answer 4: takoyaki!
What's that? Why do you say that?
Because they are made with flour, right?
I often make them with my mom!
And then, in Kansai,
it's called konamon, "dish made with flour", Kazuha told me.
Interesting!
But then, it was a bit simple.
There is no surprise.
Sorry if it was too bland for your taste...
My turn, then.
Which of these snacks is best for the teacher?
The answer is: none.
They would make you fat.
Sniff...
That wasn't a quiz...
- Well, in the meantime... - we're going to eat!
We'll think of the teacher when we're stuffing ourselves!
- Shall we get something too? - Yes!
We'll think of you, teacher!
And you, Ai and Conan?
- I'm fine. - I'm fine.
I'm going for a walk in the village.
Well, then I'm going with Conan...
No way. Come have a tea with me.
5th Birthday Party Kitanosawa Town Hall
A map of Kitanosawa?
Yes !
And a guide to the dam, please!
Okay, wait just a minute.
Hey, Yamao...
I heard the ski store went out of business.
Yeah, I just heard.
Too many avalanches, apparently.
Sorry for the wait.
This is the map of Kitanosawa Lake,
and here's the same scale map of the old Kitanosawa village.
Uh, my friend really wants
to know which part of the lake the house he grew up in sank into.
Is that so?
- Well, shall we go? - Yes, let's.
Oops.
I gotta watch out...
Hey mister, that's a taser, right?
You are well informed for your age...
It's for my protection.
When you're an insurance inspector in Tokyo,
it's better to be careful.
I always carry one with me when I go out.
Well, thanks again.
Not too long to wait?
Well, then...
A map of Kitanosawa and a guide to the dam, here
- Here you go - Thank you, sir.
Say, the people who were against the dam all along...
Are they living in the new village?
Why do you want to know that?
Uh, I have a winter break presentation to do...
What grade are you in?
First grade.
Then maybe you should choose a simpler topic.
Like...
Look, at Lake Sawajiri near the village,
there are lots of swans at this time of year.
Aren't you interested in watching them?

This lake is a natural hot spring,
so it doesn't freeze in the winter.
Okay, I'll think about it!
I should have known he wouldn't say anything to a kid...
Temporary medical office
It hurts...
Here, take this medicine.
Thank you for taking it.
Drink it and it will be better very quickly
for you and your overfull stomach !
Pff, that'll teach you to want to eat ten whole trays of takoyaki!
Oh, it's not much...
- It's not a compliment. - I'm sorry, sir.
What grade are you in?
First grade!
- Oh, well... First grade, huh? - Yes.
Wasn't that good?
Yes, delicious!
It just lacked a little eel rice.
Seriously...
How could you eat again with all that you ate earlier?
Genta has a stomach of steel!
I still have room!
Hey, by the way!
We should buy a souvenir for Mrs. Kobayashi!
Good idea!
- Do you think they have cookies? - Does he still want to eat?
Coming, Conan?
Yes.
I'm going to my room!
"Snowshoe trekking"?
Is that at Lake Sawajiri?
Please, ma'am!
Yes, what is it?
That snowshoe trek there,
does it go by the dam?
Well...
We can go by the dam if anyone's interested.
- Are you interested in the dam ? - A little bit.
What should we get him?
Bear cakes!
No, I'd rather have this owl!
It looks intellectual, look!
What do you think, Ai?
What, a mug?
"I love swans"?
It also reads "I love Shiratori"!
Well, Shiratori?
- Did you catch a cold? - No, I'm not cold.
With that criminal running around,
I don't have time to catch a cold!
Will I be able to finish it by next winter?
Hey, Ran, what do you think?
What do you mean?
To bring back as a gift to Makoto!
Oh yeah! Why not? It's cute.
- And it looks a bit like you. - Does she?
What about you?
What about me?
Well, don't you bring back any souvenir to Shinichi?
Oh, don't bother!
I couldn't give it to him, he's always away on a case.
You shouldn't leave him lying around without a necklace,
or some other girl will end up chaining him up before you do!
Without a collar?
What am I, a dog?
Anyway, I guess the same goes for Makoto...
Well...
It doesn't cost me anything to give him a call.
Damn it!
Yes, hello?
Shinichi?
You'll never guess where I am!
Kitanosawa, Niigata Prefecture.
We're at the snow festival...
Wow, it's beautiful!
What?
The lights are great!
And with the snow falling, it's really magical...
I wish you could have seen it.
I wish I could too...
If it's that beautiful,
I would have liked to see them.
What do you want as a souvenir?
Anything.
You're not helping me by saying that!
Just pick something.
Well, if you insist... What do they have?
A lot of things!
Bear cakes...
Carved wooden owls...
Or mugs with swans.
Swans...
Creepy.
Well, an owl then.
Okay, got it!
I don't know when I'll be able to get it back, though,
so just leave it at my place.
Honestly, you could come home once in a while!
Yes, yes, yes...
Where are they going at this hour?
Hello, Shinichi?
Sorry, I'm a bit busy.
See you later.
Shinichi!
Definitely...
Just in case...
Vibrate mode activated
Ah, damn it!
Damn...
But this is...
the gifts I mentioned?
Well, an owl then.
Is Shinichi...
Very cool!
It goes so fast!
I've always wanted to try this!
- It's really fun! - Yeah, right?
Yippee! It's like a roller coaster!
- My heart is beating out of my chest! - You ain't seen nothing yet!
- Uh, Genta... - It's dangerous!
It's not dangerous, trust me!
- Genta! - Front, front!
What? What? What?
Circuit
Hey, Genta, does it look like
we're off the track?
Do you? Does it?
Oh no! It's forbidden to go on the road!
Right? Are you serious?
Turn around, then.
Hey, are you alive?
Yeah, I think so.
The snow broke our fall.

It sucks, doesn't it?
We're not going to be able to get it up on our own.
What are we gonna do?
I don't think the snow will stop,
and we're too far away to walk home!
But there's not a car in sight either...
Don't worry!
You forget we have this!
They're abusing us!
What's wrong with leaving like this?
Look at the bright side.
Your skateboard has been upgraded to go on the snow.
Yeah, well, it sure has.
Are they here?
It's taking him a while, Conan...
But it's pretty good under the snow.
Yes.
Can't you hear anything?
There's Conan!
What took you so long, Conan?
Did you come too, Ai?
I didn't want to leave him alone,
since he's not used to driving on snow.
I see.
We can't do anything without an adult.
Let's call the teacher to come and get us.
We asked you to come here so he wouldn't find out...
We have no choice.
- And first of all... - It's your fault, Genta!
You wanted to do too much!
You were having fun too!
Yes, but there are limits!
- Think a little before you act! - What?
Stop it, both of you!
What are you saying, that I never think?
Ah, because you've thought about it?
Of course I have!
You're always being clever!
What's that? Are you kidding?
- You're an idiot! - You are!
That's enough of that!
Stop it, both of you.
Once said, the insults
cannot be taken back.
But...
Words hurt, you know.
Depending on how they are used, they can become weapons.
And sometimes that's enough to lose a friend for life.
If you lose sight of each other,
you may never see each other again.
A car is coming!
Yes, we'll be home soon.
Tell the others not to worry.
- Okay, be careful. - I will!
Hey...
You'll have to apologize when we get there.
- Yes, we... - We know.
Sorry, Mitsuhiko.
No, I am.
You're lucky, you know?
I have to meet someone at the lodge,
but if I didn't, I wouldn't have come this way.
You don't live in Kitanosawa, sir?
No, I built a cabin behind the mountain where I live alone
with my wooden owls.
What are you talking about? You mean the carved owls?
Do you make them?
I carve the little ones from my cabin.
But for the big ones, I have a workshop near the dam.
By the dam?
I used to live in the village,
but since everything ended up under water because of the dam...
Tell me,
weren't you the one who was against the dam until the end ?
Yes, it was me.
All those who were against it in the beginning,
including my parents,
ended up moving to the new land.
This damned village!
We're sorry.
- You little... - Come on, come on, Mouri.
They seem to regret it.
- But... - And this gentleman is waiting.
Thank you so much for driving them home!
Oh, no, no, no.
I was just on my way here.
Oh, you were?
Well, I'll let you go.
Okay, thanks again!
Say thank you, too.
Thank you, sir.
Don't give them any more trouble, huh?
I won't.
Come on, let's go inside.
- You must have been cold. - Yeah, it was.
I thought we were going to freeze to death!
Who's the idiot who wanted to ride the snowmobile?
It was you!
Hey, Muto!
We're here. What took you so long?
Look, it's the nurse!
Oh yeah, it's her!
Thanks for the afternoon!
Good evening.
How's your tummy?
Much better.
- Genta has a stomach of steel! - What's this? These two...
Sorry, but...
wouldn't you be Kogoro Mouri, the famous detective?
Yes, I am.
It's me, Kogoro Mouri, the great detective.
I knew it!
Are you on a case in the area?
Oh, no!
We came for the snow festival.
We wouldn't have brought children otherwise.
No, I suppose not.
That goes without saying!
Anyway, if I expected to meet you in such a place!
Didn't I?
Let me introduce you.
Sitting next to me is Keisuke Yamao.
Keisuke Yamao (34 years old)

And opposite, Mizuki Tohno
Mizuki Tohno (33 years old)
Fuyumi Tachihara (34 years old)
And Fuyumi Tachihara.
Takehiko Muto (34 years old)
And this is Takehiko Muto.
Shogo Hikawa (34 years old)
As for me, I am Shogo Hikawa.
We all used to live in the old Kitanosawa village,
and Yamao and I
came from Tokyo for the memorial ceremony.
So you are all childhood friends?
Yes, we were classmates in elementary school.
However, since it was the village school,
we were the only ones in our class.
What? There were only five of you?
Yes!
We hadn't seen each other for eight years.
Eight years?
That must be an emotional reunion, then!
But why
haven't you seen each other in eight years?
Ah, that...
is because of this.
Hey! Stop it, Hikawa!
But that's...
Eight years ago,
when Yamao was living in Tokyo,
he was going to the old village where his grandmother lived alone, when...
He got scared
and fled to the village, leaving her lifeless body behind.
And a few hours later,
he turned himself in to the police with remorse.
Did he?
Yes.
My car was pretty banged up and everything,
so I wouldn't have gotten away with it.
At that time,
he'd gone into debt with gambling
and his life was a mess!
He was tried
for speeding, drunk driving and hit and run.
To top it off, his license was suspended,
so he took a big hit and didn't get out until last summer.
So while he was in jail...
The negotiations for the dam took place
and the village went under.
Yamao's grandmother
collapsed when she heard about the accident
and left us soon after.
So she never lived in the new village...
The worst part of all this
is that the girl who died because of her
was Mizuki's little sister, Natsuki, who was only 18 years old.
Yamao.
I never forgave you.
I don't forgive you, Hikawa!
When they talked about the dam
you and your family quickly agreed and sold your land
at a good price and ran off to Tokyo. That's unforgivable!
Calm down, Muto...
And you're the one who convinced my parents!
You sold our precious hometown!
Do you understand?
In our society, we have to be smart!
Well, we've lingered too long.
Let's go back to our rooms.
Good idea.
We won't disturb them anymore.
Come on, kids, let's go.
Yeah, let's go.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
That woman,
Fuyumi, seems to have something on her mind too.
Yes.
They may have been schoolmates,
life finally separated them.
Yes, you have to believe.
Don't worry!
It won't happen to you two.
How can...
I know what you're thinking, what do you think!
"What will happen to Shinichi and me?"
Am I right?
No, you're not!
I was just thinking about those people,
I don't care about Shinichi!
And if not, for this story of souvenir gift,
do you really think Shinichi is here?
Yes.
He didn't rent a room here, apparently, but...
I just have a feeling that he's close by.
Even though, in reality,
I have that feeling all the time!
You sold out our precious hometown!
Do you understand?
Could this Muto be related to the bombing?
And then,
his former classmates...
Snow, snow!
- Shall we have a snowball fight? - Yes!
Come on!
Conan, Ai, come on!
Without me, thank you!
If we don't watch them, who knows what they'll do...
Bull's-eye!
Ah, is it like that?
You'll see!
Come back here!
- There they are! - Let's run !
Take this !
Hey, don't go !
- Upsy-daisy! - Come on!
Someone is watching us!
Looks like he wants something from us.
Hello !
I...
am...
Sorry, we came here to play without asking.
Can I...
play... with you?
I want...
to be friends...
Can I join...
your game?
He's a little weird, isn't he, this teenager?
Yes, he talks like a child.
Toma?
You're awake!
Toma!

Toma... Toma!
What? Mommy?
Great!
I wanted to see you, Mom!
Toma!
Great!
Toma Tachibana (15 years old)
Eight years ago, Toma,
Fuyumi's son,
fell off a cliff near the old village one morning,
and was found unconscious.
He was immediately taken to the nearest hospital
and could be saved, but...
he had been in a coma for the past eight years.
That long?
It happened on the same day as the accident caused by Yamao.
The same day?
Yes.
Our village was very peaceful,
so two serious incidents on the same day
it shook the whole village.
What did the police think about Toma's fall?
They deduced that it was an accident.
The cliff was near the lake where Toma liked to go to watch the swans,
and when they found him, he had binoculars around his neck,
so they think he slipped.
He was found
by the dog of the neighboring house, which Toma liked very much.
Where were Fuyumi and her husband, then?
Fuyumi is a single mother.
On that day, she was called to an emergency
she was called to an emergency at the hospital where she worked.
There were no grandparents either?
No.
Fuyumi's parents were caught in an avalanche...
Did they die?
They were found 30 minutes later.
If they had been there for 15 minutes,
they could have been saved.
When we are caught in an avalanche,
our survival time is estimated at 15 minutes.
Fifteen minutes?
Yes, that's what our life or death is at stake.
It's not much...
Well, then...
You can take a leave from the clinic,
so stay and look after Toma.
I will.
Thanks for everything.
What did they say, Fuyumi?
Mizuki,
Muto...
Physically, Toma is fine.
That's good.
But on the mental side...
He has no memory of the day he fell.
So
he can't understand why he stayed
asleep for 8 years.
You must be relieved though.
Really, what a relief.
I'm sorry, but
have you considered switching to contacts?
Contact lenses
would look much better on a beautiful woman like you!
Glasses make you look stern.
I don't really like that.
Hey, Dad!
You look intrigued.
That Toma's accident
and Mr. Yamao's accident happened on the same day.
Yes.
Is it just a coincidence?
Or...
Madam!
Is it true that Toma is awake?
Oh, you've all come?
Come in, come in!
Do you think he'll be all right?
It's a bit early for him to see them, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Look, Toma, it's Kaori and the others.
Hi, how are you?
Long time no see, Toma!
Let's take a break.
Yes, let's!
Look at all those swans!
Oh, Mizuki, you have...
Yes.
I wore contact lenses.
They've already been prescribed for me.
Well, you look much better like this!
It really makes you look good.
He's incorrigible!
Hey,
she changed her hairstyle too, didn't she?
Maybe she's got a crush on your father.
Give me a break, Sonoko!
No, really, what a beauty!
Sorry...
The lake's there, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Where's the cliff where Toma fell off?
- Toma? - Yes, that's it.
Let's see... This is it.
What is it? That's strange.
It's a long way from the road he took to get here.
He must have gotten lost, that's all.
Listen, you...
And the accident Mr. Yamao caused was on this curve?
Yes, it was here.
But why are you asking me that?
Go look somewhere else!
Conan!
Oh! It's snowing!
Oh yes, here.
I've had enough.
- Did you find anything suspicious? - Sort of, yes.
I'm not sure if Toma really went to see the swans.
It's so beautiful!
It looks like it will last.
No, don't worry.
It will end soon.
Well, let's get back on the road.
The snow really has stopped!
The locals really know their stuff.

Mizuki,
how about visiting Tokyo on occasion?
I'll be your guide!
I'd like to see the Sky Tree Tower.
Uh, anywhere but there...
Are you afraid of heights, Mr. Mouri?
Yes, I admit it.
And you, what is your pet peeve?
- Me, it's the narrow places... - Ouch!
Why are you standing between us?
I can walk wherever I want!
What's wrong, Mizuki?
What? That jacket is Hikawa, right?
Hey, Hikawa!
Can't he hear us?
What's he doing out there alone?
Hey, isn't that weird?
Yes, I do.
Wait for me here, okay?
Hikawa?
What are you doing here?
Daddy...
Yeah, I'll take a look.
Well, Hikawa, what's wrong?
Hikawa?
Mizuki!
What's wrong with you?
It's Hikawa, he's weird!
- Get out of the way! - Yes, sir.
Mr. Hikawa, what's wrong?
Mr. Hikawa? You...
Daddy! Daddy!
No, don't come!
No...
He's dead.
- Are you alright? - Yes...
I don't see any external injuries.
Did he freeze to death? No...
A heart attack, maybe.
It's true that as a child, he already had a weak heart...
That must be it, then.
Ran! Call the police!
Yes, right away.
Hey, that's weird.
He doesn't have his Taser on him anymore.
Hey! Get away from me, you microbe!
Mr. Hikawa said he always keeps a Taser in his pocket for self-defense!
If it's not on him,
it means someone was with him and took it.
No, it can't be.
Why can't it be?
Look at this.
There are only his footprints.
The prints are from his boots.
Clearly, Mr. Hikawa
came alone for a walk outside the village
and had a heart attack during his walk.
That's obvious.
Where is his taser, then?
He must have left it at the lodge.
That's unlikely.
Maybe not,
but the footprints...
What if it was subterfuge by the killer?
What if it was?
But yes, it happens often!
The mystery of footprints in the snow!
You, then...
Footprints
in the snow?
I've got it!
It's definitely a subterfuge of our culprit!
Listen to this!
The killer has previously
killed Mr. Hikawa with poison or something
to make it look like a heart attack.
Then he put on boots identical to those worn by Mr. Hikawa
and carried the body here.
Then he left it here
and stole his taser.
Finally, he walked backwards
backwards in his own footsteps.
Walking backwards?
Is that really possible?
Of course it can!
Check it out!
What the hell...
Why is there so much snow in his hood?
I know why!
I got it, Uncle!
The killer used a very simple trick.
What?
It was snowing just before, wasn't it?
The killer came on foot with Mr. Hikawa from the river
and killed him here by making it look like a heart attack.
And in the meantime, the falling snow
erased all their footprints.
Then the killer waited until it stopped snowing,
and put on boots like Mr. Hikawa's
to walk back to the village
without having to follow any tracks.
You see!
By doing so, he left only one kind of footprint.
And for proof, look at Mr. Hikawa's hood.
It's full of snow.
When it stopped snowing, the culprit
probably just removed the snow from his head and shoulders.
All this to make us believe that he came there after it snowed.
But this subterfuge
would have been meaningless if we hadn't found him right away.
If he had left it there and it had started snowing again
he would have gone to all that trouble for nothing.
Which means that the culprit
was someone who knew we were going to be passing through here.
Or someone who would have guided us there...
By looking at the sign with the map of the trekking,
anyone could have deduced that we would be towards here at this hour.
It's not wrong...
Say, Mizuki...
What's the direction of the footprints?
Muto's place is over there.
His lodge?
Yes, but
there's a road to get there by car from the village.

Is this the road he picked us up on last night?
Why didn't Hikawa take that road?
No, Hikawa and his murderer
deliberately avoided the road.
They left the river and cut through here to get to the cabin.
But why?
Sorry for the wait.
Mr. Hikawa's body
is being examined by a doctor at the university hospital.
The cause of death is definitely cardiac arrest,
Officer Watanabe Niigata Police
Officer Sasamoto Niigata Police
but without a thorough analysis,
we cannot say whether it was caused by
was caused by natural causes or not.
What do you mean by that?
You mean Hikawa was killed?
We can't say for sure yet.
Mr. Yamao,
what were you doing this afternoon around 2:00?
I did not see Hikawa all afternoon.
I was walking in the woods on the east side.
- Were you alone? - Yes, I was alone.
And you didn't run into anyone?
No.
All right, then.
Then...
Mrs Tachihara?
I was watching Toma who was sleeping, exhausted from his morning exams,
so I was home all the time.
Can anyone confirm this?
No.
And you, Mr Muto?
I was in my workshop near the dam,
working.
Your workshop?
So you weren't at the cabin where
Mr. Hikawa was found?
No.
Can anyone confirm this?
You don't think so!
I don't like to be disturbed in my work.
But then
why was Mr. Hikawa heading to your mountain hut?
How should I know?
Were you really not at your cabin?
What?
You didn't make Hikawa come to your place and kill him?
You could have pretended to want to talk about Mizuki.
What are you talking about?
When we were young,
Hikawa asked Mizuki to marry him, but she refused.
But Hikawa was still in love with her.
You knew that by saying her name he would come for sure.
Did you?
I was sure it was Muto who loved Mizuki!
Why would I kill Hikawa, huh?
You seemed to be mad at him for that dam thing!
It's so ridiculous that I have no words.
Well, finally, Mrs. Tohno...
She was with us,
so her alibi is airtight.
I see.
It's all taken care of.
I have no more questions for now,
but if it turns out that Mr. Hikawa was really murdered,
I'll come to you for more details.
I'm sorry, but the search...
We can't force them to do it until we have confirmation.
And then, even if the object in question was indeed stolen,
the culprit will probably have already hidden it.
Thank you all for your cooperation.
- He talks too slowly, this guy! - Yes!
He made me want to sleep.
It's so cold!
Why do we have to go through this just to see the sunrise?
Stop complaining, will you?
I wonder who killed Mr. Hikawa.
I wonder too.
If it was Mr. Muto,
considering the footprints,
he didn't kill him at the lodge but waited for him on the road.
And after killing him, he went to the river.
But what I don't understand
is why Mr. Hikawa was walking on this deserted snowy field.
Even if Mr. Muto asked him to, it's still quite strange.
That's for sure.
He could have gone by car.
In any case..,
I wonder if this murder is related to the bombing.
If it is, then it's certainly not over.
There'll be another incident, that's for sure.
Ran again!
I'm not available right now...
Pfft, again!
Shinichi's still not answering?
No.
I wanted to tell him about Mr. Hikawa.
Is he really in this village,
that obsessed investigator?
You heard her.
Let her talk.
Does she know what time it is?
Oh, isn't that Toma over there?
Kuro...
- Toma! - Hey, there!
What are you doing here, Toma?
"Kuro's grave"?
Is that the dog that found you eight years ago?
Why would he do that?
Is Kuro really dead?
Toma!
What the hell are you doing here?
Mom...
Are you going to leave without saying anything?
Calm down, ma'am.

Why is this happening to me? Why is this happening to me?
I don't get it!
My friends have become strangers
and Kuro is dead!
I don't know what to do!
I don't understand a thing!
Kuro... Kuro!
Toma!
You have to understand him...
He's still a 7 year old in a teenager's body.
It's a reality too hard for him to understand.
It's a bit the opposite of us.
Toma!
Mommy!
Look at that! The snow is shining!
This is not snow.
It's ice crystals.
Crystals?
It's raining crystal?
But no...
The water vapor freezes in the air because of the cold
and forms what we call ice dust.
Come on, Toma, come and look too!
It's really beautiful!
It looks great, doesn't it? It's a treasure!
Toma?
What's the matter? Are you alright, Toma?
Does he remember?
I have seen this light before. But where...
No, I don't remember!
- Toma! - Are you all right, Toma?
- Toma! - Toma...
I can't... remember.
It was beautiful, the ice dust.
Yes, it was like a fairy tale!
Another one, madam!
Do you think he tried to remember...
Yes.
I thought it might have something to do with his accident eight years ago,
and I asked around,
but it just snowed that day,
no sign of ice pow.
What could he have seen, then?
By the way, where are the others?
Out playing with Toma, apparently.
I hope they're not up to something again!
Hey, how far do we have to go?
My mom will get mad if I stray too far.
Hey, Toma!
Don't you want us to get closer to the cliff where you fell?
You might remember a lot of things if we go there!
But...
We'll stay with you!
What's up?
- Take your courage in both hands! - I will!
Let's go !
- Yeah! Let's do it! - It's gonna be okay.
All right, now...
Where did the kids go?
Over by the campground, maybe.
They're having a memorial party, right?
Yeah, starting at 10:00.
That's only an hour away.
I just hope they don't do anything stupid.
If they do, this time they'll taste my fist!
It's the people from the dam.
Maybe they're coming for the ceremony.
But isn't it dangerous to leave the dam unattended?
- Don't worry about it. - We left two people there.
Damn, did you hear me?
Let us have a little coffee, anyway.
Don't worry!
Shame, Sonoko...
I'll meet you afterwards, you go ahead.
Don't run, you'll trip!
No, I won't.
Hello !
You were a friend of Toma's, right?
Did you come to visit him?
Yes, I wanted to show him something,
but he's not here.
What is it? Can I see it?
Is this picture from eight years ago?
We must have been your age.
Oh? Twins?
- You were in school there, right? - Yes.
He had them with him at school?
Yeah, it was kind of his trademark.
He carried them everywhere.
So he didn't necessarily go out to see the swans that day.
This drawing was a gift from Toma.
He really loved Kuro.
I wanted to show him all this
and talk with him a little...
But he might be sorry.
The other day,
when Hikawa showed us the newspaper article,
it was folded on the front side.
But in principle, we rather fold the back side
to prevent the paper from getting dirty.
What are you looking at?
Uh, nothing!
Thanks for showing it to me.
I have to get back to the lodge!
Be careful not to trip!
I'm fine!
Hey, we can change the sheets anyway, right?
Stop it, don't open it!
What's that? Is it forbidden?
Of course, come on!
They're going to come and check for fingerprints and everything.
Right? Is it true?
Blimey, they'll suspect me!
You're going to jail, here !
Stop scaring me!
Found it.
A robbery in a jewelry shop ?
"On the 15th, around 11 pm,
"the Misuzu jewelry shop, in Tokyo's Shinjuku district, was robbed.

"The owner, Eiko Misuzu (51), was working late and was stabbed to death.
"The culprit fled with jewels worth one billion yen."
This case...
If I remember correctly, it happened when I was in the third grade
and the culprit is still at large.
But why did Hikawa keep this article?
Oh, but that date...
Yes, that's right!
That's the night before Yamao's accident!
Now that I think about it...
Yamao was sitting next to him.
So he didn't see the same side as us,
but the other side of the sheet.
Which means he saw this article!
Maybe...
Hello, Kudo?
I can't reach the kids.
What's wrong?
And also...
Hello?
Isn't this the cell phone base station?
Not only that!
The landlines don't work anymore either!
The two telephone stations have exploded?
What a bummer, an accident on the day of the ceremony!
No, it wasn't an accident!
What is it? My cell phone doesn't work...
There's no signal!
Do you read me, Haibara?
Loud and clear.
How is it on your end?
People are freaking out a bit, no cell phones are working.
I'll bet...
What about the kids...
Someone saw them hanging out with Toma.
Then the four of them went somewhere.
Meet me here quickly, please.
I understand.
They wouldn't be...
Let's gather our strength
- And test our courage... - Is it that way?
Yes, I think so.
But be quiet!
- I know we're singing loud! - Let's apologize to Ayumi!
- Let's walk firmly on this floor... - So, is it still there?
And we're still walking...
Yes, it's here!
But what does it want from us?
What are you talking about?
- Come on, let's run! - Yes!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
- We'll explain later! - Just run!
But why?
How long has he been following us?
I have no idea.
We noticed it too late!
Is he a bad guy?
We don't know!
- I am afraid! - That's why we run!
That day too, I was trying to run away.
Did you hear that?
Yes.
- It's dangerous, stay... - Now you're dreaming!
You're acting a little too cool for a kid!
If you say so.
A cave!
Let's hide inside!
Yeah!
Hurry, hurry!
No, wait!
Damn it! Haibara, go!
Yes !
What the hell are they doing here?
Go to the back!
Wow, it looks like it's going to go far!
Hey!
Get in quickly, Haibara!
Get in, are you crazy? You want to die in here?
But it's too narrow for an adult.
Toma could have come in!
And what will you do if he shoots his gun from the entrance?
No, but seriously!
Tell me!
What's wrong with going in there?
I just told them.
We have to move forward now.
Yes, yes.
What's up? Someone was chasing you?
Yeah, I just remembered.
I thought so.
I'm starting to see it more clearly.
Oh, no, you're not. If my deduction is correct...
- Hey... - What is it?
Run!
We have to get to the dam before he does!
Why the dam?
We don't understand anything!
Explain it to us!
I don't have any proof yet,
and this is just my hypothesis...
but the culprit of all the crimes
is Yamao !
If he is the one who stole the jewelry in Tokyo 8 years ago,
killing the owner
and fleeing with jewels worth a billion yen,
so it all makes sense.
Chased by the debt collectors,
he headed to Kitanosawa, to his grandmother's house.
And on the way,
he hit Natsuki at the entrance of the village.
He then panicked.
If the police arrested him now,
they would find out about the theft,
since the stolen jewels were in his car.
If we hit someone,
our first instinct is to get out and see how they are.
And while he was looking at Natsuki,
he probably bumped into you...
Toma.
Me?
That day,
you were following your mother who'd left in the night, right?
You were following the road in question to visit her in the hospital.
That's why...
Right? Mom?
Great!

I wanted to see you, Mom!
When he woke up, in his head
he was still 8 years earlier.
Yes.
For Yamao,
it was easy to knock Toma out and put him in his car.
And he kept driving
wondering what to do with him.
But then he saw them.
Toma came to his senses
and saw the diamonds in the car.
Then when he saw the ice dust,
what he was trying to remember...
it was a real treasure!
As soon as Toma saw the jewels,
it was all over for Yamao.
Are the jewels at his grandmother's house?
He hid them, right?
That's right.
I know this because he was looking for his house.
He turned himself in knowing that he would be released in a few years.
But his crime turned out to be more serious than he thought,
and in the meantime the village sank because of the dam.
If he wants the jewels back,
he'll have to drain all the water from the dam.
- Drain... - all the water?
That's why he waited for the ceremony.
Why?
He knew that the employees of the dam would be there!
There are only two people left,
and they have no idea there's a bomb.
But if he does this, the whole village...
They will all die!
That's why we have to get to the dam before he does!
Look out!
The light!
That's the way out!
Yeah, we made it through!
It's clear, you can come out.
A water pipe?
We can get in that way.
Yes, this is definitely the fastest way.
So Mr. Hikawa's killer...
Yes, that's Yamao, too.
There were two things standing in the way of his plan.
One was Hikawa.
He was his old schoolmate
but also an insurance inspector.
He probably found out that Yamao had committed the robbery and murder
and he had to promise not to tell anyone
in exchange for a share of the loot.
Assuming that Yamao pretended to accept
and planned to kill Hikawa before blowing up the dam,
everything makes sense.
After all,
there was no evidence that Hikawa was blackmailing Yamao.
And then,
both Hikawa's murder and the dam explosion
would both fall on Muto.
Muto had a motive,
since he had a grudge against Hikawa and despised the dam.
But how did he bring Hikawa to this place by car?
Well, if I have to guess...
Huh? Muto has what?
Apparently he figured out what we want to do
and wants to meet us to talk about it.
Depending on what he says, we may have to eliminate him.
At least, that's what he made him think to attract Hikawa.
And that's why they were both walking in the snowy plain.
And the second obstacle
was the governor coming to the memorial ceremony.
If he came to the village
many journalists and others would follow.
Even destroying the stations to make the phones unusable,
the news of the dam explosion would still get out.
I see.
Even if we drowned the village,
he would need time to get the jewels back.
So to prevent the governor from coming,
and also to test his bomb, he blew up the tunnel.
But he surely didn't expect
that Toma would regain consciousness.
Since Toma had coincidentally lost all memory of the incident,
he must have been relieved.
But when he saw that the ice dust
could revive his memory,
he set out to kill him, and all of you with him.
All he would have to do is find the jewels and run away.
No doubt he has already planned his escape.
Yes.
What's the matter, Toma?
Are you tired?
No.
Was it something I said?
Yes.
Something's wrong, but I don't know what.
I'm sorry, but we have to hurry now.
Yamao lost time coming to attack Toma,
so he probably hasn't planted the bombs yet.
Yes, since there were the employees before.
If that's the case, all is not yet lost.
Are we almost there?
Why are we just going up?
It's okay, you can come.
- Careful. - Thank you, sir.
Phew, I'm tired!
Come on, Toma, you're almost there.
Well, we managed to get in safely.

Speak for yourself...
- Are you okay? - No, I can't take it anymore.
I can't even lift a finger.
That was predictable.
Stay here and protect Toma, okay?
I'll notify the dam staff.
- I understand. - You can count on us.
I'll check Mr. Muto's workshop.
He can't be far.
Okay, be careful.
Maybe Yamao will go first.
I know, sir.
The rest of you go hide quickly.
Yes.
What the...
Are you all right? Hang in there!
No external injuries.
They were tasered?
But then...
No !
They are the same as on the highway!
Damn, how did he do it?
Did he come by car or by snowmobile?
Yes ?
Kudo, I arrived at the workshop...
...and it's no good!
I found Muto passed out!
- I thought so. - Didn't you?
The workers passed out too.
He probably tasered them.
Wait a minute...
That's weird!
He was much too quick...
Kudo? What's wrong?
Answer me, Kudo!
Don't tell me...
Bombs?
Don't talk so loud!
I'm telling you this because you're a detective,
but if word got out, there'd be panic!
Oh yes, my apologies.
So, are you sure this is what destroyed the stations?
We have received reports of a piece of debris similar to a timer.
We're worried about our two colleagues at the dam, so we're going back.
We can't call them from here.
Can we use our phones at the dam?
Yes, there's another base station nearby.
Maybe we can reach Conan.
Yes.
Let's go with them!
Another shooting!
I'm worried about Conan...
Yes, so am I.
That's enough, I can't stand it!
- Let's go to him! - Yes, let's!
What an idiot that kid is!
If you had stayed quietly and enjoyed the festival,
you would have died without pain!
Come on, speak ! Where are your little friends?
I came alone.
You don't seem to understand the situation,
but we'll do something about it!
Dirty!
Who do you think you are, microbe!
I don't have time to mess with you!
I'm in a hurry, so I'll believe you when you say you're alone.
Don't worry about it.
In 15 minutes the bombs will go off,
and there'll be a lot of jostling at the gates of heaven!
Goodbye,
you little brat!
Mizuki?
That shot was different. We must be quick!
- Be brave! - Oh hisse!
You're here!
I was worried about you!
- Haibara! - Ai!
Mizuki, you...
Stop, Yamao, it's over.
Are you okay, Conan?
Yes.
What are you doing here?
I had a bad feeling...
so I came here in a hurry.
That gun...
I have a hunting license.
I'm a very good shot.
Yes, I saw that.
Watch out, Mizuki!
Give me that!
Toma?
- Hey! - What's wrong with you?
You...
It was you that night!
You had glasses on, but I recognize you!
You don't understand my dreams, Mizuki!
What's that?
Ouch...
What's wrong with you?
I see...
Actually, eight years ago, Toma...
saw you.
That's why you didn't enter the cave.
You told Kogoro that yesterday.
Me, it's the narrow places...
Mizuki!
What is he talking about? Explain yourself!
Conan!
You mentioned the cave, but...
What? It's not...
Yes, it is.
It was Mizuki who chased us earlier.
What was that?
Mizuki was afraid Toma would come to his senses
because he saw everything.
That's why she was working as a receptionist at the guesthouse
in front of her new house.
This allowed her to keep an eye on Toma.
Is it true what he says, Mizuki?
When Toma woke up,
she put in contact lenses
and did her hair differently.
She wanted to avoid him remembering by seeing her face.
You took advantage of Kogoro's advice.
I put in contact lenses.
But to no avail.
Toma was slowly recovering his memories,
so you wanted to silence him before he remembered everything.
You really are a terrible sister.

Pushing her little sister into a car like that...
I never meant to kill her!
Just that she stumbled
and hurt herself a little, that's all.
But right after she fell,
the car came out of nowhere!
They wouldn't let me stay here if it got out.
It scared the hell out of me...
and I pulled out my rifle without realizing it.
But I...
I just wanted to get Toma away from me.
I swear to God!
I didn't mean to kill him!
Yes, I know.
I know that
that you don't want to hurt anyone anymore, really.
Yes, I do!
If you could hit Yamao in the shoulder
and then shoot his rifle so accurately from that distance...
then how could you have missed us?
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry!
In the end, it's better this way, Mizuki.
Now you'll finally be able to
you can finally free yourself from those demons
that tormented you for 8 years.
And I will be able to see your beautiful face without glasses.
Muto...
I'll wait as long as it takes.
Until you come back.
Edogawa!
The light's flashing!
What's wrong?
Oh no, just now...
Yamao said it would take 15 minutes.
Damn it!
Everybody run! It's going to explode!
Don't dawdle! Hurry up!
- Hurry, Toma! - Yes!
- Ayumi ! - Don't stop, keep going !
Are you OK? Go, run !
This sucks!
If the explosion doesn't stop,
the dam is ruined!
That noise is not good.
It's the outer wall cracking.
I have to do something!
It's going to collapse at any moment!
If all the water is released at once,
the village won't survive!
Think about it...
There must be a way to save it !
A lift?
Is anyone hurt?
Are you all there?
Conan's not here!
There's a little boy missing.
What?
He disappeared after helping me!
Conan...
What's he doing?
What's wrong? Were there any more bombs?
Damn it!
Oh no, the dam is collapsing!
Everybody back up!
No, Conan is still out there!
We're not moving until he comes back!
Conan!
What are you trying to do, Kudo?
Yippee!
- Go, Conan! - Conan!
Where the hell is he going?
He's trying to stop the flood!
It's madness, a child can't do it!
If the wave catches him, it's over!
He will make it!
Conan will succeed!
Nothing is impossible for the Junior Detectives!
We're counting on you, Kudo!
There should be an unused ski lift in front of the village.
I might be able to use it!
What's the matter?
It's terrible!
The dam will...
It's dangerous, we have to run!
Damn it, I won't make it in time!
It's risky, but I'll have to go through the forest.
Right, right.
That was close.
That sucks... Hold on a little longer, please!
Hey!
What will happen to the village if all the water comes at once?
It will be a disaster.
That's not an answer!
The village will be
totally engulfed for sure!
Oh no...
I see it!
Conan!
But what is he going to do?
I know!
He's going to cause an avalanche to divert the water flow!
Conan!
No, this is not the time!
Conan!
Oh, no!
Damn it!
You've got to be kidding me!
I don't believe this, damn it!
No !
This sucks!
Oh, my God, he did it!
Run for it!
Come on, I'm almost there!
Watch out!
Ran.
No !
Conan!
Conan!
- Tell us where you are! - Conan!
I can hear the others calling me.
They didn't get caught in the avalanche, thank God.
I have to get out of here...
It looks bad.
I can't move.
I have to... do something...
Conan!
Conan! Conan!
Conan!
Come on, boy!
How many minutes has it been? Who's counting?
- Uh, it's been... - 11 minutes and 50 seconds.
He's been trapped for 12 minutes!
- What? - But then...
There's only three minutes left before the time limit!
Oh no!
Quick, everyone look for Edogawa!
You mean Conan...
is under this avalanche?
Please ring the bell!
It's ringing!
Don't make a sound!

Try to hear the kid's cell phone!
Where are you, Conan?
Where are you?
There!
Can you hear it?
Conan!
Where is he?
Conan!
He's in here!
That's his phone.
Please, Conan... Come out of there.
He's over here! Search the area!
Damn it!
- He's not here? - No...
No way...
Where are you, Conan? Tell me where you are.
Please show yourself!
Ran, your fingers are bloody!
But Conan... Why can't I find him?
Will we never see Conan again?
If we lose touch with each other..,
We may never see each other again.
No...
This is a joke, right?
Conan...
Don't die!
There's less than a minute left before time runs out!
Ran!
Don't give up!
What's wrong, Ran?
Shinichi...
Please...
If you're around here...
If you're near me, come help me!
Help me, Shinichi!
I heard Ran's voice.
I have to tell him where I am...
Ran!
That's...
A soccer ball!
Isn't that...
Conan.
Conan!
Conan.
We found him, he's here!
Conan! Hold on, Conan!
I beg you, Conan...
Open your eyes!
Conan!
Conan!
Ran...
It's you.
Thank god...
I was so scared, Conan!
Hurray!
It takes more than that to get you, right?
Everybody's got something...
that they refuse to give up
And to protect it
our instinct is to fight
I've been fooling myself
And for so many years
I don't want to lie, not lie
I want to feel alive
I want to try, try
To let my feelings flow
The time to change the future
Maybe it's time to change the future
What am I willing to sacrifice?
I'm not sure yet
How much knowledge and courage
Do I have in me?
These things I must tell you
I haven't forgotten them
I don't want to die, not die
I won't do anything too reckless
I want to try, try
To shout "Yes!" loud and clear
The time to open the door
Maybe it's time to open the door
It's not the world that's complicated
It's what's in my head
What we don't realize in time
That's what's hard to get
A moment of silence that passes
They won't help me find the right timing
I don't want to lie, not lie
I want to feel alive
I want to try, try
To walk side by side with you
The most crucial moment of my life
May well have arrived
That afternoon,
in the garden of Yamao's old house that had sunk,
a briefcase full of jewels was discovered.
Faced with a fait accompli, Yamao confessed everything
and the case was solved.
Mizuki confessed what had happened to his sister eight years earlier
and the police took him in for questioning.
Toma still hadn't recovered all his memories.
Nevertheless,
the day when everything would come back to him
and he could smile again for real
was probably not far off.
We sent your stuff to this address.
Thanks for everything, you've been great.
Despite everything that happened,
feel free to come back and see us!
- Yes! - We'll come back!
Yeah, we will!
Well, hurry up a bit!
Let's get busy, otherwise I'll leave you here!
Why is he in such a hurry?
I forgot to buy a souvenir for Makoto!
Me too, by the way!
Hey, come back! There's no time!
By the way...
...what should I get her?
We haven't picked up the gift for Mrs. Kobayashi yet!
So we're taking the bear cookies?
What are you talking about?
We'll take the swan mug, we said!
I liked the owls better.
Oh, but then...
Let's just buy everything and call it a day.
- The teacher's paying for it anyway. - Hey, oh!
I see.
They're the ones who wrote this.
Well, hurry up if you're buying things!
Come on!
If we don't leave right away, I'm gonna miss the show Yoko's in!
You've got fifteen minutes!
Fifteen minutes and I'm off!
Oh, no, you don't!
Quick, run!
Come on, 15 more minutes?
