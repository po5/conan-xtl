Hello? It's me. Can you come quickly?
Yes, to lab number four.
It's worth the trip, you'll see.
Yes.
Any smell?
I didn't smell anything.
I'm like a shark.
As soon as I smell blood, I rush to the scene of the crime,
and I use all my senses to find out who did it.
And once I have him, I never let go.
I clench it with my evidence like sharp teeth.
That's what being a detective is all about.
EPISODE "ONE" - THE REJUVENATED DETECTIVE
After a hundred years, the century ends
They told me to cry, but I laughed
After all this time, the century ends
I'm running into a new world
What I thought I was beginning to understand as a child
Still eludes me, even as an adult
I am neither remarkable nor deserving
What I understand are these palpitations
It's not an answer, not even the truth
But what I believe in are these palpitations
The beating of my heart, and nothing else
I don't think this is a good idea.
A crime took place at this aquarium,
not the best place for a date.
That's true.
Damn, it's starting to rain.
It is! It is! Should we run back?
Hey, I told you not to run!
But why?
I don't believe it! What was he doing in my hood?
I'm sorry...
I was thinking about where the culprit could have put his cell phone to film,
and I forgot that I had put yours there to see.
What do I do now? It was brand new, too!
Don't cry, I'll get you a new one as soon as I can.
You're exaggerating, Shinichi!
Nothing good ever happens to me with you.
Even in America, it was investigation after investigation.
Well, I have an idea.
Tropical Land, does that tell you? I'll take you there.
Tropical Land?
Sounds good, what is it ?
An amusement park, they opened one in Tokyo.
We won't have to worry about a criminal case there!
I'll come, if you pay for everything.
Let's say it's my gift to you if I win my karate tournament!
Deal?
Uh, wait...
Last year you came in second,
and the winner has since left the club, right?
Too late, you promised!
I don't get that much spending money!
And when you replace my phone,
buy me a strap-on from the aquarium, the one with the sea cucumber.
I will.
- And also... - What, it's not over?
Okay, let's say that's enough.
Too kind.
It's really raining hard!
The weatherman got it wrong.
I'll have what he's having.
Don't you check the contents?
If there's anything missing, you'll pay for it with your life.
I, on the other hand, prefer to count again.
As you wish.
Okay, that's the count.
Here you go.
And what's the next job?
I need to know at least the basics.
So one question:
Recently, there's been an undercover rat in the organization.
Did you know about this?
Uh, no.
I didn't know about it.
Oh, well.
So my next job is to find this rat?
No.
We already have an idea who it is.
Do we?
That's a good cocktail!
What's in it?
Rum.
Cointreau.
And a little lemon juice.
It's an "XYZ".
The ultimate cocktail.
Well, uh, let me know when you need me.
You sure, chief?
We just let him go without saying anything?
We know he's the rat.
Yes.
No problem.
The cocktail of the end.
That's me.
Got it, get the hell out of there.
Now, boss, what do we do
with this information about the arms smuggling?
Don't worry about it.
We're following the plan, just like we planned.
You had him set up with the money,
so our message should get through, right?
Yeah, but it could be a trap.
We can always judge it when we get to the guy.
Yeah, right.
Besides...
It's the kind of place that's a shame to lose.
Yes ?
Shinichi?
Oh, is that you, Ran?
- What are you doing here so early? - Are you kidding?

It is already eleven o'clock!
Is it? Are you serious?
You're pushing it...
I'm coming in, eh.
Well, well, well,
why are you bothering me on a Sunday?
I knew you'd forget.
Did we have plans?
Yes, we did!
Since I don't have karate practice for once,
you offered to go shopping for a new cell phone!
Sorry, it slipped my mind.
For a change.
I bet you stayed up late reading a mystery novel.
Right on.
Well, go get dressed!
I'll fix you something while you wait.
- I don't suppose you had breakfast. - Yeah, thanks.
On the other hand, don't forget the sea cucumber strap!
No, boss!
What about it?
Do you remember the car that exploded in Beika harbor
the night we were at the aquarium?
Yes.
What about it?
They still haven't solved the case.
Oh, yeah. That's not very reassuring.
Well, they'll solve it eventually.
The Japanese police are exemplary.
"And since they call on me, I'm even more exemplary!"
Is that it?
Well... yes.
How are the ankles?
Oh, I'm just kidding.
Well, let's get going?
Alright, let's go.
Here we go...
Mitsuhiko! Give me the pass!
Here, Ayumi !
Get ready, Genta !
Come on, throw !
Too easy.
You were almost there, Ayumi.
Come on, it's my turn!
Where the hell are you aiming, Genta?
Oops, sorry.
Please!
Can you catch the ball?
Too hard.
Do you play soccer?
I used to play, yes.
Here you go.
Thank you!
Bye-bye!
If we had a friend as good at soccer as him,
we'd improve quickly.
That's for sure.
If you hadn't quit soccer,
you might be in Samurai Blue now.
I'm only a sophomore in high school, it's too early.
Is it?
Anyway,
I was just doing it to build up my stamina to be a good detective.
Like Sherlock Holmes did fencing.
But he's a hero in a novel.
But he's known all over the world.
Well, I'll give you that.
He's fantastic!
He always keeps his cool,
is very cultured and intelligent,
has an unbeatable sense of observation and logic.
On top of everything else, he's a pro at playing the violin!
The great Sherlock Holmes created by the writer Conan Doyle
is just the best detective in the world!
Stop him!
He stole my bag!
Get out of my way!
Excuse me, excuse me!
Let us through.
Who are you, bitch?
Hina Wada, 2nd year at Haido high school.
That girl...
Come on, Ran, we have to help her.
I think she'll be okay.
she'll be okay.
Who do you think you are, huh?
You'll see!
Oh, you're going with the knife?
If that's how it is,
I won't hold back!
Karate?
You want more?
She looks tough, that girl.
She doesn't just look it, she's strong.
She really is.
It was a fateful meeting,
a rival on her way to becoming a karate expert.
Ran Mouri, sixteen years old:
A spring that will change her life.
Sonoko!
I'm kidding!
Where do you get off narrating?
It's not even spring!
Who cares, it's just to set the mood.
Besides, it's not our first meeting.
Oh really, do you know her?
Yes, we've met before.
So, Ran, are you coming to my place?
I mean, we were just about to...
Postpone your date, come on!
Wait, Sonoko!
Suzuki
I'm home!
Welcome home, Miss Sonoko.
Come on in.
Hello.
Welcome, Miss Mouri, Mr. Kudo.
I received the pastries I ordered from Hokkaido,
the Purufuwa cheese pies!
What? The ones you have to order three months in advance?
- That's right! You want them? - Sure!
Are you sure you want to gorge yourself right before your tournament?
Don't complain if you get fat.
I'll be fine,
plus Kazumi is coming to train with me tomorrow.
I'll do twice as many exercises at the worst.
I swear...
Your husband is so annoying.
- We're not married! - What's the matter, Sonoko?
Sorry, do we have guests?

Are you home, Sonoko?
You could at least knock, at last.
It's nothing.
She looks dynamic, that's good. Is this your daughter?
Yes, our youngest, Sonoko.
Nice to meet you.
You never cease to embarrass us.
You're the future heir of the Suzuki group, I remind you.
There's already my older sister for that.
You still have to prepare for it.
Oh, I forgot!
Behind my daughter are her friends, Ran Mouri and Shinichi Kudo.
Ran's father used to be in the police...
and now works as a private investigator.
We could use his help with your case.
Well...
What case?
Well, Mr. Sewa is holding a party this weekend,
and they came here to invite us,
but it falls on the same day as the Beika Museum's jewel show,
so we can't go.
The Black Star Jewel Exhibition that Uncle Jirokichi was talking about?
Yes.
But the most worrisome thing here
Mr. Sewa received a threat demanding that he cancel his party.
The message said that someone would lose their life during the party.
I see...
In that case, you can hand the case over to Shinichi Kudo!
Behave yourself:
Shinichi is a high school detective who's already solved many cases!
No offense, Ran,
but I think he's more reliable than your father.
If you give me the case, I should be able to help you.
Well, that's promising!
That said, I've already had the security upgraded,
I don't think I need a detective's help.
On that note, it's time for us to leave.
- Hey. - Coming through.
- Hey, watch it! - Hey, baby!
What the hell are you doing, klutz?
Be careful!
Well, uh...
You've been very helpful.
Thank you, miss.
No problem.
Well done, Ran!
Thank you so much. You're not hurt?
No, I'm fine.
I'm very resilient. I inherited that from my father.
Did I offend you? No, I'm sorry.
I take it back, the Mouri family is great!
Oh, Sonoko...
Kudo?
Anything wrong?
No, nothing at all.
It's great!
Our Suzuki Group manufacturers designed it using
extremely light materials.
We also tightened up the sleeves a bit
to make it easier to move.
I may not look it, but I love martial arts!
But... are you sure?
Yes, don't worry!
Actually, I helped a little bit with the design, too.
You did?
Yes, I did! You can call me Sonoko the great designer!
As long as you wear that kimono...
Shinichi LOVE
you'll be unbeatable, thanks to the power of love!
Well, actually...
What?
She can't wear it in the tournament.
What? She can't?
Yes.
There's a strict dress code.
Sorry, Sonoko. I'll wear it to practice.
There's nothing we can do about it.
In return, you better win the tournament!
Sorry, ma'am.
You don't have to apologize.
We won't be able to come and cheer you on, but do your best.
Of course I will!
With all this, we couldn't buy your cell phone.
That's true.
Ah, I have to go shopping for tonight.
Okay, I'll do it. We'll do it again, for the phone.
I'll see you later.
Don't dawdle on the way.
I forgot my wallet at your place.
You're not possible...
Shinichi?
Shinichi,
I found it, I'm going there.
Okay, I'll go.
You always have so many books.
And they're all detective stories!
After reading so many,
it's normal that your father became a great writer.
You, on the other hand, just got hooked.
Oh, shut up.
Besides, your mother is the famous actress Yukiko Fujimine.
I envy you.
It's not that good.
I bet your first love
was your mother.
It wasn't!
Who was it, then?
My first love was...
I'm listening.
My first love...
Stop it, Professor Agasa!
How's your homework coming?
I was afraid you'd start falling asleep at this hour.
I helped you wake up, didn't I?
- Ouch, ouch... - Don't move, teacher.

Sorry.
So, what was the experience this time?
I knew it would pique your curiosity!
Not really, no.
Well, if you insist, I'll show you.
Tadam!
It's a transport rocket.
Nothing to brag about.
When it's finished, there'll be no more traffic jams,
and I'll be rich!
Double rich, since I'll have put an end to road accidents.
But isn't it dangerous?
It's practically a missile, your thing.
Don't talk nonsense!
All my inventions are perfectly safe.
There, it was just an accident.
- Shinichi! - Ah, Professor!
It's not looking good.
Mouri Detective Agency
What's wrong?
Oh, you're breaking my balls, leave me alone!
I don't want to go with you either.
But that's what Ran wants.
It's normal for a father to want to encourage his daughter.
But I'm telling you..,
You have more important things to think about right now.
I bet you still don't have any customers this month.
What do I care?
I found three animals this month, for one thing!
Animals?
Are you kidding me?
A detective's got to have better aim than finding lost dogs!
They weren't dogs, they were cats!
What do you take me for?
And then the other day...
- That's me! - I caught an actress with her producer!
What? But yes, that counts!
It's a real deal!
- I'll call you when we eat. - What, a counselor?
I don't want one! These things are a scam!
But why did this manager
choose such a crowded place to conclude our exchange?
He probably figures that we won't be able to cause a commotion there.
He could also use the opportunity to hide
an accomplice of his among the crowd.
Is this a trap, then?
Bourbon did say that this director was hanging out with the Deisankai.
Bourbon, huh?
He always has such a good nose.
Despite everything,
as long as we know what to expect, we'll be all right.
We'll kill him before he kills us, that's all.
Inter-high school karate tournament
Yame!
- She won! - Good.
Blue, jodan geri, ippon.
Blue victory.
She's too strong, Ran! She's the best!
She's in the finals, sir!
It's a piece of cake for her.
After all, she takes after me, so it's only fair!
I hope she hasn't inherited your tendency to get carried away.
Anyway, she's my daughter, so I think she'll be fine.
What the hell!
Ran! Cheer up for the final!
What the hell is he doing at such an important time?
Yes, fine.
Okay, fine.
I'll be right there, Inspector.
The women's kumite final is about to start.
In red is Hina Wada from Haido high school.
Hai!
In blue, Ran Mouri from Teitan high school.
Hai!
Hajime!
Come on, let's go!
- Be strong! - Stay calm!
Yes, that's good, keep it up!
Keep calm, Ran.
Yame!
Red, chudan geri, waza ari!
Tsuzukete hajime!
Yame!
What are you doing, Ran?
Ran, be strong! Believe in yourself!
Put some guts into it, super guts!
Super guts!
- Take it easy! - You can do it!
Shinichi!
What's that?
A... a... business?
A case?
There's always, always,
always only for his business !
Poor obsessed investigator!
I'll ask you to stop.
I don't have time and your investigation is going nowhere.
Come on, don't get carried away.
There is no doubt
that the culprit of this case is in this room!
So hurry up and find him and...
I already did.
I know who the culprit is.
Here you are, Kudo! We've been waiting for you.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Who is this man?
He looks very young to me.
We met at the Suzuki's, did you forget?
At the Suzuki's?
Behave yourself:
Shinichi is a high school detective who has already solved many cases!
The high school detective?
Mr. Yamazaki, the manager of the Beika bank,
was murdered in the guest room on the second floor
while the party was in full swing.
He was stabbed with a knife.
The door was locked,

said key was in Mr. Yamazaki's pocket.
The only way out was through the window of the veranda with the railing which was open.
So the culprit entered through the window
to kill him while he was resting,
and then went out through the same window.
But there is no way to climb up to the window.
And the neighboring rooms were all locked.
Indeed, there is no way to climb to the window below
and he couldn't get in through the adjoining rooms.
So how did he get in?
Through the air.
But that's insane!
What the hell...
What are you saying, Kudo?
Of course he didn't enter by flying.
But on the wall opposite there is another small window.
The culprit jumped from this window to the guest room.
This is nonsense!
There are at least five meters between these two windows!
No one could...
At the edge of the roof overlooking the small window
is a tiny ledge.
By leaning on it to go along the wall,
he was able to get within two meters.
This proves that the perpetrator is familiar with the architecture of the house.
And it's someone who was able to leave the party without arousing suspicion.
But speak up!
Who is Mr. Yamazaki's killer?
The killer...
is you!
The victim's friend and the master of this house...
Takanori Sewa!
Well, that's not true at all!
How could I with my leg?
No need to lie, I know everything!
Who do you think you are, you little punk?
- Sir... - Was it true ?
Dear... Your leg...
I was there at the Suzuki's, I saw everything!
When your wheelchair backed up,
you braked with your leg!
Your wound has long since healed, hasn't it?
Damn you!
Stop it!
I won't let you run away!
Goal!
You've been a great help again, Kudo.
Oh, it was nothing.
If you have any problems,
don't hesitate to call the great detective Shinichi Kudo!
Hey, did you hear?
The high school detective has struck again!
Yes, he's too good!
You can really say he's the savior of the Japanese police!
What's wrong with you?
You're pitiful, strutting around like that.
What, are you mad at me, Ran?
No, I'm not.
You think I'm going to be upset because my father...
...has less work because of you?
If your father doesn't have any customers, it's not my fault,
it's because he sucks.
I'm telling you, I'm not angry!
I'm surprised she won the tournament.
I don't know why everyone is bragging about you.
You're just a survey freak.
Look at all these fan letters.
Everyone loves him, the survey freak.
Good for you.
It's good to be popular with the girls,
but you're gonna have to make a choice eventually.
Just one fan?
Oh, dear...
What?
Is there something on my face?
No, nothing.
If you keep getting involved in all these affairs,
you'll end up in danger one day.
Maybe I will.
Why do you want to be a detective?
If you like detective stories so much,
you could become a writer like your father.
I don't want to write about detectives,
I want to be one.
I want to be the Sherlock Holmes of our time!
The more complicated the case, the more exciting it is!
When I foil the culprit's complex plan,
I feel the adrenaline rush!
Once you feel that, you can't get enough of it!
I love being a detective so much!
- See you later! - Wait, Shinichi!
You didn't forget our appointment tomorrow?
What appointment?
You promised to take me to Tropical Land if I won!
Didn't I? No, I don't feel like it.
Forget it, I didn't want to go with you anyway.
Why don't you go have fun with all your fans!
Come on, it was just a joke, don't get mad!
I didn't forget.
See you at ten o'clock in front of Tropical Land.
I won't forget this.
I hope you also remember that you're paying.
Oh boy, that's right!

Uh, can we talk about this? Ran!
What's this?
Just because we were going back to Japan, we have to leave without seeing our son?
And I dressed up to surprise our little Shin.
All for nothing...
We just came to recover some documents here.
Let us keep the disguises for the next occasion.
And then,
it would be necessary not to disturb them.
But I want to tease him!
Tropical Land
Here, you must be thirsty.
Thank you for that.
Come this way!
Where are you taking me, Shinichi?
You'll see!
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one,
zero!
Wow, great!
That's great!
You like this stuff, right?
Yes !
Why, when I'm so happy
Looking at the horizon makes me so sad?
I feel like I'm seeing in the distance
The one I used to be
I spin the wheel of fate
But what I think about is a mystery
Look, the person you're meant to be is there
She's still got her eyes on you
I spin the wheel of fate
I'm going with the wings of bravery
Luck can smile on us anytime
I've still got my eyes on you
I've still got my eyes on you
You know what I love so much about Sherlock Holmes?
When he first met Watson,
he knew just by shaking his hand that he had been a doctor in Afghanistan!
Just like that!
You're in a gymnastics club, aren't you?
How did you know that?
What, is he a friend of yours?
No...
I saw it on your hand.
For a girl to have so many blisters on her hand,
it's probably because of the gym bars.
She could have gotten them playing tennis.
Well, the truth is,
the wind blew up her skirt earlier, and I saw on her thigh...
the kind of bruise characteristic of those who train with
bars.
A good detective must know how to keep his eyes open
in all circumstances.
It's nothing to brag about!
It's cheating if you knew that before you shook his hand.
Hey, you!
Are you done bothering my friends?
Are you with them?
Uh, yes.
Do you want us to switch places?
No, we don't have to.
We don't want to disturb the lovebirds.
Ran.
The truth is, you know..,
I've always...
Me too, Shinichi.
Shinichi?
Shinichi!
Come on, hurry up!
I arrive!
So, did you like it?
Watch your step on the way down.
- It was scary! - Shall we go around again?
And then there, Holmes...
Two more people!
You know what I mean?
I think what Conan Doyle meant was that Holmes...
I've had enough of Conan Doyle and Holmes!
Obsessed with investigations!
I was looking forward
to come here with you.
Why can't you understand how I feel?
Ran...
Well, to tell you the truth,
I also...
You're so stupid!
Why are you freaking out? I was just messing with you!
Silly girl.
Did you take me seriously?
You won't make a good detective if you get fooled that easily.
Everybody ready? Let's get started!
Have fun!
But hey, you know,
I was really looking forward to coming.
Fall back
What, we don't do anything?
Come on, get over here.
We have orders to leave.
What, you wanted a ride?
Some water?
It's salty.
What the hell is that?
What's what?
Did you like it?
Watch your step...
- An accident! - Call an ambulance!
Get the police!
Why him?
Shinichi...
He was unlucky.
Well, it was an accident.
We can go now.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
It wasn't an accident.
This was a murder.
And the killer was in the same vehicle as him.
He's one of us!
Shinichi!
What a joke...
Please, please!
Excuse me, coming through!
Excuse us.
It's over here.
But that's Kudo!
And Ran is with you!
Hello, lnspector Megure.
Kudo?
He's the famous high school detective, Shinichi Kudo!
He's already solved a bunch of cases!
He's the savior of the Japanese police!
Hey, come quickly, it's Kudo!
Let's see him solve the case!

- You flatter me. - Pfft.
I see...
Indeed, nothing seems to indicate
that the attraction has malfunctioned.
And given the circumstances,
we can rule out suicide.
Exactly.
That's why, for me, it's clearly a murder.
But who could have killed him, and how?
Detective.
The passengers on the ride are asked to stay here,
but everyone else can leave.
Step back, please.
The vehicle has eight seats.
By taking you and Ran out..,
that leaves five suspects.
In the front row, A and B, friends of the victim.
Next to the victim in seat C, his girlfriend.
Finally, behind the victim at D and E, two men dressed in black.
But you were all tied to your seats,
which prevented you from moving.
The only one who could have killed him
was the girl next to him.
Mind you, the man behind him could have...
Can you hurry up?
We don't have time for you to play detective.
Chief...
I'm sorry, we'll try to make this quick.
Who's that?
His eyes are terribly cold!
They are the eyes of someone who can take a life without blinking.
Who could he be?
Inspector!
What is it, Chiba?
I found this in that young woman's bag.
It's not mine, I don't know where it came from!
Aiko, how could you do such a thing?
No, it wasn't me!
I thought you liked Kishida,
so why?
You have to believe me, I'm innocent!
Well, it's settled, that chick did it.
Can we go now, officer?
They found the culprit quickly after all.
- I had a bad feeling about this girl. - Was it a lover's quarrel?
- Women are scary... - Good!
We'll take her to the station as a suspect.
Follow me.
No, I...
And just in case,
I'll check the identity of the other passengers in the car.
You don't mind?
Wait, inspector.
What is it, Kudo?
This woman is innocent.
Shinichi?
What are you saying?
The person who killed
Mr. Kishida on that roller coaster...
is you!
What are you saying?
What the hell!
You saw the knife we found in his bag!
You can't decapitate a person with a knife.
Even less with the strength of a woman.
And if she had done it,
she had plenty of opportunity to throw away the murder weapon.
What's the point of storing it with a cloth in her bag?
I think it was you who put it in her bag
to make it look like she was guilty.
Don't be ridiculous!
I was sitting two rows in front of Kishida!
How could I have cut off her head from my seat?
Besides, you said it yourself:
a woman's strength would not have been enough!
Indeed, in terms of brute strength, it would be impossible.
But at the rate we were going,
it was perfectly feasible using piano wire!
Inspector Megure.
I would like to recreate the murder with the help of the officers here.
I don't see why not.
All right, listen carefully.
I will play Hitomi, that is to say, the culprit.
Inspector Megure will play Mr. Kishida, the victim.
First of all, before I lower my security bar,
I wedge a bag or something behind me before I sit down,
then I lower the bar.
Then before my crime, I just remove the bag behind,
and that frees up enough space for me to get out.
Then I take out a piano wire or a wire that I have tied
and attached it to a kind of grappling hook.
I lean on the safety bar to move backwards
and put it around his neck.
Of course, I do this in a dark tunnel.
Finally, I attach the grappling hook at the end of the wire
to the rails of the roller coaster.
All I have to do is wait for the victim's head to be
to be cut off by the speed and progress of the roller coaster.
It's crazy!
Moving on the moving attraction...
Oh but,
you're a gymnast.
Another girl, I don't say.

But a gymnast with a good sense of balance
could have done it, even on the attraction.
Enough, stop with the...
What did you do with the necklace?
The one you were wearing
before you got on the ride!
What happened to your pearl necklace?
You changed the string on your necklace to piano wire
and hid the grappling hook in your bag.
Wait a minute!
The method you're talking about here,
the two guys behind Kishida
could have used it too!
No.
They may look suspicious, but they didn't do anything.
And why not?
I don't know what they were doing on that roller coaster,
but I think it's weird
that they changed their attitude and wanted to get away as soon as the police arrived.
If they were the killers,
they should have known this was going to happen.
The real culprit knew
that the victim was going to die.
That's why she cried.
Water?
We discovered the murder just seconds
before we reached the end of the ride.
The only person who had reason to cry during the ride
was the murderer.
So what,
you saw Hitomi crying on board, maybe?
Can you prove it?
Look at the tear tracks on her face.
Unless you're on a roller coaster,
the tears
don't flow to the side.
It's all...
It's all his fault!
He shouldn't have dumped me!
Hitomi...
Is it true you were dating Kishida?
Yes !
We've been in love since before
we met in college!
And yet, Aiko...
that slut!
So that's why
that's why
I chose the attraction of our first date,
the necklace he gave me,
and Aiko as the scapegoat...
to kill him!
Shortly afterwards,
we found a large quantity of sleeping pills in her purse.
She was apparently planning
to join Kishida in death by committing suicide after that.
Two hours later, in the tunnel
the necklace used for the crime was found.
The wire had been replaced by piano wire
and only a few pearls had remained attached,
shining in the dim light.
They really did look like big tear drops.
Come on, stop crying...
How can you stay still after all that?
Well, you know, I'm used to crime scenes.
Dismembered bodies and all...
You're horrible!
Uh, sorry.
Best not to think about it anymore.
These things happen all the time.
Absolutely not!
That man...
He's one of the shady guys who was on board.
You said we wouldn't run into a case here...
Sorry, Ran, can you go ahead?
I'll catch up with you!
Shinichi!
Don't go.
Shinichi?
I don't know why I suddenly had the feeling...
that I won't see Shinichi for a long time.
And it terrified me.
Damn it,
I lost sight of him.
I kept you waiting,
Mr. Director?
That's him!
I came alone, as promised.
Yes, we could see that.
We watched you from the top of the roller coaster.
Hurry up!
Don't be in such a hurry.
Get the money out first.
Here, is this okay?
Holy cow, there's at least a hundred million!
Well, the exchange is concluded.
Quick, give me the film!
The film?
That's it.
The photos and negatives that prove your company is dealing in weapons.
Stay out of trouble in the future.
Shut up, you!
That's nothing compared to what your organization does!
Hey!
What do you know about us, huh?
Uh, nothing!
You don't seem to understand that here,
we are kindly agreeing to spare you in exchange for your money!
If you get it, close your company and get the hell out!
All we want to do
is to build a new lab on this land.
I get it...
This is serious business!
No more playing detective!
Hey, Chief!
You idiot,
you were followed by a kid.
It's the detective from earlier!
Shall I shoot him?
No.
With today's incident, there are still cops around.

What do we do then?
We'll use this.
This is the latest drug developed by our organization.
It's completely undetectable,
it will be the perfect crime.
We've never tested it on anyone before, but okay.
Chief, let's get a move on.
Yes.
So long, detective.
Oh, man,
my body's on fire!
My bones...
I feel like they're melting!
No way...
I think this is the end...
Hey, come and help me!
- There is a dead body! - What's wrong?
So I'm really dead, huh?
No, he's still breathing!
Quick, call an ambulance!
Am I alive?
I know, their poison must not work on humans!
I'm so lucky!
Poor guy, his head is bleeding...
Police officers?
There are plenty of them... Perfect.
I'll tell them everything I heard!
Hey, hang on.
You can get up,
little guy?
You okay, little guy?
Little guy?
What are they singing to me?
I'm in high school.
How did you get that head injury?
An injury?
Oh, yeah.
I remember that,
one of the guys in black hit me from behind.
Ouch!
Something's wrong with my clothes!
You must have been scared, huh?
But you don't have to worry anymore, we're here to help you.
How can he lift me so easily, this guy?
Report: we found a boy
with a head injury near the Ferris wheel.
We're taking him to the infirmary.
He's a six or seven year old,
probably an elementary school student.
An elementary school student? Is he talking about me?
That's me.
Ah, Ran, you're back?
What's all the fuss about, Dad?
That's why you don't have any customers
and Mom's run away!
Shut up!
I'm selective with my work.
By the way, where's the kid who thinks he's a detective?
Weren't you two together?
I'll catch you up!
I wonder where he went.
Did you have a fight?
Leave him alone!
Only losers want to be detectives.
You're one, I'll call you back.
Why don't you believe me?
I've seen it all!
There was this arms dealer,
and a guy who was blackmailing him!
But his accomplice saw me,
and he hit me in the back of the head!
Well, kid,
you watch too much TV.
Stop calling me kid!
I'm a sophomore in high school!
This is weird.
Something's not right.
We just checked,
and no one reported a lost child.
These people's reaction,
my clothes being too loose,
and my...
my own voice...
No, it's still not possible.
No.
As impossible as it sounds,
there's only one truth.
What? I don't believe it!
I don't believe it!
So I really did shrink?
I think he's making it up
so he doesn't have to go home.
So you think he ran away?
Let's call the chief first,
then we'll drop him off at the day care center at the station.
Day care?
Come on, kid...
He's gone!
He must have escaped through the window!
Me, in a day care center? Don't fuck around!
Hey, kid!
It's huge!
It's over here!
Holy crap!
Come back here, boy!
Seriously, I'm not an escaped criminal!
Kid!
Mouri Detective Agency Calling
Ran?
But yes, I can get Ran to come and get me!
But...
With my childish voice and body...
Damn it!
But I can write her a message!
No, how can I explain it to her?
If you keep getting involved in all these affairs,
you'll end up in danger one day.
Go look over there!
Damn it, it's not possible.
I'm fed up!
Hello, this is Kudo.
I can't answer right now.
Leave me a message after the beep.
He's not home.
He probably went out to eat
with his father, the rich writer.
What are you talking about?
His parents moved to the States three years ago
and he lives alone, you know that.
Do I?
Maybe something happened to him.
I'm going over to his place right away!
Wait, what about my dinner?

I didn't run long though,
but I'm already out of breath.
What is this body?
What happened to me?
Just a minute.
If I remember correctly, after they hit me...
This is the latest drug developed by our organization.
We've never tested it on anyone before, but okay.
No, it would be the fault of this pill?
It can't be...
You idiot, don't hang out in the middle of the road!
Be careful, you little brat!
A brat?
That sucks...
For God's sake..,
I can't even go home!
Kudo
So I can't do anything by myself?
Oh no, disaster!
Professor Agasa!
Who are you?
It's me, it's Shinichi !
Oh, you're Shinichi's relative ?
It's true that you look like him when he was little.
But no, I'm Shinichi!
Look carefully! Shinichi Kudo, a student at Teitan High School!
Hey, Shinichi!
You have a guest.
You don't believe me, do you?
Hey, is everything okay?
In that case, I'll talk about you!
Hiroshi Agasa, 52 years old.
You're the weird inventor who lives next door to me.
You say you're a genius, but your inventions are worthless.
And you have a mole on your butt!
My mole!
Shinichi was supposed to be the only one who knew about it.
Incredible, this Shinichi!
He revealed my big secret!
I didn't tell anyone, because I'm Shinichi!
They made me take a strange pill that made me younger!
A pill that makes you younger?
Yes.
A pill?
I'd like to see that!
You're not clean, come with me. I'll take you to the police!
How about that?
You just came back from the Columbo restaurant, huh?
And you were in a big hurry.
How do you know that?
By your clothes.
The front is soaked with rain,
but not the back!
That's proof that you've been running in the rain.
Plus, your pants are full of mud.
What?
The only muddy road around here
is the one that leads to the Columbo.
And the last thing is the restaurant's special sauce
still on your mustache.
But then, you're...
Elementary, my dear Agasa.
I can't believe...
are you really Shinichi?
I'm killing myself to tell you! I got younger because of a pill!
I still can't believe it.
Such a thing is scientifically impossible.
But you know about my butt...
Well, can you open my door for me?
What?
An arms dealer, you say?
Yes.
They were blackmailing him, and I saw the whole thing.
So they drugged you to silence you?
I see!
So this drug, which was not yet perfected
had the unexpected effect of making you smaller.
That's it.
Professor, you're a genius, aren't you?
Invent a drug to bring me back to normal.
Don't ask the impossible.
Without knowing the ingredients of this drug...
So lame...
I fit perfectly in my kid's clothes.
So all I have to do is find them
and get my hands on this drug?
Yes, if I can study it, maybe I can help you.
But Shinichi, don't tell anyone else that it was you!
Why not? You're still alive!
You are still alive!
If those men know it's you in there,
they'll try to kill you again!
The people around you would be in danger too.
Do you understand? The fact that you are Shinichi Kudo
must remain between us!
No one else can know about it.
And that goes for Ran too.
Yes, I understand.
Shinichi, are you there?
You could've called me to say you were home!
And remember to lock your door.
Oh no, it's Ran!
Quick, hide!
I'll hide, but where?
Professor Agasa?
Oh Ran, it's been a long time!
Where's Shinichi?
Well, he was here a minute ago...
but, uh...
- He had to leave on a case. - My father's glasses, perfect.
Where did that kid come from?
Uh, that boy, he's...
You're a shy one, huh? Come on, now,
let me look at you.
This sucks...
But, that boy...
Oops.
How cute he is!
His chest...

Professor, who is this kid?
Uh, well, he's a child in my family.
Say, how old are you?
Sixteen... uh, no.
Six!
So you're in the first grade?
Yes.
What's your name?
Uh, I'm Shin...
No, not that.
I'm...
My name is...
Conan Doyle Edogawa Ranpo
Conan!
My name is Conan Edogawa.
Oh no, but what have I been making up?
Conan? That's a strange name.
My dad is a Conan Doyle fan, so there you go...
It's weird, he looks like...
Shinichi.
So Conan, "Conan" you feel?
Professor?
Conan, seriously? You're supposed to be Japanese!
I can't help it, nothing else came to mind!
You're just in time, Ran.
Could you keep it at home for a while?
You're kidding...
His parents are in the hospital after an accident.
I've been asked to take care of him,
But a man who lives alone like me...
I don't mind, but I have to ask my father.
Oh, you agree? Fantastic!
What's the plan? What if she finds out who I am?
Come on, listen to me!
The men in black will eventually learn
that your body wasn't found.
If you stay here, you'll be suspected right away.
I can live with you then!
If you want your appearance back,
you must first find those who made you like this.
Yeah, so what?
Ran lives in a detective agency.
Yes, he does.
Maybe I can find out something about them.
That's right.
Is everything okay, Professor?
Yes, everything's fine. I want to come to your house, lady!
He's so cute!
Can you tell Shinichi to call me when he gets home?
Yes, I will.
Bye, Grandpa! Bye-bye!
See you, uh... Conan.
The rest is up to you, Shinichi.
No...
Conan Edogawa.
Tell me, Conan...
Conan?
Yes, Ran?
I can't get used to that name.
Do you have a lover?
Don't you like any girls at school?
No, no one.
I have a lover.
I like him a lot.
You do?
Wouldn't that be the famous Shinichi, the one you were looking for?
Yes, it's him.
He has always bothered me,
and he's obsessed with investigations and has a big head...
But he's there when you need him,
he's brave, and very cool.
I love Shinichi to bits!
However,
don't tell him again!
It's a secret for both of us.
So I repeat it, but don't tell Shinichi!
I won't.
This is where I live.
I feel like I have an adorable little brother.
I could tell you anything.
Ran...
Looks like Dad's here, I'll introduce you to him.
You coming?
Listen, Ran...
Actually, I...
Yes ?
Actually, I'm...
Victory!
What's wrong with you, Dad?
It's finally happened!
I got a job! My first job in months!
Be careful! What kind of job?
A girl from a good family was kidnapped...
by men dressed in black!
Men in black?
Conan?
Wait a minute, men in black!
I will find your stash,
retrieve those drugs,
and once I am myself again...
I will reveal all your misdeeds to the world!
So, to find out who these men in black are..,
I'm now living with Ran and his detective father.
Except that the old detective is a real lump.
I can't let this go, so I pretend to be him
and use my talent and the professor's inventions
to solve all the cases.
So Dr. Narumi had a death wish?
- Narumi ! - Don't go, Conan!
Let go of me, Ran!
Where's that music coming from?
It's code.
Narumi is playing...
...inside the flames.
Idiot.
When it comes to deduction
there is no winner or loser.
Because there is always
one and only one truth!
Tell me, Hattori, have you...
ever kill anyone?
Idiot.
A detective who corners a guilty man
and drives him to commit suicide...
is no better than a murderer.
Hattori.

"When you have eliminated the impossible,
what remains, however improbable,
is necessarily the truth."
Yet I told you.
That was your last chance.
Masami!
Ran, call 911!
- And uncle and the police! - Got it.
It's no use.
It's already too late.
Don't talk, your wound will...
My boy...
You're the kid from the detective agency, right?
The organization?
Yes.
A huge organization shrouded in mystery.
I was at the bottom of the ladder, so I just know
that the color of the organization is black.
Black?
That's right.
The members of the organization wear
black clothes, like the feathers of a crow.
But then...
these are the men in black?
I count on you,
my little detective.
It has many titles.
"The Modern Day Lupin", "The Moonlight Wizard", etc.
But he is best known by the nickname that was given to him.
What nickname?
Because he plays with the world's police like a child,
and he had the code name "Kaito 1412", a young writer
reused this number to give him this name:
"K. I. D."
"K. I. D." ?
But then, that's...
That's right.
Kaito 1412,
known as...
Kaito Kid!
You're not a normal kid, are you?
I'm Conan Edogawa, detective.
Yes, that's right.
Now I'm going to the film set.
Once I'm done there, I'll be free to join you.
I just have to make sure Pisco doesn't screw up, right?
I was just going there anyway.
Besides, I want to see him.
Well, I'm hanging up now.
I wouldn't want to keep the FBI kittens waiting.
I'll see you there, Gin.
Shit!
Move it, out of my way!
Move it!
Let it go.
But, Shu...
The way she drives,
you won't catch her.
But don't worry, I know where she's going.
Where to?
To Japan.
Two months later
Shinichi, where are you? Call me, okay? It is an order!
Childhood clothes of my little Shin
Conan Edogawa?
Yes, you know, the little boy with glasses!
You told me you were looking for
a person who lives in Beika?
Yes, Shinichi Kudo.
Yes, that kid lives in a detective agency nearby.
So, why are you telling me about him ?
This child, he is special.
He is strangely calm for a child,
he's quite grown up.
It all makes sense.

After a hundred years, the century ends
I was told to cry, but I laughed
After all this time, the century ends
I'm running into a new world
What I thought I was beginning to understand as a child
Still eludes me, even as an adult
I am neither remarkable nor deserving
What I understand are these palpitations
It's not an answer, not even the truth
But what I believe in are these palpitations
The beating of my heart, and nothing else
I don't know if it's cool or not
But I've got a dream that's impossible to suppress
And rather than wait and make a plan
I'd rather go for it like a kid
Even if I set up a flag at the end of the universe
I still wouldn't understand its mysteries
I am neither remarkable nor deserving
What I do understand are these palpitations
It's not an answer, not even the truth
But what I do believe in are these palpitations
I am neither remarkable nor deserving
What I understand are these palpitations
It's not an answer, nor even the truth
But what I do believe in are these palpitations
The beating of my heart, and nothing else
