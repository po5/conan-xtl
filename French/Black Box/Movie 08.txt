Where the hell is he?
There he is!
It's time to put an end to this little game, Mr. Thief.
You're right, it is.
It is getting a little late
to be playing hide-and-seek with you,
little detective.
DETECTIVE CONAN THE SILVER WINGED MAGICIAN
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug, and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name, I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
In order to find out who these thugs are, I arranged to live with Ran,
Mouri Detective Agency
whose father is a detective.
You're the culprit!
This is Kogoro Mouri.
He's Ran's father,
a very popular and famous detective.
People call him "Sleeping Kogoro".
The reason for this nickname?
You only have to look at it to understand.
Professor Agasa made these two gadgets.
The hypodermic projectile watch
The voice modulator bow tie
He developed many other inventions adapted to my new appearance.
Balloon belt
Especially this balloon belt.
It's a great gadget that gives me a balloon at the touch of a button.
Other people besides Professor Agasa know my true identity.
There is my father and my mother,
Heiji Hattori, a high school detective from Kansai.
And then there's a girl from my elementary school,
Ai Haibara.
She and her sister Akemi Miyano were part of the
of the Men in Black organization.
But, Akemi was murdered by the Men in Black organization.
Ai rebelled against this act.
And to escape from this dangerous group,
she took a drug,
the same one that I was made to swallow
and she became younger.
And finally, there is Kaito Kid.
We have some scores to settle.
On my honor as a detective,
I swear I'll get him next time!
My body is younger, but not my mind!
I'll solve all the mysteries!
There is still only one truth!
10 hours earlier
Mouri Detective Agency
I see.
Is this the warning that Kid left for you?
Indeed, I found it this morning on my porch
with a huge bouquet of roses.
Juri Maki (37) Actress
Always playing it cool, this one.
Romeo, Juliet...
Victor, Bravo !
When the 26 letters move,
I'll take the Jewel of Destiny.
Masayo Yaguchi (32 years old) Manager
Kaito Kid.
There is also a card torn in two.
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.
So, what do you think, Mr. Mouri?
Oh, well... Let's see, uh...
tell me..,
what is this Jewel of Destiny?
It is this.
It's beautiful!
Is it a star sapphire?
It is indeed.
Look at it,
the three intersecting lines above,
symbolize trust, hope and luck.
It's called the Jewel of Destiny.
I see.
It's very beautiful,
but...
I'll wear it on the stage in honor of Josephine
who was a lover of blue sapphires.
On stage?
I know!
You're going to perform in the play Josephine
at the recently opened Sora Theater in Shiodome!
Josephine?
She was Napoleon's first wife.
She also collected roses, right?
I see, so that's why the bouquet.
Exactly. You know a lot, kid!
He knows a lot about a lot of unimportant things.
Romeo, Juliet...
Victor, Bravo...
Romeo, Juliet...
Tell me, Juri?
Yes ?
Has Romeo and Juliet ever been performed
in the theater where you are currently playing?
Yes, it was.
I did not play there, but it was the inaugural play of the Sora Theatre.
Why did you do it?
I understood everything.
Did you?

The warning left by Kid, gives us the questions 3W and 1H.
In other words,
it tells us who, when, where and how it will happen.
Oh, I see!
Are you sure about this?
First of all, who?
Not surprisingly, it's obviously Kid.
Secondly, where?
On the stage of the Sora theater where Romeo and Juliet was played.
And then, when?
According to the word Bravo on the note, it will be during the applause of the public.
And finally, how?
Victor means victor...
It means Napoleon under whose features the Kid will be disguised.
And for the cards on the warning,
they are cut to form the V of victory.
So Kaito Kid intends to steal the jewel
at the very moment you are applauded
for the Josephine play in which you play the eponymous role.
He will appear to steal this ring, disguised as Napoleon.
Bravo!
Bravo, Mr. Mouri! You are worthy of your reputation!
Let's not exaggerate.
Say, Uncle?
What is the meaning of the sentence: "When the 26 letters move"?
Let's count the number of letters in the words written in English!
The words Romeo, Juliet, Victor and Bravo,
put together, make a total of 26 letters!
Ah, I see.
By the way Juri,
until when will Josephine be played?
The last one is today.
In that case, Kid will act...
Is that so?
What the hell?
Well, this is strange.
Look, there are only 22 characters.
That can't be right.
No, I counted those too.
Even counting the punctuation, there are 3 letters missing.
It must be Kid who made a mistake in his calculations.
But yes, of course.
Anyway,
there's no doubt that Kid will try to steal the jewel tonight.
I understand that, yes.
I would have one request, though...
The police will of course be present,
but I would like you to come to the theater
and protect this jewel from being stolen by Kid tonight.
I will. I, Kogoro Mouri
have never yet refused the request of a beautiful woman.
Thank you very much!
Take them out, Masayo.
Uh, yes!
These are tickets to the play tonight.
You can come with them.
Thank you very much.
When will the 26 letters move?
The 26 letters refer to the alphabet normally.
And then these cards...
Don't make me think of the V for victory.
Shiodome observation tower
Sora Theater
A few moments of patience before the play. Sera.
It's super exciting!
It's true.
I was actually looking forward to seeing this play.
Hey, Conan?
What's that bag for, it looks bulky?
Nothing very important.
What do you mean by that?
Don't tell me you brought
a whole supply of food for yourself?
I'm not like you.
Hey, kids!
I invited you here so be quiet.
-Yes! -Yes!
I'm sorry you had
to invite me too.
That's okay.
Mr. Mouri?
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
Hello, Miss Yaguchi.
Juri Maki
It's Masayo. Mr. Mouri is with me.
Please come in.
Go ahead, come in.
Thank you.
Welcome, Mr. Mouri.
Thank you, Mr. Mouri.
I'm sorry to receive you like this.
Natsuki, let me introduce you to the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.
You know him too, right?
Natsuki Sakai (26 years old) Hairdresser - Make-up artist
I'm Natsuki Sakai.
Nice to meet you.
It's huge!
There are a lot of flowers!
It's great!
I'm sorry, I accepted your offer and I also brought some children.
I don't mind.
Are you a diver, Juri?
Yes, I am, although it's quite new.
Would you like to come with me?
I'd love to.
But you've never been diving in your life.
Do you have something to say, Ran?
No, nothing at all.
There's a lot of makeup here!
That's true.
That's called foundation, right?
Yes. Just this much, there's...
One, two, three, four...
Five different ones.
Five?
Hey!
Young ladies, you are still way too young

to be interested in this.
Take an interest in things at your age, okay?
Okay.
Yes ?
Ah, Masayo.
Bunjiro.
I was told that Mr. Mouri was here.
Ah, Mr Mouri!
Are you the famous one, Kogoro Mouri?
I'm Bunjiro Narusawa.
Bunjiro Narusawa (34 years old) Actor
I am one of your biggest fans.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Are you playing the role of Napoleon?
What's that? Oh, yes, I do.
Sorry to introduce myself like this.
Let me make the introductions.
This is
Tenko Tajima who plays Theresa Tallien, Josephine's best friend.
Tenko Tajima (36) Actress
Nice to meet you.
Isao Shinjô plays Louis Hippolyte Charles, her lover.
Isao Shinjô (28 years old) Actor
Nice to meet you.
And finally, here is the director of the play
who also plays the role of Paul Barras.
Tôru Ban (45 years old) Director and actor
Tôru Ban, pleased to meet you.
Likewise.
I see that everyone is here.
Detective Nakamori.
Good morning, Mr. Mouri, it's been a long time,
hasn't it?
Indeed, I am delighted to see you!
No, the pleasure is mine!
Do you think they're all genuine?
You're right, Kid often disguises himself as one of the parties involved.
He may already be hiding among them.
Oh, by the way, I've brought in someone to help us with this case.
I mean, I didn't need it, but Megure insisted.
Uh, I mean, Detective Megure highly recommended it.
Come on in.
Good evening, I am Shinichi Kudo.
Shinichi!
Is it really you, Shinichi?
It is only him...
Shinichi Kudo, you say?
The famous
high school detective?
Who is he again?
What the hell are you talking about?
He's Ran's boyfriend!
No way!
Her husband.
Sonoko!
That's Kaito Kid!
That's not Shinichi!
Kid's in disguise!
Kid?
What makes you think that?
Because I'm the real one...
The real what?
Nothing.
I see,
it's not impossible, indeed.
Ouch, ouch! Stop, detective Nakamori!
What is this story?
I have no idea. Maybe Kid looks like me from the beginning.
Or else,
you are the impostor.
Easy on the jokes.
Perfect. There's no doubt about it, this is the real thing.
While we're at it, I'd like to shoot everyone in the face.
- Huh? - What?
No, that won't be necessary.
My intuition tells me that Kid isn't here.
Of course he's here.
Besides, I've got a foolproof plan to catch him.
Oh, you do? I'd be curious to hear it.
Miss Maki?
Do you mind if I ask everyone to leave?
No problem, I've finished getting ready, detective.
Ah, excuse me?
I'd like to do this my way.
Excuse me?
Good, we don't need a detective in a diaper.
We'll leave you now.
I can't wait to see the play.
Say,
you could have at least told me you were coming back.
Sorry, I wanted to surprise you and see your lovely reaction.
Adora...
Just arrived and you pull out all the stops?
Well, I think I'll go take a look at the roof.
Do you want to come, Ran?
How about it?
You can see the view from the top floor.
Go ahead, Ran.
I'm coming too!
You stay here.
I want to come, I want to come!
Stop your whims!
I'm going! I'm coming!
All right, let's all go together then.
Great!
Say, don't you think that...
His personality changes when he's in front of Ran.
He's at an age...
where he wants to be pampered.
I see.
What a big baby he is.
The same goes for you.
As if I would leave her alone with him!
Emergency exit
Good, it's locked.
Yes.
What's up?
All the doors on the roof were locked.
I see.
So, if my deductions are correct,
Kid certainly won't be going up to the roof as a child.
You're right.
Your joke didn't work.
Hey, I'll hold off Conan, why don't you two go somewhere?
That's not necessary.
Besides...
I think he's a little different.
Huh?
He never usually says things like that.
What kind of things?

"Adorable," for example.
It just means he's expressing a little more of what he thinks.
Why not do the same? If you love him, tell him.
Don't talk nonsense! I already told you I don't!
It's great, great, great!
That's all you've been saying all day, Genta.
I can't help it if everything is great.
What a great view!
What else can I say except that it's great?
You know what I mean?
You're right, it's beautiful.
He has a lot of nerve to dress up as Shinichi.
Yes.
He must have thought that imitating me would make it easier for him.
At least we won't have to look for him.
That's for sure.
By the way, do you know who Napoleon is?
Well, we know he's the French hero who conquered Europe.
Well then, to prepare you for the play, I'll give you a quiz about Napoleon.
Will you do that, Shinichi?
You sound like Professor Agasa.
It's not a pun, right?
This quiz will serve as your historical reference.
Take it too, kid.
Shut up a little.
Listen up, two Japanese people built their house on Napoleon's land.
Give me their names by choosing among the following 3:
number 1: Fuyuno,
number 2: Furuno,
number 3: Fukano.
Fuyuno, Furuno, Fukano...
They all have the syllables "fu" and "no".
Ah, I found it.
Shh, don't say anything.
The difference between the three is their central syllable, "yu" "ru" "ka".
I know, it's Fuyuno and Furuno!
Fukano is the only one with "ka" in the middle, right?
The "ka" stands for "China".
So Fukano is Chinese!
Right?
What? Did I get it wrong?
The answer is right, but it's not the right reasoning.
This line of Napoleon
"Impossible is not in my dictionary", does it ring a bell?
I've heard it before.
This quiz plays on words and their sound.
"Terrain" has 2 pronunciations, right?
Tochi (land)
Jisho (land)
By replacing the pronunciation of the names,
we have: "Impossible/Fukano is not
in my dictionary/land".
I see.
Actually, Napoleon would have said instead:
"Impossible is a word that can only be found in the dictionary of fools."
That's our Ai!
So it was definitely a play on words.
And then...
It won't serve as a reference for us.
Oh, really?
Josephine, Theresa!
Would you like something, Mr. Barras?
I'll make the introductions.
Theresa Tallien and Josephine de Beauharnais, this is-
We already know who it is.
General Napoleon Bonaparte.
We have heard that you were a brave man.
I wouldn't go that far.
General, may I have a dance?
With pleasure.
How nostalgic...
All those glorious days gone by...
Bonaparte...
Elba...
King of Rome.
Hey, Ran!
Isn't that your father next to the Pope?
What?
So this was his plan to catch the Kid?
Ai, I'll leave the rest to you.
See ya.
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, I lay upon this crown
the symbol of French royalty.
I am king of France,
Napoleon the First!
Are you okay, kid?
You have to be careful.
Yes, I'm all right.
However...
Is there a problem?
Nothing much,
the kid came running,
he hit me and fell to the ground.
I see. Are you all right, son?
I'm fine, yes.
Your baton is very classy, sir.
It's longer than his, right?
It's true that it's longer.
They come in all sizes.
Less than two feet long,
less than 3 cm in diameter,
a mass not exceeding 320g.
The standard measurements of the truncheons are established
by the public safety commission, right?
Wouldn't your baton be much too long?
How come?
If you want to know why it is so long...
Well, it's because... it's not a baton!
You can't escape me!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Damn it!
All the things in this world...
Glory, victory... will soon belong to me!
We will share them together!

We'll go as soon as the curtain comes down.
I know.
Now! Get a load of the Kid!
He's dressed as Napoleon!
- Aye, aye, sir! - Aye, aye, sir!
Wait, wait, wait, wait... What the...
You let your guard down, Kid.
The great Kogoro Mouri has solved your pitiful riddle.
You're mistaken, I'm not Kid!
It's time for you to reveal your true identity, Kaito Kid!
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
Ouch, ouch! Stop it!
This is the real one.
Where is Kid then?
It's time to end this little game, Mr. Thief.
You're right.
It's getting a little late
to be playing hide-and-seek with you,
little detective.
Enjoy being clever, it won't last.
It's time
...to settle the score, don't you think?
Fine by me. Besides, your girlfriend's waiting for you to eat.
Conan?
Food's ready!
You!
Come quickly or I'll eat without you!
Looks like this is the end of our feud, little detective.
Looks like it, indeed.
Damn it!
He's crazy!
I see, a paraglider versus a hang glider.
Impressive. Is this glider also an invention of Professor Agasa?
You can't run away anymore.
Once you're on the ground, Kaito Kid is just a thief.
In that case, I'll hurry up and become the other Kaito again.
What's that noise?
Damn it!
See ya.
Damn it!
Now for the weather.
Haneda Airport
We are expecting tonight in Hokkaido
a lot of rain with thunderstorms in some places, over the Hakodate area.
Thunderstorms over Hakodate?
It's not a good weather.
What if lightning falls on the plane?
It will be fine, it flies above the clouds.
We'll have to go under it to land, right?
It had to rain today, even though I'm well dressed.
Grandma always told me that the god of lightning
steals the belly buttons off of people dressed like this.
Oh, really?
Well, let him try it on for size!
I'm really sorry,
you didn't have to invite us to celebrate the end of the play.
It's quite normal, thanks to you the jewel was not stolen.
Exactly.
So relax and enjoy Hakodate.
By the way, Juri is taking a long time.
That's true.
Please excuse her, she is being made up by Natsuki
in the car on the parking.
Her makeup?
It's not every day easy to be a star.
It's for Natsuki that it's not easy.
She is so useful to Juri that she practically forces him to accompany her everywhere.
Oh, I see.
Good morning.
Sorry for the wait.
That's okay, you look lovely again today.
Thank you, Mr. Mouri.
Looks like everyone's here.
No, Isao is still missing.
He contacted me this morning to say he was unwell and was cancelling his flight.
He did?
That's a real shame, isn't it, Juri?
What is it?
No, nothing.
Excuse me?
Aren't the other actors coming?
Of course not, what's the point of inviting the supporting cast?
What was that?
Hakodate - Lake Ônuma shore
Juri's villa
If my hunch is right, he will definitely come here.
Everyone is in place, Mr. Nakamori.
It's perfect.
Group A in the front, B in the back and C is watching the surroundings.
- Yes, sir! - Understood!
Detective Nakamori!
What is it?
There's a light...
What is it?
But, this is...
Sky Japan Airlines flight 865 departing for Hakodate,
scheduled for 6:15pm, will now proceed
boarding.
Passengers for Hakodate-bound flight 865 should proceed to gate 8.
Great, they are super comfortable!
They are not bad, indeed.
I think I'm a boss!
Sky Japan Airlines is the only domestic airline to have
to have these great seats in second class.
Wow!
Hey, Ran?
What's up?
What's wrong with you? You keep turning around.
Nothing's the matter.
Welcome aboard.
Thank you, sir.
There she is!
Who is she?
Shh, don't say anything.
Excuse me, is the seat next to me free?
Yes, you can have it.
Eri?
Kogoro?
Mrs. Kisaki?

Hey, are you going to Hakodate too?
What a funny coincidence!
I knew it, you and dad are really linked by destiny!
What are you talking about?
It's you who told me to come instead of your father because he couldn't.
This is another one of your tricks.
Anyway, why don't you both sit down?
- This is a joke! - This is a joke!
- Sit next to him? - Sit next to her?
Relax, both of you.
Daddy?
Excuse me, Juri, can I sit next to you?
May I? Yes, please do.
What the...
What are you doing?
Excuse me, are you Juri Maki?
Yes, I am.
I am Eri Kisaki. I wanted to thank you for your invitation.
You're welcome.
By the way, if the ill-bred man next to you causes you any trouble,
don't hesitate to ask me for advice.
Oh, you're a lawyer?
I'll leave you now.
Well, that's fine.
Why is this happening?
It was predictable.
It was for sure.
Hello everyone, sorry for the delay.
Isao?
Didn't you cancel because you were feeling bad?
Yes, but..,
since I'm better
and I had nothing to do
I finally decided
to join you.
Please forgive my delay, Josephine.
Why don't you do what I said?
Don't worry.
We'll have plenty of time once we get there.
Have a good flight.
Thank you.
Message to flight attendants: doors closing.
What are you thinking about?
I guess it's probably the Kid.
Yes.
I wonder if he really intended to steal the jewel last night.
It's getting a little late to be playing hide-and-seek with you, little detective.
Besides, it was very careless and unusual of him
to carry around an oversized baton.
Hey hey!
I've got the 4K seat, like the K in Kid!
I've got the 4J, like the J in Jumbo.
I've got the 4B like... Uh...
But yes!
The four words in English written on Kid's note were a phonetic code.
Phonetic code?
That's right.
It's a code used to avoid confusion in radio telephony.
R for Romeo, J for Juliet, V for Victor and B for Bravo.
By the way, they are also used for communications with airplanes.
Sky flight J 865,
travel authorization runway 16 L.
Follow Juliet 10, Echo 10, Charlie 10.
This is Sky J 865, I am Juliet 10, Echo 10, Charlie 10.
So when the note said, "When the 26 letters move",
he was announcing that his crime would take place on the plane, when this code was used.
Moreover, on this outbound flight from Tokyo to Hakodate.
Why this one and not the return?
The map.
He did.
He tore the 2 of spades in half.
So it means an odd number that is not divisible by 2.
It was decided that flights departing from Tokyo, like this one, would be odd,
and those arriving would be even.
So what happened yesterday makes sense.
He made sure that I noticed it and that we thought wrongly that we had foiled his plan,
so that we would relax our vigilance.
If that's the case...
Kid is somewhere on the plane
and will be looking for the ring.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
thank you for choosing Sky Japan.
Is there something wrong with you?
I don't feel very well.
Fatigue must have caught up with you.
Hold out your hand Juri, these are vitamins.
Mr. Okoshi will be your captain
and I'll be your chief of cabin, Shindô.

Returning from the train.
It feels weird in my ears.
So do mine.
It's the pressure difference.
Swallow and you'll feel better.
It's still weird.
It doesn't work.
In this case, block your nose and blow hard like this.
But don't do it too suddenly, you might get dizzy.
It's gone. Look, what came out.

Will you turn around?
Would you? Okay.
You're right, it worked.
It's typically feminine.
What?
Blowing your nose and pinching your nose is not very attractive.
It's not something you want to show off and certainly not to your loved one.
Is it?
Excuse me, Juri.
Yes ?
Can I ask you for an autograph?
Of course you can.
Shoot, I forgot my autograph pen.
Juri?
Here, take this.
Thank you, sir.
That's why I need it.
What's he doing?
Don't worry about that bastard.
Anyway, why don't you introduce me to everyone?
Okay, I will.
Oh!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You all right in there?
Yes, thank you.
Here you are.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Western or Japanese cookies?
Nothing for me, thank you.
Any preference?
Neither, and no drinks either.
I'll have a beer and some Japanese cookies.
Well, one moment please.
A good beer in these beautiful surroundings...
Hakodate Airport
It's raining hard.
Yes, hoping that this weather does not cause anything serious.
Sky flight J 865,

This is Sky J 865,
channel 118.90.
To control tower,
Sky J 865, flight level 390.
Sky J 865, this is control tower.
Roger.
Everything all right, Commander?
Last night my last one came down with a fever,
so I'm a little sleep-deprived.
Can I get you a coffee?
I would like to, yes, thank you.
Is the ring still there?
Yes.
But you have to be careful.
That was pretty fast.
Masayu?
The chocolates.
Cockpit service?
It's rare during a domestic flight.
This is Misawa, I brought your coffee.
Please come in.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Hello !
You can't be here.
It's OK, Misawa.
Isn't it?
She was one of us.
Was she?
It's been a long time.
Indeed, it must be 5 years since you left.
It will be seven years in reality.
That long already?
It's a pleasure to see you too.
Thank you very much. I went to see Josephine.
I'm glad I did.
It was a remarkable play.
Did you find it? Thank you very much.
My heart goes out to you.
I leave you,
until the next time.
Juri?
Would you like a chocolate?
Yes, please.
And you, Mr. Mouri?
I'll have one, yes, thank you.
Delicious!
It can't be.
I smell almonds.
Indeed, it must be cyanide.
The chocolates! They were surely poisoned!
The chocolates?
Daddy! Daddy!
It's all right. It's all right.
If he'd eaten a poisoned chocolate, the symptoms would already be visible.
Then why is Juri...
The captain requests your discretion until we land...
to avoid panic among the other passengers.
I understand.
But, how did the culprit manage to make Juri swallow poison?
Certainly
by the chocolate.
She died right after swallowing it.
I think so too.
That's impossible!
I had nothing to do with it,
I bought them this afternoon in Ginza, in the usual store
and I just opened it!
Right, Natsuki?
Didn't I? Ah, sorry, I didn't see what you were doing.
Natsuki!
But, if you're fine, then that means
they weren't all poisoned, right?
If that's the case, how did she get Juri to find the poisoned one?
She's her manager, she knew exactly which chocolate she was going to choose.
I didn't do anything!
Besides, she always ate them in a different order!
Juri hesitated, not knowing which chocolate to choose earlier.
Quiet! The kids are silent!
Anyway, I'm going to requisition these chocolates.
I agree.
We'll let the police take care of it once we're on the ground.
Yes.
To preserve the crime scene, everyone will sit in the back.
Access to the restroom will also be prohibited at the front.
If we list what she's swallowed
since she got on that plane, other than the chocolate...
Vitamins...
But, who could have predicted that she would need them?

I got it!
I know who did it!
Daddy.
Who did it? Who did it?
The deceased Juri only swallowed two things since she was on that plane.
Those two things are...
The chocolate that was being discussed earlier
and the vitamins Tenko gave her.
You?
As anyone can see,
the person who murdered Juri on that plane is...
You, Tenko!
You're joking, you're making false accusations!
And besides, I have no motive!
I'm not so sure.
I think everyone on that plane
had a reason to want to kill her.
What the hell are you talking about?
You're Natsuki Sakai, her hairdresser and makeup artist, right?
What do you mean?
That's right.
I spent the most time with her then,
I think I know her relationships best.
First of all, Mr. Ban,
he was supposedly the director of this play,
but on stage, it was mostly Juri who gave the directions.
At first, it was he who trained her to become an actress,
but then the situation was reversed without him standing up to her.
I saw Tenko quarrel with Mr. Ban about this many times.
Three years ago, on Juri's request,
Bunjiro and her got divorced, but still having feelings
he came back to her many times, without result.
Recently bored by her young and new boyfriend, Isao,
she asked me to introduce her to young men.
And finally, there is her manager Masayo.
Juri used to humiliate her and say in front of everyone
that she was depressing or slow-witted.
That goes for me too, she used to lead me around by the nose with her whims.
I was flattered that she would do anything to keep me from getting other jobs,
but also very annoyed.
You see, it wouldn't be strange
if one of us had killed her.
Genta, aren't you ashamed?
Eating at a time like this!
It would be a waste otherwise.
Delicious!
What if the poison was on her fingers?
Isao was the first to touch his hand.
Would he have placed the poison at that moment?
No, he's not the only one who could have done it.
Maybe there was some on this pen.
Or at that moment,
he would have put it on the button.
Or on something she could have touched
when she went to the bathroom.
Now that I think about it,
she came out of the bathroom pretty quickly.
Just a second!
Before that...
But yes!
That's what it was for then.
That's why...
I don't feel so good.
I've seen through this little trick.
And I also know who did it!
Say, there's something weird here.
What's that?
What is what?
I don't see anything.
What's wrong?
Great, now!
Shit!
What's so weird about it?
I must have made a mistake! I'm sorry, I have to go to the bathroom!
It's not right.
It's the first time, but I have no choice.
Don't be so cocky, dear.
What?
Damn, I was wrong!
Sonoko?
Who, me?
Why don't you get straight to the point?
How about that?
I guess this case is too simple for the great Kogoro the sleeper.
All right, I'll tell the truth.
What? You'll do it?
Great, she's going to share her deductions with us!
Let's start with the ingenious trick the culprit used
to make her swallow the poison,
if you will.
The unplugging of the ears.
The unplugging of the ears?
The culprit knew that Juri would unplug her ears
once she was on the plane.
He also knew that she would use her right thumb and index finger
to plug her nose, as always.
I'm sure many people know this,
but this is a method taught in diving class.
With experience, it can be done without plugging your nose,
but Juri was a beginner and certainly used the other method.
Isn't that right, dear?
Yes.
Wait a second, how do you know all this?
Well, just like Ayumi earlier,
it's quite embarrassing for a woman to do that in front of a man.

Besides, Juri is an actress and even if you are a fool
she couldn't do it in front of you.
A fool?
That's why,
she hid in the bathroom to do it.
When she came back, she grabbed the chocolate using her thumb and forefinger.
And then, as always, she licked her cocoa-covered fingers.
It was because of this unfortunate habit
that the poison was introduced into her body,
without her knowledge.
What are you saying? Where was the poison?
We are choking, don't you think?
Yes, we are.
It's very strange.
I think Juri was already feeling the effects of the poison long before that.
She felt bad because her skin had already started to absorb it.
Her skin? You mean...
Exactly.
In the parking lot of Haneda Airport,
the poison mixed with her foundation was applied to her nose.
The person who murdered Juri was you,
Natsuki Sakai.
Not at all, but I find your deductions interesting.
Conan told me that...
Natsuki,
you lectured the girls
when they touched the foundation.
Didn't you reprimand them on purpose
to prevent them from touching
the products in which you had introduced poison?
All right, then,
show me some evidence then!
The analysis of the poisoned foundation on her fingers would have served as evidence
but by licking them, Juri made them disappear.
There is, however, other evidence.
The pot of foundation and the sponge that you used...
Clever as you are, you didn't take them with you.
That said, it was also risky to throw them in a trash can at the airport.
If it was me,
I would have sent them
by mail to my home.
One call to the airport post office and all packages will be checked.
So please give us
your home address.
This woman has shattered my dreams.
Your dreams?
My dream was to be a makeup artist in Hollywood.
To make it come true,
I studied for a year at a makeup school in L.A. and perfected my English.
I continued to receive letters from Hollywood even after I got home and was busy with Juri.
A month ago, a Hollywood actress came to Japan.
Her agent contacted me and offered me to follow them
because they thought my work was excellent.
It was the chance of my life.
And she...
She used her connections and blew it!
That proves she didn't want to lose you.
If she wanted to keep me as a makeup artist, I would have forgiven her!
But, that wasn't the case.
She wanted me around just so I could be her maid!
When I finally realized this, I thought it was the only way.
She destroyed my pride as a makeup artist...
Your pride as a makeup artist?
Cut the crap!
Why did you use your products to do this then?
After what you did, you have no right to use that word!
I'm...
I'm just...
You're still young,
once you pay for your crimes, start fresh.
What's with the bad feeling?
I'm getting a tingling sensation in my head.
Oh no!
Tell the pilots not to eat the cookies you brought!
What?
Hurry or the pilots will be in danger!
What kind of nonsense is that? There's no poison in the cookies.
It's not the cookies that are the problem, they might have poison on their fingers!
What?
Speak up, what's this story ?
All right, right now.
I'm sorry, I...
I knew it!
Commander!
What happened? What's wrong?
What is happening to them?
Nakaya, are you all right?
Commander!
Oh no, the autopilot has been disabled!
Commander, hold on! Commander!
Straighten it out, I'll take its place!
Commander!
The autopilot now...
Mr. Shinjo!
Good job, kid!
It's okay, get a doctor!
Yes, sir.
We currently have a medical emergency.

If there is a doctor on board, please report to the staff.
This is fast-acting poisoning.
Move them to the cabin and I'll give them first aid.
Yes, sir.
Bunjiro, Toru, come and help me!
I'll do that.
The medical kit, quick!
Yes !
How were the pilots poisoned?
Juri went into the cockpit earlier.
The two pilots kissed her hand.
I see, that's because of the poison on her fingers.
What unlucky people.
They wouldn't have ingested poison if she had just shaken their hands.
Come on.
Oh!
How are they doing, doctor?
Fortunately, the amount of poison was minute..,
so their lives are not in danger.
Only, in this state, they are not fit to fly the plane.
What are you saying? The pilots are unconscious?
Excuse me, may I have your name?
Isao Shinjo.
Mr. Shinjo, could you tell me the current flight conditions?
We are currently at an altitude of 12,000 feet, speed 280 knots.
Fortunately, the ILS is already engaged until landing,
and I, for one, have some flying experience.
Just tell me what to do and when.
I will.
Alert all air traffic and get a commander to the control tower.
Due to unstable weather conditions,
all flights have been cancelled.
Please be patient.
Ladies and gentlemen...
This is what it is all about.
I'll take the captain's seat.
And for the co-pilot's seat...
I would like it to be you.
How about that?
You did a good job earlier by straightening the aircraft.
That's great!
I've flown a lot of arcade games.
Are you sure?
That's not fair!
I want to sit in it too!
I want to sit in it too!
This is not a game!
Besides, there's not much left to do.
Even with the ILS, there's a bit of fiddling to be done.
It will simply assist me with that.
But, it's still just a kid.
Anyway, trust me.
Everyone back to the cabin, we're landing in 15 minutes.
Right.
He said he had some experience...
Maybe he's got a license for a Cessna.
Here? Look, Daddy,
it looks like she's asleep.
What?
All passengers, please return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts.
Would you mind sitting next to her?
God, do I have a choice.
Come on, wake up.
Can you hear me?
Damn it.
It's you, Kid, isn't it?
What are you saying?
Cut the crap.
Who'd ask a kid to copilot a plane?
So I'm busted.
The real Isao is...
in Juri's villa in Hakodate, disguised as the fake Kid.
Isn't that right?
She was upset when she saw you boarding the plane.
She certainly asked you to play the impostor for the party.
Nice work, only...
There's another person in Hakodate who's certain that Kid isn't finished yet.
He may even be pursuing the fake Kid as we speak.
So when do you intend to take the Jewel of Destiny?
I give up.
Huh?
You probably already know this but,
a real star sapphire is cold when you put it to your lips.
This one is fake.
So it was,
to verify its authenticity.
They must have said it was real to attract the public to see the piece.
So? Are you going to arrest me, little detective?
Sure, once we land this iron bird in its nest.
Sky J 865, we are handing over to Hakodate control tower.
Go to frequency 118.35, please.
118.35, roger.
Hakodate control tower.
I'm Uesugi, in charge of communications. I'm transferring you to Major Shimaoka
This is Shimaoka,
I'm going to be blunt, but do you know what the MCP is?
Yes, I do.
Well then, press the APP button on it.
The plane will automatically descend to the runway.
I understand.
APP...
It's here.
We've activated it.
Who are you?

My name is Conan Edogawa, I'm Isao's co-pilot.
Co-pilot? You have a child next to you?
Hey kid, don't touch any buttons.
Understand?
Yes.
That's reassuring.
And if not, you know how to operate the handle and the flaps?
Yeah, I can.
My dad taught me how to fly a Cessna when we were in Hawaii.
I can see and see that I made the right choice of co-pilot.
It was all theory on the ground.
I've never actually flown in the air.
The weather is really bad, but they should be able to land.
Yes.
- The rain is pouring. - The wind is blowing hard too.
Please don't crash, little plane.
There's the airport.
It's coming up.
Flight 865, select flaps 1.
Flaps five.
Flaps 10.
Gear down and flaps 20.
We're about to land.
What's the matter?
It's the lightning strike!
This is Flight 865,
lightning's blown the whole board down!
Stay calm, turn the switch under the glare shield.
That's it.
Not again!
The auto-pilot is not activated!
What?
Landing aborted!
More power and pull the stick!
All right, retract the gear.
We've got it.
Good, keep climbing.
Oh no, it's being pushed by the wind!
Turn right! Turn right!
He's going to hit the terminal!
Get it up!
This sucks!
Did you see that?
That's awesome!
Was the airport and the tower damaged?
Flight 865, can you hear me?
Yes, we can hear you!
Is there any damage?
No one in the tower was hurt, but the runway is out of action.
And on your side?
We lost reactor 2.
It is not worrying, you will be able to land with the 3 others.
What about balance?
I can keep it.
I hold the helm and I boosted the third reactor.
That's fine. Your altitude and speed?
Three thousand feet and 200 knots.
Put the flaps on 5 and level off.
Tilt the aircraft 180 degrees and climb to 4500 feet.
Roger.
Are we circling while we wait?
Yes, when the autopilot comes back on..,
...we can land with the ILS.
We can't do that! I'm telling you we don't have enough vehicles!
Put out the fire on the runway!
- Conan, this is bad! - It's terrible!
- We've lost a reactor! - We've lost a reactor!
I know, don't worry.
We'll be able to land safely with the remaining three.
We still have some fuel left...
What? We're almost out of fuel.
We're almost out of fuel.
What? What? What?
- What? What's the matter? - Out of fuel?
We're out of fuel?
How can that be?
Could the loss of the reactor be the cause?
No, normally each reactor has its own fuel tank.
The cross-valves are open!
What are these valves?
Cross valves.
This button opens the valves separating the different tanks to connect them together.
How could this happen?
-Ah! -Ah!
Oh!
Damn, that old geezer!
We have no time to lose!
No.
- Get me a map in the corner here. - Control tower, this is flight 865,
we have an emergency!
Can you hear me? Come in, Control Tower!
Flight 865, this is Control Tower, we can't hear you, please speak up.
There's too much noise,
I can't hear you at all.
What's the matter?
Professor.
We've lost a reactor and we're running out of fuel!
What is it?
A map, a map, a map...
Aren't these red books?
Yes, it is!
Damn it! The autopilot, the fuel,
and now even the line doesn't work!
If we're not in a car...
You're driving manually?
Here's the map, Conan!
Thank you, sir.
We have 1000 liters of fuel left.
We're losing 100 liters a minute, so we've only got 10 minutes of flying time left.
We have to find a place to land in that time.
What place are you talking about?
The airstrip won't be ready in 10 minutes.
Why not fly to Chitose airport?
It's too close.
There's a good chance we'll be stranded before then.

Are there any other airports in the area?
No, none.
There are probably fields or military bases,
but not long enough for a runway.
In that case, why not land on a road?
There are many straight and wide roads in Hokkaido.
No way.
The wheels of this plane are 11 meters apart.
Roads more than 12 meters wide are marked with signs
are marked with signs and separated by a median.
There are also houses and pylons.
What about a meadow?
No way.
The ground would be too soft.
Why not try a water landing?
No, the waves could turn the plane over.
Where can we land?
There is certainly a place where it is possible.
Somewhere wide and straight, with nothing around...
Say, what happens to us if we can't land?
Well, I mean... We're going to crash.
What? I don't want to die! I don't want to die!
Conan, I know!
I know a wide, straight place with nothing around!
Huh?
They showed it on the TV show "Dolphin and Whale Watching"!
You can watch dolphins and whales in Muroran...
A port!
Shin-nitetsu port, Nakau port, Motowa-nishi port...
Muroran port, Nisseki port...
Here !
Sakimori port !
Length...
1400 meters and about 30 meters wide.
But, the wingspan of the plane...
I know, a little less than 60 meters.
But, if we leave one of the wings above the sea, we should...
Impossible, it's not long enough.
This plane needs more than 2000 meters to land.
The solidity of the ground is also a problem.
Good or not, we have little fuel and few passengers on board.
The lighter the aircraft, the shorter the braking distance.
With a headwind, it would be even better.
At Haneda Airport, the weather forecast said the west wind would be strong!
Are you sure?
Yes.
This harbor
is practically east-west.
With a westerly wind, if we come from the east we should get there from just...
No way.
I hurt my left arm when we hit the tower.
I practically fly with my right hand.
If we have to land manually,
you have to hold the rudder with both hands.
What?
Do you have good eyesight?
Do you?
I have 10/10 in both eyes.
Chronic illness?
None.
Chest size, belly, hips?
Uh, chest size...
What's this?
Good, you passed the test.
Now sit down,
you will take my place.
What are you talking about?
I've never flown a plane before!
Don't worry, I'll be behind you to steer you.
You just have to hold the rudder.
I can't do that!
The plane!
The plane is going down!
We're going to crash!
Quick Ran, sit down!
Bring the rudder towards you. Gently.
That's fine. See, it's easy.
Don't say that.
Where is Muroran?
I'm looking.
Here it is.
It's located
near an airway connecting Hakodate to Sapporo.
Orientation 023°.
023.
There are mountains higher than 5,000 meters.
I see.
Excuse me?
Tell the passengers we're going to Chitose.
Yes, sir.
And move the second class further back.
What's that?
If we know a high school girl is flying the plane,
it's going to create panic.
You too, sir,
go back to the cabin.
- What? - What? What? What?
There's nothing you can do even if you stay here.
Besides, I want you to make sure that the other children are left alone.
This is a very important task.
Others will do it if they can't.
What do you think? Can you do it?
All right.
We will do it.
Count on us.
Good, I'm counting on you then.
- Got it! - Got it!
I'm staying!
I'm the only one who can help Ran if anything happens!
I understand.
Okay, then..,
Since we're running out of time, I'll explain the controls to you...
as we go along.
Let's go.
Sky J 865,
this is Hakodate control tower, do you hear me?
Come in!
It's no use, even the emergency line isn't working.
Look at this,
flight 865 is moving away.
Where are they going?
So this is the Shiratori Bridge.
It's not bad at all, is it Shiratori?

I'm sorry inspector, but his name is Hakucho.
It was worth stopping in Muroran after a case in Sapporo.
This Shiratori bridge is really beautiful.
Hakucho Bridge
I would like to come back here one day with Miwako...
What a waste of time...
Look at all those patrol cars.
They must be chasing a dangerous criminal.
Well, let's find out.
Announce to all passengers,
- Mom, I'm scared. - because of a minor incident,
- we are obliged - Do you think it's all right?
To reroute us to Shin-Chitose Airport.
We apologize and hope that you will understand.
- that you will be understanding. Actually, we're going to Muroran.
We're almost at Muroran.
Drop down to 2,000 feet.
Okay.
We're seeing lights!
That's Muroran Harbor, Sakimori Pier is on the left.
On the other side of the bridge.
Damn it!
Well...
It's too dark, I can't see anything.
Can we really land there?
What to do? There's no turning back now.
Are we going to make it, Conan?
What the...
Things are getting bad, so I'm getting off first.
Good luck!
Hold it!
Hey, come back!
Tilt the camera, Ran!
What the hell are you doing?
Hang on to something.
What happened?
It's nothing, don't worry.
Just keep the plane steady.
Ka...
Ka...
Kaito Kid!
I'll see you next time, young lady.
We'll meet again under the moonlight.
Ah, right.
See you then.
What?
Did he jump?
That's right, Isao was actually Kid.
That's why he pressed the depressurization button.
He ran away because he was afraid of crashing.
I was a fan of his, what a horror.
It doesn't say we're going to crash yet, Sonoko.
But Conan,
what do we do now?
We have no choice but to land the plane ourselves.
We'll be fine, Ran.
As they say, "two balls are better than one".
We'll make it, you'll see.
If you say things like that...
It's "two is better than one".
Is it?
Let's take a ride over the pier and see what happens.
Help me!
Please, help me!
I'm not the Kid, you've got the wrong person!
Why are you running away then?
Because I stole a watch.
You see that it is you, Kid.
Detective Nakamori?
What is it?
What's that, over there?
What is it?
Open your eyes, it's Kid.
Kid?
So you...
I'm telling you, it's not me!
How does it look, Sonoko?
It's no good.
I see lights everywhere, but nothing very distinct.
Damn it!
Are you okay, Ran?
What's wrong, Ran?
I don't know, it's like my whole body...
Conan..,
I can't do it.
Sure you can, you can, Ran.
Damn, at this rate it'll get out of hand.
Sonoko, take my place, I have to go to the bathroom.
The bathroom?
I'll be right back...
But keep your helmets on in case anyone tries to contact you by radio.
Just a second!
Damn, he's going to the bathroom
at a time like this.
What a brat.
Hello?
Hello... hello...
Ran? Can you hear me, Ran?
Shinichi.
I'm contacting you from the Sapporo control tower.
You seem to be in a delicate situation.
But it's all right. Just follow my instructions and you'll land safely.
I'll do everything I can to protect you, don't worry.
Can you hear me, Ran?
Answer him, Ran.
Do you think this is a good time to be a cool guy?
The lives of all the passengers are in my hands!
Don't give me that crap!
You're never around when you're supposed to be and I only have you on the phone.
The few times you come back, you disappear in a flash.
Every time...
Every time...
I don't want to hear!
Shinichi said...
Wait for me, Ran.
Don't run away.
I'll be right back.
You always leave me behind.
He wants you to wait for him until then.
What do you take me for?
I...
I love you, Shinichi.
Ran...
Lights.
I see lights.
A line of red lights is moving.
What was that?
So that was his plan.

Damn, you won't escape us, Kid!
Look, it's sailing towards the dock!
I know.
Kid is heading for the harbor. Units A and B,
go around and create a line of cars to block him on the pier!
Unit C, follow me!
We're gonna get him in a headlock!
There are police cars, Grandpa.
Something must have happened.
They're coming this way too.
- What's up? - What's that?
Ran, get ready to land!
Right?
It must be the police cars that Kid attracted.
So if he jumped, it was to...
...to form a trail with their flashing lights!
That's great Kid.
I knew he had an idea.
Ran, turn left again.
Got it.
Find Kid, he can't be far away!
Keep your eyes open!
Is he here?
No !
What about over there?
The rest is up to you, Detective.
Message to all passengers,
we will be making an emergency landing.
Please fasten your seatbelts and follow the stewardesses' instructions.
Put your pens, glasses
and everything else in your seat pocket.
Lean forward and put your head between your legs.
Listen to Ran,
it's time to settle down.
Altitude and speed?
700 feet at 140 knots.
Great, keep the descent angle at 3 degrees.
Sonoko!
Lower the landing gear lever and the flap lever.
Landing gear lever? Flaps?
This is the gear lever and this is the flaps.
Okay, I'll do it.
I'm putting the landing gear lever down...
...and this is the flap lever.
What's that?
What's what?
Shinichi, we seem to be out of fuel.
I understand.
There won't be a second attempt, everything is done here!
Inspector Megure?
Don't you think that plane...
It seems to be heading this way.
Why is that?
50
Raise the nose and pull the thrust lever to the max!
30
20
Take cover!
10
Push the stick!
Reverse the engines!
Stop! Stop!
Shinichi, we'll hit
a crane!
Damn it!
It's not over, push the right pedal!
We've stopped.
We've stopped!
We made it!
Shinichi, obviously,
the word "impossible" didn't exist in your dictionary either...
...for the word "impossible."
You did it, Ran!
Ran?
Ran!
Hang in there, Ran!
Sonoko?
They just passed out.
No wonder..,
They were pushed to the limit.
You were fantastic, Ran.
Eyes, with one blink you could forget...
My smiling face that you saw so close.
Guided by the glow of your eyes reflecting me
the future will change.
How often do you think that this radiance
Will make my heart beat so fast, right now?
It's so fun and so intoxicating,
you and I complete our Dream x Dream.
Life, when you're yawning next to me,
I want to do the same as you.
All these little moments of happiness become special.
All this is possible because you are there.
From now on, we will shout in unison
how happy we both are.
It's so fun and so intoxicating,
you and I complete our Dream x Dream.
How many seasons will we spend together
smelling like this? And when the time comes,
the first thing we'll say is "just like old times."
How many times do you think this radiance
Will make my heart beat so fast, right then and there?
It's so fun and so intoxicating,
you and I complete our Dream x Dream.
It's so fun and so intoxicating
you and I complete our Dream x Dream.
Your blood pressure and pulse are normal.
As a precaution, we're still going to take you to the hospital.
Thank you.
And how is Sonoko?
She has no apparent injuries,
she only lost consciousness from the shock.
I am relieved.
I'm disturbing you again, but please note here
your name and address.
I will.
And also...
your chest, belly and hips.
Huh?
What a spectacular landing.
Ka...
We'll see you next time, you can give them to me then.
Ka... Ka... Kai...
Hello?
Ran,
It's me.
Shinichi?
Tell me...
It wasn't you who called me earlier, was it?
Didn't you?

I knew it, the Shinichi from earlier was also Kid.
What?
It seemed strange, it was as if he could see what I was doing.
And then, I also suddenly heard Conan's voice.
Oops!
But before that, Sonoko said she saw him jump...
In fact, I quietly...
I know! It was an accomplice of Kid who jumped!
What's that?
Kid was on the plane in disguise.
I'm glad to know it wasn't you.
In what?
It was close! But that doesn't count!
What are you talking about?
It's a secret between Kid and me.
Come on, tell me.
No way. You can guess, you're a detective after all.
How should I know?
Well, grab Kid and ask him.
You then...
