Too good!
It flew away super fast!
It really flies high, doesn't it?
- I want to see, too. - And I want to see it!
Wait a minute!
It can fly up to 10,000 meters for half an hour.
That's a world record for a drone.
But if he gets that high,
how can he still control it?
He communicates by satellite.
So he can control it from any distance.
I fly it using latitude and longitude data
latitude and longitude data and the images the camera captures,
but I have to control the direction, the speed,
and the camera all at the same time, so it's pretty complicated.
But why did you build such a drone?
Why did you build such a drone?
It's every man's dream, of course!
With it, even without climbing Everest,
you could feel like you were there!
What a hateful laugh...
His invention is likely to cause problems of legality...
And just after the page of ads,
some news about the Tokyo summit which will take place next week.
This is where the summit will be held:
At the Edge of Ocean International Conference Hall,
the new resort on Tokyo Bay.
The Edge of Ocean, which will open next month,
was designed to take advantage of its aquatic environment
in order to use it in its facilities.
Its casino tower built in the style of a seashell
also serves as a lighthouse to watch over the surrounding sea
and as an observation point to admire the entire resort.
And in the shopping center near the tower,
a large waterfall
and an elevated garden
will offer a zone of tranquility to their visitors.
Which brings us to the other concept: harmony.
The interior of the conference hall
is decorated in the style of Japanese gardens.
There is even a chic restaurant on the first floor.
And check this out!
Two inverted monorails go around the buildings.
This is a real smart neighborhood combining tradition and modernity!
As seen here,
the Edge of Ocean areas are connected by two bridges.
On the occasion of the summit on May 1st, the metropolitan police
planned to deploy 22,000 officers
to ensure the security of the entire area.
Now, news of the Hakucho spacecraft...
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE ENFORCER OF ZERO
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug,
and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name...
I invented Conan Edogawa.
In order to find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
This is Genta, Mitsuhiko and Ayumi,
my new elementary school friends.
And this is Ai Haibara.
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She used to work with the men in black,
but then tried to commit suicide
by swallowing the same drug as me, which made her young again.
And among the members of the Men in Black organization
is Bourbon, alias Tooru Amuro.
In truth, he is part of a secret division of the police
at the head of public security.
His code name in the police is "Zero".
He is a mysterious man with many covers:
both a bartender at the Poirot Cafe and an apprentice to Detective Kogoro Mouri.
My body is younger, but not my mind!
I will solve all the mysteries!
There is always only one truth!
The uninhabited satellite Hakucho
which was sent to Mars to collect samples
will finally return to Earth on May 1!
The satellite itself will burn up during its passage in the atmosphere
to leave only a capsule of four meters in diameter.
The capsule will descend by parachute

and should land in the Pacific Ocean, near the Sea of Japan.
I see.
The sample capsule has a GPS
coupled with a precision guidance system
which will reduce its landing zone to a radius of 200 meters.
But stop!
Come on, it's my turn!
- No, no way! - I want to try too!
Maybe I should try to make three separate joysticks...
They are not possible...
We interrupt this program for a news flash.
Good morning, everyone.
We have reports of a large explosion at the conference hall
where the Tokyo summit was soon to be held.
Here are the images from the surveillance cameras.
Well, well, well.
The Edge of Ocean station where the conference hall was located
was still closed to the public...
- Professor! - the building was empty,
but several police officers who were present at the scene
were injured or killed in the explosion.
I repeat.
Edge of Ocean Station...
It may be terrorists.
But the summit is not until next week.
Maybe it's just an accident.
The Metropolitan Police
have yet to confirm the number of officers injured
or whether the cause of the explosion was accidental or not.
Were any officers injured? That's worrying.
Professor! The screen went blank!
Oh, I'm coming!
It's true, actually,
if there is a terrorist attack just before the summit,
it'll only increase security on the day.
What?
On the footage taken
right after the explosion...
Did you see anything?
It happened really fast,
so maybe I got it wrong.
I thought I saw the man
who works at the Poirot.
I think his name
is Tooru Amuro?
You saw Amuro?
Police Department
According to the scientific division,
there were no traces of explosives at the scene.
There was a Japanese restaurant on the first floor of the lobby,
and the kitchen in the basement is where the explosion took place.
A large amount of gas was found there.
I think we can deduce that the explosion was caused by gas.
Wait a minute.
That building was brand new,
so a gas leak seems unlikely.
Well,
they were equipped with a newer model
that allows you to control the opening of gas valves via the Internet.
So how did the gas leak happen?
Maybe the system was faulty from the start.
Didn't they do inspections?
There was one scheduled for today.
What do you mean?
Today is the day
that the Edge of Ocean network was configured.
And after this morning's safety inspection
by public safety, an audit was scheduled.
So it seems very likely that this was an accident.
If it was an attack,
there would be no point in causing an explosion
before the first of May, the day of the summit.
In this regard, following this incident
it was decided that the summit would take place elsewhere.
It's probably an accident, so...
I have a report to make.
Your name and division.
Yuya Kazami, public security division.
Did you find out what caused the gas to explode?
No, not yet.
The investigation office is looking into the electrical installation.
We have a lead.
It could be a high-voltage cable.
Was there a crack in the construction?
No.
But on the door of the storeroom where the cables were,
we found burnt fingerprints.
Prints from before the explosion, then.
Yes.
The only people who entered were the construction workers
and our division for this morning's inspection.
And by comparing them with the prints
of the construction workers and police officers in our database,
we discovered that they were the prints
of Kogoro Mouri, a former officer of the 1st Investigation Division!
This must be a mistake.
I don't believe it!
No, it can't be!
The international conference hall?
I've never been there!

But your fingerprints were at the scene.
That's not possible!
Daddy...
you didn't get drunk again and go in there without permission?
I'm telling you I've never been there!
It's clearly a mistake, you won't find anything here.
Calm down...
- Excuse me - It's nothing.
Is something wrong, Conan?
That investigator...
He is wounded in the face. Is he okay?
Ah, Mr. Kazami?
He was there when the explosion happened.
Sorry, I'm going to the bathroom.
Yes ? Is everything okay?
Is your father suspected by the police?
I think it's a mistake, but...
Okay, I'll look into it on my own.
It's tiring to have to play two roles.
Huh?
Where's my smartphone?
Professor?
Ah, is that you Shinichi? What's up?
I have a favor to ask you.
How much longer will it take?
- Do something! - I'm sorry, but...
- Let them speed up a bit! - Yes...
That's mine.
Funny thing about that.
Genta, slow down a bit!
We're trying to take pictures.
Oops, sorry.
Still, this is so cool.
We can make it go super far!
You can control it from up to 20 miles away.
We sent it 20 kilometers earlier.
We delivered a package to my aunt who lives in Saitama.
Even your aunt was so happy!
- Yes, she was! - You are too fast...
On the other hand,
this screen is too small, it's not easy to watch.
It's because I designed it to be used by only one person.
Hey, professor,
can't you put a screen on my controller too?
And on mine!
Yeah, maybe...
Well, in that case, take my quiz!
What do you say?
If you answer correctly, I'll give you each a screen.
Here is the question!
Professor Agasa's quiz
Which of these rows of hiragana syllabics has the
has the most space?
One: the a row.
Two: the ka row.
Three: the row of sa.
Four: the row of ta.
What do you mean, the most space?
The one that takes up the most space.
A hiragana that takes up space?
The a column is a, i, u, e, o.
The ka column is ka, ki, ku, ke, ko.
Think of it this way.
Sa, shi, su, se, so.
Ta, chi, tsu, te, to.
I don't get it!
Hey, Ayumi, don't move the camera so much!
I'm sorry!
Okay then, clue number one:
Hakucho.
"Swan"?
Hey, Ai!
A swan...
lives in lakes.
A big lake, mizuumi, so it's mi row!
Or not.
Clue #2:
The swan is going home.
The swan is going home?
Then it's definitely a lake!
His home... uchi
uchi
I've got it!
It's the Hakucho satellite coming back from space!
So what is the answer?
The row of a's!
The u is in the middle of the row, middle is said chû.
This forms uchû, "space"!
It is sure that there is nothing bigger than the space!
- That's it, bravo. - I succeeded!
You exaggerate, Ai.
You always give them way too many clues.
You are the one exaggerating!
It's dangerous to make them think while they are flying the drone!
And the pictures they're taking, there,
unlike your quiz, are serious!
Yes, sorry.
We, the investigation office, and those of the security and public safety
were all in charge of inspecting the site before the summit,
and public safety was in charge at the time of the explosion.
That's why Officer Kazami was injured.
He was outside so he had only minor injuries,
but the ones inside...
They said on the news that there were deaths.
Yes.
I probably shouldn't say this,
but it's kind of lucky
that it happened to agents only, not civilians.
If the explosion had occurred during the summit,
it would have caused international panic.

We've already taken remarks, especially from public safety.
However, it's not our fault that there was an accident before the summit.
An accident?
Ah, forget it.
Originally, we thought it was an accident, given the circumstances of the explosion.
But you found uncle Kogoro's fingerprints on the spot?
Yes.
Officer Kazami found them,
and it became a criminal case.
Did he find them?
Ran Mouri
Thank you, Mr. Takagi.
See you later!
Be careful on your way back!
What's wrong, Ran?
Shinichi, I need help!
Dad's gonna be arrested!
You've got to be kidding me!
But I'm telling you I didn't do anything!
When we searched your computer, we found this.
The schedule for the summit,
and the plans for the hall that was destroyed in the explosion.
That is a lie!
My father couldn't have had such documents on his computer!
She's right!
He's so bad with computers!
Absolutely, I can't do it.
You can explain all this to us at the station.
No way!
I don't take orders from public safety!
Fine, then I'll arrest you for contempt of court.
But I just pushed your hand away!
- Oh, no, you didn't! - You can't do that!
April 28, at 4:56 p.m.
Hey! Get off me!
You're only making it worse for yourself by struggling.
Wait!
If you think uncle Kogoro is guilty,
what's his motive to have blown up the hall?
Well yes, why would I do that?
We'll discuss that too at the station.
Hey, wait!
Hey, Dad!
Calm down, Ran! Call Kudo...
I already did!
I did call him, though...
Oh my God...
Why isn't he here at a time like this?
Is he a public security officer?
How should I know?
Officer Kazami is covered in wounds,
just like you.
I guess you were also at the explosion site.
I don't know what you are talking about.
You were inspecting the conference hall.
And you sensed that there was going to be a terrorist attack.
Only the case was going to be ruled an accident.
So you fabricated a culprit, am I right?
For agents like you two,
tampering with a computer
and leaving fingerprints at the scene isn't hard.
You know, the police
aren't interested in accusations without evidence.
But why did you do it?
Because I,
I have something I want to defend even if it means risking my life.
This time, Amuro could well
be my enemy.
But why?
Why don't you want to defend dad?
Don't tell me you think he really caused the explosion!
No, he wouldn't.
Then why won't you?
Lawyers never defend their relatives.
A judge might think the lawyer lacks objectivity.
So if I were to defend him,
it would put him at more of a disadvantage than anything else.
But that's...
Don't worry, I'll get him a good lawyer.
It's just unfortunate.
You were right, Mr. Furuya.
If we had realized that earlier..,
our teammates would still be alive.
Yes.
I didn't think the explosion would happen before the summit.
We're checking the list of terrorists in the country...
as well as the international ones.
And on your end?
I'm inspecting all the remote connections to the gas taps.
A rather strange system seems to have been used.
What do you mean by that?
I'm waiting to find out more,
and I'll notify the public safety office.
Okay, I will.
What about the other case?
That,
it was decided that 2291
would be sent.
Mr. Furuya?
I got it.
But then...
- It was true. - But...
You're saying
that on Kogoro Mouri's computer
there is evidence of remote access to the gas taps?
Yes.
That's what the cybercrime division just reported.
I think it's all clear.
Kogoro Mouri broke into the building, opened the door,
and tampered with a high-voltage cable.
Wait a minute!

In that case, the surveillance cameras should have caught it!
In fact, no.
The computer network was only set up yesterday.
Oh no...
How did the interrogation go?
Kogoro Mouri continues to deny everything.
We can still prosecute.
You're going to prosecute him without a motive?
All we need is evidence.
That's how justice works.
Wait, please!
This doesn't make sense,
something is wrong!
How can you say it doesn't make sense
in front of all the inspectors mobilized here?
Oh, well...
Right.
Again?
Why won't anyone defend him?
Because it's a serious case?
There is that, but...
it's also because the accused is the famous "Sleeping Kogoro".
That seems to slow them all down.
Come in, please.
Excuse me, sir.
Inspector Shiratori.
I wanted to warn you before you heard it in the press.
What is it?
Mr. Mouri is going to be...
to be prosecuted.
Do you have enough evidence for a trial?
His fingerprints at the scene,
the floor plans and schedule found on his computer,
as well as the flammable materials access log.
That's enough to get him in front of a judge.
Why?
Daddy...
Mommy...
Don't worry, Ran.
I'll save Uncle, you'll see!
Professor!
What did you find?
Oh, you're here.
Look at this.
Yes,
it looks like a bomb.
We took pictures of the debris like you asked.
Then we put them together like a puzzle,
to reproduce their original shape.
Ai is searching the Internet
for a match with various bomb components.
Here it is.
I found something that looks like.
What is it?
I'm pulling up the details.
"Connected high-pressure cooker"?
"A high-performance pressure cooker in the shape of a pot."
You can set the temperature, pressure and timer with your smartphone
to cook soups and such.
- Here you go. - From the kitchen?
In addition to the pressure cooker,
we found pots, pans,
and broken dishes.
So the explosion started
in the kitchen of the lobby restaurant.
What, seriously?
There was no bomb, then?
Oh, my God!
You asked us to look for bomb components
and Ai did her best to help you!
Don't be ungrateful, it's not like you.
I'm sorry.
What's wrong with you? Did something happen?
Uncle Kogoro
will go in front of the judge.
Kisaki law office
Who is it?
Can you repeat that?
My name is Kyoko Tachibana and I would like to represent
Kyoko Tachibana (29) Lawyer
Kogoro the Sleeping One.
Here are all the cases I have followed so far.
The case of the extremists of Nijoin University,
the case of spying at the Ministry of Economy...
Cases related to public security.
It would be perfect for our case, then!
And what's your success rate?
You know some pretty big words for your age.
I've lost them all.
Public safety cases are complicated.
Yes.
When the prosecutor takes the case to court,
the conviction rate is over 90%.
And even more for public safety cases.
In short, it's impossible to win.
But I work by phone.
By phone?
That's what some freelance attorneys who don't have an office do.
I have to take every case I can get.
Is that why you want to defend my father?
You're looking for a lawyer, right?
I've heard colleagues say so. Let me take the case.
Yeah, maybe...
Just give us a moment.
Don't say yes, Mom.
This lawyer is going out on a total loss.
True, but okay.
She looks so inexperienced, the DA will underestimate her.
That's not going to be enough to win!
Maybe we should get a public defender.
But I wouldn't have any say in the matter.
At least with her,
I'll be able to intervene.
Maybe, but...
-I'm not reassured. - What's his name?
Goro.
The police told me
Makoto Kusakabe (40 years old) prosecutor

that you continue to deny the charges?
Of course I do.
I am innocent.
However, we have here a lot of evidence
of your guilt.
But it doesn't make sense, Mr. Prosecutor!
Someone must be trying to frame me!
The case has been handed over
to Prosecutor Kusakabe of the Public Security
of the Public Security Prosecutors' Office.
Oops, that's not good.
Even I who rarely deal with such cases
I know his name.
How good is this prosecutor?
He's like Master Kisaki:
very competent, and he rarely loses.
Just the opposite of me.
I know this case.
It's the NAZU hacking.
NAZU is that famous American organization that deals with
space projects?
An employee of a game company hacked it for fun last year.
The prosecutor was Mr. Kusakabe there, too.
And I suppose you...
Yes, I lost, of course.
Of course?
Oh dear...
I studied the case we were assigned today,
and the complete lack of motive for Kogoro Mouri bothers me.
Sayoko Iwai (40) Chief Prosecutor
His motive, right?
But with all the evidence against him,
we can hold the trial tomorrow itself.
But...
For example, regarding the connection to the gas line,
on the report here.
Kogoro Mouri
The suspect's computer could have been a proxy for a third party.
Gas pipes
The documents found on the computer could also very well have been placed there to
- been placed there to accuse him... - Mr. Kusakabe.
Your deduction
arbitrarily ignores this evidence.
Mrs. Prosecutor,
I will ask the police to investigate further...
You will bring Kogoro Mouri to trial.
This is a public safety decision.
Is that understood?
By public safety, do you mean the prosecutors...
or the police division?
I'm done.
You may leave.
Are you going to investigate further?
Yes, at the request of Prosecutor Kusakabe.
So according to the results, my father could escape trial?
No.
The investigation is a personal request from the prosecutor,
but the police have already decided to hold the trial.
Wait, the police have no say in this!
They are under the authority of the prosecutors.
Penal Code Article 247
Prosecution is decided by a prosecutor.
Only a prosecutor can bring a case to court...
Yes, but this only applies
only to the criminal, civil and investigation divisions
of the Prosecutors' Office.
In the public safety division, it's a little different,
but I'm not telling you anything new.
Oh, sorry.
It's a little confusing.
The Metropolitan Police, the National Police and the Prosecutors' Office
each have their own "public security".
The police send an investigation report to the prosecutor,
and then the prosecutor conducts his own investigation on top of it.
The decision whether or not to hold a trial
normally rests with the prosecutor
based on the results of his investigation.
But not for public safety prosecutors.
In all honesty,
in public safety, the police are above the prosecutors.
They have many more investigators and expertise.
So sometimes, for trials,
the police have, let's say, some influence.
Some influence...
And now the explosion in the conference hall at the top,
it's like spitting in the face of the public safety officers.
I'm not surprised that they're desperate to bring the perpetrator to justice.
So my dad...
Yeah, he's probably not going to get away with it.
Oh, no, he won't.
That lawyer...
it's almost like she wants a trial!
You're investigating to see if someone
could have tampered with uncle Kogoro's computer, right?
Yes, we are.
Prosecutor Kusakabe asked us to investigate further...
Is there anything you can tell me?
Shinichi told me he wanted to help uncle,
and that he would like as much information as possible.
Did something happen
to Mr. Mouri?
Amuro.

Were you listening to us?
Not really.
I was just worried about Mr. Mouri,
so I was bringing him a snack from the café.
Unfortunately, he's not here anymore.
Since his trial was decided,
he's been taken to a detention center.
How could you not know that?
Really? I didn't know that.
As usual, you know things.
Oh, and another thing:
they don't allow you to bring food to an inmate there.
Okay, got it.
What was he doing here?
2291 was sent.
What?
What did he say to Amuro?
Damn it!
Policeman!
Give me back the computer you took from uncle!
It had all my favorite games on it!
That's evidence, I can't give it back yet.
Hey, Conan! Stop it!
But it had the games the teacher made for me...
Conan! I've been calling you.
The battery is empty.
Can you charge it with this?
Yes, thanks.
The battery usually lasts longer.
Why did you call me?
The case documents will be here soon.
Ran wanted you to see them with her.
Conan often notices things you wouldn't think of.
And if anything happens, he can tell Shinichi.
Yes, I'll tell Shinichi, I promise!
Thank you, Conan.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Here's the evidence the prosecutor gathered.
Now...
There will be a trial, right?
Yes, the prosecutor warned us it would happen soon.
Daddy...
Don't worry, we'll get him out of there.
- Come on over here. - I'll be right there.
The transcript of the statement, the crime scene report...
And the crime scene photos from the forensics team.
There's that much?
I need to find a clue.
Come on, there's got to be something!
What is it? What is it?
I just feel like I've seen this before...
The M.O. seems pretty obvious when you read this.
The police investigation reports
are like a manual with all the details of the crime.
A manual?
Yes, this is Tachibana.
The court?
Yes.
The procedures before the trial?
Ms. Iwai!
Why did you contact
the lawyers about the trial without telling me?
Don't make me repeat myself.
It's the police's decision.
In addition to deciding the trial,
the police even pick the date now?
The court has contacted us so that the prosecution and the defense
to meet tomorrow for pre-trial procedures.
And why did they contact you?
I am the prosecutor in charge of the case!
Once the proceedings are over,
you will come and inform me.
Looks like they don't have those big tubs of ice.
No, they don't.
I'll ask an employee.
I'll let you take the flour and eggs.
I'm sure you'd make a good wife, Azusa.
Shh!
Stop it, it could be misconstrued!
You're popular with our high school girls.
The other day, a rumor that I was trying to seduce you was flying around the net!
These days, you never know who might be listening!
That's true.
Mr. Furuya.
Why are you making such a big deal out of this?
If it's classified as an accident, we won't even get a warrant.
Public safety can manage to act without a warrant.
All the more reason to use legal methods when we can.
Otherwise, we'll be on our way to ruin.
If we choose to act illegally, we will have to face the consequences.
That's what public safety is all about.
But whether we formalize this case legally,
or solve it illegally,
that's also up to us.
Of course we do.
But we must also ask ourselves which of the two methods
will best serve our country.
Amuro!
Tokyo Area Court
First of all,
let the prosecutor state the facts in detail
and present the evidence.
Yes.
I'll start with the list of evidence.
Ran.
Don't get upset.
But...

It's not the trial yet, is it?
No,
it's just the procedures.
They're going to present the evidence and decide on a date.
I already told you that.
I know, but...
Ms. Kyoko!
Mrs. Prosecutor? This is Kusakabe.
We've just finished the procedures for the trial.
What evidence did the prosecutor present?
The same as the one he sent us.
Here is the list.
And the trial date?
It has been decided,
and it's as we expected.
Excuse me, I'll leave this with you,
I have to go to the bathroom.
Master Kyoko, the restroom's the other way!
Master Kyoko!
- What's the situation? - That...
the bug I put on Officer Kazami.
Is he around?
Yes, he is.
Keep going...
It's close!
He's not in the court, is he?
Where is he?
That's Master Kyoko's bell.
Ah, Master Kyoko?
I'd like to confirm something with you.
All right, I'll be right over!
Why is Master Kyoko's voice
coming out of Kazami's bug?
Was it by chance next to him?
No, for me to hear it,
they had to be next to each other for a long time.
It's surely not a coincidence.
The investigation of the public security division
revealed that the illegal connection to the site's network
was made via Nor.
"Nor"?
It is an Internet browser
that encrypts the IP address and connects to multiple devices,
and is therefore impossible to trace.
And you can't identify the user?
In principle, it is impossible.
But in case of a bad setting or a bug in the browser Nor,
it may be possible to trace it back.
In other words,
if we exploit a flaw in the culprit's Nor browser
we may be able to find it.
Our division is currently trying to trace back to the network
to see if we can find the identity of the user.
Excuse me.
I'm needed elsewhere.
If you'll excuse me.
Go ahead.
Are you listening to the investigation meeting?
What are you doing here?
When it comes to helping Kogoro Mouri,
you really give it your all.
Unless...
You're doing this for Ran?
You can come out.
Why did you call me?
Mr. Furuya?
You're such a good officer.
My apologies.
Who did this?
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
The microphone...
is it you who put it on me ?
No, I'm rambling.
It is only a child.
Amuro
is the agent of the national police who runs public security
called "Zero".
The only people who have direct contact with him
are a few agents from the public safety division.
Are you one of them, Mr. Kazami?
But who are you exactly?
Conan Edogawa.
Detective.
The man you call "Amuro"
is a murderer.
Last year he drove a suspect in custody to suicide.
Suicide?
I'm sorry, that's not something you tell a child.
I don't know why I felt the need to tell you.
You're a strange boy.
Well, as soon as you get the information about the connection via Nor,
Kogoro Mouri can be...
Excuse me!
There's something going on in town.
What in the world...
Mama! Disaster!
What? What? What?
- What's going on? - Oh my gosh!
Wow, what's all this?
How many times do I have to repeat myself?
Due to the Tokyo summit taking place today,
security measures were taken in Tokyo,
Following unexplained phenomena in Tokyo
but the police have no answers yet
to the phenomena which are taking place one after the other.
The concern of the inhabitants and the participants of the summit
is heard by the Japanese government.
They report computers or kettles exploding.
Panic is spreading...
But what's going on?
I repeat...
What's all this for?
Electrical appliances explode
Electrical appliances?
You can set the temperature, pressure and timer with your smartphone

for cooking soups and other things.
But yes!
This terrorist attack started with the summit hall!
The situation?
The communication center is in full panic.
There are already a hundred explosion sites!
The culprit is not arrested? What's going on?
- Are they terrorists? - Did they warn you?
Sorry Conan, I don't have time to talk to you...
Detective Megure!
I think we're dealing with cyber-terrorism!
Cyberterrorism?
Whoever did this is remotely disabling
a whole bunch of connected devices!
If we disconnect them from the network, we can stop everything!
Cyberterrorism, huh?
Unbelievable, this kid.
The pressure cooker found at the scene of the explosion
must have been connected as well.
Whoever did this connected to the gas line,
released gas throughout the room,
then remotely activated the connected pressure cooker
to blow up the hall!
But then...
Uncle Kogoro couldn't have done it.
Really?
Here, it was from Shinichi, I'll let you handle it!
Conan.
Shinichi is doing his best, right?
To help Dad.
Stupid.
It's not just for your father that I'm doing this.
I see.
If that's true, it will help us win the trial.
Yes, as uncle is arrested by the police,
he doesn't have access to the Internet, right now.
You're wrong.
By setting the date and time in advance,
he could have established the connection even while in custody.
If they trace the network back to the source,
Mr. Mouri's guilt will be proven.
That's not true!
But it's hard to analyze a network, right?
They may not be done until after the trial.
No, it should go quickly. Public Safety is doing it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
How do you know public safety is doing it?
I'm sorry!
The reason I know that, son,
it's because they usually handle things like this.
The public safety division of the police has several collaborators.
Collaborators?
You mean civilians who cooperate with the police?
Yes, they do.
Especially when it comes to
surveillance or inspection of networks,
public security employs many collaborators.
If one of these people joins the investigation,
they will find evidence that Mr. Mouri hacked into the network.
That is, if the evidence exists, of course!
Oh, you can leave that.
- Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.
I'll ask the repair people.
No, really... There's something fishy going on.
I feel like she's hiding something.
As for the incidents that continue to unfold,
the police have raised a strong possibility of cyber-terrorism.
Who would have thought it.
Cyberterrorism, that's crazy.
You can be counted on to come to such an inauspicious conclusion.
It was no thanks to me,
but at least it's not an accident anymore.
So we don't have to resort to illegality anymore.
Send our collaborator back.
Before that,
can you give me all the information collected by "Zero"?
Yes, I can.
NAZU ?
I'll send the information to the cybercrime division
and let the investigation division talk about it at the meeting.
So they can take the credit for us?
It's up to public safety to report it.
That's their reward.
They're the reason the incident is recognized as criminal.
And then...
The chief of investigation is already aware
that the information came from "Zero".
You're scary, Mr. Furuya.
Kazami,
there are two men who are much scarier than I am.
Even if one of them
is still a child.
I was just thinking about that child.
We have just received a report
that there was a hack on Mr. Mouri's computer.
It was used as a proxy.
Were you able to trace it?
No, the access was made from a smartphone that is impossible to trace,
we couldn't get anything.
But when it happened,

Mr. Mouri was in detention. Tokyo detention center
He had no Internet access point.
And access to the Internet of Things for terrorist purposes,
as in the previous incident,
was done via Nor.
So it would be the same culprit?
Where are you in the network analysis?
According to the report of the cybercrime division,
this system belongs to the NAZU domain.
Sorry for just showing up now!
Ms. Kuriyama!
I'm sorry to call you during your vacation.
No problem, I'm your colleague,
I wasn't going to have fun while you were in the middle of a crisis.
Thank you, it's a lifesaver.
Let's see...
This is what I could find out about the lawyer Kyoko Tachibana.
What's this?
It was Shinichi Kudo who asked me, didn't you know?
Shinichi?
Really, Shinichi asked him to do this?
Why did he want information about Master Tachibana?
Hey...
If Shinichi asked him to do this, there must be a reason.
Shouldn't we take a look?
Last year, someone from his firm caused an incident.
What?
Isn't Mrs. Tachibana a freelancer?
Her office closed down last year.
A man named Fumikazu Haba, who was working with her then..,
was apparently arrested
for breaking into a gambling company.
Moreover, after his trial,
Haba committed suicide in his cell.
What? He killed himself?
Suicide...
what do you mean?
We were able to determine
that Kogoro Mouri's computer was controlled by a third party.
It is therefore unlikely that he himself is guilty.
Now..,
you know what to do.
What about his fingerprints found at the scene?
Burnt fingerprints,
it's very easy to transfer.
Is that the conclusion of the police?
Cancel the trial of Kogoro Mouri.
You're even letting the police decide if there should be a trial?
Stop insisting!
What's the matter? Prosecutor Iwai?
Yes.
The burn wasn't too bad, but they decided to hospitalize him instead.
Don't tell me it was cyber-terrorism again?
They checked his smartphone,
and found the same Nor connection as the others...
Excuse me, sir.
Yes, this is Shiratori.
Just one second.
The charges against Mr. Mouri have been dropped!
Mama!
Good news, huh, Ran?
Thank you. I'll be sure to tell Shinichi and Sonoko.
I have to tell Shinichi and Sonoko.
By the way, what should we do about this?
This is the investigation report of the prosecutor who interviewed Fumikazu Haba.
What's this?
But this is the prosecutor Iwai, whose smartphone went haywire.
Last year, she was in charge.
Yes, but now
she's become the general prosecutor and Mr. Kusakabe's superior.
That's right.
Prosecutor Iwai was strangely
promoted after the Fumikazu Haba case.
By the way, what is this?
Why are you asking about me and my former colleague?
Uh...
Sorry, I wanted to know more about you,
so I asked Ms. Kuriyama for the information.
You've done your homework.
You're a good employee too.
"You too"?
You seem to be saying that Mr. Haba was a good employee too.
But this man was a bad employee
who committed a crime and sank your firm, right?
It wasn't Fumikazu's fault!
It was my fault...
I was incompetent.
You called him by his first name.
He was your colleague,
were you close?
You know he committed suicide in prison?
Uh... yes.
He took his own life
after being questioned by a public safety officer.
Immediately afterwards.
Last year, he drove a suspect in custody to suicide.
Why a public safety officer?
This is the first I've heard of this.
The circumstances of his suicide
have a lot of strange elements.
If I am not mistaken, Mr. Fumikazu Haba
was dismissed from his judicial training.

He wanted to become a judge?
Yes, but...
During the graduation ceremony, he...
4 years earlier - Detention Center
On this day, the aspiring magistrates and lawyers...
- are gathered... - Mr. Director!
Mr. Director!
Please explain to me
explain to me why I failed!
Why are you here?
Please tell me...
why I can't become a judge?
- Stop the ceremony! - You can't steal...
my right to become a judge!
No way!
I will never forgive you!
His protests were seen as arrogance towards justice,
which prevented him from becoming a judge.
He could not become a lawyer either,
he lost all reason to live.
Why did you hire him in your firm?
You know, people...
always have two sides.
What you see is only one of them.
I ran into your daughter, she told me everything.
Since Mr. Mouri is going to be released, you don't need me anymore.
Uh, I guess...
On that note, I too...
I have an investigation to complete.
You're going to analyze the perp's Nor?
Yes.
We've asked the NAZU for help.
NAZU? From the United States?
That's right.
Last year, there was an incident
of NAZU hacking with Nor.
Yes, it was Master Kyoko's case.
As a result of that,
NAZU has developed a system that can track Nor's users.
They will let us use it tomorrow.
Today, they have the Hakucho landing mission.
That's the uninhabited satellite, right?
Yes, plus it falls on the day of the summit,
so we're overloaded at the station.
That's right, today is also the summit...
And public safety was in charge at the time of the explosion.
In all honesty,
in public safety, the police are above the prosecutors.
So sometimes, for trials,
the police have, let's say, some influence.
The public safety division of the police has several staff members.
This is Master Kyoko's ringtone.
Why is Master Kyoko's voice...
The man you call "Amuro"
is a murderer.
After his trial,
Haba committed suicide in his cell.
I know this case.
It's the NAZU hack.
Cyberterrorism?
Whoever did this is remotely disabling connected devices!
The police investigation reports
are like a manual with all the details of the crime.
I found something similar.
I feel like I've seen this before.
No, it can't be...
Miss Midori!
Send me all the details of the NAZU case on my smartphone!
It was Shinichi who asked for it!
Ah, Conan!
I'm going to pick up Dad at the police station, are you coming?
And Shinichi doesn't answer, of course!
You knew I was coming?
I had my doubts from that moment on.
- Excuse me - It's nothing.
I gave it to the teacher,
and he found the surveillance app.
There's no icon, obviously.
Do you have any proof that it was us?
None, you guys are good.
But if you had figured it out, why did you leave the app?
Because I'm going to visit the culprit.
What? You know who that is? Do you know who it is?
His motive too.
His target...
was you and your team!
It all started
with the NAZU hacking case.
That was last year...
The Fumikazu Haba incident?
Right
Mr. Haba committed suicide in his cell last year, right?
Yes.
It was exactly one year ago today.
It's been...
exactly one year ago?
Yes, it has. How did I not see it!
His revenge is probably not over yet!
Cyberterrorism again?
Amuro!
Go for it!
Today marks the grand return
of the uninhabited satellite "Hakucho".
Good evening to all!
I'm at the Nagano National Observatory.
Oh dear...
It's late, I'll take you home.
But the Hakucho will land soon!
- Let us watch the show. - Yeah, come on!
No, you'll watch it at home.
You're mean, Haibara...
Yes, what is it?
Ah, the kids are watching it on TV right now.

What, the time he's supposed to land?
Uh, I think it's...
Kudo?
In less than an hour?
There's no time!
Conan! So, the culprit...
Yes, he's planning to hack into the NAZU and crash it!
The question is, where?
Damn it!
I don't believe it...
From space!
Ah, there he is!
Mr. Mouri!
Daddy! Daddy!
Finally you're here!
I'm sorry I worried you, Ran.
I was really scared...
You too, Eri... Sorry about all the work.
Don't be silly!
What a relief, huh Ran?
Sonoko...thank you.
Ah, I have an idea.
I'll send this maudlin scene to our investigative maniac.
- Can I be in it? - Sonoko!
Maybe this will make him react.
Smile!
- What's up? - What's going on?
Somebody turn on the emergency lights!
Inspector!
The emergency generator's been trashed!
What?! What?!
What the hell is going on here?
A message from the NAZU!
The uninhabited satellite has been hacked!
How?
Apparently, they won't be able to detach the capsule!
The body of the satellite
will burn up in the atmosphere,
but they don't know where the capsule will fall,
NAZU's control room
it's panic at NAZU.
I send the last coordinates!
East latitude: 139°45',
8,405".
The landing point, according to the NAZU...
But that's...
Oh, my God!
Conan!
It's just as I feared, he's aiming for...
the police station!
He's going for the police station?
That's crazy!
A four-meter capsule that crashes...
it will do a lot of damage!
Prepare evacuation vehicles immediately.
Evacuate everyone within a mile of the station.
Yes, sir!
- Hurry up! - What about the evacuation map?
There's no time!
Daddy, please...
Don't worry, I'm here.
Eri, you too...
Stay close to me.
I will.
Amazing!
The capsule, once separated from the rest,
will fall like a meteorite.
In a very short time, it will enter the atmosphere..,
...and we won't be able to control anything!
In the area around the police station
are the ministries, hotels and parks.
A rough calculation estimates the population
Cabinet Office Emergency Room
to about 150,000 inhabitants.
We have compiled a list of
of places and evacuation routes suitable for this number of inhabitants.
Prime Minister!
NAZU informs us that they cannot rewrite the memory!
What?
The signal sent from the station to the satellite
must be coded in a certain way.
If the code is wrong,
the memory can't be rewritten.
Does that mean the culprit changed the code?
Yes.
Probably when he infiltrated the network,
when he changed the trajectory.
We have to force him to give us the code!
For that, I'll need a collaborator.
I need the teacher who invented this wonder.
What are you going to do?
I will bring a dead man back to life.
Now he's impressing me.
To think of such a plan...
I hope he can get the code out of her.
I've managed to increase the speed even more.
Professor, the picture moves too much!
That's not right at all.
This is the first time I've flown it at night...
I want to fly the drone at night too!
Share a little, professor, it's not fair!
What are you...
They don't show the Hakucho on TV, for one thing!
That's right.
Can you handle it?
With the teacher, I don't feel safe.
- Great! - We'll have fun!
Thanks for your confidence.
Let's let the kids deal with this
and continue with the preparations.
We are...
The team...
piloting the drone!
Let's get started!
By now,
about 30,000 people will be evacuated from Tokyo Bay,
at the Edge of Ocean Station.
- Where is it again? - I don't know!
Excuse me, sir,
that's where the summit was supposed to take place, right?
Yes, it is.

We will evacuate to the casino tower.
The casino tower?
That's it!
Oh yes, I should warn Shinichi.
The NAZU keeps sending the code,
but they still can't connect.
Damn it!
We have to get the code quickly!
This is the data visible from the NAZU station, right?
Mr. Terrorist.
I wasn't expecting you, Prosecutor Kusakabe.
What do you want from me?
I should have realized it earlier.
When I saw the evidence you presented to us.
Those pieces of glass came from the device
that caused the explosion, but only the perpetrator knew that.
When you presented that as evidence,
we still believed...
that it was a cable that caused the explosion.
Right on cue.
Here's the info
on the NAZU hacking case last year,
which you were in charge of.
I see...
The modus operandi was a connection via Nor.
You followed the same modus operandi
for your cyber-terrorist attacks.
But you made a mistake.
NAZU had developed a system to find the user.
When you found out about it,
you used a buggy version of Nor
to make it look like a cyber attack
and blow up your boss' smartphone.
And all this, to get the police to focus on that bait.
That's why the timing of this attack was weird.
Don't touch my stuff!
Stop it! Stop it!
We'll find traces of Nor's access on his smartphone!
What a pain in the ass!
Not so fast!
Damn, it did not stop him!
No problem!
Take this!
Prosecutor Kusakabe.
Did you really do all this
to cause harm to public safety?
After the explosion at the summit hall,
and the fall of an American satellite on Tokyo,
the reputation of the public security police would have been ruined!
Why do you hate her so much?
As long as you have so much power,
we prosecutors won't be able to enforce justice!
You don't mind killing people, as long as it's for justice?
I had no intention of killing civilians.
I caused the explosion when there were only policemen,
I only targeted low-risk devices,
and I chose the perfect place for the capsule to fall!
You caused the power failure
so that the civilians would evacuate the building?
Yes.
Now I understand.
The cyber-terrorist attacks on the way here
were to keep the civilians away.
But even so, there could very well have been casualties!
For the sake of justice, sacrifices are necessary!
That's not justice!
Me too...
My collaborator
has been sacrificed!
Mr. Haba?
I knew it, he was working with you.
How do you know that?
From your PIN number.
It was unusual, so I was intrigued.
You left the sound on so you'd never forget that code.
88231: Ha-ba-fu-mi-kazu.
No...
It was to engrave in me my desire for revenge!
The public safety employees
are all known to Zero
and called by a number.
But between detectives,
no information is passed on.
Until last year I didn't even know that the public prosecutors also
had collaborators!
Is that why you got rid of him then?
I see, so that wasn't all.
The incident caused by Mr. Haba was a cover-up.
It was...
I was the one who asked him.
It was to solve the investigation of the NAZU hacking.
Haba had discovered
that the hacking was coming from a gaming company,
and he was trying to steal the data, when...
Tokyo Detention Center
Our employees
are forced to conduct dangerous and illegal investigations.
And that's why
we form bonds even stronger than family.
It's more than just money!
United by our sense of duty, we were one.
You should have told the investigators that you were working with me!
That was my mistake.

I couldn't make you lose your job because of me.
Don't worry about that, you need to think about yourself!
I know better than anyone what it feels like
to be deprived of your social status.
I beg you, think about your own life!
My life doesn't matter to me
compared to the lives of thousands of Japanese people.
These are your words,
and I share this way of thinking.
Prosecutors' Office
I confessed everything about my collaboration with him
to the prosecutor in charge.
Haba is my collaborator.
He only followed my orders.
- He will still be prosecuted. - I'm sorry, what?
Don't tell me
that it's the police again...
Don't worry about it.
I'll see to it that the trial is conducted
without your name appearing.
That's not the point at all!
After that, as I was going to the police station to try
to negotiate with the police...
Yes ?
Haba took his own life.
What did he do?
We don't know why,
but it happened after he was questioned by the police.
Haba was driven to suicide...
No, he was killed by the public security police!
Is that why you came up with your plan?
Yes.
I got the idea as soon as I heard that Hakucho was coming back the day he died.
What about cyberterrorism?
That wasn't originally planned, but...
as a prosecutor,
I couldn't let an innocent man be incriminated.
So to prove Kogoro Mouri's innocence
you provoked this?
Yes, I did.
But I acted hastily.
There was more damage than I expected.
Don't add more crimes to your list!
Give us the satellite access code.
Public safety prosecutors preserve justice.
I will not let haba's justice be forgotten!
Give us the code!
Just arrest me!
I won't say a word, I guarantee it.
Prosecutor Kusakabe.
Mr. Kusakabe.
No, it can't be.
How can Haba...
This is a live feed from the police station helipad.
I don't understand.
When we interviewed him at the detention center.
they made it look like he committed suicide
and he gave up the life he was leading until then.
And that was to keep the fact that he was working with a prosecutor a secret.
And then...
so that this kind of collaboration would not happen anymore,
it was kept from you, too.
If you choose to act illegally, you have to take the consequences.
And you don't have the power to do that.
That is the conclusion the police drew.
Mr. Haba
had such a strong sense of justice that he was convinced
that he was cut out to be a judge.
But that's why he was denied the job.
he was denied the job,
and that's why he turned to you for help.
That's right.
Mr. Kusakabe rescued me from a life of despair.
He only knew me for two years,
but he told me
that it was because of me that he could fight for justice.
It is because of this that I too can continue to fight.
Mr. Kusakabe.
Please give them the code.
If he crashes there,
Haba won't get away with it!
You cowards!
Is this the way of the police?
The Hakucho is about to enter the atmosphere!
We still don't have the code?
If we don't get it soon, we can't change anything!
Mr. Furuya, there's no time!
Hurry up with the code!
Mr. Prosecutor, please hurry!
But, sir...
Mr. Kusakabe.
Is this your justice? What I believed in?
The code I modified
by hacking into NAZU...
What's that? A blackout?
Yes.
It will only last for five minutes while it enters the atmosphere!
During that time, the plasma emission
will block all communications.
They don't know if they will be able to establish the connection properly.
And on top of that,
the parachute may not open.
Oh, my God!
Haba...
Get haba out of there, now!
Prosecutor Kusakabe!
Did Shinichi answer you at last?
No, nothing yet.
I left him a voice mail.
What the hell is he doing?
As for Conan, his phone must be turned off.

Knowing the kid, there is no need to worry about him.
Still...
this tower is really high.
Come on, let's hurry. Come on, this way.
Haba! Where are you?
What's the meaning of this?
He is not here.
But on the phone... I saw him...
What you saw was a computer generated image.
The images filmed by a drone
have been altered to make it look like he's here.
He is somewhere else, perfectly safe.
Oh, well...
Amuro.
If they could not change its trajectory,
the drop point...
Yes, this four-meter capsule
is going to crash here at a speed of over 10 kilometers per hour.
Can you get some explosives
get some explosives up here as soon as possible?
You want to try to destroy an armored capsule?
No.
I just need enough explosives to send it to the ocean.
You really do have some unbelievable ideas.
Do you have a better one?
Kazami, hurry up.
Yes.
It's time for an illegal job like we do.
Of all the explosives we've confiscated,
this is the most powerful.
And no one will know?
We're supposed to get rid of it soon,
we'll just have to change the register.
Perfect, I count on you.
Everything is good for us.
I'm sending you
...the trajectory data for the capsule.
Okay, kids..,
...it's time for liftoff!
- All right! - Aye, aye, sir!
It's very kind of you to ask me to calculate where to blow it up.
What a slave driver he is!
Mitsuhiko, Ayumi,
Genta...
and you, Ai...
it's up to you to protect our country!
Oh, the drone is pitching a bit, isn't it?
The professor's package is too heavy!
Let's drop it somewhere.
No, no!
This package is a very precious treasure for me!
I managed to reduce the margin of error to ten meters.
I'm sending you the drone footage,
so adjust the timing yourself.
I will, thank you.
But we're not going to get scolded?
Are we allowed to film the Hakucho's capsule from this close?
Yes, don't worry, we have permission from the police.
Well, the public security office.
What?
The parachute won't open?
The heat shield seems to be locked.
Prime Minister, we must destroy it!
No, wait!
What the...
Firing on it at this altitude
could cause even more damage.
It has passed 30,000 meters.
Yes.
Okay, sir.
Don't miss.
I won't.
Amuro.
Is the timing okay?
Yes.
We're getting closer to the capsule!
I'm counting on you...
...guys.
We're gonna hit it if we keep going.
No, we won't!
I've equipped my drone with a system that makes it
that it automatically avoids objects that are too close.
You know, if we don't get close enough,
if we don't get close enough, we won't see the capsule fly.
I want to see!
Mitsuhiko, go ahead!
I'll do it!
Kudo...
Be careful.
There she is!
Go on, go!
The chute...
...has opened!
Did it?
It's not showing anything, all of a sudden.
We didn't hit it, did we?
It automatically avoids objects, right?
Right? Uh, maybe it's...
that it has no battery?
This system, it doesn't exist, especially...
Looks like it worked.
What a surprise!
You all...
Who are you?
Let's just say we're collaborators
of a certain little detective.
Yeah, got it.
That worked.
Whew!
Mr. Furuya.
We'll take him to the station.
Yes, sir.
Hold it!
Mr. Kusakabe.
You and I,
even now, are one and the same.
Yes.
Well, follow us.
Fumikazu!
Kyoko!
Fumikazu...
I can't believe you're alive...
Really...
You're scary.
Were you a collaborator too?
And what's more, a...
a public security prosecutor!
Master Kyoko.
You're a collaborator too.
Of Officer Kazami.
You know everything, right?
You know why I hired Fumikazu.
He'd been dismissed from his magistrate's training
and the public security police were keeping an eye on him as a potential danger.

4 years ago - Tachibana Law Firm
I then received
to hire him,
so I could keep a close eye on him.
But by working with Fumikazu,
I ended up feeling very close to him.
It was the same for me.
That's why...
I'm really sorry that things ended like this.
To think that you too were a collaborator...
It all started
with the NAZU hacking case, right?
Yes.
Public Security told me to make the suspect guilty,
and I was investigating for that purpose.
It was then that
Fumikazu was arrested at the company where the suspect worked.
I couldn't understand why
why he did it.
I wanted to help him,
and I begged public security...
But they told me he killed himself.
I blamed the police.
I closed my practice,
and I waited for an opportunity to get even.
And that's when...
you were ordered to defend uncle Kogoro
and to prove his innocence.
Yes.
I don't know why the police wanted to clear him,
but I had the intention to do the opposite.
Even if I had to implicate innocent people?
I had no choice!
I couldn't know
that he was still alive under police protection.
If I had known that,
I would have never...
Fumikazu...
is working for you now, isn't he?
Yes.
What's his number?
His number?
At the public security,
you call us by numbers behind our backs, I know that.
Mine is 2291.
So what's hers?
Kyoko Tachibana
I'm releasing you from your duties as an employee of the police.
Any objections, Kazami?
If you act illegally, you have to take the consequences.
Isn't that right?
Haba is here.
You are free to go.
If you want to join him, we won't stop you...
Who do you think you are?
Becoming your collaborator was my decision.
To betray you, it was my decision!
And it is also me who chose to love him!
I forbid you to think
that you had control over my whole life!
Farewell.
Kyoko...
Even if she hates you,
protect her until the end.
That's the duty...
of public safety, I know.
Thanks to you,
we stopped a terrorist who was threatening the whole of Japan.
When did you think of terrorism?
It's like you guessed.
On that day,
during the inspection of the conference hall,
I saw that the gas pipes were connected to the Internet.
There was a risk that a terrorist could cause an explosion,
so I was about to give orders, when...
But under the circumstances,
the case was in danger of being classified as an accident.
That's why you made a suspect.
We wanted this suspect to be transferred as soon as possible
under the authority of the prosecutors we could control.
So you sent us Kyoko as your lawyer,
and once the accident was ruled out,
you had uncle Kogoro released.
I'm really impressed with you.
You've solved all the riddles.
No, there is still a mystery to solve.
- It's about... - Your phone.
It's been blinking for a while.
Ah, Shinichi?
We've been evacuated to the Edge of Ocean Casino Tower.
Call me when you get this message.
What's up? The capsule has what?
An explosion of unknown origin
sent it hurtling into an area of Tokyo Bay!
This is the area where
where 300,000 people have been evacuated!
We can't intercept it anymore!
- Slow down, don't push! - We have time!
Keep calm, please!
As for the outward journey, the bus will be able to carry everyone.
Inspector!
The news has spread
and civilian cars are coming here!
What?
The bridge is totally blocked in both directions!
It doesn't look good...
People are panicking!
Shinichi...
No, I can't do anything,
I can't reach Ran!
What should we do now? There's not much time left.
Amuro,

this time, you will be my collaborator.
There is a traffic jam in front.
The evacuation of the civilians is not going well?
There's the casino tower.
Mr. Furuya!
The pod has released its parachute and is accelerating!
What happened?
The NAZU has calculated the estimated drop point!
In five minutes, it'll fall right into the Casino Tower!
- I'm sending the data now! - Ran!
Damn it! What should I do?
I have an idea...
Amuro!
Hold on tight!
What are you doing, Amuro?
There!
I saw my life flash by, there...
Still... it is impressive.
Well, what now?
Just a moment.
Go to this building under construction.
All right, okay.
You three, stay close to me.
The situation is getting serious...
Will we make it in time?
Given our height
and the distance to the tower...
If we speed up in the next minute...
It's make or break.
Please, please...
Please let me get there in time!
Ran!
What's that?
The power of love is something.
I've been wondering about this for a while,
But do you have a girlfriend?
I do,
I am in love...
of my country!
Let's go, Amuro!
You will be able to move it, even of a millimeter?
I intend to!
Five, four,
three, two, one...
Zero!
Damn, we're not high enough!
Never mind!
Come on!
Ran!
Daddy! Daddy!
Ran...
I'll take care of the rest here.
You'd better go.
There's still a mystery to solve.
Why did you have to involve Uncle Kogoro?
In my position..,
I can't investigate on a large scale.
Involving him in this case
gave me the guarantee that you would collaborate with us.
This way,
I could borrow you at your best.
You're overestimating me.
There's only ever
Only one truth
But justice, it
Is counted in tears...
I lost my way in the darkness
Clutching the sword of good and evil
Wielding this sword
I pierced myself with it
For there is also in me
A part of good and evil
A part of error
And a double who wants to deceive me...
The justice that I draw
And the ideal that I write
Frighten you from now on
And make you sad
Not to hurt anyone
Prevent others from hurting
And protect you, all that
I realized that it was impossible
The "perfect justice" and everything else
Go back to "zero".
When you wander off into the darkness
Glad to know you're okay!  Thanks for letting me know! Shinichi
And that you no longer trust yourself
What will enter your frightened heart
Words as lights
Are found everywhere in the world
In great quantities
But some lights will fool you too...
I want to protect you
To protect your smile, despite everything
Even if for that I have to sometimes
To become bad
If in the name of love
Someone uses the chain of love
To imprison your heart
And ends up making it bleed
I will wield this sword
To slice that love
I want to protect you
To protect this tomorrow, despite everything
Even if I have to become
To become evil
Even if in the name of love
Anyone can go astray
There is always only one truth
But justice
Is not unique
But infinite
It is not from "zero".
That's why I look for
The possibility of a "zero"...
According to a detailed police report,
it was a crime that influenced a former prosecutor to commit a terrorist act.
About the suspect, Makoto Kusakabe, the police...
They did not reveal his real motive.
Probably the decision of public security.
In the capsule of the Hakucho,
which landed safely, were recovered
substances that exist only on Mars.
This is a huge step forward in unlocking the mysteries of space.
Wow!
I would have preferred to see this with the drone.
That's because of the teacher's package!
The children do not suspect that it is thanks to them that the capsule
...that the capsule was recovered.
Yes.
Or that they saved Japan from a crisis.
They are really great.

Come on, we'll explore Mars with the teacher's drone too!
- Good idea ! - Let's go!
Professor, make a new one!
A bigger one this time!
Okay, I'll try!
I'll give it a try!
I can't wait until we get to Mars!
No, I'm not exaggerating.

I'll meet you on the ship
on the floating ship in the starry sky.
Launching in Japan in May 2019!
