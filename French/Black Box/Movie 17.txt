What? But this is...
It's terrible!
This is Officer Kurata at Wakasa Coast Guard Headquarters! Emergency!
Possible explosives on board a ship in Area 4, near the rock...
For further news:
A suspicious vessel was discovered in Maizuru Bay,
Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF)
loaded with material coming from abroad...
Isn't this Maizuru Bay?
Yes, it is.
- Did something happen? - What do they say?
They found a suspicious ship near the coast this morning.
What does that mean, suspicious?
Hey, kids!
You're blocking the line, move when we move!
Yes, yes, yes, yes...
Hey, Dad!
You're the responsible adult here, watch the kids!
Give me a break.
You're the one who forced me to come here to get a chaperone.
Come on, this is a rare opportunity to visit an Aegis destroyer!
I had a one in ten chance of winning those tickets.
Too bad you didn't play the horse races instead!
Good old uncle, he's always the same wherever we go.
Speaking of which... What is a destroyer Aegis?
Well...
Me, I know!
It is a warship equipped
the naval weapons system developed by the United States!
It's a pretty big ship, huh?
Yes !
That's a very light explanation...
Are you interested in this too, Ayumi?
No, but I like the sea,
and it would be silly not to go.
That's right!
Not everyone has the opportunity to do this.
- A transmission? - So forget about the shopping, dad!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Conan?
I have to go to the little boy's room.
Make it quick, okay?
It's almost our turn.
All right!
What is it, Professor?
I just wanted to see if my satellite phone was working.
We're not even on the boat yet!
Not yet? Well, it's taking them a while...
Yes.
They're probably more vigilant because of the alert this morning.
Ah, no doubt...
You went to a lot of trouble to create this phone,
but I'd better not use it here.
By the way, how was your conference in Osaka?
Very well, especially because Ai helped me a lot.
It was a great success.
That's good.
Let's meet after the military demonstration, then.
- I have to get back in line. - By the way...
The kids must be getting bored of waiting in line, right?
No, I'm fine.
Well, okay, I'll give you a quiz!
Is that why you call me, actually?
You know that the name "Aegis"
comes from Greek mythology?
It's the English name for the Aegis shield that repels evil
and which was entrusted by Zeus to his daughter, Athena.
The god Zeus, during his fight against the Hydra,
was bitten all over his body by its sharp fangs.
But only one part of his body was spared.
Which one was it?
Answer 1: the neck.
Answer 2: the torso.
Answer 3: the belly.
Answer 4: the hips.
Those are the four choices.
The teacher insisted that I ask you his quiz.
But tell me,
when did you talk to the teacher?
He called while I was in the bathroom.
Hey, Conan, I can't find it.
- I'm giving my tongue to the cat. - What is it, then?
It's answer number four: the hips.
Why?
"God's hip" is pronounced as "no bite".
Kami no koshi = Kami nokoshi
Another pun, seriously?
Next people, please get your tickets ready and step forward.
Ah, it's ours!
Finally!
It's about time!
Hey, don't run!
Japan Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF)
Please open your bags so that you can see inside
and place them in front of the staff.
Cell phones are not allowed inside,
so please leave them here.
Aegis Destroyer "The Hotaka
Hello and thank you all for attending this public military demonstration.
My name is Inoue and I will be your guide today.
Fumitada Inoue Lieutenant Commander of the Hotaka
Nice to meet you.

First, let's look at the exercises that will be done today.
Please look at the screen.
The areas you see in red
can be explored freely.
All other areas are off limits.
You can see this in more detail in the paper guides.
Then, as far as the schedule is concerned...
Sonoko... what time is it?
- Uh, I'm looking... - Don't you have your watch, Ran?
It was broken so it's being repaired.
I was using the clock on my cell phone while I was waiting, but...
They took it away from us.
Use my watch, if you want.
Don't you need it, Mitsuhiko?
I've got the time on my camera, so it's OK!
Well, if he offers it to you...
I'll take it then, thanks, Mitsuhiko.
You're welcome!
It's water resistant, so the sea air won't do anything to it.
And it's radio-controlled, so it's very accurate!
What's radio controlled?
Don't you know that?
She receives several times a day
a radio signal that tells the time.
Wow!
By the way, it is set at 5 o'clock in the morning and in the evening.
Where are the signals sent from?
Uh, that...
Around here, it's probably from the Fukushima transmitter.
Is it?
I'm amazed that you know that, Conan!
Well, it was Shinichi who...
What?
What's that sinister sound?
What is it? What's going on?
Calm down, everything's fine.
That's the sound the drainage pump makes
when it sucks in a large quantity of sea water.
- Dad, you're embarrassing me... - Sit back down, please.
And by the way...
I think the "pump" in your mouth is leaking, be careful.
Oh, sorry, sorry!
Daddy! Daddy! Please, sit down!
Oh là là...
But it was a bit of a strange noise for a pump...
DETECTIVE CONAN - A PRIVATE DETECTIVE IN THE DISTANT SEA
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug,
and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name...
I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
In order to find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
Let me introduce my current classmates:
Genta,
Mitsuhiko
and Ayumi.
They formed the Junior Detectives
and made me join them against my will.
Anyway...
That old man is Kogoro Mouri.
I don't need to draw you a picture.
These two gadgets were invented by Professor Agasa.
The professor helps me since I shrank
by creating all kinds of original inventions.
The balloon belt.
By pressing the buckle,
this great invention inflates and pops a balloon.
And this time we will see
this recently improved watch.
It is a satellite phone and a USB stick.
In short, a great invention even better than before!
By the way,
there is someone else again
who knows my identity.
Ai Haibara.
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She used to work with the men in black,
but to escape from the organization,
she swallowed the same drug as me
and also became younger.
So, with Haibara who lives with the teacher since then,
we live like elementary school children.
My body has become younger, but not my mind!
I will solve all the mysteries!
There is always only one truth!
Ready for the anti-aircraft drill!
Everything is functional.
The ship will engage in anti-aircraft combat.
All crew members to their posts.
People with children
- are requested to come closer... - The public demonstration is about to begin.
- Step forward this way. - Watch the sky!
This is the heart of the ship: the command post.
Target n°1 in sight!
Are we under attack?

It's a staging.
Is it?
Oh right, they scared me.
They're keeping their cool.
Yeah, they're not acting very well.
This isn't a movie.
Target #2 is coming right at us.
Target #2 confirmed hostile.
Prepare for combat!
Firing exercise, target designated by command post.
Commence attack!
Gun loaded!
Mark 45 mod 4, ready to fire.
Target no. 2 in sight.
Target is in range.
Ready to fire!
Firing procedure started.
Fire!
Thirty seconds to impact!
What, we're only gonna see it on the screen?
Come on, Dad.
It's a lot, you know.
This is the most secret room of an Aegis destroyer.
You're the first civilians to visit one.
Ah, yes... it's very "top secret atmosphere"!
Target n°2 sunk.
It looks like a video game!
Do you think we could do it too?
Of course not.
- Are you sure? It looks easy... - You're not going to do it too!
Ready to fire!
Fire!
Automatic mode. Target intercepted!
Target #1 is losing altitude!
One to two seconds to impact.
Target one sunk.
Did they hit it now?
Yes, all the targets were sunk.
That was impressive!
Yes.
- Is it over already? - I didn't get it all...
- Well, that's it for... - Object detected, nationality unknown!
Target alpha, search in progress.
It's heading right for us!
Alpha target, direction: 50°. Range: 8000 meters.
This is the PC!
Alpha target detected, direction: 50°, distance: 8000 m.
Target "alpha"?
- Commander... - Yes, sir.
This is Captain Tateishi.
Yukio Tateishi, Captain of the Hotaka.
Start a search on your scanners.
I'm on my way to the operating room.
I'll go with you.
I'm going to the scene.
I'll leave my XO in charge of the bridge.
Target alpha, direction unchanged.
It's heading right for us!
Acknowledged. Prepare for any change in direction.
Stand by for attack.
I confirm it is not a living organism.
No response to friend or foe identification.
This is an unalloyed submarine!
Engage the Nixie and stop the vessel!
Full speed, 90 degrees to port.
Move into position to face the target!
Roger!
Full speed, port side!
Turning 90 degrees!
Did we really stop?
Their acting's gotten a little better, hasn't it?
Yes, it looks like it.
Send a warning signal!
Roger, sending signal.
Signal light, fire!
Visual on the third monitor.
- Wow! - This is so cool!
Yes !
That's awesome! You think that light is real?
No, it's not!
Prepare for underwater battle.
Red alert.
Aye, sir!
It might get a little rough...
Ask for confirmation of the data from the Ichigaya HQ and the others nearby.
Is something going on?
Is it part of the exercise?
Of course it is!
It's finally getting interesting.
No, if it is...
The resonance is getting blurred.
- What is the situation? - The image is not sharp enough.
Impossible to detect it.
Stop the SPY radar.
Confirm its position with the SH-60K.
The target is getting closer!
Get the SH-60K ready!
- Range: 3,200 meters. - Coming into torpedo range!
What's the matter, sir?
Any response from the target?
No, sir.
Still closing in.
Range: 3100 meters!
Only 100 meters to go before it comes into range.
Commander,
what are your orders?
Prepare to fire.
Wait, Commander!
That would be a declaration of war!
Target at 3,000 meters, speed 10.
We're in firing range!
Maintain 3,000 meters.
Start the engines, full speed!
Aye, sir! Start engines, full speed!
We're moving away!
Hard to starboard, full speed!
Isn't this exciting?
Finally, it's better than a video game!
But it's a bit scary...
No wonder they're scared.

This destroyer is about to attack for real!
No reaction from the target. Approaching 40 degrees left!
I want to see it, launch a scout torpedo.
Prepare the torpedoes!
Turning 20 degrees to port!
Anti-submarine missile ready.
Command post on deck: 20° to port, full speed!
Full speed to port!
Port side!
This is the left torpedo launcher.
Anti-submarine missile loaded!
Fire!
Anti-submarine missile, fire!
We'll soon have a visual
on the third monitor.
Shockwave coming in!
It's gonna be a bumpy ride,
so don't take your eyes off your kids!
Is everyone okay?
Yes.
That was a hell of a shake!
Yes, it was great!
This boy... is he alone?
What's that?
A submarine?
No, it's something else.
A fishing boat? Or a wreck?
What...
No explosives on board.
It's a wreck that was washed up by the tide.
Deactivate the anti-submarine weapons.
Deactivate the weapons!
We are returning to the exercise area.
Repeat:
We are returning to the exercise area.
Calling all JMSDF members...
Are we done?
Yes.
I declare the anti-aircraft combat exercises over!
That was so cool!
Yes, I thought we were fighting for real!
I even forgot my hunger!
They will have suspected nothing until the end...
Well, you can explore freely now.
Yeah!
The JMSDF is so cool!
I would love to try on their uniforms.
- It's awesome! - Come on Conan, hurry up!
That's a big Aegis destroyer!
How big do you think it is?
That's where they were filming what we saw on the screen from, it looks like.
Come take a picture with us, Conan!
All right, let's do it.
Come on, this way!
Yuuki, let's go.
- Hold my hand, Yuuki. - That boy is...
Yes.
Hey!
Your name is Yuuki, right?
Yes.
Did you find your father? Good for you!
What are you talking about, boy?
You weren't there when the boat was rocking earlier.
I was a little worried.
Ah, that must have been when I was in the bathroom.
Oh, okay, now I understand!
That's why you were all alone.
Shall we go see the other side, Yuuki?
Yes, let's.
Even if he was telling the truth,
he should have felt that tremor.
But he still hadn't returned by the end of the demonstration,
he didn't show up again until we were exploring the bridge.
This is suspicious.
Hey, there! Don't start wandering around!
You always disappear as soon as our back is turned.
Excuse me...
A woman from the JMSDF is on board the destroyer?
Hey, are you listening to what we're saying?
Wow, that's cool!
A woman from the Self Defense Force!
What?
That's rare, let's ask her to be with us in the picture!
That's right!
- How lucky! - Come on, a photo!
Please, ma'am!
Can we take a picture with you?
A picture?
Nanami Fujii Ship's Captain
What a beauty!
A detective and a beautiful JMSDF woman... sounds great!
Miss!
Sorry for the rudeness of these children
to a worthy member of the JMSDF.
Dad, that's enough!
Don't mind me, I was just about to ask her for a picture.
You don't have to stick it on so much!
Mitsuhiko, lend me your camera.
- Uh, sure. - Thank you, Mitsuhiko.
Come on, look over here!
No, no pictures!
What, we're allowed, right? Look at the others!
- With us, now! - All right.
- Is that any way to greet? - Let's go there!
Yeah, I guess...
Great!
I'm going next door!
- I want to be next to you too... - Wait for me!
Don't you want to be on top, Conan?
No, I'm okay, but come a little closer, Ran.
Okay, I'll get it.
Come on, I'll take it!
Damn, sorry.
Let's do it again!
Do you even know how to do that?
Yes, but I think it was set wrong.
There, it's perfect.
Are you ready?
Say "Aegis"!
Yeah!

So, is it in the box?
Yes, it's clean this time.
Show it to me!
Thank you very much.
It's nothing. On that note, I'll go...
Hey, JMSDF lady!
Yes ?
What kind of work do you do on this boat?
What do I do?
I prepare meals.
She's lying.
She wears the insignia of a starship captain.
On an Aegis destroyer, that's the rank of commander.
Excuse me, sir.
I have to go. I have work to do.
Thanks again, sir.
At least take my business card!
- This damn vest prevents me from... - Sorry, just ignore him, please.
What's with the flashy card?
Nice going, kid!
Hold on, beautiful lady!
What a shame, I swear...
Excuse me, Sonoko, could you hold these for me?
Wow, the bad taste!
He wanted to be noticed at every crime scene,
so he had them redone.
But I don't think he's doing it right...
Mitsuhiko.
Can you play back your camera?
Sure, sure, sure. Here you go.
- Give these cards to Ran. - Well, okay...
I'm going to the bathroom.
- Huh? - Conan?
What does he want to take a picture of on the toilet?
By the way, Ai...
What?
You think the kids liked my little quiz?
As long as the answer wasn't "hips"...
Yes, hello?
Teacher, I have something for you to check.
Oh, it's you, Shinichi.
Yes. Did you send the picture to Ai's phone?
Yes. I'll look at it right away.
But tell me, did something happen?
No, just something that intrigues me.
Did you get the photo?
Yes, we did get it.
It's a picture of a woman from the JMSDF...
Is that all?
Yes. Can you find out what division she's in?
There are only 4% women in the Maritime Self-Defense Force,
and they're often brought out for publicity,
so you should find out.
Yeah, I got it.
It shouldn't be complicated, then.
By the way, about my quiz...
He hung up.
Too bad for you.
Satellite waves?
Where on the bridge?
In the area to the right.
That's where the civilians are.
- Do a search. - I'm on it.
This is the operating room...
Commander!
Do you think that X is among the civilians on board?
Could it be that the wreckage we encountered earlier...
is related to X?
X...
This radar is like the eye of an Aegis destroyer.
It doesn't look like it,
but it can detect objects over 450 km,
and track up to 200 targets at a time!
Wow!
It's like a sea detective!
So cool!
This place...
is where I contacted the professor from.
Did they detect my satellite call?
Or maybe...
The Aegis system
is provided only to countries in which the United States has confidence.
- Okay, got it. - Japan was the first...
- We'd better report it. - to receive this system.
You go ahead, I'll check the bridge.
All right, now I'm going to tell you
about the helicopter on board, the SH-60K.
- So cool, a helicopter! - Awesome!
What's up, Conan?
Uh... I'm going to the bathroom.
What? Again?
Just a minute, Conan.
I'll walk you out.
- Huh? I don't need... - Don't argue.
If I take my eyes off you, you disappear.
I don't believe it!
It happened just a little earlier!
Come on.
Shall we go?
Yes...
Even I almost got lost on the way to the bathroom earlier.
- It's a big boat... - You still get lost at your age?
It's true that she has a bad sense of direction.
Well then? How far did you get to buy this?
Sorry, I forgot how to get back.
That's why I suggested we go together.
I know, but...
You don't go alone anymore, okay?
Otherwise you'll spend the night in the park.
I'm not worried.
Even if I get lost,
you'll find me, right?
Are you a great detective or not?
It's cold! Ah!
What's wrong with you?
Don't worry about it.
Wherever you go,
I will always find you.
Yes, always.
What was that?
Wasn't that the way to the bathroom?
Sorry, Conan, I think we're lost.

You're kidding me, don't tell me you really got lost?
What was that scream?
Conan!
Mr. Sawamura!
We sucked in a terrible thing!
A terrible thing?
Hey, but it's...
- Hey, what are you doing here? - No! This is...
a human arm?
What a drama...
What should we do?
First of all, go tell the captain.
Yes.
Ran, we should tell Uncle Kogoro about this.
I guess so.
Excuse me, sir.
Maybe my father could help you.
That's a human arm on that table, right?
Well...
My father is Kogoro Mouri.
Don't you know who he is?
The famous detective, Kogoro the Sleeping...
Kaiho High School
What's up, Kudo?
What's up? A corpse?
They found a corpse on a destroyer?
No, just a left arm.
But...
The arm was wearing the uniform of the Maritime Self-Defense Force.
So a member of the JMSDF was killed?
Maybe it was an accident, I don't know yet.
But in any case, it was a lieutenant.
It's not right.
Yes, I understand.
I'll be right there, call me back.
I've got you!
Club activities have started, you know?
It's not the right time!
- I'm going to Maizuru. - What's that?
To Maizuru? Wait, Heiji!
No one is there.
No sign of a satellite communication device.
- So they heard my call. - Keep searching!
- Maybe X is hiding in the corner. - Good!
"X" ?
Damn it!
I heard a noise!
Shinichi hung up on me.
Something must have happened.
No match
Just when we wanted to tell him what we found...
- We must have imagined it. - Yes, we did.
All clear.
We continue our search.
That was a close one!
Not surprisingly, they're on the lookout for an Aegis destroyer.
Well, I'd better find...
to find another way to communicate...
They'll know if I use their phones.
This symbol...
It indicates the presence of a strong magnetic field.
Just what I need.
I'm Captain Tateishi.
Mr. Mouri, I presume?
It's me, the great detective Kogoro Mouri.
Lieutenant Sekiguchi gave me the facts.
Makoto Sekiguchi Lt. Military Police of Wakasa
I am Sekiguchi, military police.
So you are the JMSDF police?
Yes, I am.
I see.
And this, I assume, is the member in question?
Yes. I'll let you take a look.
Well, it doesn't look like it was sliced with a blade.
Also, the cut does not appear to have any vital signs.
So the injury was postmortem?
Yes. Where did you find this arm?
In the filter of the drainage pump.
If I remember correctly, the pump...
That's the sound the drainage pump makes
when it sucks in a large quantity of sea water.
That's what caused the noise!
When we leave the bay of Maizuru,
the pump sometimes sucks up big debris carried by the current.
The arm must have ended up in the filter at that moment.
And this filter, it is...
It is a kind of net
that you put in the pump to prevent debris or fish from being sucked in
from being sucked into the boat with the sea water.
What about this arm?
When the filter gets clogged with debris,
we sometimes remove it for inspection.
Usually we remove algae or plastic, but here...
By the way, do you know who this arm might belong to?
You have an idea, right?
Well, Commander Tateishi?
From the insignia on his sleeve and his watch,
I think it's Lieutenant Sasaura from the Wakasa base.
We called the base,
and they don't know where the lieutenant is.
In this case, there is no doubt.
His watch stopped at 5:30 in the morning.
How do you know it's not 5:00?
You can tell by the display of the day's date.
When you still see the previous day's date,
it shows the time of the morning.
Was Lieutenant Sasaura part of the crew?
Sometimes yes, but not today.
You used the pump when you left Maizuru Bay, right?
Yes.

I think the arm was severed by the pump at that point.
I see.
If I understand correctly, his body was already...
at the entrance of the bay of Maizuru at the time of departure.
Then the drainage pump was activated
and the body was sucked up with the sea water,
but it was blocked and only his arm went through the filter.
Is that what you think?
Yes, that's right.
And what time do we have to return to the port?
At 5:30 pm.
That's no good... Considering the condition of the arm,
we should do the autopsy as soon as possible.
But I think about it...
there's a helicopter on board!
Wow, that's great!
Is this where you fly?
Conan!
Hey, kid! Who gave you permission to come here?
I was looking for the helicopter, and then I heard your voice.
The helicopter?
Yes! The helicopter could carry him!
But the passengers might suspect something...
That's the least of our worries!
Mr. Mouri.
If the passengers find out what happened..,
they might panic.
I want to see the helicopter fly!
Like the cannon from earlier!
Why don't you tell them that this is part of the demonstration?
Good idea!
They won't suspect a thing.
Commander Tateishi.
Every minute counts.
Good. That's agreed.
We'll prepare the helicopter.
Police Station
Really? On board the ship?
Okay, got it.
We'll contact the Kyoto station.
We'll join you as soon as we get the authorization.
Yes, that's better.
It is possible that the culprit is also on board.
Yes, take care of the left arm first.
Yes. Thank you.
Now we'll see the helicopter in action!
The take-off can be dangerous, so stay behind the fence.
Phew, we got here just in time!
Yes.
It's you!
What's wrong with you? Did you lose your father again?
You've been alone for a while, right?
Are you all right?
Where are your parents?
His father used to go with him, but he must have lost him.
Did he?
Your name is Yuuki, right?
Yes.
Well, stay here with him, Conan.
I'll get one of the crew to search.
Stop it! If you do that...
What are you talking about?
I'm...
I'm okay.
- Then leave me alone! - Wait, Yuuki!
Here, you lost this.
What kind of medicine is this?
It's to soothe the itch...
Are you sick?
I can't drink cow's milk.
Oh, I see, you have food allergies.
Yuuki, wait!
My dad told me...
I have to become strong.
And that my name means "courage".
So I'm going to hold on!
Yuuki!
Is this where you were hiding?
- Are you his father? - Yes, I am.
That makes me feel better, he looked lost.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
It's not good to leave alone like that!
Tell me, are we in Maizuru, is it there?
Yes.
We're already going to look for information here.
What's with all these people?
Well, there are many things happening on board this destroyer!
I was as surprised as you were.
It's sizzling a lot, is everything okay?
I had to hide so they wouldn't pick up my signal.
I'll make sure they can't track you anymore.
So what about the woman in question?
We looked, and she's not part of the JMSDF.
It was a man!
What's going on, Heiji?
Never mind, wait here.
Oh, but... Heiji!
He doesn't have a left arm!
- Have you called the police? - They're on their way!
A corpse without a left arm?
Is he a ship's lieutenant?
No doubt about it,
this is the Lieutenant Sasaura Kudo was talking about.
What's that, blood?
No...
But what is it, then?
Oh, don't do that!
What do you want, kid?
Don't touch it before the police come!
I'm inspector Megure.
We've come with the Wakasa Coast Guard.
Welcome aboard.
I am captain Tateishi.
- My name is Sato. - Takagi.
Kurata, security department.
Masaaki Kurata, Wakasa Coast Guard

Munekawa, criminal cases.
Tsutomu Munekawa Coast Guard of Wakasa
- Let's talk inside. - I'll follow you.
You are? At Wakasa's shipyard?
Yes, I'm pretty sure it's him.
He had the same rank, and he's missing an arm.
That means that Lieutenant Sasaura's arm was sucked into the Maizuru bay,
and then the rest of the body drifted here.
How could he have drifted to here?
It must have been carried by the current, right?
Is there so much current around here?
I'll look into it.
And I'll try to analyze that gooey stuff he had on his body.
What thing?
A red thing that he had on his cheek, I'm not sure what it is.
A red goo?
Hattori, can you join Professor Agasa?
I'm going to attack!
Oh, so good!
Yes, their naval curry is delicious!
It's the best curry I've ever had.
I must admit, it's really good!
Yuuki?
I'm overthinking this.
I wish I knew how to make it as good.
Oh yes, I know what you're thinking.
What?
"I made a delicious curry for you,
"so come back to me soon!" Don't you want to call her and say that?
Don't be silly.
He won't come home just for a curry.
No, he won't.
I'll make a call.
- That's more like it! - But no, not for that.
I have something to say to Shinichi, that's all.
If you say so. See you in a minute!
What does she want to talk to me about?
Damn, she will call me!
Where are you going, Conan?
To the loo.
What, again?
I'll be right back.
So much for my deduction and all the information we have.
I see.
So you haven't investigated yet because of the people on board.
Right
Where are the passengers now?
They are having their meal in the dining hall.
Maybe we should take the opportunity to investigate now.
But I thought they found
Lieutenant Sasaura's body at the Wakasa shipyard...
Is there really a need to investigate?
It's better, just in case.
The body could also have been caught in the pump before departure.
All right, then let me guide you.
Is that you, Ran?
How did you know?
Don't worry about the details. What did you want?
Details?
Actually, right now I'm...
On an Aegis destroyer.
Lucky for you, I wish I was on it too.
But how do you know that?
I told you:
no matter where you go, I will always find you.
Shinichi...
I got it! It's Conan, right?
He told you on the phone!
Yes...
Don't worry too much, things will surely get better.
You bet...
What do you know about it? You're not even here.
What's the matter with you?
Don't you feel safe when I'm not with you?
Don't talk nonsense!
Who do you take me for?
There, I recognize you! See you later.
And good luck.
Ah! Wait!
I'm here with you, you know...
What an idiot.
Your colleagues found him on the bridge, apparently.
- Where on the bridge? - I don't know exactly.
Well, let's hurry.
Did they find anything on the bridge?
Over there! It's right there.
Near those missile launchers...
that's where we found Mr. Sasaura's cell phone.
Where was it?
In that gap.
Let me see.
Did you check the history?
The last message was received yesterday, after 9:00 p.m.
And the last call...
this morning at 5:30.
At 5:30 in the morning?
That's when her watch stopped.
That's also the estimated time of death.
The autopsy of the body revealed that death occurred
between 4 and 6 o'clock this morning.
So he would have been on board this ship until then.
Did you find the cause of death?
Yes. He drowned.
So you think that around 5:30 this morning,
Mr. Sasaura fell off the ship?
It is most likely...
I know what happened!
Mr. Sasaura had a fight with someone on the deck this morning.
That's when he lost his phone.
Then he tried to run away,
he was chased here,
and he got thrown into the water.

If that is the case, we are dealing with a murder.
This means that Mr. Sasaura's body
was caught in the pump before it left
and got stuck there.
Yes.
Then the boat sailed away
and it was when they reactivated the pump, once out of Maizuru Bay,
that Mr. Sasaura's arm came off.
And the rest of his body, washed into the sea,
was carried by a sea current to the coast of Wakasa.
If this is what happened,
the fact that we found his cell phone here...
Here? The microSD card compartment is open...
I didn't open it.
- Is there a memory card? - No, it's empty.
You think the killer took it out?
So whoever killed Mr. Sasaura
was after that memory card!
Damn it, I can't get a good look at it...
I'll have to come out of hiding.
Not so fast!
Is something wrong, Mouri?
No, it's nothing...
Did it go up?
But... it's broken!
What are you...
What is what?
The captain's cabin?
A microSD card!
Go!
I knew it! The data was...
I'll be in my cabin.
Let me know if you find anything else.
Mr. Captain, can I take a picture with you?
You're not allowed to come in here, son, I'll walk you out.
Okay...
Obviously, she took the memory card with her.
But she must not have had time to erase the data properly.
And where is this phone now?
In the conference room.
And the police people?
- They are examining the phone... - What is the commander doing here?
Oh no! That voice, it was...
I am discovered? Damn!
It was almost over!
Don't move!
I've been tricked.
Rah, I couldn't copy everything...
Why does X still need the data?
- "X" ? - I have to delete everything quickly.
That's right...
There's no sign that X has been there.
"X" ?
Anyway, I have to get out of here fast
and turn in whatever I was able to copy to the professor.
No, wait...
If I put out a satellite feed here,
I might be able to find out who she is!
I'm picking up satellite waves!
- It's coming from the captain's cabin! - What?! What?!
But he's in a meeting!
What if it's X?
Go to the commander's quarters immediately!
Yes, sir!
I do not like it.
There is crucial data in his cabin...
It's finished downloading.
What did Shinichi send us this time?
Go figure.
Knowing Kudo, it's probably something he wants us to analyze for him.
Oh, we've arrived in Kyoto.
Freeze!
What are you doing here?
None of your business.
Colonel Fujii?
Was that you?
Commander... I'll explain later.
It's you!
Who is it?
Don't worry about her.
Get out of here.
Yes, sir.
Wait a second!
You made us run here because of suspicious waves!
Yes, and when we get here we find her here...
I think we're entitled to ask who she is.
I apologize, but...
we can't divulge her identity to outsiders.
I'm sorry? You can't be serious!
I agree with her. Aren't we and the police...
aren't we all in this together?
- It's the JMSDF lady! - Hey, there!
You're snooping around again!
My friend, he told me that it's rare to see a woman on an Aegis destroyer!
That's enough, now!
That's right!
Are women allowed on an Aegis destroyer?
Uh, yes.
There are more and more movements for their participation in missions.
So today, she's serving as a guide.
Indeed, I understand better.
Huh? But earlier, she said she was cooking...
It's true that she said that...
Explain yourself.
That is...
In the present state of affairs,
we might be led to believe that you are the person
who killed Mr. Sasaura!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
We are doing our best to cooperate!
Commander.
We're out of options. I think we should tell them.
I am part...

of the intelligence and security service.
Intelligence and security ?
The agency under the orders of the Ministry of Defense?
That's right.
We handle all information
about the JMSDF and its members.
And what's a member of the intelligence community doing...
...aboard the Aegis destroyer?
It's related to the suspect ship from this morning!
Right on. We believe it to be
a spy ship from another country.
It does not surprise me... On board this unknown ship,
there were antennas to communicate
and explosives for self-destruction.
You are well informed.
It was I who discovered the ship in question.
That's why I joined the investigation.
And since the suspect vessel
was in the same bay as this Aegis destroyer,
we suspect that a spy may have infiltrated the ship.
- A spy? - Yes.
We are looking for this potential spy, whom we have nicknamed "X".
"X"...
What would be the purpose of this spy ?
We believe he wants the confidential information
that is kept on board.
Information, you say?
What would happen if he got it?
We would lose the confidence
of the U.S. military, which provided us with the Aegis system.
No, it's much worse than that.
If the navigational data from the Aegis system filters out,
it will reveal the strategies of the Japanese defense lines.
The country would be completely defenseless
in case of military attack.
Simply put...
...it would be a national crisis.
And Lieutenant Sasaura, who was murdered..,
...knew about the spy, I presume?
Yes.
By the nature of his work, of course.
What do you mean?
What was Mr. Sasaura's job?
As a lieutenant in the Navy, he was in a high position.
Lieutenant Sasaura...
worked in information technology for the military base in Wakasa.
Information?
He was in charge of protecting the data on board.
That's why X killed him: To steal that information!
So it was also X who stole
the memory card from Mr. Sasaura's phone!
No, it was this woman who stole it.
Why is she keeping it a secret?
Excuse me.
Let us through.
Thank you, sir.
We're here to examine the communication devices.
- We'll have to search you as well. - Damn it!
Hey, uncle!
What's up?
I forgot I asked for another plate of curry.
Curry?
What are you snooping around here for anyway?
- Get out of here! - Okay, I will.
Thanks, man!
Thanks for your hard work!
Hattori, can you hear me?
Yes. I've reached Professor Agasa.
Were you able to analyze the red stuff?
We're just on our way, so wait a minute.
It's great to be able to do analysis in the car!
Ai is a scientist, basically.
A scientist?
Are you out of your mind? She's just a little girl!
Don't let her small size fool you.
It's okay, I got it.
TBT ?
It's antifouling paint
used on boats.
Boat paint?
Is there any way to tell if it came from this Aegis destroyer?
I'll get the little lady to look into it!
The little lady?
Uh... By the way, about the sea currents...
There is no current here
that could have carried Maizuru's corpse to Wakasa.
So how did he end up in Wakasa?
What about the data I sent?
Oh, that?
Kudo wants to know about the data he sent.
Shinichi?
It seems to be data on the Aegis system.
So it is!
And obviously it was copied from a company's cloud.
The cloud?
You mean the online data storage service?
Yes.
With his login and password,
you can see the original data on the cloud.
I see...
So that means that Mr. Sasaura
first stored the data from the Aegis system on his cloud,
and then copied it from there to his phone's memory card.
But still, to put such information on a public service...
Why did he do that?
Professor.

Use Mr. Sasaura's ID to send this data
from the cloud to the captain's cabin.
- But... - Don't worry about it.
I memorized his e-mail when I accessed it.
Thank you. (chuckles)
Sorry to rush you,
gentlemen of the Kyoto police,
but I would like to know the results of the investigation.
But of course.
Commander, just before you get here,
Keiji Kurumazaki Kyoto Police Officer
Fumimaro Ayanokoji Kyoto Police Officer
we retraced Mr. Sasaura's steps just before his death.
At about 5:30 this morning, Mr. Sasaura
waved a Japanese flag from a cliff in Maizuru.
One of the crew members of an ocean liner saw him.
Why would the lieutenant do this?
That we do not know,
but what's more interesting is what he was doing yesterday.
He was at the military base in Wakasa,
being interrogated by you, Mr. Sekiguchi.
Why were you questioning him?
Well... I...
More secrecy!
Colonel Fujii!
You can't even talk to us, your colleagues?
Not without the approval of the Ministry of Defense.
But you're stubborn! A man was killed, I remind you!
As long as you don't tell us anything,
we can't help you.
He was your comrade, right?
- And you... - This man was not our comrade!
So there, you must tell us more.
What is it?
Why was the Aegis data sent here?
Inspector.
Since you won't cooperate,
...I'm gonna have to go through the motions.
What?
It was sent from a cloud under Mr. Sasaura's ID.
Nice timing, Professor.
- A cloud? - That would be for showing to X, here on board?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Putting Aegis data on the Internet is against the rules!
It all makes sense.
That's why you questioned Mr. Sasaura.
And that lady from the JMSDF knew about it too.
Not so fast!
Wait, we're not done yet.
Let go of me!
Unlike you,
I work for the nation!
With that kind of thinking,
you won't be able to protect the country, let alone catch X.
Come on, let's join forces.
For the good of the country.
The data from the destroyer Aegis
has leaked from the Wakasa base!
Shut up, Lieutenant Sekiguchi!
It was Mrs. Fujii...
who ordered me to investigate this!
I knew it.
Was it Lieutenant Sasaura
who leaked this data?
Yes.
And who exactly did he leak it to?
To a detective agency that closed down years ago,
...formerly run by a man named Takekawa.
It's a dummy company, right?
Someone bought that company
and used the Takekawa name for espionage purposes.
This is a common practice in Japan.
And so it was to this so-called Takekawa
that Mr. Sasaura leaked the information?
That's right. And one day after we found out...
the coast guard informed us of the discovery
of a suspicious ship in the bay of Maizuru.
A ship in the same bay as our destroyer Aegis...
it could not be a coincidence.
We found material from another country on board the ship.
I know.
So we assumed
that a spy from the same country as Takekawa may have come ashore.
You mean...
the famous X?
We suspected that Lieutenant Sasaura was going to help X board the destroyer.
If that was the case..,
it would happen today, during the public opening.
Why didn't you tell us this right away?
A member of the JMSDF may have leaked information overseas.
You can imagine...
how embarrassing this is for us.
We decided to investigate on our own
until we were sure what happened.
So when I found the phone on the deck...
It was a passenger who dropped it?
But what does...
Lieutenant Sasaura's phone doing here?
Let's start by searching the bridge.
So you found it before me?
Mr. Sasaura was definitely on board, then.
Yes, before he was killed by X.

Excuse me, I need to contact the Ministry of Defense.
But then the satellite calls were coming from you!
I'm sorry.
After the incident, I made calls from the demagnetized room.
I was lucky, we might have run into each other there!
This is Fujii.
We had to discuss our secret investigation
with the police force and the coast guard.
Takekawa has what?
About two hours ago?
Yes.
He was seen in Kyoto City?
They found Takekawa?
If Takekawa left Tokyo to go to Kyoto...
It could be to find X.
And where is he now?
The entire intelligence community is looking for him in Kyoto.
Where was he seen two hours ago?
He was caught on a surveillance camera at a hotel in the city.
I assume you have a picture of this Takekawa?
We do.
So we can track him with Orbis,
the police N system, and the cameras.
You will have the full support of the Kyoto police.
Let us help you too.
Send us all the videos from the surveillance cameras here!
Yes!
From the Hotaka, we can analyze them without wasting time.
Well, this is starting to take shape!
Here are the images from Kyoto about two hours ago.
I asked first for the areas around the hotel where Takekawa was seen.
A message from the Maizuru base.
They picked up and searched the wreckage
and found material from another country.
I am putting this on the screen.
It comes from the same country as the suspect ship.
But a wreck from abroad does not end up like this in Japan.
This means that the wreckage that approached our ship
didn't come here by chance.
What is it?
It would be a terrorist act using sea currents?
No, that would be impossible.
We made a forecast this morning of the currents
and the boats in the area,
and changed our route to the left.
This was decided this morning?
This morning?
In that case, the trajectory...
At about 5:30 this morning, Mr. Sasaura
waved a Japanese flag from the top of a cliff in Maizuru.
If it is possible, it was...
I have to check this!
Since the road was changed this morning,
it would have been impossible
to direct the wreckage straight to us without being aware of it.
Who knew about the route change?
Only the base of Wakasa.
That rules out a spy.
Hey, kid!
Wait up!
It's not true, you again?
- You mustn't! - What's going on?
- Sorry, he just walked in... - Found it.
Hey!
I told you to stop sneaking around!
What's that? But that's not mine!
Of course it's not!
This time, you'll see...
Wait a minute!
Did you say that
that only people from the base knew about it?
That's right.
That means Lieutenant Sasaura knew too!
Look at that signal flag.
In the darkness,
the witness could easily have mistaken it for a Japanese flag.
That's right.
I see!
Sasaura used this flag this morning
to send a message to X!
What message?
What does this flag mean?
It means that we are going to port.
- But then... - Yes.
X knew in advance that we were going to change our route.
Strange, I thought I had lost him around here...
I'm going back to the dining hall!
Don't be stupid, too!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Oh, boy.
Target spotted!
- Are you sure it's him? - Yes, I'm sure.
It's a 93% match.
It's Takekawa for sure.
Where is it?
Ponto-cho Park, Kyoto. This was shot at 12:03.
I'll enlarge the image.
- Ponto-cho Park? - Yes, hurry up!
Hurry up, or else what he leaves will be recovered!
Okay, I get it!
Another thing: try to find a picture of Takekawa.
A picture? What's the point?
I count on you!
He hung up.
Anyway, be quick !
It works.
Oops.
We found you, Conan!

Well then, where have you been?
The treasure hunt is about to begin.
Target spotted!
At 12:10 p.m. on the Keihan line,
at Gionshijo station.
It's the line that leads to Osaka.
Ah! It's going up!
It's an express train!
It won't make many stops, then.
I'll contact the Osaka police for backup.
That boy is gone...
Osaka Police Station
From Gionshijo stop
to Yodoyabashi,
collect all the videos from the surveillance cameras
and send them to this address.
The command post of the destroyer "Hotaka"?
Hurry, Otaki, it's an emergency.
Got it!
For this treasure hunt,
we have hidden five types of treasure...
in the mess hall and on the bridge.
Try to find them all!
I've got one!
Look, I found one!
Wow, great!
Great, that makes three!
Only two more to find here, then.
Hurry up, then we'll go to the bridge.
Yes.
Ran, help me search this area!
I'll be right there.
The discovery of a ship.
A combat procedure.
Then Mr. Sasaura's death...
If this was all orchestrated by X, the spy from abroad...
We believe he wants the classified information
that is kept on board.
Kid.
Got a minute?
Ponta-chu park
There's something burned in there.
Yes.
That's what Kudo was talking about.
The police are here.
There, that's it!
- Call the station! - Yes!
Conan?
Thanks for your help earlier.
What's up? What did I do?
Who are you exactly?
What kind of data can only be collected here,
on this ship?
Data...
from a sudden underwater attack, perhaps?
How did you know that?
I knew it.
So, you think that X
sent the wreckage to us for this data?
Where would we get it?
At the command post, where we were just before,
and in the captain's cabin.
That's it!
During the exercise,
there was a red alert,
and the captain joined us.
During that time, his cabin was empty.
I see!
He took the opportunity to infiltrate and steal the data!
In that case, I know who X is!
Hey, wait!
Conan!
He's doing it again, that damn kid!
I don't feel safe... I'm going after him.
But... wait, Ran!
Wait, kid!
Colonel Fujii!
Takekawa has arrived in Osaka!
Osaka?
Yes, at Yodoyabashi Station.
Is that you, Kudo?
Takekawa threw out some kind of memo.
A memo?
Yes.
But most of it was burned,
so we can't make much out of it.
Apparently, Takekawa...
went to Yodoyabashi, in Osaka.
Go after him!
I got it.
Yuuki. Yuuki!
Mr. Amemiya? Hello!
Mr. Amemiya!
Is that you?
Say, is he okay, Yuuki?
Um...um... Where is he?
He said he was going to the bathroom because of his eczema.
- His eczema? - Yes.
When it itches,
he has to wash his hands and put on his ointment, right?
Uh, yes.
I'm going to join him.
Are you worried?
Of course, it's normal.
Yet, when the boat was rocking earlier,
you weren't with him.
I told you, I went to the bathroom.
No, you were in the captain's cabin.
You didn't react immediately when I called your name.
Yuuki doesn't use ointment,
but pills.
And it's for his allergies, not for eczema.
If you were her father, you would have known that.
So you are not Yuuki's father.
I am wrong,
Mr. Spy?
Who are you exactly?
Conan Edogawa.
Detective.
You think I'm afraid
of some poor kid?
Did you hurt yourself, boy?
Come back!
No !
Stop it! My father will be killed!
Damn it... Damn uncle!
This is all I could restore.
"Senshu..."
There's a piece missing!
If it's related to the Aegis destroyer,
maybe it's the "bow" senshu?
Wouldn't that be an anchor, next to it?
No, it's not.
The bottom part of an anchor is longer.

It's an arrow, at most.
But what would that mean?
That they have to look up?
In the air?
Yes! Kazuha...
you're a genius!
What's wrong?
Grandpa, let's go to Senshu airport!
What's that?
That's not an anchor or an arrow.
It's a plane!
A plane?
Is there really an airport named like that?
Yes, it's the Kansai International Airport.
Senshu is its old name.
He was in Maizuru before the departure,
but his father disappeared
and a man he didn't know made him come up with him.
He said that if I didn't listen to him,
he would kill my father...
Is this the man who disappeared during the demonstration?
Yes.
This man probably went to steal the data from the captain's cabin.
Then it's him, X.
Do you remember what he looks like?
You think you can help us?
I will.
I remember him well.
Then come with us,
we'll show you some surveillance footage, okay?
All right!
All right, let's go.
Come on, kid.
I'll be right there.
Remember what your dad said?
Your name means "courage".
So hang in there!
Takekawa and X
haven't been found yet.
Oh well...
Kansai airport!
Takekawa might be at the airport!
- What's up? - Where did this information come from?
From little Heiji... I mean, from your son.
- From Heiji? - What about him?
I tried to stop him, but he's already on his way...
Toyama, order an emergency deployment to the airport!
Otaki, get the policemen there!
Don't let him get away!
Bingo.
Anything new on Takekawa?
All we know is that he passed through Nanba Station.
I see.
What about the witness who saw X?
Finally, it's Conan who's going to help us identify him.
Come on, sit here and watch the screen.
All right!
How does he know X?
Tell us if you see the man on one of the screens.
Oh no, the images are disappearing!
What?
- Where are the videos coming from? - They are stored on our servers.
Damn, he thought of everything!
There is no video left?
We can always display the live cameras.
- Good, do that! - Yes, do that.
Just wait a minute, okay?
Yes.
I don't think X will let the cameras film him.
We'll have to ask Yuuki where X is going...
A call from the Osaka police!
They think Takekawa is on his way to Kansai Airport.
What?
He wants to escape by plane?
Please excuse us...
We have to interrupt the treasure hunt for now.
We'll resume at the dining hall...
Where could Conan have gone?
Please!
I'm going to ask you to go back, the waves are too high.
Have you seen a little boy with glasses?
Did he get lost?
No, not exactly...
Then go back inside, please.
We will close the access to the bridge.
We'll close the bridge.
Takekawa is going to the airport!
Let's contact the nearest marine base to the airport quickly.
Yes.
- I'm entrusting the boy to you, Mr. Inoue. - Yes, sir.
Now we just have to find X on board!
Remember what your father said?
Your name means "courage".
So hang in there!
Me too...
I want to help you find the spy!
Target spotted at the airport!
89% match.
He appears on the north wing camera, opposite gate 3!
He's entering the airport.
We're almost there, Yuuki.
Yes.
Excuse me, do you have a minute?
Uh, yes...
No! Is that you, X?
What's up, Yuuki?
You thought I'd leave you when you knew my route?
Get up!
Get up, I said!
I'm tired of this boy!
I'm going to have to forbid him to walk around by himself.
What's this? That's Yuuki and her father...
Didn't anyone tell them that the bridge is closed?
Are you sure this is the right place?
Yes, Takekawa is definitely around here.
Well, then I'll park the car.
Okay, we'll go ahead.
Wait for me, Heiji!
Why are we stopping here?

The investigators already know Takekawa's face.
They won't let him get on the plane.
How did you get his picture?
I forced Mr. Otaki's hand a little.
If he wants to get on without being seen, he'll go in the cargo.
So his only option is to blend in with the cargo.
Hey, kids!
- Don't stand in front of it, it's dangerous! - All right!
Stay here until the next patrol.
Understand?
Be good and you'll see your father again.
Excuse me, sir.
Have you seen Conan around?
You know, the little boy with glasses who was with me...
No, I haven't seen him.
Oh, right...
What about you, Yuuki?
No...
Yuuki was with me the whole time, so I don't think so.
Those kids, they run away as soon as you turn your back.
Oh yeah.
See you later, Yuuki.
That's a good way to disappear...
I forgot to tell you, the bridge is off limits!
Oh, really?
We'll join you as soon as Yuuki's seasickness passes.
Help, Madam!
This man is a spy!
Yuuki!
You think you can get away with this?
What's wrong, Yuuki?
Are you alright?
Forgive him...
We're playing spy, you see,
and he's taking the game a bit too far...
He's lying! That man is not my father!
That's not your father?
Well, stay here with him, Conan.
I'll get one of the crew to look into it.
Stop it! Stop it! If you do that...
What are you talking about?
I'm...
I'm okay.
It's not your dad, is it?
No, it's not!
- Please help me! - That's enough, Yuuki.
- Yuuki, come over here. - Yes!
Stupid girl.
Nothing would have happened to you if you hadn't meddled.
You really are a spy!
Yes, I am.
But it's too late to regret.
What is it?
Yuuki, go get help!
Yes !
You little brat!
I won't let you go!
He's strong... but...
Target spotted...
in cargo area G.
Perfect!
- Is that him? - Yes, it is.
The match is 97%.
I'm counting on you, Hattori.
Hello? This is Megure of the Tokyo Police.
We have located Takekawa in the G-zone.
Roger!
Takekawa is in Zone G!
It's over there!
Hey there, not that way!
Let go!
You can't come in here, kid.
- Let go! - Hey! Hey!
- Let go, I said! - Yuuki?
- It's the spy! - What is it?
He's over there!
This guy looks too ordinary.
We'll never find him.
Hey, be careful!
Are you okay?
I'm fine... thanks.
You can be so clumsy!
It's dangerous to dream here.
Wait for me here, okay?
What's up?
I won't be long!
Wait for me... Heiji!
He's getting on my nerves! He'll see, I'll find
that Takekawa before he does!
Takekawa?
Wait, Takekawa!
Come back here!
What's wrong, Kazuha?
Kazuha! Where are you?
Don't tell me she went alone...
There he is!
That's him, over there!
Police, don't move!
Get out of here!
Stop right there!
Wait, Nanami!
Let's go to the bridge.
Now that it is discovered,
I would be surprised if he stays on board until the port.
You are right. But you two...
Wait, Conan!
Yuuki, go back to the others, okay?
What the...
The lady...
Stop right there!
Back off!
Don't come any closer!
- It's over! - You can't run away anymore!
Ah, you think?
Be reasonable!
There are too many obstacles.
At the vertical...
I will not be able to reach it.
I know!
Nanami!
Do you think you can turn that cannon clockwise?
- The cannon? - If you can, do it!
Please do it!
Kazuha!
Die!
Heiji...
Get down!
Are you okay, Heiji?
Stop it!
In your dreams!
Stop it!
Come on!
I'm dreaming!
The suspect is under control!
Give up, Takekawa!
Fine, I'll leave the rest to you!
Heiji! Are you alright?
Hurry up! Hurry up! Call an ambulance!
Oh, you're overreacting.
- Heiji! - I'm alright.
It's just a scratch.
- Really, Heiji? - Yes, it is.

What's wrong, Kazuha?
Hey, don't cry!
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
Stop, I'm hurt!
Let me go, you're hurting me!
Kazuha! Are you listening to me?
Ouch, ouch!
It was not easy, was it?
- But it's a done deal... - Inspector, look at this!
It's from the agents at the airport.
In one of the shipments,
they found a pressure chamber disguised as a healing capsule.
Is that how he planned to get away?
And about Takekawa, who was arrested at the airport...
there was a suspicious message recorded on his answering machine.
I asked them to send it.
Please let us hear it.
It may be a message from Lieutenant Sasaura.
Yes, sir.
I'll prepare this right away.
Yum!
Excuse me...
What's the matter? Are you lost?
Where is the lady who was with you?
The lady? You mean Ran?
That's right, where is she?
She went to look for Conan.
The ID is:
A-E-G-I-S 0902.
Password:
0505 inform.
- Yes, this is the voice of Lieutenant Sasaura. - Recorded...
April twenty, at 5:30 a.m.
That's the estimated time of death of Mr. Sasaura.
This message came from Takekawa's phone.
This is the undeniable proof
that Lieutenant Sasaura leaked the data from the destroyer Aegis.
We could hear the sound of waves.
Maybe it was near the water.
The sound of waves?
I also heard another voice.
- Play it back, please. - Yes, sir.
The Aegis data
was put on the KRY cloud.
The identifier is:
A-E-G-I-S 0902.
Password...
What's that metallic sound?
Play the last part again.
Yes.
Password: 0505 inform.
Yes, I heard it!
It's a man's voice.
But you can't hear what he's saying.
I'll have it analyzed.
Thanks, but...
I have a bad feeling about this.
As if there were pieces missing from the puzzle...
Hello, Shinichi?
The TBT found on Sasaura's body
did not come from the Hotaka!
But it did come from a boat?
Yes.
We have searched which boats leave from Maizuru and Wakasa,
and we found a ship passing through the old ports
that left the bay of Maizuru
and passed by the shipyard of Wakasa.
As we thought,
the TBT on the hull of this ship was a match.
So the body of Mr. Sasaura
clung to the hull of this ship,
which carried him from Maizuru to Wakasa?
Yes, I can only see that.
A ship that left from the bay of Maizuru?
Around 5:30 this morning, Mr. Sasaura
waved a Japanese flag from the top of a cliff in Maizuru.
One of the crew members of an ocean liner saw him.
- Password: 0505... - On April twenty...
at 5:30 am.
His watch stopped at 5:30 am.
And the last call... this morning at 5:30.
At 5:30 in the morning?
That's when his watch stopped.
That's also the estimated time of death.
The time Mr. Sasaura was seen,
the time he left the message,
and the time of death...
It's the same for all three: 5:30.
I got it!
I was completely wrong!
After his arrest, Takekawa
was handed over to the security division of the Osaka police.
We are thinking of doing the same for X
once we arrive in Maizuru.
Don't you want to interrogate him?
We have to work together in this investigation.
And it is better to interrogate Takekawa and X together.
Yes, I agree.
Yes, I agree.
Good, case closed!
It's true that for once,
you didn't have to make any deductions.
Mr. Mouri!
Mr. Mouri?
Uh... this is the captain's chair.
Is everything all right?
Yes, it's nothing.
Just a little dizzy.
Do you get seasick? On a boat this big?
No, what made me dizzy was what I just deduced.
What are you talking about? It's all over already...
I understood everything.
Now I know who killed Mr. Sasaura.
Who killed him?
Wasn't it X, our suspect?

X did infiltrate this ship to steal data,
that's a fact.
Yes.
And he killed Sasaura to steal the memory card from her phone.
No, because the person who took that memory card
is colonel Fujii.
Yes, that's right.
Right? But why was he killed then?
That's right.
There was no reason to kill him.
So I come to think that X is not the murderer!
How?
But then, who...
Remember:
this morning, Mr. Sasaura was on a cliff in Maizuru.
Yes, he was waving a flag for X.
Right, and afterwards
he fell into the water and died.
Therefore,
Mr. Sasaura did not board that ship today!
What are you saying?
But we found his phone on board!
It was a feint to make us think he was there.
Whoever did it rushed to put it there.
Think about it, colonel.
Where and when did you find his phone?
Now that you mention it,
it was well after we left,
and it was in a very visible place,
but nobody noticed it before.
Right
That's because
it's a false evidence placed on board after the departure!
Clearly, the culprit
came on board during the journey.
Isn't that right,
Mr. Kurata?
You're right? No, you're not!
I didn't even know Mr. Sasaura before this!
That's nonsense, Mouri!
He had no reason to go after him...
No,
it probably wasn't intentional.
What was?
Conan! Play the message Mr. Sasaura left
Mr. Sasaura left on Takekawa's answering machine.
The Aegis data
has been put on the KRY cloud.
Don't you hear a metal noise?
- Yes, I do. - That sounds familiar...
What is that sound?
It's the sound
of a gun and a telescopic baton clashing on a belt.
Doesn't that sound familiar, Mr. Kurata?
But wait!
All Coast Guard officers
has these weapons on their belt!
Yes, they do.
But this message was left at 5:30am.
And the time of death is...
the same time, 5:30 am!
In short,
he wouldn't have had time to get on board with his cell phone.
Moreover, this morning,
the person who discovered the suspect vessel...
was you, Mr. Kurata!
In other words, you were at the crime scene.
Are you going to continue denying it?
Don't move!
The things...
Things weren't supposed to...
happen like this!
Who's hanging around here so early?
That's suspicious...
Hey, you!
What are you doing here?
Damn it!
This is the coast guard, stop!
He was clearly a suspect.
Let go of me!
He probably ran away without thinking since he had just
sending the data to Takekawa.
I had no idea.
I rushed downstairs
to look for this man who fell in the water
when I discovered the suspect ship.
After that, I was so busy notifying the base
and contacting the JMSDF, that eventually...
And that's when
I heard that the police had found Lieutenant Sasaura's arm
aboard the destroyer Aegis.
I quickly went to look at the belongings of the fallen man...
and that's when I realized that the man they were looking for this morning
was Lieutenant Sasaura.
It was an accident,
but knowing that I caused the death of a lieutenant sent me into a panic.
I asked my superior
to let me participate in the investigation.
But why?
Because you thought he might have been killed on board.
If I made it look like he was,
I could have gotten away with it.
So by pretending to investigate,
I placed his cell phone in plain sight on the deck.
The rest you know.
Because of my selfishness,
I put the whole investigation at risk.
I am deeply sorry for that.
Mr. Mouri!
Do you know where Ran is?
No.
We can't find her anywhere!
She must have gotten lost again, that's all.

-No! - We searched everywhere!
She disappeared after fighting the spy!
What?
Detective.
What is it, Sato?
X said something disturbing.
Disturbing?
Yes, he said that before he was arrested...
...he was found out by one of the passengers!
And that to shut her up,
he threw her into the water.
He said that she was old enough to be in high school
and that she did karate.
- Karate? - But then it's...
Ran!
No !
- Ran's been... - You mean it?
You've got to be kidding me...
Ran!
The ship is going to rock dangerously,
so hold on to your young children!
According to what X said,
Miss Mouri must have fallen in this area.
We've come a long way...
- Hey, you, wait! - Leave them.
And get the helicopter ready!
Yes, sir!
Make way!
We've analyzed the currents.
It must be here.
But... it's four times as strong as usual!
Because of the low pressure coming from the south,
the currents are stronger.
The waves are getting higher.
She won't have the stamina to hold on
much longer!
The rescue helicopter is ready!
- Good, take off immediately. - Yes, sir!
I'm coming too !
Don't talk nonsense!
But...
You'd be more of a nuisance than anything else.
Damn it!
Taking into account his stamina,
there's not a minute to lose.
We need to find her before the sun sets!
Roger that.
"Not a minute to lose"?
Ran's going to be okay, right?
What do you think of the fall she took?
She was wearing a life jacket, I guess..,
but from that height... It depends on where she fell.
Oh no!
It's not hopeless!
- Ran... - No!
Sorry ma'am, it's my fault!
Isn't there any way to know if she's okay?
No, only the helicopter can find her.
Even if they narrow down the search area..,
it's impossible to search everything before dark!
Not to mention the fact that she may still be
still caught in the current!
Please help...
Shinichi!
We are on the spot.
We are starting the search.
I'll call him on the loudspeaker, connect me.
Roger that.
Miss Ran Mouri!
It's the rescue team!
We'll find you,
so hang in there a little longer!
Ran! Where are you, Ran?
- Ran! - Hang in there!
- Don't die, Ran! - We'll save you!
Think about it...
There must be some way to find her!
The waves are getting stronger.
We have to widen the search area.
It will be dark soon.
Concentrate your search on Alpha Bravo Fox.
Roger that. We are heading to Alpha Bravo Fox.
Miss Ran Mouri, this is rescue!
We're here, hold on!
It's getting dark.
It's less than 15 minutes to nightfall.
So what if it is?
Who cares if it's getting dark?
Continue to search!
Do not stop before having found it!
Believe me, we would like to, but...
At this time of year, after 5:00 p.m. when the sun goes down,
the water temperature drops.
Even if we find it after that...
Gee, the temperature has already started to drop, so?
Damn, we don't have any more time!
Find a solution, come on!
A watch...
I think Mitsuhiko lent him one!
Why, huh?
Why do you keep looking?
- You'll find it! - Don't give up!
It's a great boat, right?
Yeah, do something!
Is it the sea detective, or what?
The sea detective?
Yes, it is!
With the ship's radar!
17h00. The ship will now leave
the competent authorities take over.
We return to Maizuru.
A radio watch!
Ran has a radio watch!
You can track satellite waves, right?
Mitsuhiko! Your watch is waterproof, right?
Yes !
The watch is updated at 5 a.m. and 5 p.m. sharp!
Hurry, Commander! There's no time!
Start the radio search!
There's 1 minute 40 seconds to go before five o'clock.
Will you be all right?
Yes, I'll be fine!
- Turn on the radars! - Sound the alarm!
This is not a drill.

I repeat: this is not a drill.
All hands off deck!
I repeat:
All crew must leave the bridge!
- Make sure we get there in time... - All clear!
Satellite radar ready!
Start the search.
I'm starting!
The time is 4:59.
Ten seconds to 5:00.
Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Four. Three.
Two. One.
Zero!
What's up?
No answer in the search area.
No! Why?
Maybe the watch receiving the satellite waves
...sank to the bottom of the ocean...
Ran...
No !
That's not possible...
You'll find me, right?
That's why I said we should go together.
I know, but...
You don't go by yourself anymore, okay?
Otherwise you'll spend the night in the park.
I'm not worried.
Even if I get lost,
you'll find me, right?
Are you a great detective or not?
I can't even find a person...
Some detective!
Ran...
Ran...
I thought I...
...I heard Conan's voice.
I told you..:
I'll find you, no matter what.
What took you so long?
Shinichi...
I...
I can hear a weak signal!
It's growing!
It's Ran!
Ran is over there!
Send the helicopter!
Send the chopper right away!
Yes, sir!
Target 4 km north!
Latitude: 36°, 4'! Longitude: 135°!
SH, proceed immediately to target!
Roger, we're on our way!
We're coming up on the designated area.
We are above, but the visibility is bad.
There are many reflections on the water.
- As long as it's daylight, it's going to be difficult! - Reflections?
Tell me! Isn't there
an area that is particularly shiny?
Huh? Well...
- Well? Answer! - Uh... yes!
There is a zone where the light of the propeller reflects strangely more.
It is there ! Follow the reflection!
Ran is at the end!
Do as the boy says, send the helicopter.
Please, Commander!
Follow the reflections!
The victim should be in the center.
Good!
We're over the brightest spot.
We're starting our descent.
We see something!
It's not a floating object!
It's her!
We found it!
Survival confirmed! Let's go down and get it!
Hooray!
They did it!
Great job, everybody.
Get her straight to the hospital.
Roger that.
She hasn't lost consciousness,
but we're taking her just in case.
Her temperature is low,
but her pulse is stable.
Shinichi...
Uncle...
Thank you.
In the dream I had last night
We were still children
The revolution we had drawn
Seemed impossible to achieve
When I opened my eyes I realized
How happy those days were
And that's because winter and summer
You were always there by my side
We had no regrets, no boredom
We went in the rain without an umbrella
By your side I felt like I was growing wings
Couldn't I
Fly through this sky one more time?
I want to knock my sadness away
Once more, once more, you and me!
The city starts to move again
And the people start chirping again
Our revolution disturbs them
They don't want to get tired
The sky is strewn with cherry blossoms
And the caterpillars have become butterflies
Together we can make it happen
Couldn't I
Follow this path one more time?
I want to walk until I swim
Once more, once more, you and me!
Couldn't I
Fly through this sky one more time?
I want to knock my sadness away
Once more, once more, you and me!
Once more, once more, you and me!
But yes I assure you, it's really nothing.
It barely grazed me.
Thanks again, Hattori.
Hey, Kazuha...
I'm telling you it's okay.
Don't look like that!
Oops!
Don't cry!
These, I swear...
Conan, right?
Miss Nanami...
Thank you for everything.
It's my turn to thank you.
Thank you.

Okay, I'm going!
Wait, Conan.
Tell me something... Who are you really?
Conan Edogawa,
a simple elementary school kid.
