Today, shortly after 9:50 pm,
the Tokyo National Microorganism Research Center
located in West Tama, was attacked by an armed group.
This terrorist group
captured two security guards and took a researcher hostage
to infiltrate the high-security lab.
Tadayoshi Uno Criminal Affairs Advisor
Toshiro Odagiri Director of the Criminal Section
After a few minutes,
they caused an explosion and fled.
One question!
The laboratory they blew up
contained an extremely dangerous bacterium
that the attackers would have stolen.
A dangerous bacterium?
It causes death in 80% of cases of infection
and no treatment is yet known.
Could the explosion have released the bacteria?
No risk.
The explosion was of such magnitude
that if there were any bacteria left, they would have been destroyed.
The director of the center said so.
What is the purpose of this group?
We don't know.
But we do not rule out the possibility of bioterrorism.
We have a request to make.
In order to avoid spreading panic,
we ask you to mention only the explosion,
and not to mention the bacteria or the possibility of a bioterrorist attack.
Are you asking us to lie to the public?
Sir!
The terrorist group has posted a statement online!
- They call themselves... - The Red Siamese.
"We, the Red Siamese,
"have attacked the Microbial Research Facility
"and obtained a deadly bacteria.
"Our next action will take place within seven days.
"Be advised."
So they do have the bacteria.
But this terrorist group
- was disbanded ten years ago... - Director!
So the case can be made public?
We have no choice.
Today we have with us Ms. Chiaki Ota, a bacteriologist.
Infection with this bacterium causes
itching, fever...
My word, what a story!
It's all over the media now.
Yeah, well...
The infection is caused by direct contact with the bacteria
and young children are even more susceptible.
- The symptoms will be immediate. - You hear that?
What's our Conan going to do when he's a little kid?
Oh, shut up.
Otherwise, Hattori.
What puzzles me...
That's why they blew up the lab, right?
If their objective was the bacteria,
they didn't need to cause an explosion.
That's clear.
And if they did,
these Red Siamese guys, had you heard of them?
No.
I just know that they used to prey on the rich about ten years ago.
We were both kids back then.
Ah, sorry.
You're still a kid, though.
You're a pain in the ass.
By the way, Kudo...
You're going to ride in a blimp, right?
The world's biggest finished blimp
The one that goes from Tokyo to Osaka, there.
Yes.
The old man has been acting up again
and issued a challenge to Kaito Kid.
Attention Kaito Kid!
He just answered that he accepts.
I bet that right now...
Damn red stray cats!
My project is finally complete,
A stolen bacterium, the best airship in the world, and you steal the front page!
Because of you, the challenge
to my great enemy Kaito Kid goes totally unnoticed!
So, Kudo...
Come and visit me when you're here.
I'll take you for okonomiyaki as promised.
Yes, I will.
See ya.
DETECTIVE CONAN - THE ARK OF HEAVEN
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug,
and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name...

I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
To find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
One, two, three, four...
This is Jirokichi Suzuki, age 72.
Excuse me.
Thank you, sir.
He's the cousin of Ran's friend Sonoko Suzuki's father.
He's a consultant to the Suzuki Group.
This old man always brags...
that he's achieved his dreams and received all the awards he wanted.
He's all about beating Kid now.
But I'm more concerned about this group.
Those terrorists who blew up a lab and stole a bacterium.
What could their goal be?
My body is younger, but not my mind!
I'll solve all the mysteries!
There is only one truth!
Here is Tropical Land!
The castle looks tiny!
It looks like a miniature park.
This is nice.
Dad, we have a great view!
Don't you want to come and see?
Shut up! I'm thinking about it.
Him, then...
I almost forgot that Mouri is easily scared of heights.
But he's not!
Do you think Kid still sees the world like that?
I envy him a little!
Besides...
Is he really going to show up, Kid?
Yes, he is!
He gave his answer to my uncle Jirokichi.
Here it is.
"It's with... that... your... on board..."
You won't understand anything if you skip all the kanji!
I swear to you...
I'll read it to you.
"It is with joy that I accept your invitation aboard the airship.
"However, knowing that you are 72 years old,
"I would feel bad to make you stay tense for six hours."
I will do this in the evening, when you fly over Osaka.
"Just relax and enjoy the trip until then.
"Kaito Kid."
You don't want to kidnap me at the same time?
My dear Kid!
I'd already thought about it,
but this girl is really original.
She sure is.
By the way, are we the only passengers this time?
There's also Mr. Fujioka, who's writing a report...
Ah, here he is!
Takamichi Fujioka Journalist
He wants to write a report about the fight between Kid and my uncle.
He insisted on coming on board.
- There's also... - Uh, excuse me.
You are Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?
Let me introduce myself: Masaki
Masaki Mizukawa, director of Nichiuri TV
Mizukawa, director of Nichiuri TV.
And with me,
our reporter, Kasumi Nishitani,
and our cameraman, Junpei Ishimoto.
Junpei Ishimoto Cameraman
Kasumi Nishitani Reporter
Nice to meet you.
Uh, hello.
Our station has obtained the exclusive
on the confrontation between Mr. Suzuki and Kid!
Oh, yes...
- Your show starts at night. - That's right.
Originally, we wanted to put more resources into it,
like when we filmed the air walk,
but it's a bit of a bad time.
What do you mean by that?
Ah, the Red Siamese case.
Yes.
Since they announced that they would act within a week,
our studio must be ready at all times.
It's true, this is the last day to keep their commitment.
Because of them,
I was denied a helicopter ride on my autobiography.
What a nuisance, these stray cats!
Right, Lupin?
Uncle Jirokichi.
Greetings, Mr. Suzuki!
Thank you for welcoming us on board.
This airship is a real wonder!
And to film this wonder,
you only come in threes?
Well, uh...
Yes, sorry.
Our studio is overloaded because of the other case.
I can't help but wonder
what the terrorists want with this bacteria.
I wonder what the terrorists want with this bacteria.
They say that once you're infected, you can't get away from it.
Apparently it is transmitted by air.
That's scary!
Can you get it on a plane?
No, through the air!
If someone coughs or sneezes on you.
Children are more sensitive to it,
so be careful.
What?
You bet!
They talk about deadly bacteria or whatever,
but I've always traveled to germy areas,
and I'm perfectly healthy!
Humans are stronger than bacteria.
Yes, I knew that!
That said, kids like you

may be dropping like flies.
What?
Don't say that!
It's not nice to scare children.
Yes, have a little empathy!
It doesn't suck, come on!
Don't worry about it!
They can release the bacteria anywhere in the country,
but aboard this airship, you will be safe.
Don't worry!
Yes, as long as we stay in the air...
What's that?
Don't you have to prepare the snack?
Yes, I do.
I'll just smoke first.
I'll be right back!
So finally we didn't find out who they are.
No.
The former group leaders who are serving their time
say they know nothing.
This bulb is our only clue so far,
but it's not from any known manufacturer.
It was probably made by the Red Siamese.
Since we found it in the parking lot of the research center...
There's a good chance that when they attacked the lab,
they had several empty vials on them.
And they used them to store
the bacteria in the lab.
And so they would have accidentally
dropped one of the empty vials?
Yes.
It's tricky to change a bacterium from one container to another,
it can be very risky.
So we think that the culprits have scientific knowledge.
But why risk changing the container first,
instead of just taking it?
And why come back like ghosts
after ten years of inactivity?
What is their purpose?
There's a window here too!
The kids seem to be having a good time.
Yes.
They're lucky to be able to ride a blimp at their age.
We can really thank Sonoko.
For them, it's like flying on a huge cloud in the sky.
No, nothing.
I was just remembering my childhood.
The first time Ran saw a blimp in the sky...
Shinichi! You won't believe it!
There's a UFO in the sky!
- A UFO? - Yes, look!
To her, it was like a balloon monster
that floated in the air,
so I understand her surprise.
Are you bragging about your dear fairy tale princess?
I'm not bragging.
Maybe, but you're putting her feminine side on full display.
I, too, would love to board a magical ship
to a fabulous land above the clouds.
Just kidding.
I was thinking, too.
Kids!
My uncle Jirokichi is going to show us the bridge!
We'll get to see the big jewel!
Yippee!
The treasure, the treasure!
Well, do you want to see the treasure?
Yes !
Then let's go!
Yes !
Conan, Ai, you coming?
Yes.
Finally, be careful that a Peter Pan doesn't kidnap him
...and take her to Neverland.
Keep her close to you.
What are you talking about?
Professor!
Don't tell Ran what I told you about the UFO.
No, of course not.
Is everyone here?
Yes !
I'm Mr. Asano, the chief steward,
Mitsuhiro Asano, chief steward.
and I will now guide you to the bridge.
Wow!
There's glass everywhere!
You can see inside the airship.
Well, let's get ready to go!
- This is exciting! - Don't be afraid, eh?
This is the interior of Bell Tree 1.
This airship is 246 meters long,
with a maximum diameter of 42.2 meters.
Compared to the famous Hindenburg,
it is one meter larger in length and diameter.
It is indeed the largest airship in the world.
Damn...
Why did they put windows everywhere?
The cockpit is equipped with a control system
operated by a state-of-the-art computer.
What's this? There are like balloons waving!
Those are the air bags, they are filled with helium.
They look like whale lungs.
You're right! It's as if it was alive!
It's like visiting the belly of a whale.
It's bright!
You can see the sky!
Here's the treasure!
And here's Mr. Suzuki's pride...
The bridge, yes.
You can open part of the roof.
Ideal for sunbathing,
or for stargazing.
It has many different uses, but for this time...
I've done a little bit of fiddling to catch that dirty thief.
Show us the treasure!
It's not for children.
Is it?
- Come on, what! - No, it's not.
Ah, you!

Tell me, you...
Detective Nakamori?
Oh, you're here too, Mr. Mouri?
- I'll show you. - Ah, wait!
This is the lapis lazuli that will serve as bait tonight.
The great Lady Sky gem.
It's gorgeous!
This deep blue is indescribable.
There are golden sparkles shining through.
They look like stars!
Look at the biggest golden grain.
Doesn't it remind you of anything?
The biggest grain?
It is a woman's face!
That's right!
That's why it's called Lady Sky.
The naturalist Pliny the Elder of ancient Rome
described it as "a shard of heaven shining like the stars".
This treasure fits perfectly on the deck of the airship!
And why keep such a treasure behind a silly glass case?
This armored glass capable of repelling machine gun bullets
and its system that can only be opened by my fingerprint
are they beyond your comprehension?
These toys will be of no use.
They had the same thing in the lab...
What happens if you press?
Let's try it and see.
We'll soon find out.
Hey!
Hey, Dad!
Did they have this at the research center, maybe?
No, they didn't.
See what you did, you little brat?
Daddy...
Oh I see, there's a sensor in here.
He got screwed like a fish.
I admit it, yes,
they didn't have anything like that in the lab.
But... what if Kid does this?
With a gun to your head,
you'll be forced to open with your fingerprint.
That would be very surprising from him,
but what if...
Mr. Nakamori!
...this is what awaits him!
He didn't fall into the ocean, did he?
Of course he didn't.
What a ridiculous trap!
You still think it's a stupid showcase?
If I'm not mistaken...
Yes I see, that's how it works.
Anyway, we know that he will come tonight.
There's no point in standing guard before then.
Let's review our strategy.
- Follow me! - Yes!
Well, thanks for the show.
It will be useful for my report.
Excuse me, sir,
the smoking area is on B deck.
Will you come with me, Mr. Mouri?
No, thank you, I'll go to my room and rest for a while.
I'm a little shaken up.
Yeah, I bet you are.
Phew, that feels good.
- Your father was hurt, wasn't he? - Yes, he did.
By the way..,
do you like the bandages?
Do you?
The bandages, you know!
Didn't you look at them?
What, did you do something to them?
What the hell is this?
Shinichi Love
Do you like it?
You're exaggerating.
Oh no!
I gave it to an employee when I came on board!
Come on, come quickly!
Watch out!
It's not safe to run, little lady.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, thank you very much.
It's nothing.
You are bleeding!
Your elbow...
Oh, I must have bumped into something.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Here, please.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, boy.
He'll think I wrote it.
He won't even see it, it's written very small!
Pfft...
I'd love to go back and look at the jewel.
I couldn't get a good look at it with the kids in front.
Okay.
I'll be in my room.
I promised Makoto I'd send him a message.
But I won't tell him about Kid.
- See you later. - Yes, sir.
Who's there?
Hello.
Hello, uh...
I'm a waiter here.
I snuck out to see the famous jewel.
Oops.
So late already? I have to get back.
Well, I leave you.
Bye, now.
Wait!
Is there a problem ?
This bandage...
I burned myself, earlier.
You're lying!
What's wrong? No, I'm not.
You didn't? Take a closer look!
Oh no!
I gave this bandage to someone else.
What is it doing on you?
You're Kid!
Damn, I'm busted.
Come on, confess !
It doesn't look good.
My waiter's cover is blown,
but if I try to escape from him...
What are you laughing at? I'm telling you to confess!
And then what will you do?
Are you going to hand me over to Detective Nakamori?
Good idea, yes.
It is you who will have troubles, if you do that.
You still haven't guessed?
I'm not the one you think I am.
Yes, you are.

The real identity of Kaito Kid...
is me.
What's wrong with you?
- Are you okay Conan, do you have a cold? - No, it's nothing.
Well then?
You've forgotten me, after all this time?
You want me to believe that Shinichi is the Kid?
What a joke! It's just another mask.
Or not?
No, that's my real skin right there!
No, the fake Shinichi with me when I had to land a plane
wasn't wearing a mask either.
You just look like him!
Damn, I was careless!
He always comes to examine the place beforehand!
- Don't leave the jewel... - Inspector!
Bad luck, you have nowhere to run on this airship.
Give yourself up, now!
A blimp?
Don't you mean a UFO?
That's what you said when we were kids.
For you, actually,
I may look like a UFO that suddenly appeared from nowhere,
but I became Kaito Kid to solve a certain case.
What is it?
To prove it,
I always return stolen jewels to their owners, right?
Uh, but...
That's not possible... is it?
Let's see...
As a detective,
I would never let a thief like that get away with murder.
I thought that would have tipped you off.
But hey, since you got me...
too bad, I surrender.
Shinichi?
What's wrong?
- Did something happen? - Well, no...
If you saw something...
No, nothing!
I made a mistake, sorry.
Bye-bye!
This is crazy!
Is Shinichi really Kid?
So all that time he said he was busy with business,
he was playing the burglar?
Here, can you pass me that drink?
How about that? Ah, yes.
What happened to your arm?
I think I got bitten, it's itching like hell.
What a bummer to find mosquitoes here!
- Here you are. - Thank you. I'll see you later.
See you.
Hey!
I'm not convinced yet.
Well ma'am, I'll leave you to it.
Oops... Thumb!
Mr. Fujioka?
Phew, sorry!
Congratulations, Miss Kanto Karate Tournament Champion!
You have good muscles.
Oh, look! A blimp!
So cool!
It looks like a whale.
A flying whale!
Here you go.
That's great!
One more, please!
Come on, baby!
He recovered well from the shock.
"My pretty one"? Really?
Sorry for the wait.
Here's dessert.
Thank you, sir.
Finally! It looks good!
Oh?
What's that under the cream?
They look like blackberries, don't they?
Hey, Ran.
Ran, hello?
Why are you staring at him like that?
He's not your type.
It's not what you think!
I'll tell your man.
Stop it, you're imagining things!
I am, I swear.
If we open this door, we can go out through the central corridor.
And by taking the door opposite...
We'll make it, right?
Yes, we will.
Say...
Are you going somewhere?
Are you? Uh, no, no.
We just thought we'd go up to our room and play cards.
They're up to something again...
Oh, how I can't wait!
I can't wait until we get to Osaka, so I can see my dear Kid!
My dearest wish
would be to feel his perfect lips on mine...
No, no, no way!
He's a criminal, come on.
It wouldn't be right.
Why are you getting upset?
I'm not getting upset.
What's wrong?
Nothing, nothing.
Come on, let's go!
Yes.
Take your time to chew, Detective Nakamori.
I've posted people to guard the treasure.
Kid could come while we eat...
It was very good!
Well, we'll play cards in our room.
See you later!
They seem to be in a hurry.
Oh, thanks.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hey, be careful!
Put your hands in front of your nose when you sneeze.
Didn't your mother teach you that?
- I'm sorry. - That's OK.
- Come on, let's go! - Yes!
Who's calling me?
Hello, hello.
We've spread the killer bacteria in the smoking area of your blimp.
What?
What is this nonsense?
Look under the couch on the left.
Hey, wait!
Something wrong, Uncle?
No, nothing at all, just a little prank.
Inspector!
But this is...

No doubt about it.
It's the same bulb that the criminals left at the center.
And we have not made this information public.
So that means...
Yes, whoever called you was telling the truth.
They must have intentionally left
an empty light bulb in the parking lot, so that we could confirm
the authenticity of the blimp.
Damn it!
Either way, I'll be sure to inform our superiors.
Thank you, sir.
Obviously, this man was telling the truth.
Mercy!
Capturing Kid is the least of our worries now!
Seal off the smoking area quickly!
And just in case,
we'll close the bar too.
Good!
What?
Oh no!
Are you sure about this?
Maybe it's a prank.
No, unfortunately.
Our colleagues just confirmed it.
Anyway, I'll say it again,
but the smoking area on B deck is closed...
To... help...
His skin...
Oh no, is he infected?
I remember seeing him go for a smoke earlier!
Help me, I beg you!
I don't feel well...
Please stay calm!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die! Thank you.
It's okay.
Ran, go disinfect your hands quickly.
Over here!
We have some disinfectant in the pantry.
Okay. I'll get it.
I can't believe the infection has spread on board.
Did anyone else go for a smoke?
Hey, is everything okay?
She has a rash!
On her right hand and her left arm!
Jesus, her too?
Can we quarantine them somewhere?
There's a sick bay with a treatment room in the back.
There's no doctor on board today,
but we can lock it down from the outside.
Well, let's get them there.
I'll take you there.
Hey!
Yes !
We better lock up the restaurant, just in case.
All right, everyone to the common room!
Dad, wake up!
It's a good thing the kids aren't here.
Yes.
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
we need to get the kids up to speed.
Oh, yeah, right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- That was fun, right? - Yeah, really!
Let's go to the whale's tail, now!
Genta.
Whales don't have tails, they have tail fins.
- Oh yeah? - Hey, guys!
Conan!
Oh, uh...
We didn't know that was forbidden here...
Genta!
Hey, are you feeling okay?
Are you?
He doesn't have a rash.
He hasn't been infected?
Or is it still incubating?
Uh, Conan?
What's wrong with you?
I know! Come explore with us!
This is not the time.
The situation is serious!
Serious? What do you mean, serious?
Let's go back to the cabins, already.
Uh, okay.
Hide!
Stay there and don't move.
Who is he?
And what is he doing in this place
at a time like this?
I heard a lock.
Is he the one who brought the bacteria?
Who is that up there?
An accomplice of Kid?
You, then...
No.
I don't think he's with Kid.
He's probably one of the Red Siamese...
Damn!
That sucks!
Oh no!
What the hell is that?
A bomb?
Go to the back!
Let's take the stairs by the gas pipe!
Faster, faster!
Don't move!
What's up? What's up? Who are you?
Did you find the light bulb?
The Red Siamese!
We put bombs on board.
Follow our orders wisely,
and they will not explode.
Lupin! Wise!
I told you to obey wisely!
What's your status?
Here Cat F, it is good for the cockpit.
This is Cat D, same for the kitchen.
This is Cat C, the bridge is under control.
Cabins are empty.
Perfect.
Use the speakers to gather the crew in the restaurant.
Conan...
what do we do?
To the entire crew:
Report to the restaurant immediately.
Repeat:
All crew members report to the restaurant immediately!
This airship
is now under the control of the Red Siamese.
Give us your cell phones.
Dad, get up!
I don't have one!
Yes ?
The blimp is taken over.
I was afraid of this... Do we know what they want?
What are your demands? Money?
Or the release of your comrades?

We have some scores to settle with the Suzuki group.
And with this vioc, in particular.
It's true that I assisted the police ten years ago.
I helped to defeat your organization.
If that's the way it is, take me as a hostage,
but let the others go.
Oh, we can't do that.
Why not?
The blimp is on its way to Osaka!
Call the police.
However, if there's any suspicious movement,
we'll blow up the blimp.
Tell them!
And also...
This is the famous killer bacteria!
Don't try to be a hero.
Otherwise it won't be one room, but all the cabins
will be infected with the bacteria!
What is the plan, Conan?
We have to save Ai and the others!
We have to deal with those bombs first.
Haibara.
They may have an accomplice posing as a hostage.
- Be careful. - I understand.
Say, you didn't go to the smoking area, did you?
Did you?
Well, yes, but...
I just looked around.
It smelled like cigarettes, so I quickly closed the door.
No way...
That, plus the sneeze...
Don't worry, we didn't come in.
- Yeah. - And it doesn't itch.
So what do we do about the bombs?
Oh, yeah.
There are four in all.
Two of them are at the end of the hallway below.
Maybe near the gas tank.
Can you...
Can you find them?
- Of course we can! - Yes, we can.
But if you find them, don't touch them!
You call me, okay?
- I'll call you. - I understand.
And if you feel bad, even a little, you let me know.
- Is that understood? - Yes, I understand.
Ayumi and Mitsuhiko should be fine.
But Genta...
Damn it!
I just have to pray that he doesn't get infected.
Hey, where are the kids?
Don't worry, Conan is with them.
I knew it.
There must be one near the smoking area.
If this place blows up,
the bacteria in the room will spread everywhere else.
And if they blow a hole in the blimp,
it will spread outside.
But why would the terrorists
use bombs in addition to the bacteria?
Either one would have been enough to achieve their goal.
But why?
Why did they need to use the bacteria and the bombs at the same time?
To make sure they didn't miss?
Whatever the case,
as long as they don't tell us what they want,
we can only watch and wait.
Stay at a distance so that they don't see you,
but follow the airship.
I'll take care of informing the police in Osaka and the areas
they are to fly over.
Yes, sir.
We found a bomb, Conan!
I found one too!
Well... only one more to go.
Get down!
I'll get the last one.
You stay here.
Open it.
And no tricks.
That is, if you value the lives of the hostages.
What are you doing, Mr. Mizukawa?
Oh, but you're...
No, it's okay!
Mr. Mizukawa!
I said I'm fine!
- A rash! -No, you're not!
It's just an allergy!
Now that I think about it, you smell like smoke!
You've been smoking!
- And you've been... - No, I didn't!
I didn't get infected, I assure you!
I don't have any other...
- While they are distracted... - We can get them.
Lock him in the smoking area.
And if I too...
Found it!
I forgot, but the kids aren't here, right?
The kids?
Yes.
It seems to me that there were three little boys of her age,
and another girl, normally.
Look for them!
Couldn't she keep her mouth shut?
Edogawa, they know you're not here.
Edogawa! Edogawa!
Two men are looking for you...
You're a hero, huh?
You!
Are you okay?
Are you okay, Ai?
To hit a child, what a shame!
Do something like that again...
and I'll kill you!
Well, that was the last one.
Did you do that?
Just me.
They didn't do anything.
You've got guts, you.
Conan!
Shinichi!
Damn it...
- Hurray! - Kid?
- Too strong! - He caught it well!
Kid is really great!
He's my enemy, but well done!

Shinichi...
So Kid was there !
But we've got rid of two troublemakers.
Come on, put down two bombs!
I didn't expect him to throw you out the window!
What shall we do, great detective?
- Do we give up? - In your dreams, yes!
Go back to the blimp!
Don't ask the impossible.
Do you see an engine on my hang glider?
Be glad you're alive, already!
Aichi Prefecture, Sakushima
They are flying to the west.
So they are going to Osaka, as I thought.
Osaka Police Station
They are currently flying over Tsu city, Mie prefecture.
At this rate, they will reach Osaka in about an hour.
At the port of Nanko
is the Bell Tree Tower, symbol of the Suzuki group.
It is the terminus of the test flight of the airship.
Do they intend to crash the airship there?
It would be a good way to get back at the Suzuki group.
We are not sure yet,
but if it happens,
the bacteria will spread all over the prefecture.
More than seven million citizens will be in mortal danger.
We must do everything we can to prevent this.
But how can we...
Heiji!
Well then, you're too late!
I'm sorry!
Who's this kid?
Hello.
Satoshi Kawaguchi, we're related.
He moved from Yokohama to Nara in spring,
and he was visiting us today so I took him along.
He wanted to meet you, you know?
And then, you get along so well with Conan.
You like kids, right?
Well, yeah, kind of.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
If I may ask,
are you two lovers?
- No, we're childhood friends! - Idiot, where would I date her from?
- And it's not a date! - She's not my type at all!
Can I marry Kazuha, then?
Please do.
If you're sure you want her, I'll make you a gift package.
Thanks, Uncle Heiji!
What do you mean, uncle?
Don't get upset, he's just a kid.
Satoshi.
I'm very touched,
but a wedding is not to be taken lightly.
And you're too young...
I know, I know.
Boys have to be 18 to get married.
So let's wait until you're 18,
and if you haven't changed your mind by then, I'll think about it, okay?
Well, let's change the subject.
Is the blimp coming soon?
Before that, there's the confrontation with Kid.
It'll be over Osaka.
We should be able to see them from here.
We have a front row seat!
I'm such a fan of Kid!
- I'll take his picture! - I can't wait for tonight!
Kudo?
Hello? Where are you now?
Sakushima, in Mikawa Bay.
What, that far away?
I can't help it, I was thrown overboard.
What's that?
Actually, Hattori...
What are you saying?
Are you serious?
Yes.
The airship with the bacteria, bombs and terrorists
is heading your way.
That's quite a combo!
Like pork, squid and octopus noodles all at once.
There are already two people infected.
No, three.
TV director Mizukawa had a rash on his right hand.
You heard him.
I thought you should know.
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.
For now, anyway.
That's a police helicopter.
Are they following the blimp?
The police?
Sorry, I'll call you back.
Hey, wait up!
He's still got his head in the game.
Well, that's understandable.
Talking about a good restaurant makes you want to go there fast.
What, weren't you talking about an okonomiyaki place?
So, did you find out their identity?
Well, we
we've expanded our search to include acquaintances of former members...
But none of the profiles seem to match.
No luck...
Yes, this is Megure.
Inspector? It's me, Kudo.
Oh, Kudo!
I'm in Sakushima, in Aichi,
and I saw a chopper following the airship...
Yes, Sato and Takagi are on it.
I have to tell you...
I know about the terrorists.
I have a request about that.
Yes ?
I'd like to come aboard your helicopter.
I, Shinichi Kudo.

And how will you bring them Shinichi Kudo?
It's you, I remind you!
Think about it!
I'm asking you to disguise yourself as me.
Damn it...
What, again?
Uh, forget it!
I want to do you a favor, but don't disturb my work!
I can't promise anything,
but I'll do what I can!
Good.
Cat E, begin preparations.
Got it.
What are you doing?
Are you preparing something?
It's been a long time, Kudo.
Yes.
But I didn't expect to find Conan with you.
Did you have something to do in Sakushima?
I'll tell you later,
we have to follow the airship.
Follow it.
I see the airship!
Get us closer!
But make sure they don't see us.
Got it.
What is the wind direction and our current speed?
Southeast, and 200 km/h.
Keep going until we catch up,
then adjust our speed to theirs.
Kudo?
What are you doing, Kudo?
Well, we'll leave you here!
- It's Kid! - What is it?
Your wings, your wings!
Fold your wings!
Hurry up and fold them!
I can't press the button while carrying you!
What the hell...
Hey, where are you putting your hand?
Stop it!
Stop fidgeting, I'm looking for the button!
- But you're tickling me. - Deal with it!
Hey, that's...
Look out!
Move us away!
But then... Kudo...
Was it Kid?
Well, goodbye, good luck with the rest.
Aren't you coming?
I'm going to stay here a while and assess the situation.
Their leader stole the jewel, so...
Oh, by the way.
Catch.
What's this?
Mr. Jirokichi's fingerprint.
Thank you, sir.
I thought he would use a fingerprint system,
but it's of no use to me anymore, so I'll give it to you.
However, you should be careful
with your little darling.
Fujioka grabbed her arms earlier.
But she pushed him away,
and he didn't cough or sneeze,
so she must not have been contaminated,
but I'm telling you just in case.
Anything?
I thought they would have put it back here.
Not there either...
Did they put them in other places?
At the end of the day, I only found two.
And they put them
where Genta and the others found them.
Why did they do that?
Why didn't they put them back in the places
where the bacteria is spread?
Anyway, let's take these down.
Kudo, what the hell?
You said you'd call me back, but you never did!
- Kudo? - Uh, no...
You've got some nerve, Conan!
Sorry, I completely forgot.
You're abusing... Where are you now?
In the blimp.
You're already back in it?
You don't hang around.
What else did you want? I'm a little busy right now.
The terrorists released the information on the Internet,
so Osaka is in a panic.
What's going on?
Everyone wants to flee to the west, the trains are full.
I'm telling you the train is full!
- Take the one to Tokyo... - No, that's where the bacteria came from!
More trains are coming, don't push!
There's still room!
Take the next one!
All roads and highways to the west are jammed.
Even the bankers and security guards
have been ordered to evacuate, I hear.
It's time for a robbery.
I wouldn't advise it.
They've tightened security everywhere.
I was just kidding!
We're talking about adults here, so stay out of it.
Security?
Hey.
Oh, it's you. Don't scare me like that.
You're missing out.
Sorry, I'll call you back.
Hey!
Pfft, he hung up again.
What's he playing at?
Say, Kazuha...
Yes ?
Who was Uncle Heiji calling?
Conan.
Conan?
He's a very smart boy your age!
He gets along well with Heiji.
- So they weren't just adults... - Hey!
Are you done picking up on everything I say?
Yes, yes, our apologies...
Uncle Heiji.
What did you want to show me?
Smoke bombs?
What are they doing?
Once we get over these mountains, we'll be in Nara.

With all this smoke coming out,
the people of Nara will freak out!
You don't think you're saying it right, there will be panic!
Panic?
They talked about the bacteria and the bombs on the Internet.
Everyone is evacuating.
If this is happening in Nara,
it's a great opportunity for a thief.
Don't be a fool!
Even if people run away, security is still...
Security...
Don't tell me they go to Nara to...
Maybe, who knows?
But...
If that's the case, then why...
did they use the bacteria for that?
Yes. I see.
Okay, got it!
I'm on it!
Where are you going, Heiji?
To Nara.
Nara?
Why are you going to Nara?
Is it to do with the airship?
Yes.
It's dangerous, don't follow me.
Take me too!
Don't be stupid, I just said not to follow me!
I know Nara well, I'll be useful!
I'm coming too!
You too, are you going to do it?
- First of all, we can't go up with three people... - Don't worry about it!
I have an idea!
Hold on tight!
Yes!
Are you all right, Satoshi?
Yes, I'm fine.
It won't take long, cheer up.
This isn't exactly legit...
No...why?
Ran?
Ran!
Ran! Ran!
Don't move!
Ran!
A rash...
Help me, please!
Get your hands off me!
Come on, get in there!
Don't touch me!
What the hell...
What's the meaning of this?
Like Kid said,
he couldn't have infected her just by touching her.
Ran pushed him away quickly,
and Mr. Fujioka didn't cough or sneeze.
Conversely,
Genta got sneezed on,
and he breathed in the air from the smoking area, but he wasn't infected.
Why?
TV director Mizukawa had a rash on his right hand.
If that's the case...
The blimp will crash!
We'll all be infected!
The ship is full of bombs!
Gofuku-ji
We've come to get you!
Come on, hurry up!
We have to evacuate quickly!
But... what about the Buddha statues?
The Buddha won't get infected!
Please come upstairs quickly!
- What if the gods punish us? - You'll see to that!
Come on, get in!
Ran...
I'm worried...
- Go see. - I will.
Hey...
You...!
Cat A.
What is it, Cat A? Answer me!
- Go see what he's got. - All right!
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Hey!
What's up? Is he asleep?
B Cat!
What happened?
Cat B!
Cat B is lying on the floor.
It's weird.
Still, a cat,
it lands on its feet.
It's Conan!
He's back!
Yes, with Kid!
Kid's not here, no.
Damn it!
Cats C, D and E! Get that kid!
No, shoot him as soon as you find him!
Roger that.
Gotcha!
You, watch the restaurant.
F-Cat!
Roger that!
I'll switch to autopilot and meet you there!
Damn it!
Damn it!
The kid is on the bridge!
One and...
...seven!
The trap for Kid will have been useful.
Not to mention this.
Wait a minute...
What if he gave it to me on purpose so I could use it?
Don't move!
Throw this on the floor.
Stand still and raise your arms.
I've seen it all. You know how this thing works.
Come on, go activate it!
Do I have to?
- Just do what I tell you! - I'll do it.
I'm not like the others...
I would have warned you.
You brat!
Wow, seriously?
What's all this?
The three traps Mr. Jirokichi set for you.
Wow.
If I stole the jewel
and threw my grappling hook out the window...
That was a close call!
The old man did it hard!
But otherwise, you...
were you hiding there all this time?
Here, take this!
Impressive.
And here is the reward for the brave.
The remaining people, are you there?
I beat your leader.
And then the other three.
What? He's fucking with us!
Go for it, Lupin!
Bravo!
No, but! It's not a toy, you know?
Edogawa? We got both of them.
Got it.
Nice call history...

And all this in the last three hours alone.
Hey, who were you calling?
There's a ton of calls.
Well, if you don't want to tell me...
What are you going to do with this?
If you don't tell me everything,
I'm gonna dump it on you.
Do whatever you want.
Okay, let's take a break.
Slowly...
I see!
You had a good idea there.
The blimp and the bioterrorism were just diversions.
Your real objective was to create panic so you could have a free hand
to steal all the national treasures from the temple at once.
They wanted to take advantage of the low level of security at the temple, right?
Normally people don't try to steal Buddha statues.
This is a move to be cursed!
What are you talking about?
We just want to put them somewhere safe.
Well, then give me the name of one of the Nara detectives.
Whoever you want, come on!
Well, I...
What, you don't know any of them?
That's suspicious for policemen.
There's one easy to remember, though!
One whose name reminds us of the Nara deer...
They're just kids.
Get them.
Hello? What did you say?
They say we're just kids.
- What's wrong? - They're so stupid!
It's clear.
Do you think we were going to come
with only three of us, against thieves?
What?
Damn it!
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm an inspector from Nara's 3rd division.
Tsuyoshi Shikatsuno!
Tsuyoshi Shikatsuno Nara police
Memorize it well.
Don't underestimate the Nara police!
Kudo, it's me.
We caught all the guys who wanted to steal the statues.
Oh, and the monks and everything else is fine!
Okay, thanks, Heiji.
Wow!
So the kid detective from Osaka handled everything?
Who's got it all figured out?
Oh, by the way...
Here you go.
Oh, thanks, kid.
Leave that aside, we have to get Ran to the hospital soon!
Oh yeah, about that...
Ran?
Conan!
No, stay away from me!
Don't worry about it, Ran.
No one was actually infected with the bacteria!
But this rash...
It's just an allergic reaction...
...caused by sumac, a poisonous tree.
Sumac?
The man who brought you here,
he's the same man who brought Mr. Mizukawa here, right?
Yes.
I knew it.
He was probably the only one of them who was immune to sumac toxins.
His fingernails were black.
He must have been a sumac lacquer maker before.
In short,
these men hadn't actually stolen any bacteria at all.
They blew up the lab
just to make it look like bioterrorism.
The proof is this ampoule.
I pretended to open it in front of their boss,
but he didn't seem to mind.
If the bacteria had really been in there,
he would have done anything to stop me.
Just like you did when you told me to stay away.
Conan...
Isn't that right, Uncle?
Yes.
Are you okay, Ran?
Yes.
And then...
In addition to the first ones..,
you also have a rash on your palms, elbows,
and behind your knees, right?
Oh yes!
The criminals probably
spread sumac all over the room.
On the walls, the sofas, the door handle...
That's why you,
got a rash on your arms where Mr. Fujioka touched you
after you came here to smoke,
but apart from that,
you only get a rash where you come in contact
with...
Wait a minute.
This person...
No !
Hey! What's wrong with him?
Conan?
Damn it!
The Nara police called.
They've discovered the identity of those thugs.
They all have experience as guards abroad.
Guards?
So the Red Siamese...
They had no connection with them.
They only took their name
to cover up the theft of the Buddha statues.
And this is the person who hired them.
Wait a moment.
Running away and leaving your subordinates behind
it's a bit cowardly, isn't it?
But you're their boss,
Takamichi Fujioka.
You're good, kid, for figuring me out.
No, I didn't.

You played your first infected act well.
I really bought it.
I assume that right after takeoff
your accomplice released sumac extract into the room
and left a blister.
Under your orders, of course.
Then you entered the smoking area
to let the toxin affect you.
All to make us believe
that you were infected with the bacteria.
And if you invited Kogoro to come and smoke on the bridge...
Will you come with me, Mr. Mouri?
And grabbing Ran's arms...
was to eliminate possible troublemakers from the picture...
by making them look infected.
But since Kogoro didn't follow you as planned..,
you had to put a sleeping pill in his beer.
Because of that he snoozed well the whole time.
Mr. Mizukawa's and the waitress' rashes
were located on their palms.
They must have touched something in the room.
Genta, on the other hand,
just walked into the room without touching anything,
so he didn't have a rash.
In short, you were the only one...
with a rash in the most unlikely places, like your face.
Plus, the chief had obviously spent the time calling someone.
That tipped me off.
You caused your own rash
with the sumac spread all over the room
to make it look like there was a risk of infection
and isolate you from the others.
So you could command the terrorists without being seen.
You were running everything in the shadows!
I admire your deductive mind, kid.
But you're wrong about one crucial thing.
What?
First of all, I'm not running away alone.
I hate to break it to you,
- but all your men... - You're wrong.
I'm not talking about the ones I paid,
I'm talking about the ones who were here before.
There were others?
Don't move!
Sonoko!
You were told not to move.
There were two others, Edogawa.
The cameraman and the reporter were accomplices!
Damn it!
Secondly, I didn't come here to run away...
but to lure you!
What?
Do you know why our objective
was those Buddha statues and not money?
In our computerized society,
the money flows are immediately traced.
But these priceless statues
did not present this risk.
Japanese statues of this kind are prized abroad.
I already had buyers!
I wanted to thank you in person for messing up!
We still have plenty of time.
We're going to have fun.
Good job, Hattori!
It's all thanks to Conan.
Other than that, can you get to the airship?
I can't get in touch with the kid.
I have a bad feeling about this.
That's fine.
Okay, Satoshi,
you're going home.
But...
I know.
It's thanks to you that we saved the statues.
Say, uncle Heiji?
I think the thieves will go to Gofuku-ji.
Their statues are national treasures.
Alright, got it!
- So take me... - No, I won't.
It's too risky.
Go back with Kazuha.
Satoshi, let's do as he says, okay?
Your mother must be worried.
All right, then.
In exchange, can I meet Conan next time?
That's who you're going to save, right, uncle Heiji?
Okay, I promise!
Kazuha, I'll let you bring him back.
Yes, I'll do it!
- And you be careful. - Don't worry.
Well, shall we go?
Yes...
I can't believe you were in on it!
It's okay on my end.
Hey!
You're untying us, right?
Ah, sorry!
I forgot to tell you there's been a change of plan.
What do you mean, change of plan?
In the end, this is all we could get.
So you're going to have to
die with them.
What?
Before we end this, let me tell you something.
We'll say our goodbyes
when we get to the bridge where a cruiser is waiting.
And right after that, the blimp will explode.
Specifically, the cabins with the hostages.
So that's what this was about.
I assume it was you who removed the bombs near the tank,

but there are still two in the cabins.
Damn!
But hey, before all that...
you're going to give me the pleasure of feeding the fishes!
Damn... what do I do?
I need to find a way to reverse the situation !
Here we are, here is the blimp !
It's flying really low.
Hey...
it doesn't look like...
Yes, it's going to crash into the Akashi Strait bridge!
We can see the harbor tower!
And Rokko's anchor!
It looks great!
You hope to distract me
so that I'll hit my head on the bridge?
You won't get me that easily!
Will you?
What the hell was that?
Holy crap!
Oh, my God!
The whale took a dive!
Hello?
Hey, Kudo, are you okay?
Hattori, you're just in time.
Call the coast guard, will you?
The Coast Guard?
Fujioka, the head of the operation, fell overboard.
The culprit fell into the water, you say?
And another thing...
There should be a cruiser with their accomplices near the bridge.
I'll let you arrest them!
I'll do it!
I'll see you later.
Tomorrow we'll have okonomiyaki.
It'll be great, you'll see.
Hey, Hattori.
Was that Kudo you had on the phone?
Yes.
I have a question for you.
Is Kudo...
Is Kaito Kid?
Is he?
Hey, is everyone okay?
Yes, we're fine.
I got a bit scared, that's all.
What about the other two?
If you mean the culprits, they are passed out over there.
They hit the wall during the tremor.
Serves them right.
We were lucky to be tied up after all.
Well, what a surprise!
I was watching the situation in the lobby
when the floor suddenly gave way!
Kid, damn you!
The big Kid!
Where's Conan?
The kid? He's all right.
He'll join you soon.
Well, I'll let you untie the others.
Untie me too, my dear Kid!
Wait, Kid!
You'll untie him last, of course!
Kid! You son of a...
Well, dear friends,
As promised, I'm taking your treasure.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't run away, Kid!
You little brigand!
I prefer "phantom thief"!
And the bombs?
Very well, I see. Good job!
All the hostages are safe,
and all the criminals have been arrested!
With that, the case is solved.
Yes.
I'm starving!
It's finally time for dinner!
They have rice with eel, I hope!
But I feel like we're forgetting something.
Yeah, me too...
Well, it's time for the long awaited quiz!
No one was expecting it!
Ayumi, Genta and Mitsuhiko are all honest,
but which ones can ride a blimp?
Is that all?
Do you want a hint?
None of the three, right?
If all three are honest,
then they're not thieves.
If they don't steal, they don't steal either...
in a blimp.
- I get it! - Yes, you do.
If that damn thief was as bad as this riddle,
I'd have caught him and been on the front page by now!
Hey, Sonoko?
Where's Ran?
That's right, she's taking a long time.
She told me to go ahead, so I thought she was just going to the bathroom.
I saw her take the elevator up.
Maybe she went to see Kid?
What?
He's not transparent, so...
Shinichi.
Hey, Shinichi...
Damn, I forgot about that!
Hi, Ran.
A lot happened today, didn't it?
Shinichi!
Turn yourself in, Shinichi!
Stealing is really bad!
Please, Shinichi!
Okay, I'll do it.
Now...
If you give me the treasure
that I want most in the world, I'll go to the police.
But I don't have any treasure.
I'm talking about of course...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Only the sound of the wind
Enveloped me then
A silent kiss
A presence like a dream
My heart tightens as I think
Of this season by your side
The blue sky is now fading
A fitting happy ending
I search in vain for it
If my heart were free, I'd fly away
Overdrive with the dancers of the skies
I want to live in a world that is all blue

With dancing birds like confetti, splendid
With the excitement of being carried by a tailwind
I think of this unknown destination
I'll finally raise all my precious expectations
The glittering sea
Seems ready to suck me in
Starry night, high in the sky
The final scene is approaching
But I can't reach it yet
Even this uncertain future comforts me
Overdrive shaken by this growing love
Look at me and show me your innocent smile
My heart slips through, like the wind
I wish I could get closer
I wish in this endless sky
I'm waiting for the day when I meet the real you
Overdrive with the dancers of the skies
I want to live in a world that is all blue
With dancing birds like confetti, splendid
With the excitement of being carried by a tailwind
I think of that unknown destination
I will finally raise all my precious expectations
I'm waiting for the day I meet the real you
You're not Shinichi at all, are you?
Conan!
Kid, you...
Indeed, I'm not a detective, but a thief.
And sometimes my profession leads me
to steal even hearts...
Oh, Kid... He's fabulous!
I hardly share your opinion after what he did to me.
What did he do to you?
Oh, the Lady Sky!
Kid gave it back!
Hey! What did Kid do to you?
Something Shinichi would never do!
Why would he do that? Why wouldn't Shinichi do it?
Why do you think so?
Well, because...
It's not because I love him, right! Don't get any ideas!
About what?
Wait, Ran!
Wait, hey...
What did he do to her?
