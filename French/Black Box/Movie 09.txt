Hideto Yashiro (49) Naval Draftsman, Yashiro Co.
How beautiful.
Yes.
If only Shinichi could see
this beautiful sunset.
I can see it.
What are you doing?
You can see better from above!
Uh, OK.
It's true that I can see better...
but shame on you!
We saw you, Conan!
Damn it!
Put me down, Ran!
- We saw everything! - Yes, we did!
You were being pampered by Ran again!
Damn it, you idiots!
You're all red, Conan!
Don't talk nonsense! It's sunset!
Liar, you're just blushing!
Idiot, it's not true!
Idiot, it's not true!
Don't talk nonsense! It's the sunset!
It reminds me of that day.
Doesn't it? Of what?
No, nothing!
Come on, tell me !
It's nothing, I tell you !
Don't do it to me, I saw your smile !
DETECTIVE CONAN - IN-DEPTH STRATEGY
My name is Shinichi Kudo, high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug, and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name, I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
To find out who these thugs are,
I arranged to live with Ran, whose father is a detective.
I'm in first grade at Teitan School, class B!
Genta Kojima!
Same class, Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya!
And Ayumi Yoshida!
- With my apprentice, Conan... - And Ai...
We're the Junior Detectives!
This cute detective badge
has a super compact built-in transceiver!
It's a little gem that doubles as a communicator!
And this watch-lamp that we have on our wrist
is totally waterproof!
You can use it even underwater!
These two inventions,
we owe them to professor Agasa.
He has been helping me since I got younger,
creating one unique invention after another.
In particular:
Hypodermic projectile watch
Voice modulator bow tie
the voice modulator bow tie and the hypodermic projectile watch.
Thanks to these two devices,
the sleeping detective Kogoro is born!
Say, about Haibara...
She always keeps her calm.
She's really mature, isn't she?
It's normal!
Ai Haibara.
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.
She used to work with the men in black,
but to escape from the organization,
she swallowed the same drug as me,
and also shrank.
Anyway,
I went from being a high school detective to a child detective.
And while solving a lot of investigations,
I'm secretly trying to find out who the men in black are.
But still, Uncle...
It would be nice if you worked a little harder on your deductions...
My body is younger, but not my mind!
I will solve all the mysteries!
There is only one truth!
Wow, this is huge!
It's the ultimate luxury!
Of course it is!
The Yashiro Group is a large conglomerate.
And this is the very first cruise ship
of their subsidiary, the Yashiro shipping company.
No wonder they're pulling out all the stops!
Mr. Mouri.
Are you Mr. Mouri?
Uh, yes.
I'll set up a table for you.
Thank you for waiting a moment.
What is it, Professor?
Huh? Oh, this?
It's just a dictaphone.
If I think of a new invention,
I can record it right away, like this.
Ah, by the way!
Speaking of invention...
Tadam!
The loudspeaker cufflinks,
with listening function.

It's a nice accessory, tell me.
I like it!
Cufflinks!
It's perfect timing. I'll borrow them!
- But that's... - You little fool!
This kind of thing is for dandies like me!
You're still too young for it to fit you!
But Dad, it's a little...
It's okay, Ran...
It wouldn't do me any good on the boat.
Oh, Mr. Mouri?
You're Kogoro Mouri, the great detective, right?
That's me, yes...
Fabulous!
Who's that one?
I'm a scriptwriter.
Hironari Kusaka (26) Writer
My name is Hironari Kusaka.
I'm a fan of yours!
Well, thank you.
Ah, let me introduce you:
Miss Minako Akiyoshi.
She is the assistant director of the group that designed this ship.
She is also the one who gave it the beautiful name of Aphrodite.
Minako Akiyoshi (32 years old) Naval designer, Yashiro Company
My name is Akiyoshi, nice to meet you.
I'm Mouri.
Wow, what a hottie!
Yes...
Excuse me, Mr. Mouri?
Sorry for the wait.
- Your table is ready. - Ah, excuse me!
Would you mind adding two more seats?
Do you mind, Mr. Mouri?
Uh, no.
Well, this way please.
Don't you think your father is strange?
What's wrong with him?
Well, I was expecting something like:
"Oh, Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty and love ?
"That name suits you better than the boat!"
Don't you?
It's probably because
because Miss Minako looks like my mother.
Oh, right!
It's true, now that you mention it!
Just the kind of woman he's weak against.
To tell you the truth,
I'm writing a script
for a series taking place on a liner.
I interviewed Miss Minako, and that's how we met.
Yes, that's right.
Oh, I see.
And you, by the way, were invited, of course?
Unless you're on a case?
Uh, I was invited, well sort of...
Uh, actually it's not that.
What's not the point?
Well, our invitation was
for Sonoko's parents.
Her father is the leader of the Suzuki group.
But my parents couldn't make it,
so I'm coming in their place.
And I thought that it would be more fun with several people.
She gave us an invitation to all eight of us.
Okay, I understand.
I guess you could say I'm here to watch them!
I see.
I see...
What kind of story are you writing?
The story of a trip around the world on a luxury liner?
- That's great! - Isn't it?
Or maybe the story of a shipwreck
during a maiden voyage, like in Titanic.
Come on, Ai...
Speaking of sinking,
there was an incident at the Yashiro company
where a merchant ship ran into an iceberg, right?
Yes.
Fifteen years ago, in winter.
I think I remember that the captain was at fault.
One of the crew died,
and the commander went down with his ship.
Is this true?
What do we do if this one sinks too?
I can only swim 7 meters!
Don't be afraid.
The commander of the Aphrodite is a good navigator,
and there are no icebergs around here.
Anyway.
If the boat were to sink, the first to be saved
would be them.
Oh, but isn't that Mr. Niimi?
The former prime minister...
And his retinue.
- There are also TV stars... - Wow!
It's the Uruwashi sisters!
They really do have great bodies!
They're all guests of the president of the Yashiro Group...
Ah, talk about the wolf.
This is the father and daughter Yashiro.
Takae Yashiro (51 years old) Director of Yashiro Cruises
Entaro Yashiro (78 years old) President of Yashiro Group
The daughter, Takae, got married and runs their cruise line.
By the way, the husband of the director Takae
died recently in a traffic accident.
- Did he? - Yes, he did.
Mr. Hideto Yashiro.
He was my superior
and the chief designer of this boat.
Oh, I see...
It seems to me that he had a heart attack while driving
and his car fell off a cliff.
Ah, there's the commander!
How classy!
That's Commander Wataru Kaido.

During the incident 15 years ago that we were talking about,
it was the ship's XO.
What? Does it bother you?
The accidental death of Hideto Yashiro?
Yes.
I still think it's odd
that he had a heart attack on the edge of a cliff.
But the police investigation
didn't reveal anything suspicious, right?
No, but...
Well, why not.
I see nothing wrong with investigating until I'm satisfied.
I'll contact the authorities myself.
Thank you, sir.
Ah, Miss Sato, do you need help?
Don't you have a report to finish?
- Well, yes... - Chiba!
- Can you help me? - I'll be right there!
Well, since we're all being served...
Let me do it, Mr. Mouri!
Uh, okay.
Well, let's..,
let us raise our glasses to this beautiful cruise,
but also...
To Ran winning the Kanto Tournament!
Huh?
Cheers!
Cheers!
Thank you...
Hey, Sonoko!
Hey, Ran!
It's great that you won a karate tournament!
And the Kanto tournament too!
It's too good, too good!
So what?
Kudo congratulated you?
Shinichi?
I told him on the phone,
and he said: "Oh yeah? Cool."
What, that's it?
He must be busy with a case or something.
That obsessed investigator.
I had already praised her a million times as Conan.
I ate too much!
The steak was good, huh?
I could eat it every day!
Now for dessert!
What's wrong with it?
I'm a little seasick.
I'm a bit dizzy too!
I think it's the booze that's making you dizzy!
You're being hard on me, Ran!
Your father's a real piece of work.
Oh no, he's just a drunk!
Please forgive me.
I'll leave you to rest in the cabin for a while.
Are you going to be okay?
Yes, I have some pills in my cabin.
- See you later. - Take care of yourself!
Hey, Dad!
Are you sure you're okay?
Kogoro Mouri reporting, I'm fine, yes!
Don't worry, Ran.
Just put him to bed.
Sorry about that.
Well, Conan, I'll leave it to you, shall I?
Yes !
You too, Professor. Sorry.
Oh, I don't mind.
He doesn't mind!
Good night, Ran dear!
- It's open, Professor. - Ah, good.
Well, let's go too!
Okay.
"Okay, Conan!"
"I entrust him to you, okay?"
Oh?
Hi!
We let ourselves in!
What are you all doing here?
We wanted to celebrate Ran's victory...
by preparing a gift for him!
With these?
Aren't they beautiful?
We picked them up on the island where we were earlier!
We're going to make a gold medal with them as a present for him!
Shinichi didn't give her anything, poor thing.
Good luck.
I'm going to take my bath.
Your bath?
What's that? Do you want to come with me?
Oh no! I...
Let me remind you of tomorrow's schedule.
Breakfast at 7:00.
A tray will be brought to your cabin.
Natsuho Tsujimoto (25) Attending staff
After that,
At 9:00, Madame will have a game of squash with Ms. Niimi.
The court on the 7th floor has been reserved.
Mr. will play pool with Mr. Niimi at 9:30.
You have a reservation at the 3rd floor bar.
After the squash game, Madam
will return to her cabin at 9:30, after which...
How nice!
That's right.
A good tea in the morning, with that little sea air...
That's something!
Yes, it's really something.
It's something...
- Right this way. - Thank you.
The wind has died down, hasn't it?
It has.
Have you seen the director's legs?
She doesn't look like she's in her fifties!
- Don't start in the morning, you! - Professor!
Are you coming soon?
You know, your quiz!
We know you're going to do it, so we might as well get it over with now!
They're totally enjoying themselves with him.
Well, I'll answer your request.
Here's a quiz related to this cruise.
During the cruise, Genta is taken to the infirmary.
Question!
What happened to Genta?
Answer 1:
He ate too much and had a liver attack.

Answer 2:
He tripped and sprained his ankle.
Answer 3:
He stayed in the sun too long and got a heat stroke.
So, what do you say?
Knowing Genta, I would say 1.
Bzzt! It's not 1!
I can eat any way I want without getting sick!
Ah, I found it !
I've got it too!
But this quiz is too hard for kids.
- They don't speak English... - Sonoko!
English?
That's a clue, right?
The second clue is the boat.
The boat?
I've got it!
It's number 2, he sprained his ankle!
Bateau is ship in English!
And shippu, compress in Japanese!
Good answer!
By the way, friendship is friendship.
And a rumor is called gosship.
But no, it's gossip!
Well, let's talk at 10 o'clock.
Yes.
Oh right, ship and shippu!
Hey, Mitsuhiko...
If we all stumble, we'll be in the same boat!
What kind of joke is this?
- That'd be too bad! - By the way!
Hey, when do we give it to her?
Now, if you want.
Hey,
why don't we do this?
Let's go get our last drinks, Ran?
Sure thing.
Let's make this cruise worthwhile!
You've already made it worth your while!
Oh no, not yet, far from it!
We're going to get...
To look for a drink!
Which soda I will take?
- Come on, let's go! - Yeah!
Wait for me!
Why are they getting so excited?
Yes ?
"I know what happened 15 years ago.
"Meet me in the ship's hold at 10:15."
I see.
It really happened just outside his villa.
Yes.
Let's go see the house.
Let's see...
What should we do now?
It's still a little cold for swimming.
I'm going to change soon.
Change?
In fact, the Uruwashi sisters
invited me!
What's that?
They want to hear the stories of the great detective Kogoro Mouri!
See you later!
He's not wasting his time, your father.
When did he talk to them?
Let's forget about him.
Otherwise, what do you want to do?
Well...
Ah, I want to play hide and seek!
It could be fun!
Yeah, come on!
Hide and seek? Brings back memories.
- We used to play this a lot when we were kids, right? - Yes!
In the park, at my house...
I used to play it at school.
Did you?
Sorry, but I'm not going.
Come on, Conan!
You're not nice!
That reminds me that Shinichi also refused.
Let's play hide and seek!
Well, it will pass the time.
And you, Professor?
I booked a massage.
A real grandpa.
Well, let's decide the rules.
The game will last 30 minutes.
We can hide from the first to the seventh floor.
But not in the cabins, the areas off-limits to the public,
restrooms, or showers.
How's that sound?
All right!
All right, let's get together!
One, two, three! Rock, paper, scissors!
Come on, it's Sonoko the cat!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This isn't going to work!
Finding six people in 30 minutes in this huge boat,
it's just not possible!
Well, what if we added a cat as an exception?
How about that? There will be two cats?
Why not, it's a bit of a change.
Let's do a rock-paper-scissors again!
Good luck with that.
Thanks, you too.
That's an unusual pair.
Oh, yeah.
Lend me your detective badge.
Why?
With two cats, we won't know who's been found.
We'll communicate with each other with these badges.
Pff, don't lose it, eh?
All right, you can start looking in five minutes, at 9:50,
and if you find everyone by 10:20,
you win.
OKAY.
We'll beat you!
Sorry, but we're going to win! After all...
We have Conan with us!
Don't lean on me...
Come on, let's go!
The hide-and-seek starts!
See you later!
You're in for a treat!
Ran didn't realize anything!
She'll find out during the game.
She'll be so surprised!
Yeah, right!
- My turn! - She's got it!
Here, it won't fit...
When is the movie again?
At 10:00, right?
Let's go!
- Hurry up! - It's about to start!
That's not right.

Yeah!
To think that I'm the cat...
But it's not bad to be one of the seekers, for a change.
It's been five minutes.
I'm going to look upstairs, from the 5th floor.
I'll leave the rest to you.
Oh, OK.
Say, Kudo...
Hi, Haibara.
Did you hear
that we're playing hide and seek here?
And one found!
Pff!
How did you find me?
It's obvious that a little glutton is going to hide in the dining room.
Haibara...
It's the teacher's, I guess,
but you've lost your way.
Let's go, I found it!
I thought I was well hidden...
It is not yet that!
You still need ten years of practice to beat me!
Yes, this is Akiyoshi.
Ah, Miss Minako? It's Kusaka.
Yes ?
Well, let's not waste time.
Let's start with the characters.
"Nanami Okazaki, 20 years old.
"Attendant at the luxury liner, the Southern Cross."
Well, now I'll read the story.
"Nanami Okazaki loved the sea.
"Probably her childhood spent in front of the Genkai sea
"was the origin of her love for the immensity of the ocean."
We found the first four easily, but...
As I suspected, there's still the strongest one.
Is Miss Ran that strong to hide?
She's a real ninja!
How many elementary school children hang from the ceiling
or hide at the bottom of a pond?
The... ceiling?
In a pond?
Wow...
She was always a baller, even as a kid.
We still have 12 minutes.
Let's look for her.
Not there either...
10h11...
Oh, I've only got nine minutes left...
It's Mouri, I'm here!
I'm going to avenge my father!
I'm counting down!
Only 5 seconds left!
Four!
Three! Three!
Two!
One!
Zero!
- We are the winners! - Yippee!
- It's all thanks to Ran the Ninja! - Yeah, right?
Ran!
- Hooray! - I told you we'd win.
Where have you been hiding, Ran?
You spent the whole game kicking your soccer ball, didn't you?
You have to play seriously!
Looks like Ran hasn't seen it yet.
That's strange...
Is her head in the clouds?
Is she still looking?
What's up? What's up?
Ah, it's cold!
It's freezing here! Where am I?
A box?
Am I in a box?
No !
Help! Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you, Sonoko?
Quick, come and help me!
Calm down, Sonoko! Where are you?
I don't know, I'm... In a box somewhere!
I've been attacked!
- Help me! Help me! - Wait, I can't hear you!
Say it again!
Get me out of here!
Get me out of here now!
What, no batteries?
Damn, just now...
Are you cold, Sonoko?
Is the box cold?
A cold place...
The cold room!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Where's the cold room?
Cold storage?
Please, please, please! My friend is in danger!
Uh, second basement.
Hey, there's plenty!
Where is she?
Let's split up!
Yes !
Sonoko!
Hey!
Miss Sonoko!
Sonoko!
Are you there?
Sonoko, where are you?
She doesn't seem to be there.
- Let's go outside. - Yes, let's...
It was too cold...
- She's not there, Conan. - Sonoko! Sonoko!
- Where the hell is she? - Answer me, please!
Where can she be?
She could be dead already...
Don't jinx it!
Well, yeah, but...
This is the only place where it's cold!
Dead?
Over there!
Morgue
Morgue A morgue in a boat?
That's unexpected...
It's heavy!
Sonoko!
Sonoko!
We have to get him to the clinic, quickly!
I'm alive again.
You've got nothing to worry about.
Once you're warm.
and after a little rest, you'll be able to move normally.
Thank you so much.
I was so afraid, Sonoko !
But still...
Who made this bad joke ?
A joke?
It's not a joke!
It was attempted murder!
Call the police immediately.
Yes, I understand.
Tell me what happened.

Where were you attacked?
In the hold.
I was looking for Ran...
when someone hit me in the shoulder with a stick of some kind.
I passed out right away.
Did you see who did it, then?
I think so..,
but I don't remember.
And the time?
Oh, that I remember!
It was 10:11.
10h11...
I see.
From here
we can reach the morgue quickly.
But why was Sonoko attacked?
This is...
President Yashiro's fan!
What's it doing here?
No one's here.
Mr. Mouri!
The commander called the police...
Uh...
This is Mr. Yashiro's cabin.
Yes.
The Uruwashi sisters told me.
But besides, I saw someone coming out of it.
Someone?
I didn't see his face.
He was wearing a windbreaker and a hood.
When was this?
It must have been 10:15.
Are you sure, Mr. Mouri?
It is strange.
Neither of them was wearing a windbreaker.
And at this hour,
only Director Takae should be here.
Tell me,
if he was wearing a hooded windbreaker in the corridor,
wasn't it to hide his face?
Do you think the director?
Madam!
It's Tsujimoto! Madam!
Hey, you have a master key, right?
But I...
Madam, I'm going in!
- Madam! - Don't move!
Wait here.
Oh no!
Who could have done this?
She must have been dead for about thirty minutes.
I'll inform the commander!
Me, the president!
She was stabbed coming out of the bathroom...
The blood was wiped here.
Why was it here?
Why only here?
What the hell are you doing?
Uh-oh!
No, but!
Mr. Mouri!
It's President Yashiro!
According to Mr. Niimi, he left in the middle of a pool and didn't come back!
How did he get there?
If that's possible,
President Yashiro is also involved in this case.
Hello.
Mr. Mouri!
Thank you for coming so quickly, Inspector.
Have you found Mr. Yashiro?
No, I haven't.
The crew is looking for him all over the ship, but...
However..,
in the sky or at sea, business follows you everywhere!
The next one will be in space?
On board a rocket, maybe.
Don't talk nonsense!
What is it?
Mr. Yashiro's fingerprints?
Yes.
They were found near the outer door, with traces of blood.
And of course, these traces of blood
match with President Yashiro's blood type.
Good job.
I'll let you continue the research.
One more thing, Inspector.
According to the personnel working at the cargo hold,
there are signs that the door has been opened and closed.
And very recently.
What's that?
Prints, blood,
and an open door...
Inspector, it seems...
It seems that Mr. Yashiro was attacked in the hold.
and that person threw him into the water through the door.
Everything indicates that this is what happened.
Yes, it looks like it.
Shiratori.
Contact the Coast Guard
and have them search the area.
Got it.
- Takagi. - What's up?
I'd like to interview the Niimi couple.
- Bring them in. - Yes, sir.
Well, Conan...
Yes ?
We'll take care of the rest.
Go back to your cabin.
And stay out of there as long as you can.
The killer is most likely still aboard this ship.
Okay.
Wow, there's even cake!
That looks good!
Roast beef...
Once in a while...
Even once, it's a no.
Oh, no, no...
Ah, Professor!
Should we bring some for Miss Ran and Miss Sonoko?
They must be hungry.
No, it's better to let the doctors take care of Sonoko.
And Ran said she'd be fine and eat later.
Oh well...
Hey, Mitsuhiko...
Do you think she found the medal?
I don't think she's thinking about that right now.
Yeah, you're right.
Here, where's Conan?
That's right, he's not here.
Don't tell me he's sneaking around among the investigators again to listen in!
He might have.
He's good at this kind of hide-and-seek.
Thank you for your cooperation.
That goes without saying,
but catch this criminal as soon as possible.
Yes.
Well, let's see...

Mrs. Takae returned to her cabin after her squash game,
so if she was killed when she got out of the bath,
that person in the windbreaker that Mouri met in the hallway
is definitely our culprit.
Yes.
Assuming our suspect
then went down to the hold
to kill Mr. Yashiro, whom he asked to come in advance...
The time fits perfectly.
In short,
it is very likely
that these two murders were committed by the same person.
Yes.
Mouri.
What did the suspect look like?
He was probably about 5'7"..,
and of fairly lean build.
Just from his height,
it's hard to tell if it's a man or a woman.
It's true that when I think about it, the victim, Mrs. Takae,
was about the same height.
Mrs. Tsujimoto, did you bring it?
Yes.
We give it to all the passengers as a gift on board.
But the crew members too
could easily take one if they wanted to.
Shiratori, about the motive of the crime...
No doubt that it is a grudge case.
The victims' wallets and jewelry were not touched.
The lock of the cabin does not seem to have been forced.
Either the victim let the perpetrator in,
or he entered with a master key.
Mr. Misaki,
who has a master key here?
A lot of people, actually.
There's me of course, the security,
Natsuho, who took care of them,
and all the chief staff in charge of the cabins.
I see...
Inspector.
The killer deliberately chose a time when the victim was alone.
Don't you think, then.
that the perpetrator knew the victim's schedule?
Mrs. Tsujimoto,
were you the one who was in charge of their schedule?
Yes.
Did anyone else know about this?
I told Mr. Misaki, our purser,
but apart from him, nobody else.
So...
If you were 10 centimeters taller,
or Mr. Misaki was 10 kg lighter,
you would be our prime suspects.
There's one more thing.
We need to determine
whether or not the case against Sonoko is related to these crimes.
To think that you had our presumed culprit in front of you,
but you didn't see his face...
Yes, I'm sorry.
But, Inspector,
we are in the middle of the sea.
The culprit must be on board this ship.
With the staff and passengers,
that's barely 600 possible suspects.
Anyway, Takagi!
Go around the passengers and see if there were any witnesses.
Yes !
Mr. Misaki and Mrs. Tsujimoto,
can you tell me in detail about the people on board?
Yes, we can.
Detective Shiratori is right.
When did the killer learn the schedule of the Yashiro?
If Mrs Natsuho didn't tell anyone...
What the...
Yes! With this!
Hey!
Can I ask you something, Miss?
Conan?
Where did you come from again?
Come here!
Last night,
didn't you talk about the director's schedule?
Yes, we did.
When I walked them home after dinner,
I reminded them.
And was their cabin empty at any point?
Well...
Yesterday, the president said he was tired,
and he rested there until dinnertime.
So it was only during dinner that the room was empty.
Okay.
Hey, you...
You've been listening to us for a while, haven't you?
You'll see!
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
Mr. Misaki.
Some people didn't come to the dinner?
No, everyone was there.
So the killer is part of the crew?
I'm sorry.
I'll leave you to rest in the cabin for a while.
Tell me, did Mr. Kusaka interview you too?
Mr. Hironari Kusaka?
Yes, he did.
Did you lose a master key right afterwards?
Are you almost done?
As if it's possible!
Well, actually...
Three weeks ago,
we lost one.
Didn't we? Did we?
And it's like Conan said.
It happened after the interview with Mr. Kusaka.
Wait a minute.
Who is this Mr. Kusaka?
He's a scriptwriter.
He has interviewed us several times.
Okay, I'll do it.

And so, Conan,
did anything about him strike you as odd?
Yes !
Mr. Kusaka went back to his cabin before dinner was over.
He said he was seasick.
But maybe he was hiding in their room
to listen to the conversation !
Imbecile!
He's not a kid, he's not going to play hide and seek!
A microphone...
He could have bugged their room at that moment.
That makes sense...
What do you think, Mouri?
Does his physical constitution fit?
He did look like him, now that I think about it.
Okay, then.
Let's go talk to this Mr. Kusaka.
I see.
A microphone, huh?
They don't call you the great detective for nothing.
Oh, no.
This time, it was Conan's idea
...that led us to this deduction.
Did he?
Unfortunately, you're wrong.
You see, at 10:15,
I was here, on the phone with Miss Minako.
Miss Minako, the architect?
Yes.
In the middle of the ocean, cell phones don't work.
So I called from here.
What time was that?
Let's see...
Since 10:00, for half an hour.
If you check the call log,
I think you'll get the exact time.
And what did you talk about?
If you don't mind my asking.
I finished my script,
so I was asking for her opinion.
Your script?
Yes.
For a TV series
that takes place on a luxury liner.
She gives me advice on cruise ships.
"The Love Boat."
I asked for a room alone
because I wanted to finish my story without being disturbed.
But why didn't you ask her face to face?
You are on the same boat.
It's that she's single...
Going to her cabin would have been awkward.
But in the coffee shop or the common room,
someone could have heard us.
In this business, script theft is common.
I see...
My intuition tells me that Mr. Kusaka is innocent.
It's too early to tell.
We have to check his alibi first.
- I'm a little thirsty. - All right, let's go.
What is it, Mr. Mouri?
This young lady must have caught his eye.
She was quite beautiful.
Mr. Misaki told me about the case.
I can confirm that Mr. Kusaka called me at 10:00 sharp.
We talked for half an hour.
He had already asked me for advice on his script.
At tea time this morning,
he told me he was almost finished and asked my opinion.
"I'll call you at 10, so don't leave your room."
That's what he said.
I see.
Well, that's all we needed.
Sorry to have bothered you.
This confirms Mr. Kusaka's alibi.
Yes.
As long as they're not accomplices.
And the phones in the booths aren't cordless.
They couldn't have been moving around while making the calls.
Is something wrong, Mr. Mouri?
He must be thinking about Miss Minako.
She's lovely, too.
- That's all for... - Mr. Tome!
Inspector Megure.
What do you think?
We followed the procedure,
but nothing conclusive came of it.
Oh well...
Just one thing: where the victim was,
there were traces on the floor of a red liquid which was wiped off.
A red liquid?
Hey, Mr. Tome,
it wasn't blood?
No, it was the same color,
but no trace of hemoglobin.
But then, what was it?
Inspector Megure!
We interviewed the crew and all the passengers on the 6th floor,
but there were no witnesses.
I see.
The welcome party starts at 5 pm?
In the meantime, let's split up and interview
those on the other floors.
Yes !
With that, Inspector...
We will take the collected evidence back to the station.
Good work, thank you.
Miss!
I was looking for you!
I have one last question...
I'm listening, little detective.
What do you have to ask me?
How was your call with Mr. Kusaka?
Hm, well...
That's a vague question.
He just read me his story while I was listening.
Didn't he? You were just listening?
Yes.
He gets upset when I interrupt him.

He tells me, "Shut up and listen!"
That happened to me once before.
So now I don't say anything until the end.
So the whole time he was reading you his story,
you didn't say anything at all?
Just about.
And after about twenty minutes, he finished and asked me what I thought.
And I told him it was interesting.
Finished!
Here you go.
Ah, thanks...
How do you feel, Sonoko?
Much better now.
We shouldn't have played hide-and-seek.
Don't say that!
Say, otherwise, before the game...
We'll win! After all...
What were you going to say?
Did I tell you that I have already played in school?
Yes.
It was during the open house when I was in first grade.
We invited Shinichi too, but...
Shinichi, are you listening?
Hey, Shinichi!
Are you playing hide and seek?
It'll be fun.
- Sorry, but I'm out. - What's up?
I have a soccer game coming up.
How arrogant!
Even as a kid, he was like that?
So we played without him.
And you know, underneath the stage in the gym, there was storage.
Where we used to put the folding chairs?
Actually, behind the stairs next to the stage too,
there was a little space.
And you went in there?
Yes, I was sure that no one would find me in there.
But a teacher who was passing by put the stairs back in place,
and I couldn't get out!
Right? What happened next?
The others couldn't find me,
and I was stuck, so I didn't know what to do.
But Shinichi found me very easily.
When I came home,
when I asked him how he found my hiding place...
"The School Monster".
In this movie, the children hiding in the school
all get eaten by a monster.
So no chance of you hiding in the main building.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
How do you know I saw this movie?
Because you looked at the poster
every time we passed the video store.
No matter how much you say it scares you,
but you always watch this kind of movie.
So,
I thought of other places to hide you.
Since you love animals,
you wouldn't have gone into the pen so you wouldn't scare the chickens.
The basketball club was cleaning the equipment room,
so you couldn't have gotten stuck there.
And since the pool is under construction,
that left the gym.
I figured you had to be there.
And then the other day, during a sports class,
you were looking behind the stairs.
So, what's up? Are you surprised?
In fact, you watch me a lot!
Idiot! It is not true!
Hey, you're all red!
Don't talk nonsense! It's the sunset!
Yes, okay, I get it.
Yesterday, when you said it reminded you of that day,
you were talking about this.
So you were going to say:
"We're going to win! After all...
"the only one who can find me is Shinichi!"
Am I right?
But no, that's not it!
Oh?
You're all red!
Don't talk nonsense!
It's the sunset!
Uncle...
What did he want from Kusaka?
Yes ?
Is that you, kid?
I came to play!
Ah, wait!
I saw it earlier.
It's cool, your computer!
Yes, after all it's my work tool.
It's not a story for children.
Okay, well...
What do you think?
The teacher has the same one!
Oh? I can't hear a thing...
Kid...
Get out of here.
He wasn't going to leave any evidence lying around, either.
The one time we go on a trip, it's ruined.
Don't say that, Genta.
This is serious.
Yeah, you're right.
But why are people hurting each other?
Everyone should be friends.
We can't be.
We all have emotions.
In addition to being invisible,
they are complex and changeable.
If it's friendship or love, great,
but if something changes them into hate or jealousy,
it can make you want to kill.
Yeah, but hey,
my parents fight a lot, but they get along fine!
It's because they have consideration for each other.

As Ai explained,
Sometimes people hurt others or get hurt.
To prevent this from happening
you have to respect and consider the other person's feelings.
Consideration...
Teacher!
I need to borrow something of yours.
Sure, sure.
West Tama Police Department
A belt buckle...
Chiba, come here!
I'm coming over!
You need me?
Take a look at this.
Is that a belt buckle?
Doesn't it look like
something was attached to it?
Yes, it does!
It looks like the marks of a string or something.
A string...
Huh? What are you doing, uncle?
Where have you been hanging out? The party's about to start.
Mr. Mouri.
Inspector Megure is asking for you.
The inspector?
All right, I'm coming.
- I'm coming too! - You stay here!
I see...
Hideto Yashiro's accident is also suspicious...
Yes.
From what Ms. Sato says,
that string attached to the belt seems important to her.
What do you think, Mouri?
Any ideas?
With so little information, no...
Was there anything else?
Yes.
Some kind of burnt can,
and some other miscellaneous debris.
But it's all been dumped since...
A can and a string, huh?
What if it was?
Did I scare you?
You brat!
I wanted to shake a can of cola
to make it explode in the room,
but they didn't sell them.
Were you going to throw cola at us?
I almost had a heart attack...
But speaking of cans!
A stun grenade.
Wouldn't we have used that to kill him?
Bingo.
What's this about, Shiratori? This grenade...
Stun.
Also known as a flashbang.
It's used to stun the enemy with a loud noise and a bright light.
It's a type of grenade about the size of a soda can.
If for example
we had tied a string to a grenade with the pin pulled,
and you tied that string to the belt buckle...
At the time the person would put on the belt...
Oh, I see.
Even without triggering a heart attack,
the person who fainted would not be able to drive,
and the car would end up in the ravine.
But it's not easy to get these grenades...
I mean, we live in an age where you can get anything with means.
Yes.
And then,
if the aim is simply to stun the target,
it doesn't necessarily have to be a real one.
A big firecracker would suffice.
Detectives.
I just got a call.
They found what they think is Mr. Yashiro's body.
Commander..,
may I speak to you for a moment?
What's up?
The party that is supposed to start at 5 p.m,
could you cancel it?
If the killer is planning to take another victim,
there's a good chance he'll take advantage of the party's excitement!
Uh, but that's...
Please, Commander.
No, Inspector.
Let the party go on.
All will be revealed soon.
Mouri, would you...
Are you going to give us your show?
He's not sleeping, though.
Are you sure about this, uncle?
Come on, let's party!
I've got to make up for the half day I lost!
You too, Sonoko...
Hey, about Ran...
You'd have to ask him.
Yes.
What's that? A gold medal made of seashells?
The string was too short so it's more like a bracelet.
You didn't notice it, so...
I am disappointed.
Sorry!
I promise to look for it later!
But thank you.
The thought alone makes me very happy!
Dear guests,
welcome aboard the Aphrodite.
I will be your host for tonight's party,
my name is Natsuho Tsujimoto.
Thank you all.
First of all, I would like to introduce our crew.
Our purser, Naoya Misaki.
Next, our ship's doctor, Dr. Mizukubo.
Our chief, Katsuhiko Shiomi.
Have you found the culprit?
- Officer Yosuke Izawa... - Yes, but...
I don't have enough evidence yet.
And the one you've all been waiting for,
our captain, Wataru Kaido!
Before we talk about me,
I'd like to introduce you to the wonderful architect of this ship.
Miss Minako Akiyoshi, the naval designer!
Captain!

Is it true that Director Takae was murdered?
There is also a rumor that Mr. Yashiro is missing!
Well...
You are the police, right?
Did you catch the culprit?
Don't you have better things to do than to join the party?
Please, sir,
calm down, please!
What's going on, anyway?
Uh, I mean...
Mr. Mouri?
Huh?
Mr. Mouri?
Everybody calm down, please!
There is nothing to worry about!
The person responsible for this terrible series of murders,
I, Kogoro Mouri, have already discovered him!
We've been waiting for this, Mr. Detective!
The person who killed Mrs. Takae Yashiro
and President Entaro Yashiro,
is...
You, Miss Minako Akiyoshi!
The motive of the crime?
To avenge Mr. Hideto Yashiro who died in an accident 15 days ago.
It was in fact
a murder committed by the father and the daughter Yashiro!
But...
why would Miss Akiyoshi want to avenge him?
Well, I suppose
that Miss Minako and Mr. Hideto were lovers.
But wait, Mr. Mouri!
It's true that I respected him as a superior and mentor,
but there was nothing romantic about it!
Not to mention that at the time of the incident,
I was in my cabin, on the phone with Mr. Kusaka!
That's true.
But in reality,
you let Mr. Kusaka read his story for 20 minutes,
without saying a single word!
This means that
you have no alibi during that time!
Don't be ridiculous!
If Mr. Kusaka had stopped in the middle of reading to talk to me,
he would have known right away that I was gone!
I am not so stupid as to create such a lame alibi!
If you still say that I am guilty,
then show me your proof!
Hey!
Do you have proof, Mouri?
Uh, well...
Huh?
Dad, don't tell me
you suspect Miss Minako because she looks like Mom?
Well, Mr. Mouri?
Uh, sorry, I need to take a break in the little room!
A break?
Found it!
Detective,
if we don't do something before they finish laughing...
I know, but...
Don't worry, Inspector Megure.
I know the real culprit.
Really, Professor Agasa?
It's the professor's turn to do his show !
Dear guests,
do you know where the word "cruise" comes from ?
From piracy.
Ships used to form a cross while zigzagging to attack their targets.
In this boat too, a pirate is hiding among us.
But he doesn't steal treasure.
He is a pirate stealing the lives of others!
The identity of this pirate is...
The scriptwriter, Mr. Hironari Kusaka!
It's you!
What are you saying?
Didn't you listen to what Miss Minako said?
At the time of the crime,
I was reading her the story of my scenario on the phone!
You mean this story?
"Nanami Okazaki loved the sea.
"Without a doubt her childhood spent in front of the Genkai sea...
"was at the origin of her love for the immensity of the ocean."
It's a very simple trick.
You placed a prepared recording in front of the handset,
and you committed the murders during it!
That's not possible! I had it erased!
Erased it?
No, you thought you erased it,
but it wasn't gone!
But it was important,
you should have checked better to avoid trouble!
This is fabrication of evidence.
It was you who recorded this using his voice, wasn't it?
Yes, I did.
But hey,
I have another piece of critical evidence.
But that's not
sufficient evidence to prove murder!
I have another piece of evidence, come on!
It's right here.
Well, well... What do you have there?
There's a black streak in your red hair!
Say, isn't that
blood?
Blood?
Sorry, Mr. Kusaka.
Oh, I know!
After you did something wrong, you looked in the mirror,
but you didn't see the blood on your hair the same color!
You'd better remember that.
Blood hardens with time,
and its color changes too.
By the way, could you take off your scarf?

If my deduction is correct,
there should be a trace left.
Fighting you for his life,
Mr. Yashiro must have left nail or finger marks!
Excuse me!
Mr. Kusaka.
You will tell us the details in private.
Wait, that's not right...
I still have...
cards in my hand !
Don't move!
Move and I blow it up!
A bomb?
If you don't want to go down, do as I say!
That's the man!
That's the man who attacked me!
Do you finally remember?
Please, calm down!
Why are you doing this?
- To avenge my father! - Revenge?
Fifteen years ago,
the crew member who died in the accident of the merchant ship,
was my father!
I see!
That was...
Two years ago,
I ran into his former colleague while visiting his grave.
And he told me a strange rumor about the accident!
Entaro and Takae, then the director and general manager of the company,
conspired to sink the ship to get the insurance money.
And also to get rid of Commander Okita, who demanded
better working conditions,
they got his First mate, Kaido, involved!
According to what I was told,
you put a sleeping pill in the coffee of the commander Okita,
deliberately ran into an iceberg,
and at the same time,
you detonated a hidden bomb!
And everything leads us to believe
that it was Hideto Yashiro who told you where to place the bomb!
My mentor would do that?
How did you kill President Yashiro?
That old man pinned me down and tried to strangle me,
so I pushed him over and threw him in the water!
And...
I was going to blow up that boat, just like you did back then,
and I was going to kill you in the panic!
What an imagination.
Stop it! Stop it!
Put down that remote and let's talk about this!
Shut up, you! Don't come any closer!
It's gone!
You're not getting away!
Conan!
After him!
Damn it!
Wait, Conan!
Wait for us!
Hey, you...
We're coming with you!
We're not going to let you have all the credit!
Haibara...
You heard them.
Don't fall in the water!
Turn left!
Turn right!
We've passed it!
Haibara, take over!
Conan!
Did you get him, Conan?
Yippee!
Another victory for the Junior Detectives!
Hey, kids!
Hey!
Are you all right?
Are you out of your minds?
He's a suspect in a murder case!
Things could have gone very wrong!
Sorry, sir...
Inspector Megure...
How many bombs did he plant?
Well, Izawa?
Captain, sir!
The explosion made several holes in the hull!
The watertight doors?
All closed,
but water's seeping into blocks 3 and 4!
What is it, sir?
Captain, what are the orders?
Captain!
Evacuate the passengers.
All passengers.
This is Officer Izawa.
Everyone put on life jackets
and come to the second floor deck.
This is not a drill.
I repeat: This is not a drill.
Proceed in a calm manner.
The crew will guide you to the deck.
I can't find it.
The medal that the children made...
where did it go?
Ran...
Hey, let's go! Hurry up!
Ran, let's go.
Yes...
Don't panic!
There's still plenty of time!
Go ahead and don't rush!
Dad...
- Where are Conan and the kids? - Don't worry about them.
Detective Megure contacted me.
Apparently, they followed Kusaka in a motorboat,
and were picked up by a cruiser.
That makes me feel better.
Ran.
You and the others will take that boat.
I'll take another one.
- But... - See you later.
Dad!
Get in line, don't push!
Once you're in the water, move away from the boat quickly.
If you get caught in the siphon created by the boat, you're done.
Got it.
We're suffocating in here!
It's an emergency, deal with it.
But I'm too hot, I can't help it!
I remember!
You do? Remember what?
She fell when I was hiding!

The gold medal?
Well, we're going down.
Hold on tight !
Wait, I'm coming out!
Hey, Ran!
- I'll get it, you go ahead. - But...
It may be a trinket made of shells..,
But it's very valuable to me!
- I'll see you later. - Wait, Ran!
There it is!
We're in luck, though,
that boat was in the area.
Do you think the people on the boat will be okay?
I'm worried...
They'll be fine.
She's probably in a boat...
Kusaka wanted to take advantage of the panic
to kill Mr. Kaido, according to him.
But in that case,
don't you think there were too many bombs?
It's as if
his goal was to sink the ship...
And then,
the trick for his alibi,
it was far too simplistic!
If Miss Minako had spoken up during their call,
everything would have fallen apart.
But he had planned it.
He made sure she never interrupted him,
to use her as an alibi.
Is it true that she said...
Yes.
He gets angry when I interrupt him.
Inspector Megure!
The coast guard gave us their report.
They found a knife stuck in Mr. Yashiro's back.
What's the matter?
What's the meaning of this?
Kusaka never talked about a knife!
It was 10:11.
It must have been 10:15.
No,
it wasn't Kusaka!
But then who killed her?
She doesn't look like she's in her fifties!
Hey, Conan!
Where are you going, Conan?
Conan...
I don't know why,
but something's bothering me.
I have a feeling
I'll regret it if I let things end like this.
Are you talking about the investigation?
Yes, I think so.
I guess so.
Conan...
The investigation...
That's really the only reason,
Kudo?
If my deduction is correct,
the real culprit is...
Captain!
We've finished evacuating the passengers.
I'll take the life raft.
You and the rest of the crew can take a boat.
Aye, sir.
Oh?
You're not going down with your ship,
Commander?
What are you doing out here? Hurry up and evacuate!
Doesn't this remind you of something?
My father liked them a lot.
An origami boat...
No! You are?
Yes, I am.
I'm the daughter...
...of Major Okita whom you and the Yashiris killed 15 years ago!
I'm sorry, but..,
but I destroyed the last life raft.
- What did you do? - Don't move!
It's a little cramped in here.
Let's find a place where we can smell the sea air
to discuss this calmly.
It was six months ago.
Kusaka came to ask me questions for his series.
But he wanted to know unrelated things about the Yashiro family,
and I found it suspicious.
So while he was in the bathroom...
"The truth about the sinking of the Yashiromaru 1."
That was his real purpose.
At first I didn't believe it,
but the next day I visited Hideto Yashiro.
I served him a little strong alcohol and he told me everything.
That it wasn't an accident,
but a set-up.
He had no idea I was Okita's daughter.
Please forgive me.
I was just following orders...
Don't make excuses!
You're going to join the Yashiro's!
And my father, dead with all his resentment!
Damn it, please let me get there in time!
Please, spare me!
Farewell, my commander.
Stop it!
So you were the real culprit,
Miss Minako Akiyoshi.
Uncle?
Don't move!
Sorry, I made this gun unusable.
When I went to the toilet,
I found it in your cabin.
Commander.
The two of us will have a long talk after this.
Miss Akiyoshi.
- From what I gather... - Let's leave it at that.
All three of us are doomed.
Explaining your deduction to me while we're sinking,
it's no use.
As if I would stop!
A detective only lives to find the truth.
I assume that you have discovered
that Kusaka was planning to kill those four people, including Hideto.
But his plan was too flawed.
So you decided

to assassinate Hideto before him by making it look like a heart attack.
With a handmade grenade.
With Hideto dead,
Kusaka changed his plans to kill the remaining three,
and decided to use you as his alibi.
Having discovered this,
you turned his plan to your advantage,
to kill them with your own hands.
You started by
by installing a different bomb than the one Kusaka had.
You made the plans for the boat.
You knew better than anyone where to place it effectively.
And this morning, at 10:00,
when Kusaka called you,
you left your cabin as soon as she started reading.
You knocked Mrs. Takae out of her bath,
and you put on her bathrobe to pass yourself off as her.
When Kusaka came in,
he saw you in the robe and mistook you for Mrs. Takae.
You pretended to try to take the knife from him
to stab yourself in a hidden pocket of fake blood.
Thinking he had succeeded, Kusaka ran away,
and you then killed Mrs. Takae.
Then you wiped off the fake blood
and came out of the cabin wearing a windbreaker.
At the time,
I thought the person turned his back on me to hide his face.
But then I realized.
Maybe it was a woman
who was reflexively turning away to protect her chest.
I see!
That's why earlier...
You then went straight down to the hold.
And you arrived exactly
when Mr. Yashiro was on top of Kusaka and tried to strangle him.
You ran to them both,
grabbed Mr. Yashiro's legs...
- His legs? - Didn't you?
Yes !
You took care not to touch his legs,
and stabbed him in the back!
Yes, that's it!
You stabbed him in the back!
Then you quickly ran away,
so that Kusaka would think that he had done it alone.
Everything went according to your plan.
A deduction worthy of the great detective Kogoro Mouri.
If I used Kusaka,
it was because you were on board.
If I wanted to fool a detective,
I needed a scapegoat.
And one who would be convinced of having committed the crime.
But that's not all.
In the story he was writing,
he criticized my father's "outdated" choice to go down with his ship.
I don't forgive those who insult my father!
And you think you deserve forgiveness?
You not only took the lives of three people,
but also endangered many innocent people!
You even went so far as to sink your own ship...
I have calculated everything over and over again!
The number of bombs, the volume of water required to sink,
the evacuation time...
All this with one goal in mind:
to create a situation in which that coward who is hiding there
would perish alone and desperate in the open sea, like my father!
And then,
Aphrodite is a goddess born from the foam.
It is her destiny to return there.
And finally,
since you have discovered everything, it is finished.
I will surrender without a struggle.
It is my policy never to hit a woman.
Isn't it a bit sexist?
Uncle!
What's up?
Do you still intend to follow this principle?
I am also against unnecessary fighting.
Basically, all three of us will sink with the boat.
That's for standing between me and my revenge!
That little...
- Shinichi? - What's that?
Oh, no, nothing.
It's time to end this,
Mr. Kogoro Mouri.
A great detective like you in this state,
it's sad to see.
I don't need your pity.
Uncle!
I really have no chance.
To have caught the eye of a great detective in the first place...
Do I look
that much like a woman you despise?
It's just the opposite.
It is because you look like her,
I hoped you weren't guilty,
and I looked for proof of your innocence.
And this is where it led us.
Uncle!
Are you all right, Uncle?
Nice deduction, old man.
What's up? But why are you here?
No time to explain, we have to run away!

Run away?
No way!
All the lifeboats are gone,
and she destroyed our life raft!
Uh-oh...
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
We're saved!
What's that feeling?
The case is solved though.
Then what is this
this unpleasant sensation as if something was wrong?
The boat will sink soon, hurry up!
Hey!
Your turn, hurry up!
What are you waiting for? Get in quickly!
Say...
Where...
Where's Ran?
Huh?
She's already got a boat.
Aren't you with Ran, sir?
What do you mean, I'm not?
She went to get her medal where we were playing hide and seek!
So I thought she'd be with you!
That was it!
Wait, come back!
Hey!
Where is she, Ran?
Somebody help me!
Is anyone there?
Hi, Ran!
I knew you were here!
Shinichi...
You're gonna find me, right?
Shinichi!
Hey! Do you know where Ran is?
Ran knew I was playing ball here!
So that means...
She's up there?
I'll find you!
I swear I'll find you!
I'm coming, Ran!
Hey! Where's Ran?
Calm down.
Calm down and think.
You found her just fine that day!
But by the way...
How did you know where I was hiding?
You were focused on kicking your ball!
You spent the whole game kicking your soccer ball, right?
You have to play seriously!
Yes, I do!
It's just like that day!
Uncle!
Do you see a place to hide under the floor?
I've found it!
Damn, it does not open!
Uncle!
It is open!
Ran, are you there?
Dad...
- It's here! - We have to hurry, Uncle!
Damn it!
Oh no, this sucks!
We have to get back out there,
or they'll all go down!
I'm afraid that's impossible.
If we get any closer,
we risk being caught in the siphon created by the boat!
Oh no!
It's the Coast Guard rescue chopper!
Great!
The rescue chopper!
Oh, boy.
Let's go to the bow!
Hey, we're here!
- Are you all here? - We're here!
Hang on, kid, it's almost over!
You'll be saved soon!
Yes !
You hold on tight to me, understand?
Yes !
We will be lifted.
Hold on tightly, please!
Got it!
Got what?
Grab it!
Oh, shit!
Hold on tight, Conan.
Ran, are you okay?
Kid!
Grab my hand!
The wind is blowing hard again today.
And the light comes through the waves
If you hold on tightly to your hand
It looks like we're going to reach the sky
You are different from the one I knew
And for a moment I was afraid
But I don't have enough words
To tell you how much I love you
Like a late summer sail, always,
I will always think of you
Under the sun we repeated our failures
But we've bounced back
Wherever we're headed
A dream awaits us
I don't want us to spend
Saying "I'm sorry" all the time
It's "Thank you" that I want to say
To tell you again and again
Even if I tried to understand you
Our temperatures were sometimes different
And yet I almost
Never suffocated by your side
Like a late summer sail, always,
I always want to hold you close
I'd like to be honest with my feelings
But sometimes it hurts people
Where I'm headed
Is to you
Like a late summer sail, always,
I always want to hold you close
I'd like to be honest with my feelings
But sometimes it hurts people
Where I'm headed
Is to you
We'll be there soon.
Ah, thanks.
The boat with your parents is almost here.
So what convinced you that she was the culprit
was that Kusaka's alibi was too simple?
Yes.
He could not have created such a simple alibi
if Minako hadn't wanted to use it to her advantage.
And to be able to pretend to be Mrs. Takae

you had to be a woman with legs as thin as hers.
I see...
That said, congratulations on finding Ran's hiding place.
Oh, that...
I was the one who was afraid for you!
During the game, I was kicking a volleyball,
But Ran said something about a soccer ball.
So I figured she heard the noise from her hiding place.
It's a shame, though.
I'm glad you were rescued,
but I thought the only one
who could find her would be Kudo.
No, I'm the one who was saved...
Ran!
We finished fixing the medal!
We put a wire long enough to put it around your neck!
I'll hang it up for you!
Thank you, Ran.
It looks good on you!
Yes !
I'll take care of it.
I was saved
thanks to these kids
and the love they put into making this necklace.
