Ayumi.
It's late, go take your bath.
Just a little longer! I've come at the best time.
You have a pool tomorrow.
OK, then...
Who are you?
Dracula?
No.
I was just resting my wings after a long flight.
I'm just a lowly magician.
Miss.
There he is!
Don't let him get away!
Catch Kaito Kid!
See you around,
Miss.
Teitan Elementary School
What, you saw Kaito Kid?
Is that true, Ayumi?
Yes! He was so cool!
He's really the modern day Arsene Lupin!
So, how will the modern-day Holmes react?
Silly girl!
I'll catch him in the end, of course!
DETECTIVE CONAN THE LAST MAGICIAN OF THE CENTURY
My name is Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.
One day, at an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,
I witnessed the suspicious traffic of a man in black.
Totally absorbed in the transaction,
I didn't hear his accomplice approaching from behind me.
He made me swallow a drug, and when I woke up...
My body had become younger!
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,
my life and the lives of my relatives would be in danger.
On Professor Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my identity,
and when Ran asked me my name, I invented Conan Edogawa.
Ranpo Edogawa / Conan Doyle
In order to find out who these thugs are, I arranged to live with Ran.
I am Kogoro Mouri, the great detective...
They call him Kogoro the Sleeping One, and for a reason!
Hypodermic projectile watch
I put him to sleep with my hypodermic projectile watch,
and I imitate his voice with this bow tie
Voice modulator bow tie
to solve the investigations for him!
These two inventions were created by Professor Agasa.
He doesn't look it, but he is a real genius.
He also created the turbo-engine skateboard,
radar glasses,
the hyper-fortifying shoes...
In short, he helps me with his unique inventions!
Turboshaft skateboard
The skateboard can be recharged with solar light
and now works 30 minutes during the night!
In addition,
two people besides the teacher know who I am.
Heiji Hattori, the high school detective from the west,
and my classmate, Ai Haibara.
She used to work with the men in black,
but to escape from the organization,
she swallowed the same drug as me and also became younger.
While tracking down the organization,
I have to deal with a lot of stuff!
And now...
a new enemy appears!
I will illuminate the darkness of confusion and doubt.
My body has grown younger, but not my mind!
I will solve all the mysteries!
There is still only one truth!
Police Station - August 19
Meeting on Kaito Kid case
Thief #1402, aka Kaito Kid,
has already committed 134 crimes.
15 of which were committed abroad,
in a total of 12 countries: USA, France, Germany, etc.
To date, he has stolen 152 jewels,
with an estimated total value of 38,725,000,000 yen.
Shintaro Chaki (49 years old) Commissioner 2nd division
Yesterday, Kaito Kid sent us a new card.
"From the twilight of the lion to the dawn of the virgin,
"when the clock without a second hand indicates the 12th symbol,
Ginzo Nakamori (41 years old) Inspector 2nd division
I will appear at the top lit up in the sky,
"to seize the Egg of Remembrance.
"The last magician of the century, Kaito Kid."
Kid!
This "Egg of Remembrance" he mentions
is a secret treasure of the Romanov dynasty
found by the Suzuki group.
It's one of the Imperial Easter Eggs.
The Imperial Easter Eggs
were the Easter gifts of the Russian Tsars to their wives.
They are egg-shaped jewels created by the jeweler Fabergé,
who made fifty of them between the years 1885 and 1916.
This egg is the 51st found to date.
The Suzuki Group will exhibit this 51st egg
at the Suzuki Museum of Modern Art which will open on August 23

in the park of Osaka castle.
Concerning the deciphering of the code...
- Nakamori. - Yes.
The phrase "From the twilight of the lion to the dawn of the virgin"
refers to the night of August 22nd, the last of the astrological sign of Leo,
to the morning of the 23rd, first day of the sign of Virgo.
This is the date on which Kid will act.
Then, "when the clock without a second hand indicates the 12th symbol"
seems to refer to the time of the crime,
but we're still thinking about it.
Finally, the "lighted peak in the sky"
refers to a Japanese castle.
So that's where Kid will show up: at Osaka Castle!
So, with this map,
Kid warns us that he will be, on the night of August 22,
on the roof of Osaka Castle
to try to steal the Imperial Easter Egg!
On that note, for this case,
we will work with the Osaka police.
And at the request of the leader of the Suzuki group,
we've also asked detective Kogoro Mouri for his help!
Uh, hello!
Our main objective
will be the protection of the egg.
Even if Kid escapes, we'll have to give priority to...
We can't afford to be naive!
The egg comes second! Listen to me carefully!
Our pride as policemen is at stake!
I want to see that insolent little bastard behind bars!
We'll get him, no matter what!
What did I get myself into...
Ran! Over there!
Sonoko!
A limousine, huh?
The Suzuki Group is going all out.
Because today's a big day!
A big day?
I'm finally going to meet the great Kaito Kid, my idol!
Let's go all out!
You then, Sonoko...
The big kid, his idol?
Oh, by the way!
At the wheel is Mr. Nishino, Dad's secretary.
Masato Nishino (29) Mr Suzuki's secretary
Nice to meet you.
He has traveled all over the world
and he speaks fluent English, French and German!
Wow!
Agasa House
It's not fair, Professor!
Why is Conan going to Osaka and not us?
I wanted to see Kid again...
He's got a knack for taking the wind out of our sails!
Come on, don't think about it.
Have some watermelon, it will take your mind off it.
Yippee!
Enjoy your meal!
Just a second!
You'll have to solve my quiz first!
You're not serious?
Yes, that's how it is!
Not everything in life will fall into your lap!
Come on, listen up!
"When I had children, their mother took care of them."
How old are these children?
Huh? Do you have children?
It's just a quiz!
It's too hard without Conan.
So we can't eat?
They are 0 years old.
They are still eggs.
When the "jay" bird had children,
their mother took care of the "eggs".
The eggs are still 0 years old.
Good answer!
I was sure you would find it, Ai.
- Actually, Haibara... - She's too good!
Uh, Haibara did it on behalf of all the Junior Detectives, right?
So...
Enjoy your meal!
I wonder what will happen to the other egg.
I look forward to seeing you in action, Kudo.
Osaka City Curatorial Office
Suzuki Museum of Modern Art
They really went all out.
They won't even let an ant in, it seems.
Of course they won't!
We're talking about the great Kaito Kid! After all, he is...
A gentleman thief who appears and disappears as he pleases.
No security system or safe
can withstand his skill and tricks.
And he masters the art of disguise,
even imitating the voice and character of those he copies.
Really...
You have made a great enemy,
Kudo.
Hattori?
Him again?
Why do you always call Conan 'Kudo'?
Sorry!
It's because he looks so much like Kudo, too!
It just comes out.
How stupid you are!
All morning he kept saying "Kudo is coming"!
Maybe you should go see a shrink.
Hey...
Is that Heiji Hattori, the high school detective from the west?
He's quite good-looking!
Don't even think about it!
He already has Kazuha, his childhood friend.
They often bicker,

but they are very close!
Of course, you can tell.
They look like you and Shinichi!
I wish I had a male childhood friend!
President's office
Shiro Suzuki (51) President of the group and father of Sonoko
Oh, my dear Mouri!
Thank you for coming all this way.
It's only natural.
Thank you for coming too, Ran and Conan.
Tell me, Sonoko,
who are those two?
That's Heiji Hattori and Kazuha Toyama, Dad.
Heiji is called the "Western High School Detective",
he's famous in Kansai!
Well, nice to have you with us!
Yeah! Count us in, old man!
Hey, you!
He's the president of the Suzuki Group, show some respect!
It's nothing, Mouri.
Ah, let me introduce you.
The first secretary of the Russian embassy,
Sergei Ovchinnikov (41 years old) First Secretary of the Russian Embassy
Mr. Sergei Ovchinnikov.
Nice to meet you.
Next door, an art dealer who came to negotiate a price,
Mr. Shoichi Inui.
Shoichi Inui (45 years old) Art dealer
This lady is studying the Romanovs,
Seiran Hoshi (27) Anthropologist
Mrs. Seiran Hoshi.
Ni hao.
And finally, the one who offered to film the interviews on the egg,
Mr. Ryu Sagawa, freelance videographer.
Ryu Sagawa (32 years old) Videographer
Nice to meet you.
You're talking about negotiating a price, but how much is it?
Eight hundred million.
Eight hundred... million?
If you sell it to me, I can put in even more.
Mr. President!
The imperial eggs originally belonged to Russia!
Instead of selling it to a dealer from who knows where,
I'd be grateful if you'd donate it to a Russian art museum!
I don't allow you!
It's good, all that!
I think that filming you
will be more interesting than the egg!
You seem to have something to say.
Since you study the Romanovs,
you must want this egg more than anything, am I right?
Yes.
But eight hundred million yen, for me that's...
I can imagine.
At best, I could get out two hundred million.
Well...
Looks like Kid isn't the only one who wants to get that egg!
Can we discuss the egg again in due course?
All right, I'll leave it at that.
Well, I'll leave it at that for today.
Sir,
I brought the egg.
Ah, thank you.
- Leave it on the table. - It's fine.
Come on, you can look at it.
What a chance to see it!
Well, don't expect much.
I thought it was a toy when I was little, to tell you the truth!
For a toy?
Is this the Imperial Easter Egg?
Nishino, get them some refreshments.
Right away.
It's not as much as I expected.
Yes... It looks like an ostrich egg.
It can open, right?
Absolutely, good for you for noticing!
This is the family of Emperor Nicholas II.
It is made entirely of gold.
That's not bad!
And wait, there's a funny mechanism.
That's nice, isn't it?
In some old Fabergé documents,
we found the plans of the egg's interior.
This is what proved its authenticity.
And the name Remembrance Egg,
is the translation of its Russian name?
Yes, it is.
In Russian it is vospominánie,
a word meaning "remembrance".
Tell me,
how does turning the pages of a book evoke a memory?
You're so stupid!
The emperor reading a story to his children,
that's a memory for them!
Are those jewels shining on the back of the egg?
Oh no, it's only glass.
In a gift for the tsarina?
How weird is that?
Well, at the time it was created,
it must be said that Russia was in economic crisis.
For me, it's Kid's announcement card that I find weird.
The "illuminated peak in the sky"...
Osaka Castle doesn't glow, though.
You're silly!
It was built by Hideyoshi Toyotomi,
who allowed the city to develop and prosper.
It represents the light of Osaka!
That's right.

Kid will show up at the top of the castle,
no doubt about it.
On the other hand...
"When the clock without a second hand indicates the 12th symbol",
this is the part we don't understand!
Rather than a symbol, isn't it a Japanese syllable?
The twelfth of the Japanese syllabary is...
Shi?
Shi, that means "four"!
No, it's too simple to be a Kid code.
I've got it, Commissioner.
It's not a syllable, but a letter of the alphabet!
Of the alphabet?
The twelfth letter of the alphabet is "L".
So...
Three hours?
You really amaze me! Bravo !
It is inevitably that!
Three hours, that remains the night,
so before the dawn of the Virgin!
You don't pay anything to wait, Kaito Kid!
This time we'll get you!
Namba Shrine
I drew a "Big Chance"!
Show me!
"You will find your long awaited loved one."
Oh, it must be Shinichi!
Oh, that's great!
You'll introduce me to him, right?
I'm right here...
Well, let's see.
We still have some time to kill before 3:00 a.m.
We can start by getting something to eat...
Kazuha.
Why don't you show them the city?
What about you?
I'm going to be the little guy's guide.
Why? We'll be better together.
We want to be guys.
Right, uh... Conan?
Yes, we do!
It's not that hard to remember!
Hey, I think you're pretty arrogant.
I can tell them anything.
Can you hold it, please?
I like it better.
And don't forget to smile when you ask for a favor.
Damn...
They seem to be getting along well, oddly enough.
Who cares, we're better off as girls!
We'll find some handsome guys from Osaka to invite us to eat!
For that, there is the Bridge of Lovers!
Is it this story of the 12th letter that worries you?
Yes.
If "L" was the 12th letter of the Russian alphabet, again...
Which one would it be, in Russian?
"Ka", the equivalent of "K".
But the form "K" means nothing on a clock.
That's not all.
His signature intrigues me too, "the last magician of the century".
Hardly pretentious, this guy!
He had never named himself like that.
And above all, Kid had never stolen anything but jewels,
- so why this egg? - Failure!
By the way, what did you get for your prediction?
I haven't looked yet.
Why not?
Don't you want to know how it will be tonight?
Pfft...
Oh, a "Small chance"?
That's neither good nor bad.
It doesn't do us any good.
We can't know if you're going to beat the Kid or not.
"The expected person will come"?
"Travel:
"Refrain, your secret would be revealed."
Hey...
What if it's...
No way.
The predictions from here are often right.
What, seriously?
I swear.
Go to the restaurant?
Yeah, after all Kid won't show up until 3am.
What do you say, in the meantime?
What a great idea!
Mr. President, is it good for you?
Oh yes, take it.
Ah, you're taking it to the showroom?
- No, we'll put a fake. - A fake?
Until now,
we've left the objects where Kid said he'd steal them,
and our naiveté got the better of us.
This time, we intend to hide it!
Oh, right!
Where will you hide it?
I won't tell you anything!
Only me and my two men will know about it!
And I made sure
that neither of them is Kid wearing a mask!
What are you doing?
You could have been Kid too!
Ah, is that so? Maybe you are the Kid!
But stop it, you...
My name is Natsumi Kosaka.
This is Mr. Sawabe, my butler.
It's about the Imperial Easter Egg on that brochure.
I'd like to speak to your director.
I'm afraid he's out.
But if I can help you, please do.
The egg in this picture is different from the drawing
my great-grandfather did.
Oh, that's funny.
If 3 h's form an "L", this forms a he.
A "he"?
Look, now it's 7:13.

At 19:20, it will form the Japanese syllable he.
There is this syllable in the first sentence of the card...
in the twelfth position!
Hattori!
It's not at 3 o'clock that Kid will come,
but at 7:20!
What's up?
Hey! Where are you going, Kudo?
To Osaka Castle!
You, watch the egg!
Rain?
It wasn't supposed to rain.
Wait, Kudo!
The "lighted peak in the sky" is the Tsutenkaku!
The what?
The Tsutenkaku tower lights up according to the weather!
What?
Ladies and gentlemen!
Come on, let the show begin!
What's that?
What the...
"Kakei" Restaurant
Fireworks?
That's part of the charm of summer.
Dotonbori district
Wow!
They are beautiful, the fireworks of Osaka!
It's weird,
they didn't announce anything for tonight.
Inspector!
Fireworks are being shot off towards the castle!
And a lot of them!
Don't panic, it can't be Kid!
There is still more than seven hours before the time he announced.
And he won't suspect that we hid the egg here,
in this warehouse.
Hattori! Which way is the tower?
That way!
But no fireworks in sight.
He probably shot off the ones at the castle
to divert our attention!
But why?
What does he want to do to Tsutenkaku?
Damn it!
We'll never get to that tower in time!
Let's set a trap for him here!
Mr. Nishino! Where's the egg?
Detective Nakamori took it away.
What is it?
Well, let's move on.
Electricity station
A breakdown?
What's going on, again?
This is not normal!
Ah, the moonlight!
It makes for a nice atmosphere.
Stay calm!
The emergency generator, quick!
Got it!
I know what he'll do!
Hoenzaka Mikado Hospital.
Dojima Century Hotel.
Tenman Emergency Center.
Channel 10 Hotel.
Naniwa TMS Hospital.
Kansai World Hotel.
Bingo!
Get out of the way, I have to shoot!
What about the priority?
He knows that the egg has been moved somewhere else!
He plunged the city in the dark to be able to locate it
thanks to the emergency generators!
Except for hotels and hospitals, where he will see light...
It's Kid!
Damn it!
Oh no, a dead end!
This way, Kudo!
I see it.
From the top of the Tsutenkaku tower, he had the best view!
He saw it all coming before he even sent his map!
Besides, the place is kept secret.
And therefore not very well guarded.
We have to hurry before he steals it!
Hattori!
- Wait here! - What's up?
Hey, Kudo!
Kid!
No !
Damn it!
Hurry, Kudo!
Hang gliders fly better with a light headwind!
So he's letting the wind carry him?
He's descending in altitude!
He's heading for the bay.
He'll land there for sure!
Hattori, are you okay?
Don't just stand there, go after him!
Don't you dare let it get away!
Hattori...
Are you okay, buddy?
Call the police and an ambulance!
Yes.
I'll be right back, Hattori!
What was that?
He's hurt.
The egg's intact!
It's Kid's monocle!
Did it fall in the water?
But who was that person?
After that,
in spite of the police's meticulous search,
nobody knew if Kid had survived.
The next day,
to examine the state of the egg,
23 August
the exhibition was cancelled,
and it was brought back to Tokyo by a Suzuki group ship.
My great-grandfather's name was Kiichi,
and worked as a craftsman at the Fabergé workshop.
He married a Russian woman there,
Natsumi Kosaka (27 years old) Pastry cook
and they returned to Japan one year after the revolution.
They had a daughter together.
However, his wife died soon after.
My great-grandfather
died nine years later, at only 45 years old.
And so their daughter...
She was my grandmother.
I lost my parents and my grandfather
when I was five years old, in a car accident.
I was raised by my grandmother.

Kuranosuke Sawabe (65 years old) Butler of Kosaka
She unfortunately passed away last month.
I used to work in Paris as a pastry chef,
but I went back to Japan to sort out her things.
I found this old sketch,
which must be from my great-grandfather.
It is torn in the center, but...
"Memories."
It is indeed the Egg of Remembrance!
But this one is adorned with jewels.
Maybe they were originally there,
but someone stole them?
Hey...
Maybe there were two eggs.
Well, yes...
Look, the lines of the egg
are not the same on both pieces.
Maybe it was a big leaf with two eggs,
and the middle part is gone!
That makes sense.
However,
what does this have to do with the memory?
Is that a mirror there?
Damn, it fell down!
What are you doing?
I wanted to see the mirror, and it fell off.
What is it?
Conan!
Ah, don't worry.
It comes off easily.
I think it was added later.
What's that?
We see something...
Oh, isn't that...
Mr. Nishino, turn off the light!
Uh, okay.
But you think you can do anything?
Can we see an image?
It's a magic mirror.
A what?
I've heard of it.
They were found in China and Japan, where mirrors were sacred.
That's right.
These mirrors are quite special.
In ancient Japan, Christians would use them to pray in secret
by reflecting a cross against the wall.
Mr. Sawabe, is this the castle?
Yes.
This is Yokosuka Castle.
Yokosuka Castle,
is it the one you often see in pubs?
Yes.
My great-grandfather had it built,
and my grandmother maintained it.
I didn't know this castle belonged to your family.
Tell me, Mrs. Natsumi,
what if it was your great-grandfather who made these two eggs?
Let's say that after the Russian Revolution, your great-grandfather
returned to Japan with his wife and the two eggs he had made.
It is possible that
that he sold some of the jewels encrusted on the second egg
to build the castle,
and that he hid the first egg in it!
And he would have left a clue to its location
inside the second egg, in the form of a magic mirror.
Since we're on the subject,
with the sketches,
I found this old key. Do you think there is a connection?
Yes, there is no doubt that this is the key that will lead us
to the other egg!
Another egg, with jewels?
If it really exists, it could be worth 100 million...
No, probably more than 150 million yen!
That would explain why Kid wants it...
No.
Mr. Mouri, once you're back in Tokyo,
would you agree to accompany me to the castle?
Of course I would.
I'd like to come too, if possible.
And me too !
Please do!
- I would love to film it. - Can I come too?
Of course, you're all invited.
Well, well, well.
They seem to be very interested!
The first egg is not enough for them anymore?
There, very soft.
Well, he's not bleeding anymore.
If his wounds close up, he'll be able to fly again.
Is that right? That's great!
Hattori got off with a minor sprain, too,
but Kid may be dead...
No, it takes more than that to kill him.
If that's the case,
he's already on board...
I'll be right there!
I like your expression!
It's in the pocket.
He's a bad guy.
Hi, Ran!
Is this a bad time?
Ah, you brought Ms. Natsumi and Mr. Nishino!
Please come in.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.
Uh, sorry, I changed my mind!
Huh?
I got it! He's embarrassed in front of all these beauties.
It's so sweet.
I forgot the other beauty!
I'll invite her.
Mrs. Seiran? I'll do it.
- Come on, kitty! - Why do I have to come?
I'd love to, thank you.
Just let me get ready for a moment.
"Grigori"?
Oh, is that a picture of your boyfriend?
Uh... Yes.
You're all lucky.

I should have persevered to get Kid in my pocket.
If it were that easy, the police wouldn't have such a hard time.
Say, Ms. Natsumi,
you've been living in Paris since you were 20?
Yes.
So I sometimes lose my Japanese.
Speaking of which,
there's a sentence that has always puzzled me since childhood.
Is it? What is it?
Barushe nikukattabeka.
What is it?
I think it means, "Did Barshe buy meat?"
But I don't know anyone by that name.
Oh, your pupils, they're...
They're gray, yeah.
My mother's and my grandmother's too.
We probably get that from my great-grandmother.
Oh, but Mrs. Seiran has gray eyes too.
Oh yes, she does!
Do Chinese people also have gray eyes?
If not...
Does your name, Mrs. Seiran, mean "blue orchid"?
My name also means orchid.
"Seiran" is the Japanese reading,
My real name is Qin Lan.
"Chin Ran"?
The character sei is read chin, and ran does not change.
And hoshi is read pu-su, so my name is Qin Lan Pusu.
So Ran is pronounced the same in Chinese!
Yes, it does.
And Mouri is read Maoli.
So in Chinese, I'm Ran Maoli.
I like it, it's cute.
What about me?
Sonoko Suzuki would be...
Yuanzi Lingmu.
Yuanzi... Lingmu...
I was wondering, Mrs. Seiran,
we're about the same age, right?
Surely. I'm 27.
I knew it! What month are you from?
I was born on May 5.
What?
I was born on May 3, just two days apart!
And I'm right between you two!
Between the two of you, so the 4th of May?
It's Shinichi's birthday!
Is it just a coincidence?
Or maybe...
Or maybe Conan is really...
Don't be silly, Ran.
How could that be?
It's because I keep thinking about him.
I'm just...
really stupid.
If it isn't Ms. Natsumi and Seiran!
Will you join us?
- You don't mind? - Of course not!
Your outfit is nice, it's colorful!
We won't do it again...
Come on, drink up.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Sagawa, your pendant...
It's true that you study the Romanovs.
Did you recognize it?
Here you are.
What's this? He wasn't wearing it before, was he?
"Maria"...
Is this the ring
the ring of Maria, the daughter of Emperor Nicholas II?
You tell me, you are the expert.
Where did you get it?
Was it the real ring?
I don't know, sir.
We should have it examined.
Careful, Nishino, your pen will fall out.
Thank you.
Mr. Mouri! Are you home?
Is it dinner time?
It's terrible! Mr. Sagawa...
- He's dead in his room! - What is it?
Mr Sagawa...
He was shot in the right eye.
It was the same with Kid!
Go away! It's not for kids!
How's it going?
His cheeks are just starting to get stiff.
He can't have been dead more than 30 minutes.
The ring around his neck is gone!
Mr. Suzuki!
This is a murder.
Call the police!
Yes, I understand.
Okay, we're coming.
Inspector Megure?
Shiratori!
I thought you were on leave in Karuizawa?
Ninzaburo Shiratori Deputy Inspector
I was a little bored there.
What's up?
You're just in time, we'll need your help.
We've been waiting for you, Inspector!
Can you tell me why everywhere you go, there is a crime?
Who knows, maybe it's God's will...
Unless you yourself are a god.
A god of death.
He's tough on you, Detective Shiratori.
Are you hurt?
Oh, yes...
I fought a criminal yesterday.
The victim is Ryu Sagawa, 32.
A freelance videographer...
Detective!
The culprit killed him to steal a ring!
A ring?
Yes !
He had the ring of the daughter of Emperor Nicholas II
on a pendant around his neck which was stolen from him!
If you just wanted to steal that, you could have just ripped it off his neck.
But look at the state of the cabin.
Even the cushions have been ripped open!
But he gets on my nerves, snooping around all the time!
Inspector, I found this on the floor.
A ballpoint pen?
"Mr. Nishino"?

Mr. Nishino, can you confirm
that this is your pen?
Uh, yes.
But how did it get there?
It was you who found the body, wasn't it?
Yes, it was me.
I went to tell him that dinner was ready.
And you went into his cabin?
No.
If you didn't go inside,
how could your pen have fallen in there?
I don't know.
Well, what were you doing around 7:30?
Uh, I took a shower in my cabin around 7:10,
and then I rested for a while.
Dad, do you think Mr. Nishino could have...
No, that's inconceivable!
If it was Nishino who killed Sagawa,
then it's very likely he shot Kid too.
Inspector Megure!
I searched the victim's room,
...and all his videotapes are gone.
- How did you do that? - I see!
That explains the mess in his cabin.
Hey there, Conan! Don't wander off by yourself!
I'll take care of it.
Ran, whoever did this might be hanging around here somewhere.
Go back with the others.
But Conan is...
I'll get him back, don't worry.
Come on, I'll bring him back.
Well, but...
Just trust me.
Professor? Hey, it's me.
Can you check something for me?
A sniper aimed at the right eye, you say?
All right, I'll look into it.
Call me back in ten minutes.
Let's see, let's see...
In ten minutes...
Was it my imagination?
I found it, Shinichi!
Searching the Interpol database,
I found a criminal of unknown age and sex.
His name is...
Scorpion!
Scorpion?
I found it, inspector! Under Mr. Nishino's bed!
No, that's impossible!
It's irrefutable evidence.
Wait, detective! I'm innocent!
If you didn't do it..,
then where did you get that ring?
I'm as confused as you are!
The culprit is Scorpio, I'm pretty sure.
Does that mean Mr. Nishino is Scorpio?
What's this?
A rice ball cushion?
Conan!
Hey, Mr. Nishino, are you allergic to feathers?
Yes, why?
Then he can't be the culprit!
What's wrong with him?
Well, what about him? Let's hear it.
Because Mr. Sagawa's cabin was full of feathers!
The killer ripped out his feather pillow.
Someone with allergies wouldn't have done that.
Are you really allergic?
It's true, I can testify to that.
All it takes is one little feather
and he starts sneezing.
That's why he has a pillow stuffed with rice husks.
Ah, but yes!
That's why you came out of Ran's room,
because of the dove!
But if not him, then who?
Do you know Scorpion, Inspector?
Scorpion?
He's been stealing Romanov treasures from all over the world,
and he kills his enemies with a shot to the right eye.
He's a bad guy!
Yes, I remember him. He's wanted internationally.
Wait, what?
You think he's the killer?
I think he is.
And I think he shot the Kid, too.
What are you saying?
Kid's monocle was broken, right?
Scorpio shot him
trying to take the egg away from him.
How do you know Scorpion?
Ah, well, actually...
Professor Agasa told him about it.
Right, Conan?
Well, yes...
Oh, dear.
The presence I felt when I was on the phone,
was it Officer Shiratori?
The prediction was about a secret!
You think Shiratori found me out?
Let's say Scorpio is the killer,
why would he hide the ring in Mr. Nishino's room?
I have no idea.
It's not looking good.
I can't use my projectile watch in front of Shiratori.
Well, never mind.
Say, Mr. Nishino, you knew Mr. Sagawa, didn't you?
Yesterday at the museum he was very surprised to see you!
Was he?
You have traveled a lot abroad, haven't you?
You must have met him during a trip!
What's up? Is he right?
Yes.
It was three years ago, during a trip to Asia.
He was filming a girl who had just lost her home in the civil war.

When he refused to stop, I snapped and hit him.
So, Mr. Sagawa must have been angry with you for that.
Everything is clear now! Mr. Nishino,
you are Scorpio!
Are you serious?
Come on, Mouri, we just deduced that you're not!
Oh yes, that's right.
In any case, you were lucky.
If Mr Sagawa hadn't been killed by Scorpio,
he would have accused you of stealing his ring.
Wait a minute...
I know!
Just like there were two eggs,
we have two separate cases here!
Two cases?
Yes, here it is.
The first case..,
is Mr Sagawa trying to charge Mr Nishino with theft.
He planned to make it look like he stole his ring,
and he showed it to everyone beforehand.
Then he went into his cabin while he was in the shower,
and hid his ring under his bed.
And finally, he took his ballpoint pen.
All of this was done in order to frame him for the theft.
But he didn't have the time,
because that's when the second case happened:
his murder
by a bullet fired by Scorpio.
Scorpion probably killed him
to take the ring and a video revealing his identity.
But not finding the ring around his neck,
Scorpion searched his cabin from top to bottom.
You're too good, uncle!
Nice deduction!
It's a piece of cake for me.
But that would mean
that Scorpius is still on board.
Well, actually...
A lifeboat is missing.
What?
So Scorpion ran off with it?
I've sent a team to look for it,
but in my opinion, it's no use.
He's slipped through our fingers...
Did Scorpio really escape?
Personally, I'm comforted by the fact that this criminal
is no longer on board, aren't you?
Yes, I do.
But if Scorpion wants the other egg,
he'll probably come to Kosaka Castle.
What?
He may even be on his way there now.
Inspector Megure.
Tomorrow, as soon as I get to Tokyo,
I'd like to go to the castle with Ms. Natsumi.
Good, you have my consent.
Hey, do you understand?
This time you're not coming with us.
Yes, let's take him with us.
What's the matter?
He has a unique way of thinking, it might help us.
Who, him?
Yes.
Tokyo - August 24
He's getting on my nerves, Conan!
Me too.
He hasn't called us once since he left!
He forgets that we're all Junior Detectives!
Professor.
You still haven't found your license?
I was sure I left it here...
Hurry up, or Edogawa will get here before us.
You're really good at finding things, Ai.
Come on, one more problem on your hands.
What's that?
Mr. Mouri,
do you think Mr Sagawa's ring was really Maria's?
Go figure.
I gave it to Detective Megure,
he said he would have it examined.
They say that Maria was the nicest of the four sisters,
and that she had big, beautiful gray eyes.
Grey eyes?
The same color as Ms. Natsumi and Ms. Seiran.
You probably know that the entire imperial family was executed
at the end of the Russian revolution,
but we could never confirm the death of the emperor or Maria.
Oh well...
Yokosuka
What a beautiful castle!
It looks like the castle of Neuschwanstein, in Germany.
The famous castle that would have inspired Cinderella's one.
What's that?
But why a German-style castle?
Mrs. Natsumi's great-grandmother was Russian, though.
Yo, Conan!
Conan!
How are you doing?
What are you doing here, Professor?
Conan told me everything on the phone,
and it made me want to come.
Here, I made them better like you asked.
Thank you, Professor.
But why did you bring the kids?
They went upstairs while my back was turned.
It's like a fairy tale!
They say there's a hidden treasure.
How much is it worth, in a bowl of eels?
Listen carefully, children!
It's forbidden to go inside!
- Yes! - We know!
Let's see, they are very conciliatory!

Mister Inui is late.
Yes... He said he had to go somewhere first.
Sorry I'm late, it took me a while to get ready.
What's this big bag?
We're not going on an expedition!
Oh, you know... Better safe than sorry.
Stay on your toes.
Scorpio may be closer than we think.
Yes, I know.
Ah, lock up, please.
To keep the kids out.
All right, let's do it.
Well, let's get to it!
What do you mean, let's play?
We'll find the treasure before they do!
There must be another way in, let's find it!
Hey, wait!
This is the hall of knights.
Armor and western tapestries are on display.
Hall of the knights
Room of the damsels.
This is the ladies' room.
Madame spent most of her days here.
This is where she was most at ease.
Room of the tsars
And here is the room of the tsars.
Tell me about it, I have an urge.
The bathroom is on the right at the end of the hall.
I knew it.
No egg in sight, but it will do!
What's going on here?
This is the anti-theft system
designed by Mr. Kiichi 80 years ago.
There are other traps like this all over the castle.
Please be careful.
In other words, don't try to get ahead of us, Mr. Inui.
You don't need more than this flashlight.
That Mr. Kiichi must have really liked mechanisms.
So...
Say, is there a basement here?
No, why?
Did great-grandfather have his own rooms on the first floor?
Yes, the butlers' room.
Come in, please.
Here you can see photos of Mr. Kiichi...
and a film showing him during his daily routine.
Ms. Natsumi, where are the photos of your great-grandmother?
Unfortunately, we don't have any.
I never knew what she looked like.
That's strange.
There are still lots of pictures of Mr. Kiichi.
Hey!
Is this man Rasputin or am I dreaming?
Indeed, it's him.
He even signed his name, "F. Rasputin."
"F. Rasputin"?
Who is this Rasputin, Dad?
Uh, I just know he was the biggest scoundrel of his century.
They called him Rasputin "the mad monk".
He got close to the emperor
and caused the fall of the Romanov house.
He enjoyed a certain power for a while,
but in the end he was close to the emperor,
Prince Yusupov, who killed him.
When they fished out his corpse,
his skull was broken, and one of his eyes
crushed by a bullet.
One of his eyes?
Mr. Inui,
concentrate on the egg instead of talking about Rasputin.
That's easy to say.
It's so big here that I don't know where to start.
Uncle, I'm borrowing it!
No but oh!
There's a draft.
There's a hidden room down there!
What?
Let's see...
Mr. Kiichi loved mechanisms,
so there should be a switch somewhere.
What's this thing?
It's in Russian alphabet.
So, can you access the hidden room with this?
I think there's a password.
Mr. Sergei, can you type it in Russian?
Yes, I can.
This is the "memory", vospominánie, I'm sure!
vospominánie...
Or not?
Try Kiichi Kosaka!
Kiichi Kosaka...
Nothing happens.
Ms. Natsumi,
do you have any idea what it could be?
No, not a clue.
Barushe nikukattabeka.
That phrase you were talking about,
maybe it's Russian.
Hey, what's he talking about?
Shh, let them talk!
Say again, Ms. Natsumi? Barushe...
Nikukattabeka.
Barushe nikukattabeka?
Maybe cut the syllables differently?
Barusheni kukatta beka...
Barusheni
It would not be
volshebnik consta veka?
But yes!
That's it! Volshebnik consta veka!
What does it mean?
In English it means: The last wizard of the century.
Which translates into...
"The last wizard of the century."
The last wizard of the century?
I've heard that somewhere before.
In Kid's card.
Oh, yeah.
That's quite a coincidence.

A coincidence?
Is it really a coincidence?
Well, I try to enter this.
Volshebnik consta veka.
What's that noise?
What?
I don't believe it!
Good job, kid!
No, it's locked here too.
No way!
They'll find the treasure before we do!
Wait, Ai!
Where are you going?
I'm just going to see that tower.
Haibara!
Is there anything there?
- Maybe it's the treasure! - I hope so!
It's open.
Isn't it?
There's nothing here, Haibara.
I never said there was.
Hey!
That's enough now, come back!
What's the matter?
Mercy!
You hurt me !
Your belly was very soft.
Thanks to you, we have nothing.
What is this thing ?
A snake!
It's not a snake.
It's just a rope ladder.
It looks old.
It must have been tied off, then someone cut it off.
Well, thanks, I was scared to death.
What do we do now?
Do we wait here for the teacher to help us?
Or do we move on?
- Well... - It goes without saying.
Let's go !
I have a question, Ms. Natsumi.
Yes ?
Why did he put that phrase as his password?
I think it was my great-grandfather's nickname.
When he was 16, during an exhibition in Paris in 1900,
he exhibited his mechanical dolls,
and then went straight to Russia.
Right...
The year 1900 is indeed the end of a century.
Is it still going on?
We can't see the end of it...
What's the matter?
I heard a noise.
Could it be Scorpio?
I'm going to check it out!
Conan!
I'll go and see.
Stay here with them, Mr. Mouri.
Understood.
You?
Ah! It's you!
Conan!
Seriously...
But who in this world will succeed
to get your love?
These kids do as they please!
Leave them alone, Mr. Mouri.
The more the merrier.
But still...
You make me melt!
You were still...
Oh?
A dead end.
Did we take the wrong road?
It's very unlikely.
There was only one way.
There must be another mechanism here.
There are lots of birds!
What's this?
It's weird that big bird, it's the only one with two heads.
The eagle with two heads.
It's the imperial coat of arms.
Yes.
Is it a sun, behind the crown?
The sun...
Light?
Maybe it's...
Mr. Shiratori, can you narrow your beam and illuminate
the area behind the two-headed eagle?
Uh, okay.
It's glowing!
What's shining?
Watch out, get back!
A secret passage?
I see...
So this crown is a light meter?
So cool!
What an invention, my word!
It's like being in an egg.
What is this thing?
It's a coffin.
It is of Western design,
but made of paulownia wood.
And it's got a hell of a lock!
Ms. Natsumi, your key!
Oh, yes!
It's the right key.
So inside this coffin...
Can I open it?
Yes.
It weighs a ton!
A skeleton...
And he has the egg with him.
As if he's holding it against him in his sleep.
Do you think it's your great-grandfather?
No, in my opinion,
it's my great-grandmother.
My great-grandfather is buried in Yokosuka,
I thought it was strange that he was the only one.
Maybe
because she was Russian,
they didn't let her be buried in the family grave.
Ms. Natsumi.
This may not be the best time,
but would you mind letting us see the egg?
Yes, of course.
Here you are.
There's a small hole underneath.
Is it empty?
That's impossible!
What does that mean?
Empty?
Is it a matryoshka?
A matryoshka?
We have one like that at home.
A friend of my father brought it back from Russia as a souvenir.
What is this matrio what's-his-name?
A Russian doll.
When you open it, there are other smaller ones inside.
Maybe there are.
Take a look.
There are grooves in it, like to hold
a second egg in place.

Damn it!
We would have needed the other egg to try!
Oh, but we have it.
I thought we might need it, so...
I borrowed it from Mr. Suzuki.
Say...
You didn't take it without his permission, I hope!
Of course not, of course not!
No more talking, let's try it.
Exactly!
In fact, Mr. Kiichi
didn't make two separate eggs,
but rather two eggs in one!
You don't look satisfied.
No...
I have a feeling that this egg is still hiding a secret.
A mechanism more worthy of the last magician of the century.
Anyway, these diamonds are sublime.
No, I don't think they are diamonds.
It's just glass, right?
Glass?
Wait a minute, wait a minute...
Remember.
The bottom of the other glass egg...
Mr. Kiichi's room...
A photometer...
And... this pedestal!
No doubt about it.
The glass of the egg must be a lens!
Mr. Sergei!
Can I see the egg?
You're not going to start that again!
Come on, wait, Mr. Mouri.
Do you need any help?
Yes, with the light.
Set the beam to minimum and put her in.
Okay, Mr. Sergei.
Mr. Sergei, Mrs. Seiran!
Put out the candles!
What are you trying to do?
Look, you'll see.
You can see inside!
The mechanism is not working,
but the figures of the family go up!
The inside of the egg is also a light meter.
But what is...
What is what?
These are pictures of Nicholas II's family.
I see...
The figure in the egg was not reading a simple book...
But a photo album.
So that's why it's called the Egg of Remembrance.
If the tsar had not been murdered
and he had received this egg...
He would have thought that there is no better gift!
He deserved to be called the last magician of the century,
your great-grandfather.
I'm sure he'd love to hear you say that.
Ms. Natsumi?
In this picture,
isn't that your great-grandfather?
There, in the picture with two people on a bench.
Oh, but it is.
Then that must be my great-grandmother with him!
So that's her!
I finally see her face.
This is the only photo taken in Japan.
Mr. Kiichi must have added it afterwards.
Oh? This person...
She looks like
Ms. Natsumi.
This egg is a real cultural treasure
for Mr. Kiichi... no, for all of Japan.
Russia renounces its rights to the egg and its contents.
It belongs to you.
Thank you very much.
But the egg inside belongs to Mr. Suzuki.
I will explain the situation to him and convince him.
I'm sure he will agree.
Now that I think about it, where is Mr. Inui?
No photo of Rasputin...
There wasn't any.
But he was close to the tsar.
Ah yes...
It's true that in Mr. Kiichi's room...
The letter "ford", don't tell me that...
Anyway, everything ends well!
Here it is!
Well, it's time...
Attention!
What are you doing, Conan?
Don't touch it, Ran!
Ran!
Shinichi?
Get down!
The egg!
I won't let you get away!
Come back!
Mr. Mouri, take care of the others!
Yes !
Shinichi?
Mr. Inui!
Damn it!
Damn it!
There must be a switch to open it from the inside!
This brick is different!
Stop!
If you think you can get away without us,
you're barking up the wrong tree!
We know who you are.
You pretended to come from China,
but in truth, you are Russian!
Aren't you?
You're the descendant of Rasputin the mad monk,
Seiran.
What the hell is this?
The way is blocked!
What, we're blocked here?
Follow me, all of you!
What's that?
I told you to come, don't argue!
Uh... Yes...
It took me a while to realize it.
That voice... Sagawa?
Rearranging the syllables,
your Chinese name, Qin Lan Pusu,
becomes Rasputin!
No, you're dead...
I killed you, I'm sure!
The treasures of the Romanov house
were supposed to go to Rasputin,

because he was close to the imperial family.
At least that's what you think,
and you decided to get them instead of your ancestor.
You go so far as to aim at the right eye,
as if to express your resentment at having been murdered.
Inui?
There's only me here.
What's that?
This is a voice modulator bow tie.
It allows me to imitate all voices.
But who are you?
Conan Edogawa,
detective.
You killed Mr. Sagawa
because he might have revealed your identity.
He went from room to room,
filming everyone.
And you forgot to return your photo frame.
This picture..,
it wasn't your boyfriend.
It was a picture of Grigori Rasputin.
The initial of his first name is a G,
but in Russian, it's the letter "ford."
So I didn't immediately make the connection with the photo
signed "F. Rasputin".
Thinking that Mr. Sagawa had filmed the photo by mistake,
you killed him.
Isn't that right, Mrs. Seiran?
Or should I say... Scorpio?
You're a smart boy.
And I suppose you killed Mr. Inui
because he saw you put the silencer on your gun?
Now you're just blowing my mind.
You look like you've seen it all.
As for killing uncle,
it was because he spoke ill of Rasputin.
Who is this Rasputin, Dad?
Uh, I just know that he was the biggest scoundrel of his century.
And that wasn't enough for you, you wanted to kill Ran too.
We're done talking now.
It's sad, but you're going to give me the pleasure of dying.
That's a Walther PPK/S, isn't it?
It has a magazine capacity of eight bullets.
One bullet for Mr. Inui, one for uncle, one for Ran,
plus the five fired here...
You don't have any left.
I'll teach you one thing.
If in advance...
you load one bullet before adding an eight-round magazine,
you get nine.
That means
I still have one more bullet left!
So shoot.
Go ahead, if you really have one bullet left.
Stupid idiot.
What's that?
Bad luck, Scorpio.
I had the professor change
the lenses on my bulletproof glasses.
Conan! Are you alright?
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
Come on, let's get out of here!
Conan!
We're saved.
Oh, no! The castle's on fire!
Conan!
Shinichi...
What an idiot...
Conan!
What's wrong?! You're breaking my ears...
Conan!
Mr. Shiratori took the egg back from Scorpio, you know!
What, really?
Where's Scorpion?
He's arrested her and he's driving her to the station.
Scorpion, or rather Mrs. Seiran.
What?
Mrs. Seiran was Scorpio?
Here, he said to give it to you.
Thank you, sir.
Was it really Scorpio? She had such beautiful legs...
Ms. Natsumi,
I'm so sorry, it's terrible...
Don't be, the castle burned down,
but I still have the treasure made by my great-grandfather.
And besides,
I don't think the basement will burn down.
It will.
When the fire is out, we can bury
your great-grandmother with Mr. Kiichi.
But in the end, Kaito Kid didn't show up.
Maybe he is really dead.
No, he's alive and well.
Uncle fell asleep.
He must have been tired.
Yes,
it's normal.
With all that's happened...
Ran?
Thanks, by the way.
You saved me at the castle.
You were really good.
You were like Shinichi!
You...
really look like him.
Ran...
But then again..,
You're not him, are you?
Aren't you?
Conan...
The time has come...
Actually, Ran...
The truth is, I...
I'm...
Shinichi?
Is that you, Shinichi?
What, you don't recognize me?
I came to see how you are, after hearing about the case.
It is of the delirium!
Fool!
Where have you been? I had no news!
Sorry, I was really busy.
I have to go back already...
Wait, I'll bring you some dry clothes!
Wait a minute, Kaito Kid.
You got me!
I didn't know for a second that it was you dressed up as Shiratori.
Oh, Shiratori!

I congratulate you!
Thank you, but why?
I just got back from my leave in Karuizawa.
What's that?
You guessed it, right?
That something would happen on the boat.
I wasn't 100% sure.
But I tapped the boat's lines just in case.
One more thing...
You tried to steal the egg
to return it to its rightful owner, Ms. Natsumi.
You knew it was made by Kiichi Kosaka
and that he called himself the last magician of the century.
Hence the reference, in your warning card.
Well...
Is there anything else you've guessed?
You mean the fact that Ms. Natsumi's great-grandmother
of Ms. Natsumi was Maria, the third daughter of Tsar Nicholas II?
Maria's body was not found,
because before their execution,
Mr. Kiichi saved her by taking her to Japan.
They fell in love
and had a daughter.
Unfortunately, Maria died soon after.
Mr. Kiichi,
to prevent Russian revolutionaries from taking her body,
sold Maria's jewels to build a castle.
But he didn't build a Russian castle,
but a German style castle,
because Maria's mother,
the tsarina Alexandra, was German.
Afterwards,
he hid Maria's body with the egg in a secret room.
As for the other egg,
it would serve as a clue.
He hoped that one of his descendants would find it.
Well, that's just a guess, but it would explain everything.
Let me give you some advice.
Sometimes it's better to keep things secret.
It sure is,
it's probably best to keep it all a mystery.
I've got another mystery for you, great detective.
Why I took on the appearance of Shinichi Kudo,
and why did I save you, when you are my enemy?
Shinichi!
Idiot.
It's not a mystery at all.
You saved me...
as a thank you for taking care of him,
am I right?
This night is so quiet
That my ears are ringing
Yet neither I, nor you, nor anyone
Is asleep, I know it
Words are definitely precious
If I could tell you how I feel
I'd like to hear your voice again and again
I want to see you again someday, somewhere
As if I could forget you!
You are the only one for me
Behind the door
A future lies dormant
Waiting impatiently
For me to make the first move
I only remember the pleasant moments
But it's not so bad sometimes
To allow yourself to cry
The days we spent together
Have made us stronger
Let's be proud of it!
We've got to meet again sometime, somewhere
As if I could forget you!
Baby you're the only one for me
And a new sun is rising
Why didn't you stop him, Conan?
But, uh,
Shinichi said he'd come back!
All right, fine.
Next time I see him...
That's what he'll get!
I'll have to stay a child for a long time, I guess...
